          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 05:04:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced plans for a "Golden Dome" missile defense system designed to counter advanced aerial threats to the United States, including hypersonic weapons and fractional orbital bombardment systems. The system, inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, will integrate next-generation technologies across land, sea, and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. Canada has expressed interest in participating in the project, which Trump claims will be operational by the end of his time in office. The initial investment is projected at $25 billion, with potential total costs reaching $175 billion, though the Congressional Budget Office estimates the space-based parts alone could cost up to $542 billion over 20 years.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 05:02:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that camping should require their permission. The judgement centers on the interpretation of a Dartmoor by-law granting the public access to commons for "open-air recreation." The court determined that this encompasses camping, affirming the public's right to camp on Dartmoor without needing explicit landowner consent. This decision is likely to reignite discussions regarding public access to land in England, particularly in areas with significant natural beauty and recreational value.</p>

          <p>NHS England will launch a world-first gonorrhoea vaccination program starting in August, primarily targeting gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners or STIs. The vaccine, originally designed for meningitis B, has shown 30-40% effectiveness against gonorrhoea, which has seen a surge in cases. This initiative aims to reduce the rising rates of infection and combat antibiotic-resistant strains of the bacteria. The program is projected to prevent 100,000 cases and save the NHS nearly Â£8 million over the next decade, with Public Health Scotland and Northern Ireland also considering similar programs.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo reveals that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider tax increases before this year's Spring Statement. The memo proposed raising taxes by Â£3 billion to Â£4 billion annually through various measures, though the chancellor did not implement these suggestions. This revelation highlights internal debates within the Labour party regarding fiscal policy, with some advocating for wealth taxes or relaxed borrowing rules to avert cuts to certain departments.

He argued that these regulations provided Chinese companies with the spirit, energy, and government support to accelerate their development. Despite this, Huang vowed that Nvidia would continue to sell AI chips in China, while Washingtonâ€™s controls on chip exports have made it increasingly difficult for Nvidia to do business in China.</p>

          <p>Leading financial officials from the world's richest countries are meeting in Canada amid tensions stemming from President Trump's sweeping tariffs. The G7 finance ministers will likely have contentious discussions, as Trump's tariffs threaten economic growth in many member nations. The meeting marks the first formal G7 event for U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is viewed as a moderating influence on tariffs. Key topics will include global trade imbalances, the status of the U.S. dollar, and potential new sanctions on Russian oil, testing the G7's unity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is increasingly involving America's business leaders to bolster his image both domestically and internationally. Corporate titans are dedicating more time to cultivate favor with the administration, aiming to secure regulatory relief and tariff exemptions. Trump, in turn, leverages their presence to project an image of a booming economy, despite indicators of slowing growth. While these engagements offer companies exposure and potential benefits, they do not fully insulate them from Trump's anger or policy decisions, as demonstrated by his interactions with companies like Apple, Amazon, and Walmart.</p>

Existing antivenoms, derived from animals injected with small amounts of venom, are specific to certain snake types, making a universal treatment highly valuable.</p>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope, has raised questions about potential clashes with the Maga movement, particularly among Catholic figures within its ranks. Pope Leo XIV's emphasis on addressing global issues like climate change, inequality, and migration contrasts with the nationalist and insular views often associated with Maga ideology. Drawing inspiration from Leo XIII, the new pope is expected to challenge the right-wing populist turn, advocating for a Catholic commitment to universality and compassion for the stranger, which may create tension with Catholic Maga leaders.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo metropolitan government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer, aiming to encourage residents to use air conditioning without financial constraints during extreme heat. A supplementary budget of 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) will cover the costs, benefiting approximately 8.2 million households. The initiative responds to concerns about declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer, with the goal of protecting residents' lives and daily living. Metered water usage will still be charged, but the base fee waiver is expected to save households around 5,000 yen over the four months.</p>

She aims to drive a cultural shift toward safer kitchen environments, drawing parallels to past public behavior changes like the ban on indoor smoking.
