        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank has kept its key lending rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, a decision that was widely anticipated by economists. The one-year loan prime rate remains at 3.0%, while the five-year rate, which affects mortgages, stays at 3.5%. This move comes despite a recent interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and amid a backdrop of slowing economic data in China, including weaker retail sales and industrial output. Analysts suggest Chinese policymakers may introduce modest monetary easing later this year to help meet the government's annual growth target of around 5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent observations of China's GJ-11 'Sharp Sword' unmanned aerial vehicle suggest it is being modified for deployment on aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships. Visible folding hinges on the drone's wings, a new feature not seen at its 2019 debut, indicate a naval variant is in development. This adaptation, combined with imagery on the emblem of a new Type 076 amphibious ship, points to the possibility that the GJ-11 could become the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone. The development underscores China's advancements in intelligent warfare and naval aviation capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk were seen shaking hands and chatting at the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, signaling a potential reconciliation after a very public falling out. Musk, who once led a government efficiency initiative for Trump, had a spectacular feud with the president over a tax bill, leading to harsh exchanges on social media. Their meeting in Arizona, which Musk documented on his platform X with the caption "For Charlie," has sparked speculation about a renewed political alliance between the two influential figures.</p>

          <p>In a joint operation, the U.S. Navy destroyed a speedboat carrying an estimated 1,000 kilograms of cocaine approximately 80 nautical miles south of the Dominican Republic. Dominican authorities subsequently recovered 377 packages of the drug from the vessel. Officials described the action as the first joint operation of its kind against "narco terrorism" in the Caribbean. The mission is part of a broader U.S. naval deployment in the region aimed at combating drug trafficking, which has been criticized by some human rights groups and Venezuela.</p>

          <p>At a memorial service for her late husband, conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Erika Kirk delivered an emotional speech in which she forgave the 22-year-old man accused of his murder. She told the tens of thousands gathered that the answer to hate is love, a message rooted in her Christian faith. Her remarks about forgiveness and seeing a spiritual "revival" after the tragedy stood in stark contrast to the more combative political rhetoric from other speakers at the event, including President Trump and Vice President Vance. She vowed to continue her husband's work as the new CEO of Turning Point USA.</p>

          <p>Scientists are monitoring a large, persistent area of unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific, known as the "warm blob," which could have significant consequences for this winter's weather. This marine heat wave, the fourth-largest since 1982, has historically caused devastating effects on marine ecosystems and fisheries. Meteorologists are concerned the anomaly could induce a ridge of high pressure, shifting the jet stream and potentially plunging the Eastern United States into much colder, Arctic-like temperatures in the coming months.</p>

This analysis suggests Vance is methodically building his profile to become the heir apparent to Donald Trump, blending populist rhetoric with a focus on cultural and economic nationalism.</p>

          <p>British MP Zarah Sultana has stated she is "determined to reconcile and move forward" following a public dispute with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over the formation of a new left-wing political party. Sultana, who had previously accused Corbyn's camp of being a "sexist boys' club" and instructed defamation lawyers, has now dropped the legal action. The row emerged over the unauthorized launch of a membership system for the new party, but both sides now appear to be engaged in discussions to resolve their differences before a planned inaugural conference.</p>

          <p>In a series of social media posts, President Donald Trump directly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to aggressively investigate and prosecute his political adversaries, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump expressed frustration that "nothing is being done," a statement that was quickly condemned by Democrats as a dangerous step towards authoritarianism. The president's call for the Department of Justice to target his enemies tests the long-standing norm of the department's independence from direct political influence from the White House.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan is in the grip of a catastrophic hunger crisis, with a silent wave of mortality affecting its youngest citizens as international aid has sharply decreased. This article tells the story of one couple who has buried three young sons, all of whom died from malnutrition in the past two years. The UN warns that over three million children are in peril as food assistance programs, which previously staved off the worst of the hunger, are now running out of funds. The crisis is compounded by a severe drought and the Taliban government's restrictive policies.</p>

          <p>A leading Chinese analyst has suggested that Beijing could build a scientific laboratory at the Scarborough Shoal, a disputed territory in the South China Sea. The proposed facility would invite international experts to conduct research on coral reefs and fisheries. However, the Philippines, which also claims the shoal and considers it part of its exclusive economic zone, has condemned any such move as "illegitimate and unlawful." The suggestion highlights the ongoing tensions and strategic maneuvering over contested features in the region.</p>

The maker of Tylenol, Kenvue, has strongly refuted any causal link, stating that over a decade of scientific research does not support the claim. The company expressed deep concern that such an announcement could pose a health risk to expecting mothers with fevers who have few safe alternatives.</p>
