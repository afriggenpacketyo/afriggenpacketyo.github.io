          <p>Former Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey has been formally charged with five counts of sexual assault and one count of sexual assault involving three different women. The alleged offenses occurred between 2021 and 2022, with the investigation beginning after a report was made to police in February 2022. Partey, whose contract with Arsenal recently ended, is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in August. The 32-year-old footballer joined the Premier League club in 2020 and was a significant player for the team during his tenure.</p>

          <p>Iran has announced it will suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) following recent US and Israeli airstrikes on its nuclear facilities. This move raises questions about the future of international monitoring and whether Iran will remain in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The article provides a detailed history of Iran's nuclear program, from its US-backed origins in the 1950s to the post-revolution developments and the 2018 collapse of the JCPOA deal. Experts warn that the attacks may push Iran to pursue nuclear weapons for self-defense.</p>

          <p>Following a public dispute with President Trump over a major spending bill, Elon Musk has renewed his threat to create a new political party, tentatively named the "America Party." The article explores the significant legal, financial, and logistical challenges Musk would face, including navigating complex state-level ballot access laws and the high costs of litigation against established parties. Despite these hurdles, experts note that Musk's immense wealth could make a serious attempt possible, though building a national party would likely be a multi-year, multi-million dollar endeavor.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has criticized Germany's proposal to resume deporting individuals to Afghanistan, a practice halted since the Taliban's 2021 takeover. A UN spokesperson emphasized that ongoing human rights violations make it inappropriate to return people to the country, urging nations not to conduct forcible returns. The potential policy shift in Germany, championed by the conservative government, comes amid rising anti-immigrant sentiment. This development contrasts with Russia recently becoming the first country to formally recognize the Taliban government.</p>

          <p>A recently signed peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, aimed at ending conflict in the eastern DRC, is being met with significant doubt. Key rebel groups like the M23 have rejected the deal, and observers highlight major challenges regarding implementation, inclusivity, and accountability for past atrocities. While the US-brokered deal has economic motivations tied to the region's vast mineral wealth, critics, including Nobel laureate Denis Mukwege, warn it could legitimize the plundering of resources without ensuring genuine, lasting peace for the local communities.</p>

Researchers found that people perceived as cool tend to share six specific traits: they are seen as more extroverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open, and autonomous than those simply considered "good." The study distinguishes "coolness," which often involves pushing boundaries and sparking change, from "goodness," which is associated with traits like conscientiousness and agreeability.

          <p>A jury has heard that a widely filmed brawl at Manchester Airport last year, which involved two brothers assaulting three police officers, was preceded by an attack in a Starbucks cafe. Prosecutors allege that Mohammed Fahir Amaaz and Muhammad Amaad used a "high level of violence" against the officers who were responding to the initial incident where one of the brothers headbutted and punched another man. The events, captured on CCTV, show the brothers resisting arrest, leading to a physical altercation where one officer's nose was broken. The defendants claim they were acting in self-defense.</p>

          <p>In Springfield, Ohio, community volunteers are urgently working to help Haitian families secure U.S. passports for their American-born children. This effort comes as the Trump administration plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, which could lead to their deportation. Without passports, thousands of U.S. citizen children could become stateless or be separated from their parents, creating a potential humanitarian crisis. The situation is fraught with fear, as families and advocates worry about immigration raids and the legal complexities of ensuring family unity.</p>

          <h2>Some International LGBTQ+ Travelers Are Avoiding US Destinations Due to Political Climate</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of international LGBTQ+ travelers are reportedly choosing to spend their vacation budgets in countries other than the United States, citing the political climate and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and policies. Travel platforms have noted a significant decline in U.S. bookings from Canadian and European users, while advocacy groups have canceled participation in U.S.-based events. This trend reflects a form of "activist tourism," where travelers consciously avoid destinations they perceive as unwelcoming or unsafe, potentially impacting the U.S. economy, which benefits from the significant purchasing power of the global LGBTQ+ tourism market.</p>

          <p>Apple is experiencing a tale of two strategies, with the successful launch of its blockbuster movie "F1" highlighting its strength in long-term services, while its artificial intelligence development appears to be struggling. Despite being an early pioneer with Siri, Apple's AI has fallen behind competitors like Google and OpenAI, with a much-anticipated Siri overhaul reportedly delayed until 2026. This lag in a critical technology sector is causing concern on Wall Street, contrasting sharply with the company's proven ability to execute ambitious, multi-year projects in other areas like original content.</p>

          <p>The recent Summer Fancy Food Show in New York highlighted several emerging culinary trends that could soon appear on store shelves and restaurant menus. Key trends included new takes on pantry staples like olive oil and mustard, with infusions and artisanal methods elevating their flavor profiles. The "swicy" (sweet and spicy) trend continues to evolve, while chef-led brands are bringing restaurant-quality sauces and foods to home kitchens. Additionally, the show saw a more refined approach to plant-based foods and the appearance of beef tallow as a cooking fat.</p>

          <p>With a July 9 deadline looming for the U.S. to impose steep tariffs, European Union member states are reportedly divided on how to approach trade negotiations with the Trump administration. While some leaders, like Germany's Chancellor, seem willing to accept a baseline 10% tariff to avoid worse outcomes for key industries like auto manufacturing, others like France's President decry the pressure as "blackmail." The European Commission is attempting to maintain unity, but striking a deal that satisfies all 27 members while placating the U.S. is proving to be a significant diplomatic challenge.

          <p>Russia launched its most extensive drone and missile assault on Kyiv since the start of the war, a seven-hour barrage that injured at least 23 people and caused severe damage across the Ukrainian capital. The attack occurred on the same day as a phone call between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, a timing Ukrainian President Zelenskyy described as a deliberate signal of Moscow's intent to continue the war. President Trump expressed disappointment with the call, stating he made no progress with Putin on ending the conflict, as Russia escalates its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p>
