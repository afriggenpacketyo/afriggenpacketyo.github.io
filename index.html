          <p>President Trump's visit to Scotland is expected to serve as a platform for finalizing key aspects of a recent US-UK trade agreement. Unfinished business includes resolving a 25% tariff on British steel and aluminum and addressing a UK digital services tax that impacts American tech companies. While the foundational deal is in place, these negotiations are crucial for cementing the economic partnership. Analysts suggest these discussions could lead to positive announcements that strengthen bilateral relations ahead of a wider August 1 trade deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two men from the Dominican Republic, present in the U.S. illegally, have been federally charged in connection with the shooting of an off-duty Customs and Border Protection officer in Manhattan. One suspect faces a charge for possessing ammunition as an illegal alien, while the other is charged as an accessory after the fact. The incident has intensified the political debate surrounding sanctuary city policies, as authorities revealed one of the suspects had a lengthy criminal history and was previously released despite an active ICE detainer.</p>

          <p>In a UK first, the Welsh government is launching a new system to provide people with coeliac disease a pre-loaded debit card to purchase gluten-free food. This initiative offers an alternative to the current pharmacy-based prescription model, aiming to 'de-medicalise' the process and give individuals more choice and convenience. The move comes as reports indicate that a gluten-free diet can increase food bills by as much as 35%, and participants in a pilot program praised the greater flexibility it provides.</p>

          <p>President Trump is visiting Scotland to attend the opening of a new golf course at one of his resorts, a trip that critics note mixes personal business with official duties. While in the UK, he is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss trade, but the focus on his private enterprises during a time of international turmoil has drawn scrutiny. The article highlights the unusual nature of a sitting US president so publicly promoting their commercial interests while in office.</p>

          <p>The United States has cut short its participation in Gaza ceasefire talks in Qatar, with President Trump's special envoy stating that Hamas's latest response shows a lack of desire to reach a truce. The American negotiating team is returning home to consider 'alternative options' for securing the release of hostages and stabilizing the region. This development is a significant setback in the 21-month-long conflict, as Israel has also recalled its negotiators, stalling diplomatic efforts amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Princeton, Texas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the U.S., with its population more than doubling in just a few years due to an influx of residents seeking affordable housing near Dallas. This explosive growth has severely strained the city's infrastructure, forcing a temporary halt on new construction to allow for essential upgrades to sewer lines, water systems, and roads. The city, which now has 37,000 residents, is projected to reach 100,000 within five years.</p>

          <p>In a high-profile case that has been closely followed in Canada, five former players from the country's world junior hockey team have been acquitted of sexually assaulting a woman in 2018. The Ontario judge declared the men not guilty on all counts, stating that she did not find the accuser's testimony to be 'credible or reliable.' The central issue of the eight-week trial was whether the woman, who had consensual sex with one player, had consented to subsequent sexual acts with the others.</p>

          <p>The suicide prevention charity Samaritans has announced plans to close more than 100 of its 200 branches across the UK and Ireland over the next decade. The leadership aims to consolidate into fewer, larger regional hubs, arguing the current model is not sustainable.
