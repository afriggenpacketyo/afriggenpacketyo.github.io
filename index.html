The National Hurricane Center reported the Category 2 storm was moving north-northwest, with its center projected to pass west of Bermuda. Forecasters are also monitoring Tropical Storm Imelda, which is expected to become a hurricane and move toward Bermuda, prompting a hurricane watch for the island.</p>

          <p>The torture and murder of two women and a teenage girl, livestreamed on social media, has ignited widespread outrage and protests in Argentina. The bodies of the victims were discovered buried in a Buenos Aires suburb, with investigators linking the crime to drug gangs seeking retribution. Thousands marched in the capital demanding justice and an end to femicide, a persistent issue in the country where a woman is killed every 36 hours. Seven suspects have been arrested, but the alleged mastermind remains at large.</p>

          <p>This article traces the ascent of Rupert Murdoch, who transformed a single Australian newspaper inherited from his father into a global media empire that includes Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Post. Experts describe his ruthless business tactics, his formula of combining sensationalist tabloids with elite newspapers, and his profound influence on politics in the UK, Australia, and the US. The piece highlights how Murdoch's outlets have shaped political discourse, culminating in the powerful, and often controversial, position his company holds today.</p>

          <p>Germany's manufacturing-heavy economy, which prospered during the first 'China Shock' by supplying industrial machinery, is now facing a severe crisis. A new wave of competition from China is hitting Germany's core industries like automobiles and machinery, where Chinese firms have become formidable rivals, particularly in electric vehicles. This 'second China Shock,' compounded by high energy prices and U.S. tariffs, is causing a significant slump in exports and production, leading economists to warn of potential deindustrialization worse than what the U.S. previously experienced.

          <p>Hamas and other Palestinian factions are reportedly leaning toward accepting a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Gaza, with a formal response expected soon. The comprehensive proposal, presented by President Trump, includes an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and a significant increase in humanitarian aid. The plan also outlines a future for Gaza governed by an interim administration of Palestinian technocrats, with key Arab nations and the European Council expressing support for the initiative.</p>

          <p>A Greenpeace study reveals that EU companies have become major clients for Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG), contributing an estimated $9.5 billion to Russia's treasury in tax revenues between 2022 and 2024. While the EU has banned Russian oil and coal, LNG imports remain exempt from sanctions, with French, German, and Spanish companies being among the top buyers. The report highlights that this revenue could fund a significant portion of Russia's war effort, noting that key importers have spent more on Russian gas than they have provided in aid to Ukraine.

          <p>A Russian drone strike in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region killed a family of four, including two young children, according to Ukrainian officials. This comes as deadly attacks continue across the country and Russia reports intercepting dozens of Ukrainian drones over its own territory. Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that a reparation loan for Ukraine, funded by profits from frozen Russian assets, would partly be used to bolster the EU's defense industry.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. Congress facing a midnight deadline to pass a funding bill, a government shutdown appears increasingly likely. A shutdown occurs when lawmakers fail to approve a budget, forcing nonessential federal agencies to close and furloughing hundreds of thousands of employees without pay. While essential services like active-duty military, air traffic control, and Social Security payments continue, a prolonged shutdown can disrupt the economy, delay the release of important data, and undermine public confidence. The longest shutdown in U.S. history lasted 35 days in 2018-2019.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-backed proposal to end the Gaza war presents the most detailed plan yet, calling for an immediate hostage-prisoner exchange and a surge in humanitarian aid. A key point of contention is the future governance of Gaza, which would be overseen by a transitional body and potentially the Palestinian Authority, while Hamas would be required to decommission its weapons. While the plan has broad Arab support, its success hinges on Hamas's acceptance and the stability of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's government, which includes far-right partners opposed to key provisions.</p>

          <p>A Chinese woman, Zhimin Qian, has been convicted in a UK court for her role in a massive international fraud scheme after police seized 61,000 bitcoin, currently valued at over £5 billion. Between 2014 and 2017, she defrauded over 128,000 investors in China and laundered the proceeds through cryptocurrency before fleeing to the UK. The conviction is the result of a seven-year investigation into the global money laundering operation, highlighting the increasing use of crypto assets by organized criminals to hide illicit funds.</p>

          <p>A tragic building collapse at an Islamic boarding school in East Java, Indonesia, has killed at least three people and left dozens of students and workers trapped under the rubble. The two-story building, which was undergoing construction of additional floors, gave way while students had gathered for prayers. Rescue efforts are underway but have been complicated by the instability of the collapsed structure, as anxious families await news of their loved ones. Officials say the building's foundation was unable to support the added weight.</p>

          <p>As another government shutdown looms, Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, find themselves in the unfamiliar role of potentially forcing it. In a reversal of past dynamics, Democrats are withholding support for a government funding measure, demanding extensions for healthcare subsidies and other provisions. This strategy, previously used by Republicans, marks a significant tactical shift and could result in Democrats being blamed for a shutdown, though they argue it's necessary to counter the Trump administration's policies and push for their priorities.</p>
