The Trump administration had threatened to seek "emergency relief" from the Supreme Court if the tariff ruling was not quickly put on hold. The appeals court has given plaintiffs one week to respond to the administration's bid for a stay pending appeal.

          <p>A federal court has ruled that the tariffs imposed by President Trump are illegal, citing constitutional limits on Congress's ability to empower the president to impose tariffs. The US Court of International Trade's decision argues that Trump surpassed these limits and that the tariffs violate the separation of powers. The court's decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court, but if upheld, Trump would likely not be able to reimpose the tariffs. The court also concluded that the tariffs do not effectively address the threat of drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>The resumption of student loan payments is negatively impacting many borrowers' credit scores, with millions experiencing significant drops. Delinquent student loan borrowers saw their credit scores decrease substantially in the first quarter of 2025. A low credit score makes it harder and more expensive to secure future loans, potentially delaying milestones such as buying a home or saving for retirement. The end of the "on ramp" period has led to the reporting of missed payments to credit bureaus, further damaging borrowers' credit.</p>
