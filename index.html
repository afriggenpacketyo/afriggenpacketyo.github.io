          <p>William Bordsen, accused of murdering Robert Murphy, has been returned to jail after a judge revoked his $400,000 bond. The initial self-defense claim was discredited by toxicology reports showing the victim was not intoxicated, and cellphone video allegedly captured Bordsen taunting Murphy as he died. The victim's family expressed relief, attributing the bond reversal partly to increased scrutiny on the justice system from a separate high-profile case. They seek a conviction to ensure Bordsen remains incarcerated.</p>

This marks a rare public acknowledgment of these covert operations, which historically faced severe suppression by the Kuomintang (KMT) with many operatives captured and executed. The show, which premiered on Martyrs' Day, signifies a shift in Beijing's stance on these historical events, offering a narrative under state guidance.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that global energy investment is substantial, with clean technologies attracting double the funding of fossil fuels, yet a crisis of confidence persists due to political instability. It highlights how populist pressures are causing leaders to retract climate commitments, framing environmental action as incompatible with affordability and energy security. The author suggests that the primary threat to net-zero ambitions is the dismantling of policy frameworks, urging democracies to protect climate policy from political cycles.

          <p>Luigi Mangione's legal team has requested a New York judge dismiss certain federal charges, including the one carrying a potential death penalty, related to the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The lawyers argue Mangione was not read his rights before questioning and that his backpack, containing a gun and ammunition, was searched without a warrant. They also contend the "crimes of violence" charge, which allows for the death penalty, lacks a qualifying underlying offense, seeking to remove capital punishment from consideration.</p>

          <p>Sahil Majothi, a 22-year-old Indian student, has been captured by Ukrainian forces, becoming the first known Indian detained in the conflict. His mother claims he was falsely accused in a drug case in Russia and given a choice between joining the Russian army or imprisonment. Majothi alleges he received no pay and was sent to the battlefield after only 15 days of training. India's foreign ministry is investigating, and the incident highlights growing concerns about Indians being recruited into the Russian military, despite government advisories against it.</p>

          <h2>Changing Monsoon Patterns Turn Himalayan Autumn Climbing Season Deadly</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 18:17:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The traditionally clear autumn climbing season in the Himalayas has turned deadly due to extended monsoon patterns, leading to unexpected extreme weather events. Meteorologists report that monsoon now stretches into October, bringing "damaging precipitation" like the shock blizzard that stranded hundreds of trekkers near Mount Everest, resulting in one death. This shift poses significant risks for mountain tourism, with frequent storms hampering operations. Scientists attribute these changes to global warming increasing moisture in the air and earlier interactions with westerly disturbances, intensifying weather systems.</p>

          <p>Former investment banker and LAUSD superintendent Austin Beutner appears to be preparing a mayoral campaign against incumbent Karen Bass, with "AUSTIN for LA MAYOR" banners briefly appearing on his social media. Beutner, who previously explored a mayoral run, would be the most significant challenger to Bass, who faces criticism over the Palisades fire response and a city budget shortfall. His extensive background in finance, journalism, and local government, along with philanthropy, positions him as a formidable candidate for the 2026 election.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that National Guard troops sent to Illinois by former President Donald Trump can remain under federal control but cannot be deployed for duties like protecting federal property or patrols. This decision partially upholds a lower court ruling that found no substantial evidence of a "danger of rebellion" in Illinois. The deployment is part of Trump's broader immigration crackdown, which has drawn strong objections from state and local leaders who accuse him of exceeding legal authority and violating states' sovereignty.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, the document is expected to redefine the country's infrastructure spending and investment strategy. Historically, these plans have driven massive public works projects, helping economic growth but also accumulating local government debt. The upcoming plan is anticipated to emphasize more tech-driven and people-focused projects, indicating an evolution from past models. Economists remain optimistic about continued large-scale infrastructure spending, suggesting a strategic shift to meet new developmental demands while addressing past challenges.

          <p>Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader, asserted in an NPR interview that her country is in "profound, total chaos" under President Nicolás Maduro's "illegitimate" regime. Speaking from hiding, Machado called for Maduro's removal, citing evidence of election rigging and the forced exodus of over one-fifth of the population. She accused Maduro of operating a drug cartel and destabilizing the region, aligning with US claims. Machado, who dedicated her Nobel Prize to Trump, believes the regime's end is mandated by the Venezuelan people.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that US-Gulf partnerships in AI infrastructure, exemplified by multi-billion dollar deals and the Stargate UAE AI data center built on US technology, could thwart China's ambitions for AI leadership. While China has advanced with initiatives like an underwater data center, it faces capital constraints compared to the US, which is strategically investing in semiconductor companies and accelerating data center production. The article argues that Washington's interventions challenge China's near-term lead in the data center industry. (not investment advice)</p>
