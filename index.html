          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned a 12-hour Russian aerial assault that killed at least four people, including a child, and injured dozens across seven regions. The attack utilized hundreds of drones and missiles, targeting civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and other major cities like Zaporizhzhia. Zelensky has vowed retaliation and urged stronger international support, framing the attack as a clear statement of Russia's intentions following the UN General Assembly. This prolonged bombardment represents one of the most intense aerial attacks in recent months of the ongoing conflict.</p>

The storm, which previously caused at least 10 fatalities in the Philippines, is expected to make landfall with high-speed winds and the potential for severe flooding and landslides. In response, four coastal airports have been closed, fishing boats recalled, and thousands of troops mobilized for assistance. Vietnam has a history of being vulnerable to deadly typhoons, with natural disasters causing significant loss of life and economic damage in recent years.</p>

Speaking on a podcast, Huang highlighted China's vast talent pool and vibrant entrepreneurial environment as key factors in its rapid technological advancement. He argued that allowing US tech firms to compete in China maximizes America's economic success and geopolitical influence. Huang also expressed his belief that it is in China's best interest to remain open to foreign investment and competition.</p>

The election follows the disqualification of two pro-Russian parties over allegations of illegal foreign financing. Polls suggest Sandu's ruling party may struggle to maintain its majority, making the outcome highly consequential for Moldova's path toward potential EU membership.</p>

          <p>Swiss citizens are voting for a second time on the introduction of a national electronic identity card system, after a previous proposal was rejected in 2021 due to data privacy concerns. The revised plan makes the e-ID optional and keeps the system entirely in public hands, with data stored on users' smartphones rather than centrally. Supporters argue it will streamline bureaucratic processes, while opponents still fear it could undermine privacy despite the new safeguards. Recent polls suggest that voters, now more familiar with digital credentials after the pandemic, may be ready to approve the measure.</p>

          <p>The article provides a detailed background on Transnistria, the internationally unrecognized pro-Kremlin breakaway region in eastern Moldova. It explains the territory's origins in a post-Soviet war, supported by Russian troops who remain stationed there despite commitments to withdraw. Transnistria functions as a Russian military and operational base, characterized by a Soviet-style dictatorship, a lack of independent media, and systemic human rights violations. The region's economy has been heavily subsidized by Russian gas, and it serves as a hub for money laundering and Russian influence operations aimed at destabilizing Moldova.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany have activated the "snapback" mechanism to reimpose sweeping UN sanctions on Iran, citing the country's "continued nuclear escalation" and lack of cooperation with inspectors. The move comes ten years after the sanctions were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA). Iran suspended international inspections following US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities in June, though it maintains its program is peaceful. This reintroduction of economic and military sanctions marks a significant blow to the already fragile nuclear accord, though European diplomats insist it is not the end of diplomacy.</p>

While not a formal alliance, their actions—from economic pressure and political interference to cultural warfare—are mutually reinforcing.

          <p>Ahead of their match against Arsenal, a team known for its set-piece prowess, Newcastle United is working to improve its own effectiveness from dead-ball situations. Despite having a physically imposing team, including several players over 6ft 6in, Newcastle has not consistently converted set-piece opportunities into goals this season. The club recently hired a specialist set-play coach, Martin Mark, from the Danish club Midtjylland to help address this. The article analyzes the team's tactical shifts, such as an increased use of long throws, as they seek to leverage their physical advantages.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's TikTok Deal May Represent a Strategic Victory for China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 01:09:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent "framework consensus" for TikTok's U.S. operations, brokered by the Trump administration, may ultimately be a strategic win for China. While the deal places TikTok's data and servers under U.S. control and increases American ownership, it leaves Chinese parent company ByteDance as the single largest shareholder. The author contends that this structure still provides China with significant leverage over the platform's future. The article suggests that what appears to be a victory for U.S. national security could, upon closer inspection, be a major strategic triumph for Beijing.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Autistic Individuals Possess Traits of Focus and Empathy That Donald Trump Lacks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 01:00:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article responds to recent claims from the Trump administration about autism by highlighting the positive traits often associated with autistic people. The author argues that, contrary to the framing of autism as a tragedy, many autistic individuals demonstrate qualities like intense focus, adherence to facts, a strong sense of social justice, and profound empathy. The piece contrasts these characteristics with Donald Trump's perceived lack of focus and empathy, suggesting he could learn from the very community he mischaracterizes. It celebrates autistic joy and love as fundamental human experiences that defy negative stereotypes.</p>

          <p>As the regular season concludes, the Los Angeles Dodgers are finalizing their roster for the upcoming wild-card series, with several key decisions hinging on player health. Infielder Max Muncy and catcher Will Smith are both dealing with injuries, leaving their availability for the postseason opener in doubt. Beyond injuries, the team must decide on the final composition of its pitching staff, particularly the bullpen, balancing left- and right-handed options. Manager Dave Roberts is also keeping the Game 1 starting pitcher announcement private, weighing options that include two-way star Shohei Ohtani.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is taking new steps to acknowledge a violent episode in its history by erecting a monument to the victims of the 1885 anti-Chinese massacre. During the incident, a mob of European migrant miners killed 28 Chinese laborers and burned down the local Chinatown amid labor tensions. The new statue and an accompanying archaeological dig at the site of the former Chinatown represent a significant effort by the town to confront this dark past. This commemoration comes at a time of renewed national debate over immigration, highlighting the complex history of migrant labor.</p>

          <h2>Weak Consumer Spending in China Leads to Lower Hairy Crab Prices Ahead of Holiday</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 00:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prices for hairy crabs, a popular seasonal delicacy in China, are significantly lower this year as the country approaches its "super golden week" holiday. Industry insiders attribute the price drop to a combination of higher production and weak consumer demand, reflecting broader concerns about sluggish household spending. The eight-day holiday, which combines the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival, is seen as a critical test for China's domestic consumption. The falling price of this luxury food item is being interpreted as an indicator of ongoing economic doldrums. (not investment advice)</p>
