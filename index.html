          <p>Lazzat, ridden by James Doyle, triumphed over Satono Reve at Royal Ascot, preventing a Japanese victory. The win marked a double for Doyle and Wathnan Racing, who also celebrated Humidity's earlier success. Rebel's Romance, trained by Charlie Appleby, claimed the Hardwicke Stakes, Appleby's first Royal Ascot win since 2022, with William Buick as the jockey. This Group One victory added to Rebel's Romance's impressive record, providing a much-needed win for Appleby after Treanmor's earlier defeat. The jockey was briefly unseated after the finish line when the horse ran loose before being caught.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration fired hundreds of Voice of America (VOA) journalists, effectively shutting down the US-funded news outlet, which was originally created during World War II to counter Nazi propaganda. The administration accused VOA of left-wing bias and dysfunction, leading to the layoffs of 639 employees, with over 85% of the agency's staff losing their jobs since March. VOA journalists have sued to stop the network's elimination, decrying the move as the death of independent journalism. The firings are part of Trump's broader attacks against the US media, urging Republicans to defund NPR and PBS.</p>

He stated that if Gabbard made a false statement, there would be an obligation to correct the record, rather than dismissing her testimony.</p>

          <p>Arturo Gamboa, who was arrested after a fatal shooting at a "No Kings" rally in Salt Lake City, has been released from jail while the investigation continues. Gamboa allegedly brandished a rifle at the rally, leading to a safety volunteer firing shots that killed a demonstrator. The district attorney's office stated they could not yet decide on charges against Gamboa. Utah is an open-carry state, and the volunteer's actions are also under investigation to determine who was at fault for the shooting that killed Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, a fashion designer who appeared on "Project Runway."</p>

          <p>The superyacht Bayesian, which sank off Sicily last year, resulting in the death of tech magnate Mike Lynch and six others, has been recovered by salvage crews. The yacht sank during a storm as Lynch was celebrating his acquittal on fraud charges, and Italian authorities are conducting a criminal investigation into the incident. The recovery operation was complex due to the depth of the wreck, and involved specialized cave divers and steel lifting straps. British investigators reported that the yacht was knocked over by extreme wind.</p>

Bannon advised Trump against military action, citing concerns about the reliability of Israeli intelligence and the potential ineffectiveness of the "bunker-buster" bomb. Other advisors, like Senator Lindsey Graham, advocated for supporting Israel in eliminating the nuclear threat. Trump ultimately decided to hold off on a strike against Iran for two weeks, but the situation remains fluid.</p>

          <p>As a heatwave approaches the U.S., experts say American sunscreens are less effective than those available in other countries. While US sunscreens protect against UVB rays, they often provide weaker protection against UVA rays due to regulatory differences. The FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in over 20 years, while countries like France and Japan have approved a wider range of ingredients. Despite this, dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen and advise using broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>
