        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CBS News has ended its over 60-year continuous presence inside the Pentagon after declining to sign new press requirements. Along with most other major news organizations, CBS refused the new rules which critics, including veteran correspondents, argue could infringe on First Amendment rights by requiring prior authorization to publish even unclassified information. This departure marks a significant shift in the relationship between the press and the military, potentially hindering the "shoe-leather reporting" that has historically uncovered major stories through direct access and relationship-building within the building. The move affects numerous correspondents, producers, and technicians who have covered national security from inside the Pentagon for decades.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the possibility of the U.S. providing long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. Zelenskyy suggested a potential trade involving Ukrainian-made drones, an idea Trump appeared open to, though he also expressed concern about depleting U.S. stockpiles. The discussion occurred a day after Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he plans to meet soon in Budapest to discuss ending the war. Trump expressed hope the conflict could be resolved without escalating to the use of Tomahawks, which would enable Ukraine to strike deep within Russia.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old senior at Neshaminy High School in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, has died after contracting bacterial meningitis. The student, Ryan Duffy, became suddenly ill last week and passed away after being treated in an intensive care unit. The school district informed parents that the specific type of meningitis, Streptococcus Pneumoniae, is not typically contagious in a school setting and does not spread through casual contact. Enhanced cleaning protocols have been implemented at the school as a precaution. Health officials note that while most people recover from bacterial meningitis with proper treatment, it can be fatal within hours and may cause permanent disabilities in survivors.</p>

          <p>The White House budget chief announced that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is immediately pausing over $11 billion in projects due to the ongoing government shutdown. The administration stated that the funding lapse has drained the agency's ability to manage these "lower-priority projects" in cities like New York, San Francisco, and Boston. This move is part of a broader administration strategy that has seen funding frozen for infrastructure and climate-related projects in predominantly Democratic-leaning areas. The administration has framed the shutdown as an opportunity to reduce the federal bureaucracy, though a federal judge has temporarily blocked plans to lay off thousands of government workers.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, who served as President Trump's national security adviser, has pleaded not guilty to an 18-count indictment for allegedly mishandling classified information. Prosecutors claim that between 2018 and 2025, Bolton shared over 1,000 pages of sensitive, diary-like entries with two relatives via non-governmental messaging apps and personal email. Bolton asserts the charges are a politically motivated effort by the Trump administration to punish him for his criticism, calling it a weaponization of the Justice Department. The indictment details that some of the information was classified at the top-secret level and was also stored insecurely at his Maryland home.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's focus on Venezuela, including authorizing covert CIA operations and launching naval strikes against alleged drug smuggling boats, has revived concerns about U.S. intervention in Latin America. President Trump recently confirmed the CIA's authorization and declared a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, framing their activity as a "narcoterrorist" threat. This aggressive stance, which includes a $50 million reward for information leading to dictator Nicolas Maduro's arrest, has been labeled an attempt at regime change by Maduro. Experts note this approach recalls past U.S. interventions, though some believe it is a "special case" driven by Trump's focus on migration and drugs rather than a broad regional policy shift.</p>

          <p>A series of bad loans and allegations of fraud have triggered a selloff among regional bank stocks, focusing investor anxiety on a specific type of lending. The concern centers on loans made to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs), a sector that has grown rapidly as post-2008 regulations pushed riskier lending outside of traditional banks. Recent disclosures from Zions Bank and Western Alliance about near-total losses on loans to the same commercial real estate firm have spooked the market. This has raised fears of broader, hidden risks within the $1.14 trillion NDFI lending category, as investors question the quality of collateral backing these loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold reached a new record high this week, surpassing $4,300 per troy ounce as investors seek a safe-haven asset amid growing economic anxiety. The surge is attributed to several factors, including the prolonged U.S. government shutdown, ongoing global trade disputes, and the prospect of lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Since the beginning of 2025, gold futures have risen by nearly 60%, reflecting deep-seated investor concern about market stability and the value of the U.S. dollar. The demand is also fueled by central bank purchases and heightened geopolitical tensions, driving a significant shift in investment patterns. (not investment advice)</p>

This promotional effort aims to counteract perceptions of unrest that could deter tourism, a primary source of funding for the organization through lodging taxes. In response, the White House criticized the portrayal, labeling the protests as "radical violence" and defending the president's actions to protect federal facilities from what it terms domestic terrorists.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the Trump administration began launching deadly strikes against suspected drug vessels, the U.S. military has captured survivors after attacking a narco-submarine in the Caribbean. The strike is at least the sixth in the region since last month, with previous attacks resulting in at least 27 fatalities. The administration has justified these actions by declaring an "armed conflict" with drug cartels, a legal rationale that critics and human rights groups argue violates international law and amounts to extrajudicial executions. The capture of survivors raises new legal questions about their status, whether as prisoners of war or criminal defendants, amid a broader U.S. military buildup in the region.</p>

          <p>Faculty at the University of Texas at Austin are expressing alarm over the potential elimination of entire liberal arts departments, particularly those focused on ethnic, regional, and gender studies. Their concerns stem from the quiet appointment of a committee to review the restructuring of these programs, coupled with a new state law that disbands faculty senates and consolidates power with administrators. The university's new provost recently published an essay criticizing "identity-studies" and what he called an "ideological imbalance" in higher education. This has created a climate of uncertainty and fear among professors, who see these moves as a politically motivated attack on academic freedom and specific fields of study.</p>

With rates in the 5% to 6% range, they provide a secure return shielded from market downturns.

          <p>The Swiss running shoe company On is facing a class-action lawsuit filed by customers who allege a design defect in its popular shoes causes a "loud, embarrassing" squeaking sound with every step. The complaint claims the noise originates from the company's signature CloudTec sole design, where rubber components rub together during use. The plaintiffs argue they would not have purchased the premium-priced shoes, which retail for up to $180, had they known about the issue. According to the lawsuit, the company has dismissed customer complaints by categorizing the squeaking as "normal wear and tear," which is not covered by its warranty.</p>

          <p>While many homebuyers are anticipating another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve at its late October meeting, this article suggests that mortgage rates could fall even before the official announcement. Historical patterns show that mortgage rates often decline in anticipation of Fed action, as lenders "price in" the expected cut beforehand. For example, significant rate drops occurred just before Fed cuts in September 2024 and September 2025. Borrowers are advised to prepare by improving their credit scores and monitoring the market daily to capitalize on a potential, limited window of opportunity for lower rates.

          <p>Stephen Bryant, a South Carolina inmate convicted of a murder over 20 years ago, is scheduled to be executed next month. Bryant killed Willard Tietjen in his home, burned the victim's eyes with cigarettes, and used the victim's blood to write "catch me if u can" on a wall. The state Supreme Court issued the death warrant after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review his case. Bryant, who will be the 50th person executed in the state since 1985, has until October 31 to choose between lethal injection, firing squad, or the electric chair as his method of execution.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic analyzes recently revealed text messages from leaders of Young Republican groups, which included expressions of love for Hitler and jokes about gas chambers and sexual assault. The author argues that this rhetoric is more than just bigotry; it represents a profound "moral collapse" and a rejection of basic human decency, enabled by the political climate. The piece criticizes Vice President J.D. Vance for downplaying the comments as "stupid jokes," suggesting that this partisan relativism leads to nihilism. The author concludes that such dehumanization affects all of society and requires a defense of universal moral values.</p>

          <p>The South African women's cricket team secured a dominant 10-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in a match shortened by rain at the Women's World Cup in Colombo. Chasing a revised target of 121 runs in 20 overs, South Africa reached the goal with ease in under 15 overs. The victory was led by an unbroken opening partnership between captain Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits, who scored 60 and 55 runs, respectively. This fourth consecutive win moves South Africa into second place in the tournament standings, just behind Australia, while Sri Lanka remains winless and is unlikely to advance to the semi-finals.</p>

          <p>A potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Trump in Budapest faces major logistical challenges, primarily concerning Putin's travel through EU airspace. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian aircraft have been banned from flying over EU and U.S. territory. To reach landlocked Hungary, Putin's presidential plane would require special permission, or derogations, from individual EU and NATO member states like Bulgaria or Romania to cross their airspace. While Hungarian and EU officials have indicated a willingness to facilitate a meeting aimed at peace, the complex flight path and security arrangements highlight Putin's diplomatic isolation from the West.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against three major plastic bag manufacturers, alleging they are illegally marketing their products as recyclable when they are not. The lawsuit claims that the thicker plastic bags sold in stores since the state's 2014 single-use ban are not accepted by the vast majority of California's recycling facilities. This deception leads to billions of bags ending up in landfills and the environment. Alongside the lawsuit, the state announced a settlement with four other producers who will halt sales and pay over $1.7 million in penalties for similar violations, effectively phasing out these types of bags statewide.</p>

          <p>The recent record-breaking surge in gold prices is accelerating a shift away from the classic 60/40 investment portfolio, which allocates 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds. Some strategists now advocate for a 60/20/20 structure, reducing the bond allocation and dedicating 20% to alternatives like gold and cryptocurrency. The argument is that bonds no longer provide sufficient protection against inflation and geopolitical risk, as they increasingly move in tandem with stocks. This change reflects a growing acceptance of gold not as a fringe asset but as a core holding to hedge against economic uncertainty and currency debasement. (not investment advice)</p>

Qatar is focused on maintaining its indispensable role as a mediator, which relies on its ties to both the U.S. and Hamas's political leadership.

          <p>Richard Linklater's new film, "Blue Moon," features a deeply vulnerable performance by Ethan Hawke as Lorenz Hart, the brilliant but self-destructive lyricist of the Rodgers and Hart songwriting duo. The film imagines Hart on the opening night of "Oklahoma!," the first major success for his former partner Richard Rodgers with a new collaborator. Set almost entirely in the Sardi's restaurant, the story unfolds as Hart confronts his professional irrelevance, envy, and personal demons. Hawke's portrayal is described as touchingly diminished and poignantly egoless, capturing the fragility and self-loathing of an artist consumed by the fear of being a has-been.</p>

The article reveals that another woman was hospitalized after taking jabs purchased from him.

          <p>This Guardian editorial argues that the U.S. is transitioning from a society governed by the rule of law to one practicing rule by law, where the legal system is used as a weapon by the executive branch. The piece cites the recent string of indictments against President Trump's political opponents—including John Bolton, Letitia James, and James Comey—as evidence of this dangerous trend. The author contends that Mr. Trump has successfully framed personal vindictiveness as political retribution, imperiling the core democratic principle of a justice system applied without fear or favor.

          <p>President Trump is moving forward with privately funded construction projects at the White House, including a new $250 million ballroom, in an effort to cement his architectural legacy. At a dinner for the project's financial backers, Trump indicated that the ballroom is fully financed and that leftover funds might go toward another project: a large arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial. The fundraising and construction have drawn scrutiny from Democrats, who have introduced bills to ban donor names on White House structures and are investigating the project's financing for potential conflicts of interest, including foreign donations. The White House maintains the project is a welcome respite from other pressing matters of state.</p>
