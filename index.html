          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reports that Israeli forces killed at least 67 Palestinians who were waiting for aid lorries in the northern part of the territory. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated they fired warning shots to address an "immediate threat" and have disputed the number of fatalities. This incident is part of a pattern of deadly events near aid distribution points, exacerbating the severe hunger crisis in the region. The event has drawn international attention, including a call from Pope Leo XIV for an end to the "barbarity of the war."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While companies often cite "restructuring" or "optimization" for layoffs, employment experts suspect artificial intelligence is a larger, unacknowledged factor. Firms like IBM and Klarna have been more transparent about replacing roles with AI, but many others use vague language to avoid potential backlash from employees and the public. This strategic silence allows companies to proceed with automation while managing public perception. Experts note that while AI can automate many tasks, a complete replacement of human roles often proves premature, requiring companies to quietly outsource or rehire to fill the gaps.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, acting ICE director Todd Lyons announced a significant shift in enforcement policy, stating that agents will arrest any person they encounter who is in the country illegally. While the agency will still prioritize deporting serious criminal offenders, this new directive eliminates the previous focus that largely spared non-criminals from arrest. Lyons attributes this change to "sanctuary" policies that prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with ICE, forcing agents to conduct more community-based operations. The administration is also increasing worksite enforcement, targeting both unauthorized workers and the companies that employ them.</p>

          <p>In a commentary piece, former presidential speechwriter David Litt suggests that in a deeply divided America, seeking "common ground" is often futile, but finding "neutral ground" is essential. He describes his own experience of bonding with his politically opposite brother-in-law over surfing, an activity that allowed them to connect without focusing on their disagreements. Litt argues that such shared, non-political activities can foster friendships and create space for genuine discussion, rather than debate. He encourages people to find their own neutral spaces to engage with those they disagree with, helping to overcome the pervasive political polarization.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and his office have shifted to a more combative and aggressive social media strategy in response to former President Trump and his allies. This new approach involves using confrontational language and memes, a departure from the traditional Democratic motto of taking the "high road." Newsom's aides state the change was prompted by what they saw as federal overreach and that the goal is to match the tactics of the White House to effectively counter what they deem misinformation. While the strategy has significantly boosted Newsom's online engagement, it also raises questions about whether such tactics risk alienating voters who prefer more respectful political discourse.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia led to the temporary closure of all four major airports serving Moscow, causing the cancellation or redirection of hundreds of flights. The Russian defense ministry reported downing over 230 drones across Russia since Saturday, with 27 intercepted over the capital region alone. This disruption marks a significant escalation in Ukraine's ability to strike deep within Russian territory, impacting civilian infrastructure and daily life in Moscow. The attacks occurred as diplomatic rhetoric continues, with both sides expressing readiness for peace talks but with little progress toward a resolution of the nearly three-and-a-half-year-long war.</p>

University of Kentucky professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala explains that by consciously and repeatedly changing one's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, it is possible to shift underlying personality traits.

The high cost of living is a major contributing factor, as many of these cities are in states where retirement savings of over $1 million are considered necessary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article expresses the growing anxiety among the nearly 25 million naturalized U.S. citizens following the Department of Justice's prioritization of denaturalization cases. The author, a naturalized citizen, reflects on the constitutional distinction between natural-born and naturalized citizens, a line the Trump administration is accused of exploiting. The piece raises concerns that vague criteria for denaturalization, such as being "sufficiently important to pursue," could be used to target political opponents and chill free speech. It questions whether the promises of American democracy, as outlined in the civics test, still hold true when citizenship itself feels precarious for millions.</p>

          <p>A naturalized U.S. citizen employed by the Commerce Department's Patent and Trademark Office has been prevented from leaving China for several months. The individual, who previously served in the U.S. Army, was detained upon arrival in Chengdu in April during a personal trip to visit relatives. While the exact reason for the exit ban is unconfirmed, sources suggest it may be related to national security concerns or an alleged failure to disclose his U.S. government employment on his visa application. This incident adds another point of tension to the already complex diplomatic relationship between the United States and China.</p>

          <p>Following an upper house election in Japan, exit polls indicate that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition has lost its majority, compounding its minority status in the more powerful lower house. The defeat comes amid public frustration over inflation, political scandals, and the rise of the right-wing populist Sanseito party. Despite the significant electoral setback, which has historically led to resignations, Ishiba has vowed to stay in his post. He cited the need to lead the country through critical trade negotiations with the United States as his primary reason for remaining in power.</p>

          <p>A team of archaeologists believes it has found the wreck of the Nossa Senhora do Cabo, a Portuguese warship captured by the French pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as "La Buse," in 1721. The ship was carrying a vast treasure, including gold, diamonds, and other valuables, estimated to be worth over $138 million today. The wreck was discovered near the island of Nosy Boraha off Madagascar, a known pirate hideout. While thousands of artifacts have been recovered, the main treasure of La Buse, which he allegedly hid before his execution, remains a 300-year-old mystery that continues to captivate treasure hunters.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have made a major discovery at the ancient city of Petra in Jordan, unearthing a previously unknown tomb beneath the famous Khazneh, or "Treasury." The excavation, documented by the Discovery Channel, revealed the remains of 12 individuals and various artifacts dating back over 2,000 years. Unlike many other tombs at the World Wonder site, this one was not empty, providing a rare opportunity for new insights. Researchers believe the individuals buried in such a prime location were of high status, and studying the remains could help unlock more secrets about the Nabataeans who built the iconic monument.</p>

          <p>Two market analysts are forecasting that Bitcoin's price could surge to $200,000 by the end of the year, driven by a "wall of money" from corporate buyers. They report that over $15 billion in corporate treasury purchases of Bitcoin are planned, a trend that represents a fundamental shift in how companies view the cryptocurrency. Unlike traders, these corporations are treating Bitcoin as a long-term strategic reserve asset and are unlikely to sell, creating what the analysts call "permanent capital holding vehicles." This sustained demand could create a supply shock and drive the price significantly higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the United States' recent trade arrangements with Southeast Asian nations signal a strategic shift away from mutual partnership toward a transactional, rent-seeking model. The author argues that instead of fostering integration, Washington is now monetizing access to its market by imposing dramatically higher tariffs and demanding mandatory purchases from ASEAN members. This approach, the article claims, may secure short-term gains for the U.S. but ultimately undermines the sovereignty and manufacturing competitiveness of the region. The new strategy risks turning ASEAN economies into "fee for access" systems. (not investment advice)</p>

This rise coincides with significant cuts to foreign aid budgets by the United States and the European Union. With the U.S. and Europe pulling back tens of billions in aid, the report suggests the "center of gravity" for development finance is shifting east to Beijing, as well as Tokyo and Seoul.

A ceasefire was announced by Syria's interim president, and government forces have since closed roads into the city to contain the situation.

          <p>A new workplace phenomenon dubbed "quiet cracking" describes a state of persistent burnout, stagnation, and disengagement that differs from "quiet quitting." According to research from TalentLMS, affected employees feel unappreciated and see no path for career advancement, causing them to silently crack under the pressure, which eventually impacts performance. This trend, experienced by one in five employees frequently, is driven by economic uncertainty, unmanageable workloads, and poor leadership. Experts suggest that employers can combat this by providing recognition, managing workloads, and investing in learning and development opportunities to restore a sense of purpose.</p>

The documents were obtained after a digital news outlet and a research group successfully sued the foundation for violating Georgia's open records law. The released records reveal, among other things, the foundation's efforts to lobby city council members to derail a public referendum on the project. This outcome sets a significant precedent for the transparency of private police foundations, which have often operated as "black boxes" to fund police activities without public scrutiny.</p>

These moves, including gutting tax credits for solar and wind power and shuttering NOAA research labs, have been criticized as a scientifically baseless war on science.

Women with PCOS, a common hormonal disorder linked to insulin resistance, have reported significant improvements in symptoms such as irregular periods, hair loss, and weight management after taking the drugs. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity indirectly helps rebalance hormones, though larger clinical trials are needed to confirm these effects.
