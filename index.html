          <p>In a nine-hour interview with the Department of Justice, Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly stated that Donald Trump never engaged in any concerning behavior in her presence. According to sources familiar with the discussion, the Trump administration is now considering a public release of the interview transcripts and audio recordings. This development occurs as Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, is appealing her conviction to the Supreme Court and as Trump has not ruled out a potential pardon for her.</p>

          <p>Shares of Snap plummeted more than 15% after the company's second-quarter earnings report revealed a miss on global average revenue per user (ARPU). CEO Evan Spiegel attributed the weaker-than-expected topline growth to a flawed update to its advertising platform, the timing of Ramadan, and changes in trade policy. Despite the current challenges and a net loss of $262.6 million for the quarter, the company issued optimistic third-quarter guidance that exceeded Wall Street's revenue expectations.

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Transportation has announced a new proposal aimed at simplifying the process for companies to use drones for commercial purposes. The proposed rules would establish a clear pathway for businesses to operate unmanned aerial vehicles for tasks like deliveries and inspections, which proponents argue has been hindered by complex, case-by-case waiver systems. To address safety concerns, the regulations would mandate collision avoidance technology and prohibit flights over large public gatherings.</p>

          <h2>Texas Democrats' Departure from State Raises Legal Questions About Their Removal from Office</h2>

          <p>The exodus of over 50 Texas House Democrats to block a Republican redistricting plan has created a significant legal and political showdown. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers removed from their seats, but political experts suggest this would be difficult to enforce under the Texas Constitution. The primary constitutional methods for removal are expulsion by a two-thirds legislative vote or by voters at the ballot box, not by executive action for breaking quorum.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is preparing to seek hate crime charges and the death penalty against the man accused of murdering two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C.

          <p>An industrial accident at a cement plant in the Northern California city of Yreka prompted a temporary shelter-in-place order on Tuesday morning. A large dust cloud containing potentially hazardous cement particles was released, leading county officials to issue the alert out of an abundance of caution. The order was lifted within an hour as the cloud dissipated, and residents were advised that any settled particles on outdoor surfaces were safe to wash away.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparison of the interest earned from depositing $10,000 into either a 3-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. While current rates show a high-yield savings account might earn slightly more, a CD offers a fixed, guaranteed rate, which is a significant advantage if interest rates are expected to fall. Savers must weigh the benefit of a locked-in rate against the flexibility of a savings account, where rates are variable and funds are accessible. (not investment advice)</p>
