          <p>Medical researchers and patients are expressing alarm over proposed budget cuts to the National Cancer Institute under the Trump administration, warning of an existential crisis for cancer research. The article highlights how these cuts are leading to layoffs of specialized staff and significant delays in promising clinical trials, such as one for a pancreatic cancer vaccine. Patients, including one whose participation in a trial was critically delayed, share their devastating experiences, questioning the politicization of what was once a bipartisan funding priority. The story underscores the human cost of these administrative decisions on the fight against cancer.</p>

          <p>An early morning fire and explosion in Philadelphia's Nicetown-Tioga neighborhood resulted in the collapse of three rowhome buildings, hospitalizing at least two women. The incident prompted the evacuation of nearby residents due to the risk of further collapses and has initiated an extensive, all-day search and rescue operation. The Philadelphia Fire Department, alongside federal agencies like the ATF, is investigating the cause of the explosion, meticulously examining the rubble. Residents described being woken by a "big bang" that shattered windows and shook houses blocks away.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will consider the most appropriate governing framework for his coalition following the critical House of Councillors election in July. Securing a majority is a "must-attain" goal, though he acknowledged it will be difficult amid voter concerns over inflation, stagnant wages, and economic uncertainty. The election is seen as a public verdict on his minority government, which is grappling with issues like soaring rice prices.

          <p>An excerpt from a forthcoming book argues that despite having less partnered sex than previous generations, Gen Z is spearheading a new sexual revolution by politicizing and redefining sexuality. The article posits that this generation, shaped by political turmoil and the erosion of reproductive rights, views sex through a political lens and is actively challenging traditional gendered expectations. Rather than being sex-negative, many young people are expanding the definition of sex beyond heterosexual intercourse and focusing on consent and agency. This shift is presented as a progressive response to a restrictive political and social environment.</p>

The piece delves into the psychology and business models of contact centers, revealing how efficiency metrics incentivize agents to be unhelpful.

          <p>This opinion article contends that the liberal argument for youth gender medicine, particularly the claim that it prevents suicide, is a "zombie fact" unsupported by strong evidence, a point even conceded by an ACLU lawyer before the Supreme Court. The author argues that many on the left are in a media bubble, unaware that the evidence base for treatments like puberty blockers is weak and that organizations like WPATH have suppressed internal doubts and contrary findings for political reasons. The piece critiques the polarization of the debate and suggests that acknowledging the scientific uncertainty is necessary, regardless of one's stance on legislative bans.</p>

The festival, which involves pulling the chariots of the deities Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra through the streets, is a major event that attracts a massive number of onlookers each year.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that the Labour government is now in a "better position" to pass its welfare reforms after making significant concessions to avoid a major backbench rebellion. Last week, the prime minister reversed course on several planned cuts to disability benefits, including Personal Independence Payment (Pip), after more than 120 Labour MPs threatened to vote against the bill. Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and that the government had to learn from the near-rebellion. Key changes include limiting Pip cuts to new claimants and creating a review of the assessment process co-led by a prominent MP.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision limiting the scope of nationwide injunctions has cleared a path for the Trump administration to begin implementing its executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, the decision means it could take effect in 28 states within 30 days. Questions remain about the practical execution of the policy, such as what documentation will be required at hospitals.

          <p>Following his primary victory for New York City mayor, Republicans are strategically using Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as a means to brand the entire Democratic party as extremist. High-profile Republicans, including Donald Trump and the RNC Chair, have labeled Mamdani a "communist" and are linking his progressive platform to national Democrats to energize their base ahead of elections. In response, some moderate Democrats have distanced themselves from Mamdani, while others have defended him against what they call Islamophobic attacks. Mamdani himself has responded by stating that New Yorkers are excited by his focus on addressing economic inequality.</p>

          <p>The Senate has voted to advance the so-called "One Big Beautiful Bill" after a prolonged and tense session where Republican leadership worked to secure support from a bloc of conservative holdouts. After hours of negotiation, Senator Ron Johnson switched his vote to yes, allowing the legislation to proceed without a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The holdouts, including Senators Mike Lee and Cynthia Lummis, said they felt "more comfortable" after receiving promises for a future amendment vote on deficit reduction and Medicaid changes. The bill now faces a lengthy process before a final vote.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old Cleveland man, David Carr, received a distressing notice from the Social Security Administration demanding he repay $1,700 for unemployment benefits allegedly collected by his late wife for six months after her death. The demand threatened the financial stability of Carr, who relies on survivor benefits to care for his two adult children with special needs. After being initially rebuffed by the SSA, the erroneous overpayment notice was finally rescinded following an inquiry from a local news outlet.

          <p>This analysis argues that the Trump administration has weaponized federal civil rights laws against universities, adopting aggressive enforcement tactics previously pioneered by progressives. While the Obama administration used Title IX to pressure colleges on sexual assault policies, the Trump administration is now using Title VI to target institutions over alleged anti-Semitism and DEI initiatives, demanding sweeping changes under threat of losing federal funds. The author contends this approach, regardless of intent, leads to bureaucratic bloat, infringes on academic freedom, and creates an unstable environment where policies shift dramatically between administrations. A congressional solution is proposed to limit this "regulation by intimidation."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay is a symptom of a "poor-impulse-control economy" and reflects deeper economic anxieties, according to economic commentator Kyla Scanlon. The article explores how Gen Z and millennials, raised in the shadow of the 2008 crisis and student debt, view such services as "casual debt" and a tool to navigate high costs of living and stagnant wages. While not inherently evil, the ease of BNPL is seen as a psychological buffer against the feeling of being locked out of traditional economic stability, like homeownership.

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to resume enriching uranium in "a matter of months." Despite recent U.S. and Israeli strikes causing "severe damage" to nuclear facilities, Grossi clarified that Iran's industrial and technological capabilities were not totally eliminated. This assessment appears to temper claims by U.S. President Donald Trump that the program was "obliterated." The report comes amid high tensions, with Iran insisting its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes while its supreme leader vows the nation will never surrender.</p>

          <p>A veteran music teacher at a Catholic school in a New Orleans suburb was fired after a parent discovered his late husband's obituary, which revealed his same-sex marriage. The teacher, Mark Richards, had worked at St. Francis Xavier school for 21 years and said his sexuality was an open secret, but the discovery led to his termination based on a morality clause in his contract. The firing has sparked an outcry from other parents, who started a petition calling the decision "unjust" and have collected over 1,500 signatures.

Legal experts express concern over this power vacuum and the recent replacement of experienced vaccine advisers with Kennedy's appointees.

          <p>This sports commentary argues that the Los Angeles Lakers' new majority owner, Mark Walter of the Guggenheim group, should initially retain President of Basketball Operations Rob Pelinka and Head Coach JJ Redick. Despite both being controversial hires linked to personal connections rather than extensive qualifications, the author contends they have earned a chance to prove themselves under a new, more professionalized ownership structure. The piece notes that Pelinka has an NBA championship and key acquisitions on his resume, while Redick showed promise in his first regular season. The recommendation is to allow them at least one more season to maximize the roster's potential.</p>

          <p>UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds is holding urgent talks with Lotus management amid concerns the sportscar maker might move production from its Norfolk factory to the United States, jeopardizing 1,300 jobs. The company's Chinese owner, Geely, was reportedly exploring options to avoid U.S. tariffs on car imports. However, Lotus has insisted it has "no plans to close the factory," stating the UK is the heart of its brand and that it is exploring strategic options to enhance global competitiveness. The potential move by such a prestige brand would be a significant blow to the UK's automotive sector and the government's industrial strategy.</p>
