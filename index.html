          <p>US federal prosecutors have charged 11 individuals in a Russia-based scheme accused of defrauding Medicare and its supplemental insurers of over $10 billion through fraudulent billing for expensive medical equipment. The "transnational criminal organization" allegedly acquired legitimate medical equipment companies to submit billions in false claims, with approximately $41 million paid by Medicare and an estimated $900 million by supplemental insurers between 2022 and 2024. The scheme involved stealing personal information from over a million Medicare recipients, and proceeds were laundered globally via shell companies and cryptocurrency. This extensive fraud, organized by an individual in Russia and managed across several countries, underscores the significant vulnerabilities in public health programs to sophisticated international criminal exploitation.</p>

          <p>Japanese and U.S. negotiators are continuing talks to reach a beneficial tariff deal, despite significant differences, particularly regarding Washington's treatment of Japan's automotive industry. These discussions occurred as the U.S. administration considers extending its 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, set to expire in early July, though President Trump indicated he could shorten it. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump recently failed to strike a deal at the G7 summit, leaving Japan facing potential additional tariffs of up to 14 percent on top of existing duties. This ongoing trade uncertainty, coupled with already raised automotive tariffs, poses a substantial economic concern for Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, despite not playing their best baseball, secured a 5-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals, moving into sole possession of the best record in MLB at 52-31. Manager Dave Roberts noted the team's inconsistent play, yet they managed to compensate for shortcomings like a short start from Dustin May and limited hits. Key offensive plays included Shohei Ohtani's leadoff blast and game-tying triple, alongside Max Muncy's two-run homer. The bullpen's five scoreless frames and a game-ending double play in the ninth sealed the win, highlighting the team's current ability to achieve success even without a flawless performance.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that parents can opt their children out of lessons using LGBTQ+ storybooks if they offend religious beliefs, requiring schools to provide advance notice for temporary removal. This decision stems from a lawsuit against Montgomery County, Md., schools, which had incorporated these books to represent LGBTQ+ families in their English language arts curriculum. The ruling specifically detailed nine picture books, including "Pride Puppy," "Love, Violet," and "Uncle Bobby's Wedding," outlining their content and the objections raised by parents. Dissenting justices argued the majority failed to acknowledge the fundamental truth of LGBTQ+ people's existence and acceptance, warning against eliminating books depicting LGBTQ+ individuals.</p>

          <p>A ranking Emirati official revealed that the long-term US objective in the Middle East, particularly after 9/11, has been to "reduce any regional state on a military and technological par with Israel to a pre-industrial society." This agenda, once a neoconservative idea, became official US policy, aiming to ensure Israel's military dominance. This strategy has been a source of exasperation and concern among Gulf powers, who question the endless cycle of violence it seems to perpetuate. The policy's fallout includes sustained regional instability and ongoing conflicts, indicating a deliberate effort to shape the regional power balance through military and technological disparity.</p>

          <p>China's solar panel manufacturing industry is facing a severe downturn due to a combination of a domestic price war, a significant supply glut, and restrictive US tariffs. Prices across the supply chain plummeted by 60-80% in 2024, leading to substantial losses for many listed producers, totaling an estimated $40-60 billion. Major companies are experiencing significant share declines and opting out of key industry events, signaling widespread weariness and concern. The industry, once hailed as a new economic driver, is now questioning the depth and duration of this prolonged downturn, with fears of bankruptcies looming as export markets become increasingly inaccessible.

Weiss faces criminal charges for unauthorized computer access and identity theft, having accessed over 2,000 college athletes' and 1,300 other students' accounts to find private images.

          <p>For the first time in four years, leaders from South Korea and Japan were notably absent from the annual NATO summit, with both countries, along with Australia, sending lower-level representatives. Experts suggest this decision reflects higher priorities in the Indo-Pacific region, where there is growing concern that ongoing Middle East conflicts might divert crucial US attention. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reportedly canceled his trip to The Hague due to the low likelihood of securing a meeting with US President Donald Trump. This collective absence underscores a potential strategic re-evaluation by these Indo-Pacific nations, prioritizing their immediate regional stability and concerns over participation in broader alliance gatherings.</p>

A Toronto-area business owner, Wes Love, recounted paying a C$35,000 penalty due to a missed deadline, likening the situation to "dealing with the mob." Canada is engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war, primarily on metals and autos, which has significantly slowed its economy. Despite Prime Minister Mark Carney's efforts to negotiate a new trade deal, Trump recently announced the termination of all trade discussions over Canada's digital services tax, leaving businesses desperate for stable rules and clear ground rules for operation.

Some areas are experiencing nearly two inches of elevation loss annually, raising concerns about the long-term integrity of the $15 billion levy system. The study, published in Science Advances, identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites and new developments, potentially transforming critical wetland buffers into open water within a decade. Researchers emphasize the urgent need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure flood defenses do not lose their protection, guiding other coastal cities facing similar challenges.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) aid distribution system as "inherently unsafe" and "killing people," with over 400 Palestinians reportedly killed while seeking aid. GHF, backed by Israel and the US, bypasses UN and NGOs, claiming it prevents Hamas from seizing aid, an accusation Hamas denies. Guterres stressed that the "search for food must never be a death sentence," urging for a ceasefire and emphasizing Israel's obligation to facilitate aid deliveries. While a GHF spokesperson denied deaths at their sites, an Israeli military investigation into possible war crimes over alleged civilian shootings near aid sites is underway.</p>

          <p>The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), recently purged and restaffed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., held its first meeting, marked by skepticism towards established vaccine safety data. New members, including prominent vaccine skeptics, questioned CDC presentations and proposed alternative hypotheses of harm, despite lack of supporting scientific evidence. This shift comes after Kennedy terminated over $1 billion in US funding for a global vaccination initiative and hired an anti-vaccine organization's former president. Critics expressed concern that decisions were being made based on "feelings and preferences rather than evidence," signaling a potential radical change in America's vaccination policy, moving away from its historical evidence-based approach.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, limited federal judges' ability to issue nationwide injunctions, ruling that such sweeping orders likely exceed their equitable authority. Authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the majority opinion argued these universal orders are historically unsupported and not intended for general oversight of the Executive Branch, but rather for resolving specific cases. While the ruling stemmed from challenges to President Trump's birthright citizenship order, the court did not address its constitutionality, allowing the administration to proceed with implementation planning. Dissenting, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned this new regime risks constitutional rights for non-parties and abdicates the court's crucial role in protecting the rule of law.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom warns that a GOP budget bill in the U.S. Senate could lead to "devastating" healthcare cuts, potentially causing 3.4 million Californians to lose Medi-Cal insurance. The bill, a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda, would impose work requirements for Medicaid recipients and reduce federal funding for states. Newsom projects that millions could lose coverage due to these new requirements and stricter re-verification rules, impacting struggling rural hospitals and increasing Covered California premiums. He criticized Republican lawmakers for "gutting an already vulnerable system," emphasizing the severe threat to the state's progress in reducing its uninsured population, particularly in rural areas.

          <p>A study by the Japan Institute for Health Security indicates that a traditional Japanese-style diet, including rice, miso soup, and fish, may lower the rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research, conducted on 12,499 employees, found that those adhering to this diet were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms, even after isolating other potential influencing factors. The institute suggests that certain foods like seaweed, soy products, and omega-3 rich fish contribute to improved well-being by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. This first-of-its-kind study hopes to inform public health measures for depression prevention in workplaces and other areas.</p>

The correspondent's phage, named Gallagher-phage, proved highly effective in killing a troublesome urinary tract infection bacteria in the lab. While phage therapy is an old idea, it's gaining renewed interest as antibiotic resistance becomes a "silent pandemic" with projected annual deaths of 10 million by 2050.

          <p>The European Space Agency's Biomass satellite, launched in April, is providing groundbreaking images that "see" through dense rainforest canopies and clouds, revealing previously hidden details. This pioneering satellite, 20 years in the making, uses a unique P-band radar frequency to measure woody material and estimate carbon storage, crucial for understanding rainforests' role in mitigating climate change. The initial breathtaking images show concealed deforestation and terrain, allowing authorities to react more swiftly to illegal logging. The ultimate goal is a global 3D forest map, enhancing efforts to protect these vital ecosystems, which cover only 6% of the world's land but host half its species and store billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, a quiet Wisconsin high school senior, overcame social anxiety by painting portraits of 44 of her classmates, spending 13 hours on each for a total of 600 hours. Schafer, who felt disconnected from peers she once knew, wanted to "be seen again" and reconnect with them. Her generous act of presenting the paintings to her classmates evoked rave reviews and some remorse from students who wished they had interacted more. Schafer hopes her experience teaches others, both students and adults, that reaching out and trying to connect can bridge perceived social gaps, emphasizing that much of social isolation is "all in your head."</p>

          <p>Henrik Svendsen, owner of My Home Contemporary Furniture in Merriam, Kansas, is closing his store in August, citing President Trump's tariffs as making imported furniture unaffordable for customers. Svendsen has paid approximately $162,000 in tariffs, which he couldn't absorb due to his business's slim margins, forcing him to liquidate everything. With 99% of his inventory imported, half from China, his business was heavily impacted despite a temporary US-China deal. The closure also means layoffs for his 10 employees, highlighting the direct and severe economic consequences of the trade war on small businesses and their workers, leading to significant personal and professional uncertainty.

          <p>The US military did not use bunker-buster bombs on Iran's Isfahan nuclear site due to its extreme depth, a top general informed lawmakers, as such bombs would likely be ineffective. While B2 bombers used these bombs on Fordow and Natanz, Isfahan, believed to house nearly 60% of Iran's enriched uranium, was only struck by Tomahawk missiles. Intelligence officials noted that most enriched material is buried at Isfahan and Fordow, with some capabilities potentially unreachable by US bombing capacity. This detail highlights limitations in US strike capabilities and raises questions about the long-term setback to Iran's nuclear program, despite President Trump's claims of "obliteration" and denials of material movement.</p>

          <h2>Fourth Federal Judge Blocks Trump Executive Order Targeting Law Firms</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, marking the fourth such ruling against his campaign to punish elite law firms. Judge Loren AliKhan declared the order "unconstitutional from beginning to end," citing violations of First and Fifth Amendment rights and a broader assault on the American legal system. Trump's orders sought to impose punitive measures like suspending security clearances and ending government contracts for firms representing opposing causes or employing disliked attorneys. These consistent judicial rebukes, from judges appointed by both parties, underscore the courts' defense of an independent bar and the rule of law against executive overreach.</p>

          <p>Labour's recent U-turn on welfare reform, particularly regarding Personal Independence Payments (PIP), raises significant questions about the government's long-term strategy and ability to manage affairs. The initial plan to cut Â£5bn from welfare by 2029-30, driven by a need to meet borrowing rules, faced mass rebellion and independent expert criticism for not adequately supporting people back to work. While the compromise spares some current claimants and pulls forward disability employment funding, critics argue it's still not a full, structural reform needed to tackle rising health-related claims. The incident highlights the challenge of balancing short-term budget needs with long-term social and economic goals, potentially forcing future tax increases or spending cuts.

          <p>The 1975 headlined Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, delivering a slick and crowd-pleasing show that was polished but largely safe, lacking the band's usual wild excesses. Frontman Matty Healy, while expressing nervousness, showcased his verbose lyrics and the band's tight musicality, blending digital textures with rock and 80s influences. Despite Healy's self-proclaimed status as a "generational poet," the performance mostly stuck to hits, with only "People" showing untamed energy. Notably, the band steered clear of politics, with Healy stating a desire for their legacy to be "love and friendships" rather than political, a significant shift that may influence their forthcoming sixth album and future performances.</p>

          <p>The remote Alaskan village of Kwethluk recently hosted hundreds of clergy and pilgrims for the canonization of Matushka Olga, a local midwife and healer, as the first Yup'ik Orthodox Christian saint. Olga, remembered for her humble service and healing of trauma, particularly sexual assault, has been attributed with miracles since her 1979 death, with icons of her likeness appearing in churches. The two-day glorification ceremony included her last funeral rite and a procession, with services incorporating the local Yugtun language. The Alaska diocese is now fundraising for a new church, pilgrim's lodge, and cultural center in Kwethluk, symbolizing a new chapter for the community and its strong Orthodox tradition.</p>
