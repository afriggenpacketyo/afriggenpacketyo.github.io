          <p>Authorities in Sun Valley, Los Angeles, are actively searching for a gunman who opened fire on three male teenagers Friday evening, before fleeing in a silver car. The victims, aged 16 to 18, sustained non-life-threatening wounds and were transported to local hospitals for treatment, marking a distressing incident of violence. The shooter, described as a man in black clothing, was last seen heading eastbound on Arminta Street and is believed to be armed with a handgun, posing a continued threat. This event underscores persistent community safety concerns and the challenges law enforcement faces in preventing such acts, as the Los Angeles Police Department continues its comprehensive investigation to apprehend the suspect.</p>

          <p>The UK, alongside France and Germany, is prepared to utilize the full value of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's war effort, a significant escalation in pressure against Russia. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced this joint action, aiming to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the conflict. Previously, only profits and interest from these assets were used, but the new move targets the over £25 billion in Russian assets frozen by the UK since 2022. This initiative, undertaken in close cooperation with the US, follows extensive missile and drone strikes by Russia on Ukrainian infrastructure, which killed two and injured 20 people.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Announces New 100% Tariffs on Chinese Imports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 22:36:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced new 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, effective November 1, in response to what he termed China's "extraordinarily aggressive position on trade" regarding export controls. This move, which comes on top of existing tariffs, follows China's new restrictions on rare-earth minerals crucial for semiconductor production. The announcement triggered a stock market sell-off, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all experiencing declines. Trump also suggested he might cancel an upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at APEC, signaling a potential re-escalation of trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has rejected a Trump administration proposal that sought to impose policies on universities in exchange for federal funding, citing concerns over academic freedom. MIT President Sally Kornbluth stated the "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education" would restrict freedom of expression and was inconsistent with the university's core values. The compact included demands such as capping foreign admissions, restricting political comments by leaders, and adopting a binary gender definition. MIT's decision, following previous federal funding cuts, underscores a broader conflict between the administration's conservative agenda and the autonomy of higher education institutions.</p>

Lured by promises of glory and an afterlife in the 1990s, Banayee, then 14, was radicalized in a Pakistani refugee camp amidst intense religious propaganda. He joined the Taliban in Afghanistan, enforcing their laws and promoting propaganda, but eventually questioned their cruelty. Now living in the UK and working with the NHS, he has written a book, "Delusions of Paradise," to warn about the dangers of radicalization, especially with the rise of religious schools in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>Many individuals experience seasonal mood shifts, often referred to as "autumn blues," characterized by tiredness, lethargy, and isolation. Counsellors explain that reduced sun exposure leads to less serotonin and more melatonin, affecting mood and sleep. Strategies to combat this include actively planning social engagements, avoiding excessive remote work, and maximizing natural light exposure at home. Additionally, light therapy, maintaining consistent sleep schedules with sunrise alarm clocks, and embracing the "cosy" aspects of the colder months through activities like hot baths and scented candles are recommended to improve wellbeing during these seasons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Silicon Valley is increasingly concerned about a potential AI investment bubble, with critics questioning if the rapid rise in AI company valuations is fueled by "financial engineering." OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged some "bubbly" parts of AI, though he maintained his company's growth is "real." Warnings from institutions like the Bank of England and JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon highlight the magnitude of money involved, prompting fears of a significant economic downturn if the bubble bursts. This article details the complex financing arrangements, such as Nvidia's investment in OpenAI, which are contributing to market scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration announced a deal with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to offer discounted prescription drugs to Medicaid patients and list them on the "TrumpRx" website, aiming to make medicines more affordable. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will provide drugs at "most-favored-nation" prices to Medicaid, matching the lowest rates offered in other high-income countries, and offer up to an 80% discount for eligible patients. This deal, similar to one with Pfizer, also aims to avoid the administration's threatened tariffs on drugmakers. However, experts express skepticism about the deal's broad impact, noting Medicaid already receives low prices and the limited reach of TrumpRx for insured patients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The hit BBC show "The Traitors," including its celebrity edition, captivates audiences by exploring themes of lying and deception, which psychologists suggest are deeply embedded in human nature. Professor Richard Wiseman notes that the show mirrors everyday life, where individuals constantly try to discern honesty from deceit, and that deception can paradoxically hold society together while also being exploitative. The article discusses how the show's format exposes the "illusion of co-operation" and how quickly loyalty can collapse under pressure. This analysis highlights the psychological intrigue and social experiment aspects that make the program so compelling to viewers.</p>
