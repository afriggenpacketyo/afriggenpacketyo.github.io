          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, recently had its initial public offering (IPO), raising $1.5 billion.  However, Wall Street banks, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs, received only 2.8% of the proceeds in underwriting fees, significantly lower than the historical average. This low payout raises concerns about the current state of the tech IPO market and CoreWeave's financial stability.  The company's stock performance following the IPO has also been underwhelming, further fueling investor apprehension.</p>
