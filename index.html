          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, has returned to Massachusetts after spending six weeks in ICE detention in Louisiana, expressing her faith in the American justice system. Speaking at a press conference with Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, Ozturk thanked supporters and shared her experiences of receiving support from her university lab mates while detained. She emphasized the need to address the conditions of women in immigration detention and vowed to continue her legal case, asserting her due process and First Amendment rights were violated when she was taken into custody for co-authoring an op-ed about Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk was released on bail after a judge found no evidence to justify her detainment beyond the op-ed.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that the UK will end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration, requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas for existing foreign workers. The government plans to unveil changes to visa and recruitment laws aimed at cutting up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers from entering the UK over the next year. The threshold for skilled visas is expected to increase to graduate level, and there will be a narrower list of exceptions for temporary shortage visas in some industries. Cooper also promised a new fair pay agreement for care workers to attract more domestic workers to the sector.</p>

          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to reduce the number of flights in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport for the next several weeks to address ongoing radar outages, flight delays, and air traffic controller shortages. Duffy intends to convene a meeting with airlines operating at Newark to determine the extent of the reduction, with a focus on afternoons when international arrivals increase airport congestion. The Trump administration has proposed a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the US air traffic control system, including new coordination centers and technology upgrades. Duffy also plans to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers and offer bonuses to encourage them to stay on the job.</p>

          <p>Puerto Rico is seeking to capitalize on the global trade war by attracting international companies to relocate their manufacturing plants to the island, offering exemption from tariffs. Government officials are actively promoting Puerto Rico as a business and investment destination, highlighting its U.S. jurisdiction, tax incentives, and skilled workforce. Manufacturing remains the island's largest industry, and the government aims to recapture its past success by attracting companies in sectors such as aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. However, chronic power outages and high energy costs remain challenges for attracting investors.</p>

          <p>Britain is experiencing wildfires and drought warnings after the driest start to spring in nearly 70 years, with fires erupting across Scotland, Wales, and England. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service deployed around 50 firefighters to combat a large forest fire near Fauldhouse, with mainland Scotland under an "extreme" wildfire risk warning. In southwest Wales, a wildfire broke out on the Welsh Government Woodland Estate, and in England, a major wildfire in Dartmoor, Devon, raged across more than 1,200 acres. The Environment Agency has warned of a medium risk of drought this summer if there is not consistent rainfall.</p>
