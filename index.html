        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk have publicly clashed after Musk criticized the Republican tax and budget bill, leading to Trump threatening to cancel Musk's government contracts. Musk responded by alleging that Trump's name appears in files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier. Trump officials had previously vowed to unveil more files related to the Epstein case, but only a limited release has occurred so far. The feud escalated with Trump claiming Musk was unhappy about electric vehicle subsidies being eliminated and Musk asserting he helped Trump win the election, highlighting a significant rift between the two former allies. The optimism score reflects the negative sentiment stemming from the public dispute and allegations. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to David Brooks, the Democratic Party is struggling to adapt to a new historical era marked by widespread social distrust and a belief that societal systems are rigged. Brooks argues that the Republicans, under Trump, have been more effective in adjusting to this shift by appealing to the sense of alienation and distrust. Trump has departed from traditional conservative orthodoxy, embracing policies such as protectionism and government intervention in the economy. This shift requires Democrats to adopt a visionary approach rather than relying on conventional political tactics.</p>

Prosecutors stated that Solny exploited vulnerable homeowners. He now faces a potential prison sentence of up to seven years. The verdict sends a message that those who exploit homeowners will be held accountable, but the fact that such a crime could be committed in the first place is a reflection of a darker reality.</p>
