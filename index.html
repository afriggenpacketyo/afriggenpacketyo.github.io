        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major trade unions in France organized widespread strikes, causing significant disruptions to transportation networks, schools, and other public services across the country. The protests are a direct challenge to President Emmanuel Macron's government and its plan to implement substantial budget cuts and social welfare freezes. Demonstrators argue these austerity measures will disproportionately harm low- and middle-income workers who are already struggling with the high cost of living, echoing ongoing public resistance to economic reforms. This action represents a critical test for the new Prime Minister, Sebastien Lecornu, who is tasked with navigating the unpopular financial agenda through a restive parliament and public.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has reportedly blocked domestic tech firms from purchasing Nvidia's H20 and RTX Pro 6000D AI chips, effectively freezing the U.S. company out of the market. This move follows a national security review and claims that China's homegrown AI chips have achieved comparable performance, reducing reliance on foreign technology. Analysts suggest Beijing's actions reflect growing confidence in its domestic semiconductor industry and could be a tactic to gain leverage in ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. The decision creates significant uncertainty for Nvidia's access to one of its key global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ABC and major affiliate owners, including Nexstar and Sinclair, have indefinitely pulled "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" from their schedules following comments the host made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel suggested that political allies were exploiting the killing for political gain, which drew widespread condemnation and calls for his removal from air. The decision has sparked a broader debate about free speech and media responsibility, with the FCC Chairman threatening action and various unions defending Kimmel's writers and staff. The move highlights the intense political polarization surrounding the tragic event and its aftermath.</p>

          <p>In an interview, journalist Mehdi Hasan discussed his recent experience debating 20 far-right conservatives on the YouTube show "Surrounded," where he encountered individuals openly identifying as fascists. The conversation, framed by the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk, explored the broader question of whether engaging with extremist ideologies provides value or merely legitimizes them. Hasan argued that while he does not believe in debating fascists, his goal in such forums is not to change his opponents' minds but to reach open-minded viewers in the audience. The article delves into the complexities of political discourse in a polarized, algorithm-driven media landscape and the strategic choices involved in confronting extremism.</p>

Police were called to the scene on Wednesday evening and have since recovered a firearm. Authorities are treating the event as an isolated incident, believing the man and woman were known to each other, and have stated there is no wider risk to the public.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, with their differing approaches to the Israeli-Gaza conflict expected to be a key topic. While both leaders have criticized Israel's military operations, their policy responses have varied significantly, highlighting a potential point of contention within the EU. Spain has actively pursued measures against Israel, including joining South Africa's genocide case at the ICJ and imposing an arms embargo. In contrast, Germany has maintained a more cautious stance, rejecting broader sanctions, which underscores the challenge the EU faces in forming a unified foreign policy on the issue.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government announced it has secured £150 billion in investment commitments from U.S. companies, a development timed with President Donald Trump's state visit. Major tech firms like Microsoft and Google are among the investors, with the government projecting the creation of 7,600 jobs. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to strengthen economic ties between the two nations. However, the announcement comes amid challenges, as some pharmaceutical giants have halted their U.K. investment plans, citing an unfavorable business environment, and a proposed deal to cut steel tariffs has been shelved, presenting a mixed economic picture.</p>

While key players have been absent due to injury, this has created opportunities for new talent to emerge from MLS.

          <p>After a day of royal ceremony at Windsor Castle, President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K. is shifting focus to trade and geopolitical discussions with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The leaders are meeting at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence, to discuss the U.S.-U.K. trade deal, tariffs on British steel, and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. The visit has already been marked by the announcement of £150 billion in U.S. investment into the U.K. The seemingly positive personal relationship between the politically dissimilar Trump and Starmer is noted as a potentially key factor in the success of the talks.</p>

          <p>Starbucks workers in Illinois, Colorado, and California have initiated legal action against the company, alleging its new, stricter dress code unlawfully forces them to bear the cost of new clothing. The class-action lawsuits and complaints, backed by the Starbucks Workers United union, argue that the company must reimburse employees for expenses that primarily benefit the employer. The new policy requires solid black shirts and specific types of bottoms and shoes, a significant change from the previously lax code. Workers claim they have been denied reimbursement for new clothes and, in some cases, for costs like removing non-compliant piercings.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced that its once-daily oral semaglutide pill demonstrated an average weight reduction of 16.6% in a late-stage trial, with a tolerability profile similar to its popular Wegovy injection. The positive results, which caused the company's shares to jump, position the "Wegovy pill" as a significant alternative for patients averse to needles. The drug is currently under review by the U.S. FDA, with a decision expected later this year, intensifying the competition with rivals like Eli Lilly to bring the first approved oral GLP-1 obesity treatment to the market.

          <p>The families of four passengers killed in the June Air India crash have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Honeywell in the United States. The complaint alleges that a faulty fuel cutoff switch on the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, which could be inadvertently disengaged, led to a loss of engine thrust and caused the disaster that killed 260 people. The lawsuit claims both companies were aware of the risk, citing a 2018 FAA caution about a similar issue on several Boeing aircraft. This legal action marks a significant step in seeking accountability from the manufacturers for the tragic crash.</p>

          <p>For the 15th time, the fear of rising living costs has been identified as the greatest concern among Germans, according to an annual study by insurer R+V Versicherung. Despite ongoing global crises, the overall level of fear in Germany has slightly decreased, which researchers suggest could be a sign of adaptation to a state of permanent crisis. Concerns about finances, including tax increases and unaffordable housing, remain prominent, as does the fear of being overwhelmed by immigration. The survey also reflects deep dissatisfaction with politicians, though fears about societal polarization have notably lessened compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>President Trump's persistent public pressure on the Federal Reserve and his recent appointment of a White House economic adviser, Stephen Miran, to its board are fueling concerns about the central bank's political independence. For decades, presidents have avoided publicly directing the Fed, but Trump has openly demanded drastic interest rate cuts. The Fed did cut rates slightly this week, but Miran dissented, favoring a larger cut in line with the president's wishes. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell insists the institution's decisions remain data-driven and apolitical, the administration's actions are seen as an unprecedented test of the central bank's autonomy.

Experts monitoring these campaigns note that foreign actors are spinning the event to fit their own narratives—for instance, Russian media blames Ukraine, while Chinese media uses it to portray U.S. instability. However, the analysis indicates that this content is not gaining significant traction compared to the massive volume of domestically generated discourse. Researchers conclude that the toxic online conversation surrounding the shooting is primarily a home-grown problem.</p>

          <p>The price of beef in the U.S. has surged to an all-time high, driven by a confluence of supply and demand issues. America's beef cattle herd has shrunk to its smallest size in 75 years, largely due to persistent drought and high operational costs for ranchers, which disincentivizes herd expansion. While consumer demand for products like hamburgers and steaks has remained strong for years, recent data suggests shoppers are finally beginning to resist the high prices, with spending on ground beef plateauing. This shift is forcing both restaurants and home consumers to reconsider their purchasing habits and seek alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

However, some policy experts fear the measures are insufficient, as Google's vast data collection still provides a significant advantage.

The move, supported by Republican Governor Bill Lee but not requested by the city's Democratic mayor, replicates a similar deployment in Washington, D.C. Legal experts and civil liberties advocates express concern that using military troops for domestic law enforcement normalizes their presence in non-emergency situations and tests the limits of presidential power.

While prosecutors suggest a motive tied to Kirk's anti-trans rhetoric, extremism researchers argue the act is rooted in a nihilistic, "extremely online" gamer culture focused on the performance of violence rather than a coherent political ideology. The inscrutable, in-joke nature of the messages appears designed to generate discourse and emulate other high-profile killers who have used similar tactics. This suggests the killing may be part of a disturbing trend where the act of violence itself, and the attention it garners, is the primary goal.</p>
