          <p>England's rugby league team experienced a "torture" of a match, losing 26-6 to Australia in the first Ashes game at Wembley in over two decades. Head coach Shaun Wane expressed deep disappointment, citing simple mistakes and wasted chances as key factors in the defeat, rather than being outclassed by the top-ranked Australian side. Australia's Reece Walsh was named player of the match for his pivotal plays, highlighting a significant quality gap that England must address before the next game in Liverpool.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery after ingesting between 80 and 100 small, high-powered magnets he reportedly purchased online. The magnets clamped together inside his digestive system, forming four chains that caused pressure necrosis, or tissue death, in his bowel and large intestine. Doctors successfully removed the magnets, and the teen was discharged after an eight-day hospital stay, highlighting the severe dangers of these powerful magnetic toys.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are observing a shift away from the popular "VOO and chill" investment strategy, where investors passively buy ETFs that track the S&P 500. Experts argue that the index has become imbalanced, with the technology sector accounting for a record 35%, thereby reducing diversification for investors. As a result, traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500 and hitting an all-time high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Polling places have opened for early in-person voting in two closely watched elections: the New York City mayor's race and the New Jersey governor's contest. The New York race features Democrat Zohran Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and independent Andrew Cuomo, while New Jersey voters will choose between Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill. These off-year elections are seen as potential bellwethers for the Democratic party, testing the appeal of progressive versus moderate candidates ahead of future national elections.</p>

The framework was reportedly based on extensive investigations during Xi's tours across China and underwent multiple revisions by the Politburo Standing Committee before its presentation at the party's fourth plenum.</p>
