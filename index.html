          <p>A federal judge is seeking answers regarding the potential deportation of a two-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras alongside her mother and sister. Judge Terry Doughty expressed concerns that the deportation may have occurred without due process. The judge scheduled a hearing for May 16 to investigate the circumstances surrounding the case, particularly focusing on whether the government knowingly deported a U.S. citizen. The Department of Homeland Security stated that the mother chose to take the child with her, a common occurrence in such situations, though the father filed for custody to prevent the deportation.</p>

          <p>Recent polls suggest that American confidence in Donald Trump is waning, even among some Republicans, particularly regarding his handling of key issues. A majority of those surveyed described his second term as "scary," with concerns raised about the economy, immigration policies, and overall priorities. Only a small percentage of independent voters believe Trump is focused on the right issues, and his approval ratings have declined across various sectors. The surveys highlight growing unease among Americans regarding Trump's leadership and policy decisions.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan by the FBI has sparked strong reactions from both Republican and Democratic politicians. Republicans are calling for her removal, alleging she obstructed federal law enforcement, while Democrats criticize the arrest as an overreach of executive power and an attack on judicial independence. The arrest stems from allegations that Dugan helped a man evade immigration officers at her courthouse, leading to accusations of political motivation and weaponization of federal law enforcement.</p>
