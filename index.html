          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before House and Senate committees, defending significant workforce cuts at HHS, which aim to eliminate wasteful spending and focus on chronic diseases. Kennedy outlined budget priorities including mental health, addiction, food safety, and cybersecurity, while also eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion funding. Democratic representatives criticized the cuts, arguing they would lead to loss of life, and questioned Kennedy's views on vaccines amidst a measles outbreak. Kennedy also faced inquiries about his stance on fluoride in drinking water, with a Republican representative expressing concern about the secretary's comments on its effects on children's neurological development.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission proposed weakening environmental conditions tied to agricultural subsidies in response to widespread farmer protests across the EU. These protests were triggered by concerns over EU regulations and cheap imports. The proposed changes aim to reduce the administrative burden on farmers, potentially saving them up to â‚¬1.58 billion annually. Smaller farmers would be exempt from conditions linking subsidies to environmental regulations, and certified organic farms would be considered automatically compliant. The Commission hopes these measures will boost farmers' competitiveness and allow them to focus on food production while protecting natural resources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. drug overdose deaths experienced a significant decline in 2024, with 30,000 fewer deaths compared to the previous year, marking the largest one-year drop ever recorded. Provisional data from the CDC estimates around 80,000 overdose deaths, a 27% decrease from 110,000 in 2023. Experts attribute this decline to increased naloxone availability, expanded addiction treatment, and shifts in drug use patterns. Despite the positive trend, concerns persist that reductions in federal funding could hinder further progress. The Trump administration's view of opioids as primarily a law enforcement issue also worries public health leaders, who advocate for a public health approach focused on support rather than punishment.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming platform back to HBO Max, reversing a decision made just two years prior. This change reflects a shift in strategy towards prioritizing quality content over quantity. The company aims to reach over 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026. The decision comes after the merger of Discovery Communications and WarnerMedia, and the subsequent addition of Discovery+ content. The move echoes similar strategies by competitors like Disney, who are also focusing on quality content to drive streaming success.</p>

          <p>According to a New York Times news analysis, Moscow believes it is gaining ground in Ukraine and intends to negotiate from a position of strength, while Washington sees costly, incremental gains and an unrealistic negotiating position. President Putin and other Russian officials have stated that their forces have the advantage and are close to defeating the Ukrainians. This stance poses a challenge for the Trump administration, as Russian officials are making demands that the battlefield situation doesn't appear to justify, including strict limitations on the Ukrainian military and annexation of territories they have not fully conquered. The article suggests any success in negotiations will hinge on convincing Putin that better relations with the U.S. outweigh the benefits of continued military gains.</p>

The agency will reconsider limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, and a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS. Utilities will receive an additional two years, until 2031, to comply with the standards for PFOA and PFOS. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the agency is committed to protecting Americans from PFOA and PFOS while providing flexibility for compliance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) forecasts exceptionally low river levels in the UK, raising concerns about water supplies for households, farmers, and businesses. This warning follows the driest spring in England since 1961. The Environment Agency has indicated a medium risk of drought and cautioned households about potential water restrictions. Farmers are already being forced to irrigate crops earlier than usual, and there has been an increase in wildfires. The last drought in 2022 led to hosepipe bans affecting millions, highlighting the potential severity of the situation.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have advanced President Trump's tax bill, including trillions in tax breaks, through the Ways and Means Committee. A key point of contention remains the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). The current proposal raises the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, but some lawmakers seek a higher limit. The full House vote is expected soon, but the legislation faces potential changes in the Senate.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates a growing gap between what Americans earn and what they need to maintain a basic standard of living. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that a "minimal quality of life" is out of reach for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. These households, earning an average of $38,000 per year, would need $67,000 to afford essential items, including technology, healthcare, and childcare. The cost of affording a basic level of economic security has doubled since 2001, while median earnings for lower-income earners have fallen.</p>

          <p>Roki Sasaki's placement on the injured list due to a shoulder issue has put the Dodgers in a challenging position. The team's manager, Dave Roberts, downplayed the severity of the injury, attributing Sasaki's underwhelming performance to the shoulder pain. However, the injury raises concerns about a potential chronic problem, as Sasaki has a history of injuries. With several other key pitchers also injured, the Dodgers' rotation is in a state of disrepair, forcing them to rely on younger players and veteran Clayton Kershaw.</p>
