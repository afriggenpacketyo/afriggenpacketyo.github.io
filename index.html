        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the confusion and frustration passengers face due to varying airline baggage rules. One passenger's experience of being charged extra for a bag that was slightly over the size limit highlights the issue. The EU is considering standardizing sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines, with transport ministers proposing a maximum size of 40x30x15cm. Consumer groups argue this proposal doesn't go far enough and object to airlines charging for overhead cabin bags. Airlines maintain their policies comply with the law and allow them to keep fares low, but pressure is mounting for change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK doctors are testing 'poo pills' containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors to combat superbug infections. These pills aim to replace harmful gut bacteria with healthy bacteria, addressing antibiotic resistance, which kills an estimated one million people annually. The focus is on the bowels, which are considered a major reservoir of antibiotic resistance. Early trial data from Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals show promising signals that poo pills can help tackle superbugs and increase the diversity of gut bacteria, which is a sign of good health. This approach represents a shift in understanding the importance of bacteria for overall health.</p>

          <p>Victoria McCloud, a transgender former judge, argues that a recent ruling on gender, which led to updated guidance about shared public spaces, puts trans people at risk. The ruling, defining a woman by biological sex, has resulted in new guidance on access to public facilities like toilets and changing rooms. McCloud fears this could lead to dangerous situations, particularly for trans women in male-only spaces. She plans to challenge the Supreme Court judgement at the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the court did not hear from trans people before its ruling, thus breaching her human rights.</p>

The campaign, running since 2012, aims to improve the Communist Party's image and cut wasteful spending. Analysts suggest it also ensures resources are spent wisely to compete with the United States. The campaign is also seen as a way to identify loyal cadres for promotion.

          <p>The public feud between Elon Musk and President Trump has the potential to create divisions within the Republican Party ahead of the midterm elections. Musk's criticisms of Trump's policies and his departure from the administration have raised concerns among some Republicans. The back-and-forth attacks have reverberated across Washington, D.C., potentially undermining support for Trump's agenda. The situation creates uncertainty for the party and could affect fundraising and voter turnout.</p>

          <p>Dodgers starting pitcher Tony Gonsolin has been placed on the injured list due to discomfort in his surgically repaired right elbow. Gonsolin will undergo an MRI scan to determine the extent of the injury. This move further complicates the Dodgers' pitching situation, as they are already missing several key starters. Right-hander Dustin May is scheduled to start against the Padres, but the team will need to fill Gonsolin's spot in the rotation.</p>
