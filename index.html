          <p>G7 leaders convened in Canada to discuss global trade, grappling with divisions arising from President Trump's tariffs and unilateral approaches. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized the need for cooperation in a divided world, though Trump signaled disagreement with the group's consensus. Discussions encompassed strengthening supply chains for critical minerals and addressing regional affairs, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region where China's increasing military activity raises concerns. The summit concluded with "action-oriented" statements, reflecting the difficulty in achieving consensus on major global issues. Optimism among the leaders at the summit seemed muted given the divisions and the lack of a detailed joint statement.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korea's SK Hynix experienced a surge, reaching over two-decade highs, driven by reports of SK Group's plans to construct the country's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. SK Hynix, a prominent supplier of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), has benefited from the AI boom, with its shares increasing by almost 50% this year. While competitor Samsung has struggled to capitalize on AI-led demand, SK Hynix has emerged as a leader in high bandwidth memory, supplying to clients like Nvidia.

          <p>Prime Minister Ishiba of Japan and President Trump of the U.S. failed to bridge differences on tariffs during their summit, raising doubts about a swift agreement beneficial to Japan's auto sector. Ishiba emphasized that any deal should serve both nations' interests, with ongoing ministerial talks planned to pursue such an agreement. The U.S. granted a 90-day reprieve from tariffs, but Ishiba did not confirm discussions about an extension, as Japan urges the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy aimed at rectifying trade imbalances. The auto sector is a key concern for Japan, given its economic importance and the U.S. market's significance for automakers like Toyota. (not investment advice)</p>

The Dodgers had initially planned to delay Ohtani's pitching return until after the All-Star break, but Ohtani expressed his readiness to pitch sooner, leading to his expedited debut. The team intends to gradually increase Ohtani's workload, with plans for him to pitch as an opener once per week.</p>

          <p>The House of Commons is set to debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. Currently, abortion is illegal in England and Wales but permitted under certain conditions, requiring approval from two doctors. Tonia Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent the investigation, arrest, or prosecution of women who terminate their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals or violent partners involved in illegal abortions. The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children opposes the amendment, viewing it as an "extreme and dangerous proposal."</p>

          <p>The number of Americans aged 55 and older experiencing homelessness is increasing, raising concerns among health workers. Over 140,000 Americans in this age group are homeless on any given day, with projections estimating a near tripling by 2030. Common causes of homelessness include the death of a spouse, divorce, job loss, eviction, and medical issues. Researchers highlight that the aging trend in the homeless population has been ongoing for 30 years, linked to economic challenges faced by the Baby Boomers generation and the impact on healthcare systems.</p>

Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) urges the prioritization of the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which would ban the marketing and sale of nicotine pouches to under 18s.

          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasing its focus on arms exports, driven by security concerns rather than solely profit. This shift aims to deepen ties and enhance interoperability between Japanese forces and allies. By exporting arms, Japan can standardize maintenance processes and create joint training opportunities, which is a key component of the concept of 'proactive contribution to peace.' The move also seeks to develop Japan's defense industrial base, which has been struggling due to reliance on U.S. weapons imports, and improve economies of scale for domestic production.</p>

          <p>Israel attacked Iranian state television and warned residents in Tehran to evacuate following Iranian missile strikes that killed civilians in Israel.

The U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory for Israel to the highest level, and House Speaker Mike Johnson postponed a planned address to Israel's parliament. The conflict has escalated, with both sides exchanging missile attacks and the U.S. deploying additional military capabilities to the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump is cutting his trip to Canada short and returning to Washington due to the situation in the Middle East. The decision follows escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, with both sides trading airstrikes and missile attacks. Trump stated that he had "spoken to everybody" regarding Israel and Iran, and that he believes a deal will be signed. The U.S. is not joining Israel's military offensive, but has helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) is warning that patients who film their medical treatment for TikTok or Instagram could be putting themselves and NHS staff at risk. The trade union's annual conference heard that more patients were videoing their procedures on mobile phones, often without asking permission. This could distract staff or make them feel uncomfortable and anxious, and sharing material on social media also risks publicising the private medical data of other people. The NHS needs policies to address this issue.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have proposed a bill to ban law enforcement officers from concealing their faces while on duty, with exceptions for SWAT teams and medical reasons. The bill aims to increase transparency and accountability following concerns about masked federal officers during immigration raids. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security criticized the proposal, citing safety concerns for officers, while supporters argue that masking shields law enforcement from public scrutiny. The bill also encourages officers to wear identification on their uniforms.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, bringing into force parts of a tariff deal agreed between the two countries last month. The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. The pact, initially agreed last month, is the first that the White House has announced since it imposed wide-ranging tariffs on various goods entering America earlier this year. The deal will come into effect seven days following its official publication.</p>

          <h2>Trump Says Axing Russia from G8 Was a Mistake</h2>

          <p>Donald Trump has told G7 leaders gathered for its summit in Canada that removing Russia from the former G8 was a mistake, and is lobbying for the country to be readmitted. Russia was thrown out of the group after it invaded Crimea in 2014. Trump’s defense of Russian leader Vladimir Putin came a day before he was scheduled to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the fringes of the summit.</p>
