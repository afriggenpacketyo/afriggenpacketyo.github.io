          <p>DNA tests have confirmed a 48-year-old man is the 140th "stolen grandchild" identified by the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo activist group in Argentina. He was born in a clandestine detention center in 1977 after his parents, left-wing activists, were "disappeared" by the military dictatorship. His older sister, who has been searching for him, expressed immense joy at the discovery. The case highlights the ongoing struggle for justice and identity for the estimated 500 infants stolen during the regime's "dirty war."</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is investigating an incident where an "unknown actor" used artificial intelligence to impersonate Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The imposter created a fake Signal account and used an AI-generated voice to contact at least five individuals, including three foreign ministers, a U.S. governor, and a member of Congress. A department cable revealed the actor left voicemails in an attempt to manipulate officials and gain access to information. The incident highlights the growing cybersecurity threat posed by sophisticated AI-driven impersonation tactics.</p>

          <p>A recently signed legislative package includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which will have significant financial implications for the pharmaceutical industry. While the overall impact is seen as a marginal negative, some companies are more vulnerable than others due to their reliance on the program. According to analysis, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Gilead Sciences have the highest exposure, with Medicaid accounting for 25% and 22% of their U.S. revenue, respectively. The financial effects on drugmakers are not expected to materialize until 2027, after the 2026 midterm elections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that many Americans, particularly younger generations, are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their finances based on feelings about the economy. This anxiety is fueling a shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending" to "revenge saving," as consumers look to build emergency funds amid uncertainty. Financial experts advise against letting emotions drive these habits, instead recommending intentional strategies. They suggest taking a "money temperature" to assess finances, using "reverse budgeting" to prioritize savings, and automating contributions to appropriate accounts to build wealth systematically.

          <h2>Global Survey Finds US More Often Seen as Both Top Ally and Top Threat Than China</h2>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center survey across 25 middle- and high-income nations reveals a complex global perception of the United States. In the poll, the U.S. was more frequently named as the most important ally compared to China. However, the U.S. was also more likely to be cited as the greatest threat. In eight countries, including Canada and South Africa, the U.S. was the most commonly mentioned threat, whereas China was named the top threat in only three countries. This highlights the dual role the U.S. plays in international opinion as both a key partner and a source of instability.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, has put forward a bill that would reform the country's military service. The plan aims to make voluntary service more attractive but also includes a provision allowing the government to call up conscripts if a defense situation requires it. This move is seen as a compromise, as compulsory military service was suspended in 2011 but calls for its return have grown due to the changed security landscape in Europe. The proposal comes as Germany seeks to expand its armed forces to meet new NATO guidelines in response to Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, conspiracy theories blaming the disaster on "cloud seeding" have circulated on social media, amplified by some political figures. However, meteorological experts have unequivocally debunked these claims as false. Scientists explain that cloud seeding cannot create massive storm systems and that any particles from recent operations would have dispersed long before the storm. The article clarifies that the flooding was caused by a convergence of natural weather phenomena and that such extreme rainfall events are expected to become more common due to climate change.</p>

          <p>Kenya is experiencing continued unrest after another round of deadly anti-government protests, with businesses remaining closed and roadblocks in place in several cities.

The government's response has been criticized as authoritarian, with over 560 people arrested during the recent Saba Saba Day demonstrations.

A police search uncovered a significant cache of explosive devices, 83 firearms, and thousands of rounds of ammunition.

The court found "reasonable grounds" to believe they have committed the crime against humanity of persecution through their systematic and severe restrictions on the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan. Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban has barred girls from secondary education and women from most jobs. The warrants are a significant step in holding the regime accountable for what the UN has termed "gender apartheid."</p>
