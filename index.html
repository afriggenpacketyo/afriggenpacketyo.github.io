        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German start-up Proxima Fusion has raised $148 million in a Series A funding round, the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date, with the goal of developing the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant. Investors Cherry Ventures and Balderton Capital co-led the round, expressing optimism about the technology's potential role in the energy transition. Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, involves jamming together two hydrogen atoms to form one helium atom, releasing massive amounts of power. Proxima Fusion's CEO, Francesco Sciortino, believes nuclear fusion is the "ultimate" source of clean energy and "inevitable" for humanity, with the funding enabling the company to pursue its goals for the next few years. The successful replication of nuclear fusion at an industrial scale could provide virtually limitless clean, safe, and affordable energy. </p>

          <p>Seventeen police officers were injured during a second night of violence in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault. Protesters threw petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks at police, resulting in five arrests and a total of 32 officers injured over two nights. Riot officers used baton rounds and a water cannon to disperse the crowds, as cars were set on fire and houses were damaged. PSNI Chief Constable Jon Boutcher condemned the violence and highlighted the critical underfunding of the police force. Sinn FÃ©in First Minister Michelle O'Neill denounced the disorder as abhorrent, and urged for an immediate end to the violence. </p>

She accused China of being the "main enabler" of Russia by providing exports that contribute to its missile program. BraÅ¾e also highlighted the importance of strengthening Ukraineâ€™s ability to defend itself, calling Ukraine the "strongest deterrent of Russia's aggression."

          <p>China's military has accused Japan of undermining regional security by testing new long-range anti-ship and hypersonic missiles. A commentary in the People's Liberation Army Daily stated that the extended range of these missiles poses a significant deterrent to surrounding areas. The article argued that Japan's increased ability to strike long-range targets violates the restrictions of its pacifist constitution, which prohibits offensive weapons. The missile tests were conducted as part of an annual live-fire drill near Mount Fuji, with the upgraded missiles planned for deployment in Kyushu and Hokkaido. China views Japan's actions as a move towards "first strike capabilities" under the guise of building "counter strike capabilities."</p>

          <p>Climate.gov, a major U.S. government website providing public education on climate science, is likely to be shut down after almost all of its content production staff were fired. Former staff members believe the changes were targeted by political appointees within the Trump administration to restrict public-facing climate information. The website receives hundreds of thousands of visits per month and is a key source of information about climate science. There are concerns that the administration may co-opt climate.gov to publish anti-science content or misinformation, potentially undermining public education on climate change and related environmental issues. The cuts also impact the website's social media presence, which was used to combat misinformation. </p>

          <p>iFlytek, a Chinese voice recognition solution provider, reports that using mainland-produced semiconductors extends the development time of artificial intelligence (AI) models by three months. Chairman Liu Qingfeng stated that this delay is due to the need for additional computing resources compared to using Nvidia chips. iFlytek is reportedly the only Chinese AI model developer that insists on using domestic chips, including Huawei's Ascend 910B, to mitigate the risk of losing access to imported chips. The company has been barred from purchasing advanced U.S. chips since being added to the U.S. Entity List in 2019. Despite the delays, iFlytek remains committed to using local chips and improving development processes, with the training efficiency of the Ascend 910B having increased significantly. </p>

          <p>A columnist argues that President Trump detests the immigrant communities that define downtown Los Angeles, viewing them as a sign of urban decay. The author contrasts this view with the reality of Little Tokyo, where immigrants are actively cleaning up after protests and contributing to the community. The column highlights the fear and resilience of immigrant workers in the face of potential raids, and criticizes Trump's rhetoric for echoing the dark days of Japanese American internment. The author celebrates the diverse ethnicities and cultures that make L.A. a vibrant and welcoming city for immigrants. </p>

          <p>A Dads' Group in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, provides a community support model for fathers and father figures, addressing the isolation that can accompany modern parenting. The free biweekly sessions offer a space for dads to share experiences, build emotional muscles, and receive care traditionally offered to mothers. The meetings are casual and small, operating on a drop-in basis, and take place in PlayLab's indoor play space, where children can play while dads engage in discussions. The group aims to soften the sharp edges of fatherhood and foster connections among dads, promoting vulnerability and support. </p>

          <p>A contributor argues that fossil fuel companies could face homicide prosecutions for deaths caused by unnatural heat waves linked to climate change. The author suggests that if these companies knew they were likely creating lethal climate harms, homicide charges may be appropriate. Proving causation would require linking deaths to heat, attributing the heat wave to human-caused climate change, and demonstrating that fossil fuel companies were the primary drivers of greenhouse gas emissions. The author emphasizes the need for accountability for reckless killing, advocating for a combination of civil and criminal enforcement to deter future crimes and ensure public safety. </p>

          <p>Following four days of escalating protests in downtown L.A. related to immigration issues, Mayor Karen Bass imposed a regional curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. The curfew is in effect across most of downtown Los Angeles, with limited exceptions for residents, workers, media, and emergency personnel. The curfew aims to curb the actions of "bad actors who do not support the immigrant community," with strict enforcement and arrests for violations. The protests began in response to the Trump administrationâ€™s immigration crackdown in Southern California, escalating into violence, theft, graffiti, and property destruction. Similar curfews were implemented in L.A. during the 2020 protests following George Floydâ€™s murder. </p>

          <p>Homeowners are saving on insurance by upgrading their houses against disasters, with states developing insurance discount programs modeled after Alabama's. Alabama's program encourages homeowners to strengthen their houses against disasters, such as using stronger building materials to withstand storms. Homeowners can qualify for discounts of 20% to 35% off the wind portion of their insurance by meeting the FORTIFIED Roof standard. While such programs are newer in states like California, they offer smaller discounts, often less than 10%, for fire-proofing homes. Disaster experts emphasize the importance of retrofitting homes to withstand extreme weather, with insurance companies taking this into account when offering coverage. </p>

          <p>Proposed changes driven by Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" and other regulations could undermine access to Obamacare, potentially causing millions to lose coverage by 2034. The House-passed bill would end automatic re-enrollment, requiring policyholders to provide annual documentation to receive tax credits. This could delay access to tax credits for some enrollees, potentially raising the cost of their insurance. Other changes include ending provisional eligibility for tax credits and shortening the ACA open enrollment period. Enhanced tax credits created during the pandemic are set to expire, which would lead to higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs for many enrollees. </p>

          <p>Seattle is striving to balance the need for increased housing density with the preservation of trees to address climate change impacts. A new state law requires more housing density, but the city is working to ensure trees are not sacrificed in the process. The Bryant Heights development exemplifies this approach, integrating 86 housing units while preserving over 30 trees. Preserving trees requires extra negotiations with the city, such as proving new construction will not harm them and using porous concrete for walkways to allow water to reach the roots. Despite efforts to preserve the urban canopy, Seattle's tree coverage has slightly decreased, prompting the city to plant more trees in parks and require care for newly planted trees. </p>
