        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a decline after Warren Buffett revealed his plans to step down as CEO, naming Greg Abel as his successor, and the company reported a drop in earnings. Buffett, at 94, will transition out of the CEO role on January 1, 2026, remaining as chairman to mentor Abel. Investors are processing the implications of this leadership change, though analysts believe Buffett's continued involvement will provide stability during the transition. The company's Class A shares fell nearly 4%, reflecting market uncertainty despite Berkshire's recent peak performance.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed global business leaders at the Milken Institute Global Conference, encouraging them to increase investment in the United States despite concerns over the Trump administration's trade policies.

He framed tariffs as a strategy to incentivize direct investment in the U.S., assuring investors of a favorable tax and regulatory environment.

          <p>The Trump administration has resumed collection activity on federal student loans in default, ending a five-year pause, which is expected to significantly impact millions of borrowers. This resumption coincides with changes to repayment plans and staff reductions at the Education Department, leading to long wait times for borrowers seeking assistance. Experts warn that borrowers in default may see their credit scores decline, with some facing a drop of up to 175 points, especially those with previously high credit scores. The article underscores the challenges borrowers face as they navigate the complex student loan system amid these policy shifts.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed that Donald Trump's proposed 100% tariff on foreign-made films will be part of ongoing trade negotiations with the US. This announcement has sparked concern among UK filmmakers, who fear potential job losses for freelancers if US productions are pulled from the UK. Industry leaders are seeking clarity on whether the tariffs will affect only British films exported to the US or also co-productions. The UK film sector, which contributes significantly to the economy and employs many skilled freelancers, faces uncertainty as the details of Trump's plans remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Footwear company Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, marking the end of its public trading after nearly three decades. The acquisition, representing a 30% premium, occurs during a challenging period for the retail industry, particularly the footwear sector, which is affected by discretionary spending and global trade uncertainties. While Skechers withdrew its full-year guidance due to macroeconomic factors, 3G Capital remains optimistic about the company's long-term growth potential.

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA, citing ongoing disruptions at Newark Airport and broader issues affecting the East Coast. Schumer attributes the problems to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, budget cuts, and outdated technology. He highlighted the FAA's decision to offer bonuses to air traffic controllers at select towers, excluding those in Washington, Philadelphia, and New York, which he deems illogical given their critical needs. With Newark Airport facing significant operational disruptions and potential summer challenges, Schumer warns of similar problems for other airports nationwide if these issues remain unresolved.</p>

While Senator Lisa Murkowski advocates for preserving the tax credits to support renewable energy infrastructure, other Republicans seek to eliminate them to fund Trump's agenda.

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on movies made outside the United States has drawn criticism for its xenophobic undertones and potential economic consequences. The move, framed as a measure to protect national security, lacks clarity regarding its application to US-produced films shot abroad versus foreign films distributed in the US. Critics argue that the tariff could harm the film industry by disrupting international co-productions and limiting access to diverse filming locations.

The Community Notes system relies on algorithms to surface annotations that achieve consensus among diverse users.

          <p>President Trump is considering declaring a national emergency to impose a 100% tariff on foreign movies, citing concerns about the decline of Hollywood. This move follows a pattern of Trump using emergency declarations to bypass Congress and implement policies quickly. The potential action has raised questions about its impact on the film industry, particularly companies like Netflix and Disney that rely on international productions. Trump's focus on Hollywood also intersects with his contentious relationships with Canada and California, key locations for film and television productions.</p>

          <p>A European Central Bank study reveals a growing trend of European consumers actively avoiding U.S. products and services due to President Trump's trade war. Despite a temporary truce, the 10 percent base-line tariff remains in place, and Europeans are increasingly wary of America's treatment of its allies. Consumers are seeking alternatives to American brands, even if it means paying more, signaling a potential long-term shift in consumer preferences. This trend is reflected in the development of apps that identify American products and the cancellation of subscriptions to U.S. streaming services.</p>
