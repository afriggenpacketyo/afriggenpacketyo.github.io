          <p>An Austrian court has overturned the perjury conviction of former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who had previously received an eight-month suspended jail sentence for giving false testimony to a parliamentary inquiry. The three-judge panel acquitted Kurz, who was once a rising star among European conservatives and twice headed a governing coalition in Austria. This decision marks a significant turn in the legal proceedings that have shadowed Kurz's political career, potentially paving the way for a future return to public life.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine exchanged drone and missile attacks, despite President Trump's criticism of both Putin and Zelenskyy, signaling his frustration at being unable to end the three-year-old invasion. Ukrainian officials reported engaging targets across the country, with Russia launching 364 "air attack vehicles," while Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have downed 128 Ukrainian drones. Trump rebuked Putin for the ongoing violence and also attacked Zelenskyy for causing problems with his rhetoric, as both sides continue to exchange strikes without a clear path to a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," which challenged the myth of widespread French resistance during the Nazi occupation, has died at the age of 97. His landmark film, originally banned from French television, interviewed ordinary citizens of Clermont-Ferrand to reveal the complex and often uncomfortable truths about collaboration and resistance during World War II. Ophuls went on to direct other notable documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "HÃ´tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," leaving behind a legacy of incisive and thought-provoking historical analysis.</p>

The early arrival of the monsoon, which provides nearly 70% of India's required rain, is crucial for the country's farmers and the recharge of aquifers and reservoirs.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker BYD experienced a significant drop after the company announced price cuts on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models. Investors are assessing the impact of these price reductions, which are aimed at boosting sales amidst growing competition in the EV sector. While analysts expect a spike in dealership foot traffic, concerns remain about the potential for a price war and its effect on the profitability of BYD and other Chinese automakers (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Octopus Energy has apologized to a Hartlebury man, Peter Holden, for relentlessly pursuing him for nearly four years over another person's gas bill of more than Â£6,000. Despite Holden repeatedly alerting the firm to the error, he was sent monthly bills and chased by debt collectors due to an industry data error. The firm's commercial director personally apologized and promised further training for staff to prevent similar mistakes in the future.</p>
