        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Defense Department spent over $21 million on 46 flights to Guantanamo Bay between January 20 and April 8 in support of migrant deportation efforts, according to data sent to Congress. These flights, averaging $26,277 per flight hour, were part of the Trump administration's plan to use Guantanamo Bay as a holding site for migrants, including non-criminal detainees. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the expenditure as a waste of military resources for political stunts, while the administration maintained the facility was necessary for managing high-threat and low-risk detainees. The flights transferred Venezuelan migrants to the facility before they were taken to Honduras.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced significant flight delays on Monday due to a shortage in air traffic control staffing, with incoming flights delayed by over an hour and 40 minutes. The FAA issued an advisory for delays from all U.S. airports and some in Canada, but few flights were canceled. This incident follows recent radar and telecommunications malfunctions at the airport, one of the nation's busiest hubs, and the Transportation Secretary plans to slow flights to address these issues. The Trump administration has promised to install new fiber-optic cables connecting the airport to a facility in Philadelphia.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas in Gaza since October 7, 2023, was released on Monday after successful negotiations between the U.S. and Hamas. The International Committee of the Red Cross transferred Alexander to Israeli authorities, and he spoke with his mother by phone from the Israel Defense Forces convoy. Israeli security officials implemented a temporary pause in combat, airstrikes, and aerial reconnaissance in the area of Gaza where Alexander was released. The release is viewed as a goodwill gesture toward the Trump administration and a potential opening to jumpstart talks surrounding the broader conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce the prices of key medicines in the United States, but the order cites no clear legal authority to mandate lower prices. The order suggests potential regulatory actions or importing drugs from other countries if drugmakers do not comply. This action came shortly after House Republicans proposed health care policy changes that would cut Medicaid and Obamacare marketplaces, potentially leaving millions uninsured. Trump criticized European countries for negotiating lower drug prices and threatened to use trade policy to push them to pay more.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer cautioned investors against impulsively buying into Monday's market rally, triggered by a U.S.-China agreement to cut tariffs. He advised that investors should be careful because even strong companies could be negatively affected by selling pressure, saying that raising cash is essential during rallies, but spending it is prohibited. The agreement, which temporarily cuts tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 10% for 90 days, boosted stocks, but Cramer emphasized the importance of monitoring trade talks closely. He cited Stanley Black & Decker and Best Buy as examples of stocks that still face tariff problems despite the relief rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that he expects to meet with Chinese officials again in the coming weeks to continue trade negotiations, following a 90-day pause on tariffs.

Bessent noted that the agreement provides a mechanism to avoid upward tariff pressure and that the Chinese are now serious about assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of precursor drugs.

The cell, directed by alleged Russian agent Jan Marsalek, operated across borders in the U.K., Austria, Spain, Germany, and Montenegro, targeting individuals and places of interest to the Russian state. The spies, motivated by money, discussed using one of the members as a "honeytrap" and dropping pigs blood on the Kazakhstan embassy in London by drone.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration's trade policies, including tariffs, are a scam designed to redistribute wealth from the poor to the rich while maximizing presidential power. Tariffs, which can be imposed and waived unilaterally by the president, disproportionately affect low-income families and small businesses. The administration's fiscal plans, including tax cuts for the wealthy and reduced tax enforcement, exacerbate the trade deficit and increase federal debt. The author asserts that the focus on trade deals with Britain and China distracts from the real goal of fiscal redistribution and the expansion of presidential authority.</p>

South Africa disputes these claims, stating there is no persecution of white Afrikaner South Africans.

          <p>The UK government's immigration plan faces several challenges, including reducing overall numbers while addressing labor market gaps, particularly in social care. While tightening rules for work visas and overseas students, the plan aims to attract high-skilled individuals and reduce reliance on cheap overseas labor. However, economists disagree on the impact of immigration on economic growth, and care providers worry about filling vacant posts without overseas recruitment. The government's proposals could lead to higher training costs, increased taxes, or contentious decisions regarding university funding and domestic student tuition fees.</p>

Unlike most other hostages, Alexander was released without a formally announced cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, highlighting the failure of efforts to secure a broader truce between the two sides. Relatives of hostages still in Gaza expressed mixed feelings, hoping that Trump's involvement would lead to a broader deal.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is urging cities and counties to clear and effectively ban homeless encampments, intensifying a crackdown on homelessness in the state. Newsom announced a new model ordinance to address persistent camps, aiming to reduce visible signs of the crisis, along with $3.3 billion in funding for housing and drug treatment programs. The move follows a US Supreme Court ruling that cities can criminalize unhoused people for sleeping outside even without available shelter spaces. The model ordinance includes provisions for banning persistent camping, blocking sidewalks, and requiring local officials to provide notice and offer shelter before clearing an encampment.</p>

During his time as mayor, Newark experienced a revitalized downtown with new construction and new homes, though problems such as high poverty rates persisted. His career was marked by both significant redevelopment projects and a corruption scandal that led to his imprisonment.</p>

The administration threatens to directly tie drug prices paid by government programs like Medicare to those paid in other countries if drugmakers don't comply voluntarily. Trump stated the U.S. has been subsidizing other countries by paying higher prices and said drugmakers would have to cut their U.S. prices or face consequences.

The Wallabies have typically prioritized players from domestic teams or those committed to returning to play in the country. However, coach Schmidt indicated that the strength of the Lions squad might necessitate a more flexible approach with overseas talent.</p>
