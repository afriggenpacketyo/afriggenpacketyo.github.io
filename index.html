          <p>The Great Salt Lake is facing an environmental crisis as its water levels have significantly decreased, leading to potential public health and economic consequences for Utah and beyond. The state has initiated measures to reverse the lake's decline, but critics argue that the efforts are insufficient and slow-paced. Agriculture, particularly alfalfa farming, and real estate development contribute significantly to water consumption, creating tension between economic priorities and environmental needs. While some farmers are hesitant to lease water rights, efforts are being made to incentivize water conservation and track leased water to ensure it reaches the lake, highlighting the complex challenges in balancing economic interests and ecological preservation.

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to coordinate with a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. The practice, known as red-boxing, involves posting strategic information publicly for big money groups to utilize, circumventing direct communication restrictions. Cuomo's website included polling data, pre-edited video clips, and specific instructions for ad campaigns targeting Jewish, Black, and Latino voters. If found in violation, Cuomo could face penalties and lose public matching funds, raising questions about the ethics and legality of campaign coordination tactics.</p>

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council called the offer a "cruel bit of deception." Meanwhile, the White House is considering options to protect the US film industry, following President Trump's announcement of a 10% tariff on movies produced outside the US, which triggered a drop in production company shares.

The lawsuit alleges that Trump's presidential memorandum revoking the clearances of Zaid and others is a violation of First and Fifth Amendment rights. Zaid's attorneys suspect he came onto Trump's radar after representing a whistleblower in 2019, leading to Trump's first impeachment.</p>

Facial reconstruction specialist Emese GÃ¡bor found a high degree of morphological similarity between the unknown skull and that of Corvinus' son, JÃ¡nos Corvinus. The greenish discoloration on the bone surface suggests the presence of a metal crown, while the skull's physical features align with what is known about Corvinus' age and height. Researchers plan further studies, including genomic and DNA analyses, to confirm the skull's identity.</p>

Created in 2018, the site was a prominent marketplace for deepfake porn of celebrities and individuals, allowing users to upload, view, and buy custom nonconsensual content. The shutdown follows the passage of the "Take It Down Act," which makes posting nonconsensual sexual imagery a federal crime.

          <p>President Trump has seemingly disengaged from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, potentially giving Prime Minister Netanyahu a free hand to escalate actions in Gaza. Despite earlier promises to end the war, Trump's administration has grown distracted, leading to concerns about a potential humanitarian crisis. While Trump has expressed some concern for Gaza's population, his attention has been sporadic, and he may be tolerant of Israel's use of force. The shift in focus is evident in the portfolio of Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, who is now juggling multiple missions, including addressing Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>India is grappling with concerns over Chinese "dumping" of goods, particularly viscose yarn, as trade tensions with the Trump administration escalate. Cheaper Chinese imports are slowing demand for locally made products, impacting spinning mills in southern India. While China's Ambassador to India has assured that his country will not engage in dumping, anxieties persist across various sectors. India's trade ministry has established a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with investigations underway in multiple sectors.</p>

          <p>A fatal plane crash in Simi Valley, involving a kit-built aircraft, has raised questions about the safety and regulation of such experimental planes. The crash, the second in five months involving that model, killed two passengers and a dog. Kit planes are popular due to their lower cost and customization options, but the FAA requires builders to complete test flights before carrying passengers. The NTSB is investigating the cause of the crash, which has renewed scrutiny of the oversight and safety measures for amateur-built aircraft.</p>

Experts say that the demographic divide among Americans on the topic of Israel may eventually lead to reduced real-world support for the country, with weaker diplomatic ties and reduced military aid.
