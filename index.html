          <p>A 911 call has been released detailing a medical emergency experienced by Gregg Popovich at a San Antonio restaurant last month, where he reportedly fainted and was described as "not responding." The now-former San Antonio Spurs head coach, who had previously recovered from a stroke, was taken to the hospital and was alert by the time he entered the ambulance. Shortly after this incident, Popovich announced his retirement, transitioning to the role of president of basketball operations. His career spanned nearly three decades, during which he led the Spurs to five NBA Championships and earned a place in the Hall of Fame in 2023.</p>

          <p>An upcoming Spending Review in the UK is expected to reveal significant budget cuts across government departments, with health and defense prioritized. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is in discussions with Cabinet ministers to set government budgets through 2029, leading to tensions over resource allocation. While overall government spending has increased due to tax rises, some departments face potential cuts to day-to-day spending, potentially endangering public services. The review is anticipated to focus on capital spending for infrastructure projects, while departments reliant on daily operational funding, such as police and education, may experience financial strain.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed tax bill could jeopardize the U.S. clean energy boom by terminating key tax credits that have supported solar and battery storage projects. This legislation would effectively undo parts of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, potentially leading to job losses and increased electricity costs. Companies have invested billions in clean energy projects since the IRA's passage, but the proposed changes could significantly slow down the deployment of clean energy to the grid.

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, marking a significant advancement in underwater communication. The team, led by Professor He Chengbing, developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior seabed knowledge. This breakthrough could pave the way for real-world applications in long-range undersea messaging, with potential civilian and military uses. The technology overcomes challenges such as signal scattering, Doppler shifts, and ambient noise, enabling reliable communication over vast distances.</p>
