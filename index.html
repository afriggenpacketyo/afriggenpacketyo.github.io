          <p>Oakland Athletics pitcher Luis Severino has been vocal about his dislike for the team's temporary home, a minor-league ballpark in Sacramento, comparing home games to "a spring training game." In response to his blunt complaints, a report suggests the team "can't wait" to trade him before the July 31 deadline. Severino has stood by his comments, stating he was being honest and that his teammates feel similarly about the subpar facility. His performance statistics reflect his preference, with a significantly lower ERA in road games compared to his struggles at the temporary home field.</p>

          <p>A North Carolina detention officer, 56-year-old Francisco Flattes, was shot and killed after a federal inmate, Kelvin Simmons, seized his weapon during a scuffle at a medical facility. Simmons, who was being treated for foot pain, was being escorted by two officers due to a prior escape attempt. After the shooting, the inmate carjacked a vehicle and fled but was later apprehended and now faces a first-degree murder charge.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, can help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine works by inhibiting an enzyme called TBK1, which in turn prevents inflammation and aging in multiple organs. This finding provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The discovery could lead to new anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise on the body.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident in the Los Angeles River resulted in the death of one adult and a dog after a group of three adults and a child fell into the water. The event occurred near a low head dam in Long Beach, a structure often called a "drowning machine" due to the dangerous rotational currents it can create. Fire department crews rescued three of the individuals, with one adult and a four-year-old child being transported to a trauma center for treatment. The exact cause of the fall remains unknown, and officials noted the river's current was not particularly strong at the time.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has abruptly canceled two pandemic-era grant programs that provided about $1 billion for food banks and schools to buy produce from local farmers. This decision has left food aid organizations struggling to serve vulnerable populations, including children and seniors in food deserts. The cuts also have a significant downstream effect on small farmers who had expanded their operations to meet the demand created by the programs. With food insecurity still a major issue, advocates warn these cuts could severely impact communities that rely on these networks for access to fresh, healthy food.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a "vote-a-rama," an extended series of amendment votes, on President Trump's major tax and spending bill, titled the "One Big, Beautiful Bill." Republicans are pushing to pass the legislation before a self-imposed July 4 deadline, using the budget reconciliation process to bypass the need for Democratic support. The bill, which passed the House narrowly, includes increased spending on defense and border security offset by cuts to social programs like healthcare and nutrition.

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made moves in NBA free agency, agreeing to a two-year, $12 million deal with forward Jake LaRavia. This signing came shortly after the team lost a key role player, Dorian Finney-Smith, who opted out of his contract and signed a four-year, $53 million deal with the Houston Rockets. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing, provides shooting for the Lakers, having shot over 42% from three-point range last season with Memphis and Sacramento. Finney-Smith was a versatile defender and contributor for the Lakers, valued by new coach JJ Redick.</p>

Campaigners have welcomed the review, calling it the "best chance in a generation" to modernize a system that many find inadequate and unaffordable. The review will examine statutory pay rates, which have been criticized as too low, and the low uptake of shared parental leave. The goal is to create a system that better supports working families, though some express concern about potential costs for employers.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. military policy implemented by the Trump administration effectively bans transgender individuals from serving, forcing many into what they describe as "survival mode." The policy, which removes nearly all exceptions for those already serving, deems a history of gender dysphoria incompatible with military standards. This article follows two transgender officers, Army Major Kara Corcoran and Navy Lt. Rae Timberlake, as they navigate the directive, which could lead to their involuntary separation and loss of career and benefits. Critics have labeled the ban discriminatory, while supporters argue it upholds necessary military standards.</p>

The request comes as the state faces a critical fire season with its specialized National Guard firefighting unit staffed at only 40% capacity. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization of the troops for immigration-related unrest, supports the move, urging the president to "stop the political theater."

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing market trends by favoring companies with bold, innovative ideas over established giants. He argues these investors are rewarding companies like Robinhood and Reddit for their disruptive potential, while punishing more traditional firms like Apple for what they perceive as a lack of new ideas. Cramer suggests the market is shifting from being dominated by institutional investors focused on the Federal Reserve to an "idea market" driven by individual stocks and powerful narratives. He believes this new wave of investors is less concerned with traditional metrics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests that practical and logistical obstacles, rather than vaccine hesitancy, are a primary reason for falling childhood vaccination rates in the UK. Parents face difficulties such as booking appointments, getting time off work, and accessing clear information about their child's vaccination status. This decline has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough, with no childhood vaccine currently meeting the WHO's 95% coverage target.

          <p>This article examines the divisive approach of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the new U.S. Health Secretary, whose mission is to tackle America's "epidemic of chronic illness." While his focus on issues like processed foods and environmental toxins has gained some support, he remains a deeply controversial figure due to his history of promoting unfounded health conspiracies, particularly regarding vaccines. Kennedy has already targeted food additives and dismantled the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, actions praised by his supporters as anti-corruption but condemned by many in the scientific community as dangerous. The piece questions whether his revolutionary zeal will ultimately improve or harm public health.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not yet observed significant price increases for consumers resulting from U.S. tariffs on foreign imports. He attributed this stability to mitigation strategies, including Amazon and its third-party sellers making forward purchases of inventory before the tariffs took full effect. Jassy also discussed the transformative power of artificial intelligence, calling it the "most transformative technology of our lifetime" and confirming Amazon is leaning into it. He predicted that most consumers will have robots in their homes within the next decade, powered by advanced personal assistants like Alexa.</p>

          <p>Energy prices for millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales are set to decrease by 7% due to the latest price cap from regulator Ofgem. While this provides some immediate relief, analysts express concern that bills remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels and may not fall much further. Future prices are uncertain, with geopolitical instability potentially impacting wholesale costs and leading to higher bills again in the winter. Ofgem is encouraging consumers to shop around for fixed-rate deals, which could offer more certainty and potentially save households hundreds of pounds annually. (not investment advice)</p>

The show's finale, which sees the protagonist Gi-hun sacrifice himself, has polarized audiences. Some viewers found the character's altruism to be unrealistic and at odds with the show's dark portrayal of human nature, while others saw it as a powerful, if uncomfortable, message about kindness prevailing against all odds. The show's creator acknowledged the mixed reactions, attributing them to the sky-high expectations set by the first season.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments over the Trump administration's controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of gang ties. The administration invoked the wartime law by labeling the Tren de Aragua gang a "hybrid criminal state," a move the ACLU argues is an overreach of a law intended only for major military conflicts. The judges appeared focused on whether they have the authority to overrule a president's determination of an armed conflict. The administration defended its position, citing FBI intelligence about the gang's control and potential for violence within the U.S.</p>
