          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, comprising 78 articles, to support and protect the country’s private sector. The law, effective from May 20, aims to foster fair market competition, improve the investment and financing landscape, and encourage private firms to engage in scientific projects and technological innovation. Chinese leaders hope this new law will boost morale for private businesses amidst the ongoing trade war with the US, where domestic dynamism is needed to ensure economic growth. The law's drafting began in 2024, led by the National Development and Reform Commission, with a public feedback period in October.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders modifying tariffs for carmakers, removing some levies that Ford, General Motors, and others complained would backfire by raising production costs and squeezing profits. Automakers paying a 25% tariff on auto imports will not be subject to other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum, or on certain imports from Canada and Mexico. Carmakers can also qualify for tariff relief for a portion of their imported component costs, phased out over two years. Trump stated he was showing “a little flexibility” but wanted components made in the United States. The move aims to reduce the industry’s reliance on foreign manufacturing and encourage domestic production.</p>

          <p>In Newark, Delaware, suspects in an unreturned U-Haul rental van fled from police, resulting in a crash that killed one pedestrian and injured several others. Officers initially spotted the van, reported as an unauthorized use vehicle, parked on the street. As officers attempted to apprehend the suspects, they fled in the van, striking a police vehicle and two pedestrians before crashing into multiple parked cars. One pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene, while another sustained serious injuries, and three others were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

          <p>Paramount Global is entering mediation to resolve President Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit regarding a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The board has agreed on parameters for a potential settlement to move forward with its sale to Skydance Media. Trump alleges CBS deceptively edited the interview to support Harris's election chances, initially seeking $20 billion in damages. Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder, is pushing for a settlement to facilitate the Skydance deal, causing internal protests. Bill Owens, executive producer of “60 Minutes,” resigned due to corporate pressure over coverage.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly supported legislation to increase the penalty to a felony for soliciting a 16- or 17-year-old for sex. This stance puts him at odds with some Democrats in the state Assembly who weakened the bill by removing the felony charge. Newsom stated that the law should treat all sex predators who solicit minors the same, regardless of the victim's age. The bill aims to criminalize loitering with intent to buy sex and build on existing state law, which already makes it a felony to pay for sex with a minor under 16 and for sex trafficking a minor under 18.</p>

          <p>Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are dropping sharply due to the Trump administration's steep tariffs, leading retailers to warn about impending supply shortages. U.S. import duties on Chinese products are as high as 145%, while China has retaliated with 125% tariffs on U.S. products. The Port of Los Angeles is already experiencing a slowdown in cargo flow, with shipments down 10% compared to last year. Retailers had previously rushed to import goods ahead of the tariffs, but now many shipments have ceased. Economists warn of potential empty shelves and COVID-like shortages for consumers, as retailers may have sufficient inventory only for a couple of months.</p>

Areas such as healthcare and flood defenses remain poorly prepared, with only a few of the assessed areas showing good plans and policies for the future.

          <p>Rodney Scott, President Trump’s nominee to lead Customs and Border Protection (CBP), faces accusations of orchestrating a “cover-up” related to the 2010 death of Anastasio Hernández Rojas, who died after being beaten and tased by CBP agents. James Wong, a former CBP official, alleges that Scott, then a top Border Patrol official, oversaw a critical incident team (CIT) that aimed to mitigate liability and present Border Patrol in the best light. Wong claims the CIT unlawfully obtained Hernández Rojas’s medical records to spin information for public relations purposes, disqualifying Scott from leading CBP.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order softening some automotive tariffs his administration put into place earlier this month. Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports that had resulted from separate levies. Additional 25% tariffs on auto parts set to start by May 3 will still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years. Trump stated the administration will "slaughter them if they don't" bring the parts back to the U.S.</p>
