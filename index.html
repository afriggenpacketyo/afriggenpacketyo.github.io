          <h2>Trump Administration Eases Tariff Impact on US Automakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 13:41:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to announce measures easing the impact of tariffs on US car manufacturers, a move welcomed by industry leaders. The changes include reducing import duties on parts used in US-made vehicles, though cars made outside the country will still be subject to tariffs. This decision comes after concerns from industry groups about the potential for higher car prices and lower sales due to tariffs. Ford, GM, and Stellantis have expressed gratitude for Trump's support and look forward to continued collaboration. Optimism remains cautious as the industry navigates global financial market uncertainties and potential economic slowdowns.</p>

          <p>Miriam Haley, one of the accusers in Harvey Weinstein's sexual assault retrial, took the stand, recounting her allegations from the first trial five years ago. Haley alleges that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. The retrial was ordered after Weinstein's original conviction was overturned by a New York appeals court. The prosecution also includes allegations from two other women, while Weinstein maintains his innocence. The defense is challenging the relevance of Haley's testimony, particularly regarding alleged childhood abuse.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving to block a Democratic effort to investigate Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's controversial use of the encrypted messaging app Signal. By tucking specific language into a rule with unrelated measures, GOP leaders are preventing Democrats from calling up resolutions of inquiry. This procedural maneuver aims to prevent what Speaker of the House Mike Johnson calls a "nonsensical waste of our time." Johnson has used this tactic previously to block efforts to rescind Trump's tariffs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Liberal Party's surprising election comeback in Canada, led by Mark Carney, is viewed as a rebuke to Donald Trump's policies. The election was sparked by Trump's remarks about Canada becoming the 51st US state and the imposition of tariffs, which transformed the political landscape. Carney, a member of the global liberal elite, positioned himself as the experienced leader needed to navigate the crisis, emphasizing closer ties with Europe and Asia. While Conservative support rose, the Liberals secured a fourth term, albeit possibly as a minority government, signaling a resistance to right-wing populism.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case involving an FBI raid on the wrong house, with justices expressing skepticism toward the government's defense of the operation. During the raid in Atlanta, agents used a battering ram and a flash-bang grenade, only to realize they had the wrong address. The couple who lived there sued for various claims, but lower courts sided with the government. Several justices questioned the lack of policy to prevent such errors, with Justice Gorsuch asking if checking the address was too much to ask.</p>

The plot failed because the pilots grew suspicious and sent the package for examination.

          <p>President Trump is employing a "flood the zone" strategy, similar to the Project 2025 blueprint, to rapidly implement his conservative policies, according to experts. This approach involves issuing numerous executive orders, challenging congressional power, and pushing immigration enforcement limits. While other presidents have used executive actions, Trump is taking it to an extreme. Experts note that even if these moves are blocked by courts, they still cause short-term and long-term damage by implanting a narrative and shifting the political landscape to the right.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ended the Pentagon's Women, Peace and Security program, labeling it a "woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative." This decision is controversial as the program was established under President Trump's administration with the Women, Peace and Security Act in 2017. Hegseth claims the Biden administration distorted the original program. The move has raised eyebrows, particularly given the support for the initiative from other Trump cabinet members and Ivanka Trump.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars' shares experienced a significant drop after announcing cost-cutting plans of $1.87 billion and withdrawing financial guidance. The company's operating profit fell sharply in the first quarter, attributed to a drop in wholesales, adverse currency effects, and industry turbulence. The cost-cutting plan includes reductions in investments and potential layoffs at its global operations. Volvo Cars cited tariff pressure on the automotive sector as a reason for withdrawing its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026.</p>

          <p>The White House criticized Amazon's reported plan to display tariff costs on imported goods as a "hostile and political act." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt questioned why Amazon didn't take similar action during the Biden administration's high inflation period. Amazon initially stated it considered listing import charges on its Amazon Haul store but later clarified that the plan was never approved and would not be implemented. President Trump reportedly called Bezos to express his displeasure about the initial report.</p>

          <p>California is leading a coalition of states in suing the Trump administration over cuts to AmeriCorps, arguing that the administration is unlawfully dismantling a program established by Congress. The lawsuit alleges that the Department of Government Efficiency is acting without regard for the services AmeriCorps provides to communities in need. The state argues that the cuts will harm California, where the program invested over $133 million last year. The lawsuit is the 16th filed by California against the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>In a "Dear James" column, The Atlantic explores the phenomenon of wanting to finish a book, even when thoroughly enjoying it. The author contemplates the linear momentum of reading and its connection to the nature of experience. The author suggests that the desire to finish stems from being narrative animals, always seeking the next moment. The author also admits a personal inclination to embrace the chaotic and illusion-filled journey of life, rather than seeking stillness through meditation.</p>

          <p>A columnist argues that President Trump's economic philosophy, particularly his approach to tariffs and trade negotiations, is a repudiation of American conservative economic principles and aligns more with left-wing thought. Trump's analogy of America as a department store he owns and sets prices for is seen as a form of economic planning from above. The columnist contrasts this with the free-market views of economists like Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek, who advocate for decentralized decision-making and limited government intervention.</p>
