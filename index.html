          <p>Verizon has entered into an agreement with AST SpaceMobile to provide its customers with cellular connectivity directly from space, with service expected to begin next year. This partnership aims to eliminate mobile dead zones by enabling standard smartphones to connect to satellites. While the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, the announcement led to a significant surge in AST SpaceMobile's stock, with shares climbing over 8% in pre-market trading. The collaboration expands on a previous partnership between the two companies, signaling a major step forward in satellite-to-phone technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry, the tenth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic and is projected to strengthen into a hurricane by Thursday. The storm is currently far from land but is moving west-northwest on a path that could bring it near or north of the northern Leeward Islands by late this week. Tropical storm watches have been issued for several Caribbean islands, which are expected to experience heavy rainfall and life-threatening surf conditions.

          <p>Representative Daniel Goldman defended the Department of Justice's actions in obtaining the 2023 phone records of nearly a dozen Republican senators as part of the January 6th investigation. Responding to Senator Ron Johnson's claim of being surveilled, Goldman stated on social media that the DOJ only acquired basic metadata like call time and duration, not the content of the conversations. The records were reportedly collected by former special counsel Jack Smith's team to confirm communications related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The move has been described by some Republicans as an outrageous abuse of power.</p>

          <p>At least 24 civilians were killed and 47 injured in Myanmar's central Sagaing region after the military dropped bombs from a motorized paraglider onto a crowd at a Buddhist festival. The gathering was a peaceful protest against the military junta, calling for the release of political prisoners and opposing conscription. This attack is part of a broader, bloody campaign of airstrikes by the junta, which has recently been bolstered by new drone technology from China and support from Russia. International organizations like Amnesty International have condemned the attack as part of a disturbing trend of targeting civilian communities.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is facing a deepening political crisis as his own former prime ministers and key allies publicly criticize his leadership and decisions. Gabriel Attal, once Macron's protégé, stated he no longer understands the president's choices, while former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe called for an early presidential election to resolve the political deadlock. Another former prime minister, Elisabeth Borne, suggested suspending Macron's controversial pension reform as a potential compromise.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a slight dip in interest rates, overall mortgage application volume in the U.S. has declined, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. However, within the current market, there is a growing trend of borrowers opting for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to secure lower initial interest rates. The share of ARM applications increased as borrowers seek savings, even though these loans carry the risk of future rate hikes after their initial fixed period expires. This shift occurs as the housing market contends with high prices and economic uncertainty, with purchase demand remaining largely stagnant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has affirmed that the United Kingdom will not relax its visa rules for India, a statement made ahead of a major trade delegation visit to the country. The trip, involving over 100 business and cultural leaders, aims to boost UK investment and leverage a recently signed trade agreement. Despite the focus on strengthening economic ties, Starmer emphasized that opening more visa routes for Indian workers or students is not part of the government's plan. This stance aligns with the Labour government's broader policy of trying to reduce overall immigration levels into the UK.</p>

In contrast, jobs requiring physical labor or significant human interaction, such as construction or nursing, are considered more insulated from the technology's immediate impact.

          <p>In a series of opinion articles published ahead of a key political meeting, China's Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, has described the nation's economy as an "unsinkable economic aircraft carrier." The articles assert that China's economy is resilient enough to withstand both internal and external pressures, including trade protectionism and shrinking global demand. The series emphasized the stability and predictability of China's long-term planning in contrast to what it called wavering policies in some Western countries. The commentary signals a continued push towards an economic model driven by innovation, consumption, and sustainable development.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a mathematics professor reflects on their experience of being diagnosed with autism in their 30s and argues against viewing the condition as a tragedy to be eliminated. The author contends that conversations about autism often exclude autistic voices and echo the dangerous logic of eugenics, which sought to erase disabled people. Drawing parallels to the concept of "deaf gain," the article highlights how autistic traits like persistence and attention to detail can be strengths, citing historical figures like Isaac Newton. The piece concludes with a call to recognize that difference is not a defect and that the world is better with autistic people in it.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called for Europe to strengthen its defenses and adopt a new mindset to deter what she describes as a campaign of "hybrid warfare." In a speech to the European Parliament, she cited a series of recent air incursions, cyberattacks, and damage to undersea cables as part of a deliberate and escalating campaign to destabilize the EU. While not explicitly blaming Russia for every incident, she stated that Moscow's clear aim is to sow division. Von der Leyen stressed that Europe must respond with unity and resolve, as the EU prepares plans for joint defense projects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Preordering books provides a significant and disproportionate boost to authors, influencing the publishing industry in several key ways. High preorder numbers signal strong interest to booksellers, who may then decide to increase their stock, feature the book more prominently in stores, or promote it online. Furthermore, all preorders are counted as first-day sales, which dramatically increases the likelihood of a book debuting on a bestseller list. This initial success can create a snowball effect, generating more visibility and subsequent sales, making preorders a critical tool for a book's launch.</p>

The defense ministry stated that the incident occurred after a pickup truck attempted to ram an army vehicle, causing the troops to perceive a threat and open fire. Tamaulipas is known for frequent and violent clashes involving drug cartels, and the military's actions in the region have previously led to accusations of extrajudicial killings.

While Chevron has not confirmed the cause, the unit remains shut down indefinitely, though the refinery continues to produce fuel from other sections. Industry experts suggest that the fire's large scale points to a significant failure, possibly related to faulty equipment or sensors that allowed hot oil and gas to escape and ignite. Multiple investigations are underway by Chevron, local air quality officials, and Cal/OSHA to determine the root cause and prevent future incidents.</p>
