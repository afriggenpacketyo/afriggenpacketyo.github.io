          <p>Republican lawmakers are attempting to roll back several health and environmental protections related to PFAS "forever chemicals" used by the U.S. military. The proposed changes, included in the National Defense Authorization Act, would delay a ban on PFAS firefighting foam, cut cleanup funding, and lift a moratorium on its incineration. This move reverses five years of bipartisan progress on the issue and has been criticized by environmental groups for prioritizing military convenience over the health of service members.</p>

Rising unemployment among youth and ongoing economic pressures are contributing to the president's underwater approval ratings. While the Democratic party is currently in disarray, this potential fraying of Trump's coalition could present an opportunity for them ahead of the midterm elections if they can formulate a coherent message.</p>

          <p>A royal expert has shared a story about the late Queen Elizabeth II once hiding in the bushes of Buckingham Palace to avoid Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu during a 1978 state visit. The Queen reportedly found Ceaușescu and his wife "ghastly" and took evasive action while walking her corgis in the gardens. The incident highlights the occasional awkwardness of diplomatic duties, where monarchs must host figures invited by the government, regardless of their personal feelings.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Lax Vetting on Walmart's Online Marketplace Leads to Counterfeits and Identity Theft</h2>

          <p>An investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its third-party online marketplace has been accompanied by significant problems, including the sale of counterfeit goods and lax seller vetting. The report discovered that some sellers used stolen identities of legitimate businesses to create accounts, selling fake products that could be dangerous to consumers. As Walmart aggressively competed with Amazon, it reportedly loosened its verification processes, creating what some sellers described as a "Wild West" environment on the platform.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has triggered a fierce national conversation about free speech, leading to repercussions for media figures like Jimmy Kimmel, whose show was suspended by ABC. The suspension came after the FCC Chairman threatened retaliation, and President Trump suggested broadcasters critical of him could lose their licenses. This has raised concerns among constitutional experts about the government using its power to suppress critical speech and retaliate against media outlets for their content.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Five years into the pandemic, experts are clarifying why COVID-19 can cause severe illness in some healthy people while others experience only mild symptoms. A key factor is the initial viral load, meaning the amount of virus a person is exposed to at the time of infection; a higher dose can lead to a more severe illness. While new variants continue to emerge, immunity from prior infections and vaccinations remains the most crucial tool for reducing the risk of severe disease.</p>

          <p>Neel Kashkari, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, has indicated that two more quarter-point interest rate cuts would likely be appropriate before the end of the year. He cited a weakening labor market as a primary concern, arguing that the risk of a sharp rise in unemployment justifies a more supportive monetary policy. Kashkari also downplayed the risk of tariffs causing a significant inflation surge, a shift in perspective that adds weight to the case for further easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump responded with alarm to an appeals court ruling that found his across-the-board tariffs illegal, claiming the decision would "literally destroy the United States of America." This article critiques his statement as hyperbolic, pointing out that the U.S. economy prospered for centuries without such tariffs. The author argues that blocking the tariffs would actually benefit the economy by reducing inflation and that Trump's frantic rhetoric is likely aimed at intimidating the Supreme Court, which is expected to hear the appeal.</p>

Although these groups were not aligned with Kirk, they are using his killing as a rallying cry to expand their extremist movement, a significant domestic terrorism threat.</p>
