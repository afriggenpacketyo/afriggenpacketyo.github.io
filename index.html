          <p>A suicide bomber attacked a Greek Orthodox church in Dweil'a, Syria, killing at least 20 people and wounding 52. The attacker, identified by the Syrian Interior Ministry as an extremist from the Islamic State group, opened fire before detonating an explosive vest inside the Mar Elias Church. The attack is the first of its kind in Syria in years, occurring as the government tries to gain support from minorities amidst concerns about extremist sleeper cells. Syrian Information Minister Hamza Mostafa condemned the attack as a terrorist act, reaffirming the state's commitment to combat criminal organizations and protect society.</p>

He also voiced his concern over the strikes being conducted without Congressional approval, emphasizing that Congress holds the sole authority to declare war according to the Constitution.

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. is "not at war" with Iran, but rather with its nuclear weapons program, aligning with the White House's stance after the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear installations. Vance declined to definitively confirm the complete destruction of Iran's nuclear sites, but asserted that the U.S. has "substantially delayed" Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. Conflicting reports have emerged regarding the extent of the damage, with some Iranian officials claiming minimal damage to the Fordo enrichment plant, while U.S. military officials maintain that the sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of people across the Midwest and East Coast are experiencing a rare June heatwave with dangerously high temperatures. Heat advisories have been issued from Minnesota to Maine, as well as parts of the South. The National Weather Service forecasts heat indices exceeding 100F in many areas, prompting cities like Philadelphia to declare heat emergencies. Meteorologists attribute the extreme temperatures to a heat dome, a large area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity, with the heatwave expected to persist into the coming week.</p>

          <p>England captain Ben Stokes made a crucial breakthrough after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test at Headingley. India was building a lead when Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2 with a 96-run advantage at the close of play. Brook's innings, marked by outrageous strokes and dropped catches, ended when he top-edged a hook, but he propelled England to virtual parity. The match is finely poised, with India holding a slight advantage heading into the final days.</p>

          <p>Despite claims of "totally obliterating" Iranian nuclear sites, satellite images suggest that the damage may be limited. New images of Natanz show a new crater, but the main support building at Fordow remains undamaged. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitors are still trying to assess the extent of the damage, and the strikes have complicated the task of tracking uranium. Analysts suggest that the attacks may incentivize Iran to move its program underground, making it more difficult to monitor.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers across the political spectrum have offered mixed reactions to President Trump's decision to launch strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.

Despite calls for de-escalation, the White House proceeded with military action, testing the UK's relationship with the US. While the UK government has not explicitly endorsed the US approach, they acknowledge that delaying Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons aligns with the UK's national interest. Starmer's position has evolved since earlier in the week, when he expressed confidence that President Trump would not intervene, raising questions about whether the Prime Minister misjudged the situation.</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda identifies five toxic phrases that instantly make children refuse to listen. These phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Instead, Raouda suggests using alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy, validate their emotions, and encourage problem-solving. By shifting to language that fosters respect, emotional safety, and involvement, parents can create an environment where cooperation feels natural and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>
