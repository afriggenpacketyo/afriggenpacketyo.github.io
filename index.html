          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 21:17:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that former President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found the order invalid because it directly contradicts the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued that the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected. This ruling marks a significant legal setback for the policy, which has been on hold amid numerous legal challenges since its announcement.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after a contraction in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a surge in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products. However, analysts express caution about the future, citing concerns that slowing global trade and potential U.S. tariffs could pressure the country's export-dependent economy. Despite a turnaround in domestic demand, experts predict that the current pace of growth is unlikely to be sustained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>LIV Golfer Lee Westwood Criticizes Official World Golf Ranking System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 21:09:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Veteran golfer Lee Westwood has publicly criticized the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) system after his finish at The Open Championship caused him to jump nearly 3,800 spots. Westwood, who plays on the LIV Golf tour, argues that the system is flawed because it does not award ranking points for LIV Golf events, causing players like himself and former world No. 1 Dustin Johnson to plummet in the standings. He stated that excluding top players from earning points makes a "mockery of the system." The criticism comes as LIV Golf has submitted a new application for OWGR accreditation.</p>

However, some experts believe the impact on China may be limited, as Chinese companies have increasingly localized their production within Southeast Asia over the past five years, reducing their reliance on transshipments that would be affected by such deals.

          <p>In Haiti's gang-controlled capital, Port-au-Prince, sexual assault is being used as a weapon to terrorize communities, with reports of attacks surging. The article shares the story of a 19-year-old survivor who is now raising a child conceived from her abduction and repeated assaults by gang members. Medical charity MSF reports that patient numbers for sexual abuse have nearly tripled since 2021, with gangs using collective sexual assault during large-scale neighborhood attacks. The crisis is compounded by widespread displacement, hunger, and a breakdown of state authority, leaving women and girls exceptionally vulnerable.</p>

Both teams are considered the best in Europe, setting the stage for a dramatic one-off game. Despite the World Cup loss, England has a decent overall record against Spain and is not seen as an underdog, with many believing the team has evolved since their last major final encounter.</p>

He pointed to positive developments like the U.S.-Japan trade deal and strong corporate earnings from banks and healthcare companies. However, he also warned of speculative "froth" in certain areas, reminiscent of previous market bubbles, and noted concerns about the sustainability of the data center buildout.

          <p>Vehicle manufacturing in the United Kingdom has fallen to its lowest point since 1953 for the first half of the year, when excluding the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), car output dropped by 7.3%, while van production plummeted by 45%. The decline is partly attributed to uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, which caused some firms to slow production. While a new U.S.-UK tariff deal and government EV grants may help, the SMMT remains doubtful that the industry will reach its ambitious production targets for the coming years.

The team boasts a mix of veteran talent like quarterback Matthew Stafford and young stars such as Puka Nacua and Jared Verse. However, issues to watch include Stafford's back soreness, the offensive line's health following left tackle Alaric Jackson's blood-clot issues, and depth at the cornerback position. Additionally, the team is still in contract negotiations with star running back Kyren Williams, whose future with the team beyond this season remains uncertain.</p>

The Dodgers' bullpen has struggled recently, and its high usage is a growing concern for the team.

          <p>An exhibit at Muir Woods National Monument has been altered to comply with a Trump administration executive order targeting signage deemed "unpatriotic." The original exhibit, installed in 2021, had added context to a historical timeline, including the role of Indigenous peoples and the racist language used by historical figures like John Muir. Following the order, these additions were removed, restoring the sign to its previous, less complete version. Critics, including a former park ranger involved in the project, have condemned the move as an act of censorship that erases a more complex and inclusive telling of American history.</p>

A leading theory suggests an idle Edison transmission line ignited the fire that killed 19 people and destroyed over 9,400 structures.
