          <p>A tornado in North Dakota claimed the lives of three residents on Friday night, impacting several homes in rural Enderlin, about 60 miles southwest of Fargo. Cass County Sheriff Jesse Jahner noted that the nighttime timing of the storm may have limited residents' ability to prepare, and first responders have described the event as the worst they have encountered. The Enderlin Sheldon Fire Department reported damage to approximately ten homes and loss of livestock. The National Weather Service warned of further severe storms with potential for hail, wind, and tornadoes, while Minnesota experienced major damage from high winds, leaving thousands without power.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless woman of Palestinian descent, has been detained by ICE since February after returning from her honeymoon in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Sakeik, who has lived in the U.S. since she was eight years old, was previously under an "order of supervision," requiring regular check-ins with immigration authorities. Despite assurances from officials before her trip, she was detained at the airport and has since been held in detention centers, facing attempted deportation without proper notification. Her husband, a U.S. citizen, is concerned about her uncertain future and the procedural challenges she faces due to her stateless status and past deportation order.</p>

          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) possesses nearly five times more cash on hand than the Democratic National Committee (DNC), marking the widest disparity since at least July 2020. The RNC reported $72 million on hand at the end of May, while the DNC held only $15 million. This financial advantage comes amid internal tensions within the DNC following President Donald Trump's return to the White House. While some Democrats express concerns about the party's direction and fundraising, the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support, raising roughly $40 million in individual donations since February.

Trump has contradicted this assessment, claiming that Gabbard and the intelligence community are "wrong." Reed suggests that Trump's position may be influenced by his contemplation of an attack against Iran, necessitating a conclusion that Iran possesses the intent and capacity to develop nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>The UK recorded its hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures surpassing 33C, as a Met Office warning for thunderstorms came into force. An amber heat-health alert is in effect in England, with research suggesting nearly 600 heat-related deaths could occur in the next four days. Passengers were evacuated from a train in south London due to a fault amid the high temperatures. The National Fire Chiefs Council is urging caution with barbecues and flammable objects, while scientists emphasize that climate change is making heatwaves hotter and longer.</p>

The U.S. State Department has also issued a Level 4 travel advisory for Israel, advising Americans against travel due to armed conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest. Ben Gurion International Airport remains closed, and several commercial airlines have suspended flights from Israel to the United States.</p>

          <p>Casinos in Las Vegas are quietly laying off dealers due to declining tourism and increased automation, with major resorts like Fontainebleau and Resorts World reducing staff. Visitor volume in Las Vegas has dipped, leading to lower gaming revenue and hotel occupancy rates. Travel industry analysts attribute the decline to broader economic uncertainty and evolving U.S. travel policies. The introduction of electronic table games and reduced enrollment in dealer training programs further contribute to job losses in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The policy change, which could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding, was deemed arbitrary and capricious.
