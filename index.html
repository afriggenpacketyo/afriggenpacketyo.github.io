          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane, bringing days of heavy rainfall and the potential for life-threatening flash flooding and landslides across the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center reported the storm's slow movement over very warm waters is expected to lead to significant strengthening by the weekend. While specific rainfall totals beyond Sunday remain uncertain due to Melissa's unpredictable track, affected regions are under a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning. Despite the severe threats to Caribbean nations, the storm is not anticipated to have major impacts on the mainland United States, though local authorities are bracing for significant humanitarian challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced the termination of all trade negotiations with Canada, a decision he attributed to an anti-tariff ad campaign from Ontario that featured excerpts from a 1987 Ronald Reagan radio address. Trump criticized the ad as "FAKE" and alleged it was designed to influence an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court decision concerning his tariff policies. The Ronald Reagan Foundation also denounced Ontario's use of "selective audio" without authorization, stating it misrepresented the former president's remarks. This development marks a further deterioration in U.S.-Canada trade relations, which have been strained by Trump's previous tariff hikes and Canada's retaliatory measures, despite ongoing attempts at reconciliation.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the mayoral race, just two days before early voting commences. Adams, who recently withdrew from the race, expressed anger at not being the one to challenge Democratic nominee Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, whom he sharply criticized as a "snake oil salesman" for his rent freeze proposals. Cuomo echoed these sentiments, labeling Mamdani a "Democratic socialist" and an "existential threat" to the city. This endorsement signifies a significant mending of fences between Adams and Cuomo, who previously had a contentious relationship, uniting against a common opponent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate failed to advance a Republican-backed bill designed to ensure essential federal workers receive pay during the ongoing government shutdown, marking a significant legislative setback. This outcome reflects the persistent political gridlock in Congress over budget allocations, leaving thousands of federal employees facing financial uncertainty. The inability to pass this measure highlights deep partisan divides regarding the responsibilities of government during a shutdown and the welfare of its workforce. As the shutdown continues, the lack of consensus on even basic provisions for federal staff underscores broader challenges in Washington's political landscape.</p>

          <p>North Korea has held a groundbreaking ceremony for a memorial dedicated to its soldiers who died fighting alongside Russian forces in the Ukraine war. Leader Kim Jong Un lauded the event as a "historic peak" in ties with Russia, calling the Memorial Museum of Combat Feats a "sacred sanctuary" for patriots. This development follows North Korea's admission in April 2025 of sending troops to Russia and its provision of billions in weapons, indicating deepening military cooperation. South Korean intelligence estimates at least 2,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed in Russia's Kursk region alone.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have unveiled details of a sophisticated, mafia-linked illegal poker ring that allegedly used advanced technology to defraud victims of millions, including NBA figures.

          <p>Kim Kardashian has revealed her diagnosis of a brain aneurysm, suggesting that personal stress might have played a role in its development. The reality TV star shared footage of her imaging scan, bringing attention to a condition that affects approximately one in 50 people. While many unruptured aneurysms cause few symptoms, larger ones can lead to headaches, balance issues, and speech problems, and ruptured aneurysms are highly dangerous and potentially fatal. Medical research indicates that brain aneurysms are most common in adults aged 30 to 60, with women being particularly susceptible, underscoring the importance of monitoring and potential treatment.</p>

          <p>Mark Killick, identified as one of Britain's most prolific "cowboy builders" with a criminal record dating back to 1995, defrauded 37 victims of over £1.25 million. He exploited legal loopholes by changing his name twice and maintained a professional online presence with fake glowing reviews, enabling him to repeatedly defraud customers. This case has intensified calls for stricter regulations in the building trade, including a central register for convicted fraudsters and mandatory builder licensing. Experts argue the current system fails victims, leading to significant financial losses and a lack of consumer confidence in the construction sector.</p>

          <p>Indian exporters are experiencing a challenging Diwali season due to severe 50% U.S. tariffs, which have significantly impacted labor-intensive sectors like textiles and gems and jewelry. These tariffs have jeopardized billions in revenue and millions of jobs, forcing manufacturers to contend with unsold inventory and production cutbacks. The U.S. remains India's largest export destination, making the tariff shock a critical blow to industries that heavily rely on cross-border demand. While discussions for a potential trade deal to reduce tariffs are ongoing, the current economic climate has dampened festive spirits and threatens India's export engine. (not investment advice)</p>

Boyd, who maintained his innocence, was pronounced dead after a process that witnesses described as prolonged and involving visible shaking. The U.S. Supreme Court denied his stay of execution, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing a scathing dissent against the "mounting and unbroken evidence" of the method's unconstitutionality. This marks the eighth use of nitrogen gas for execution in the U.S., a method adopted by states struggling to obtain lethal injection drugs.</p>

YouTube TV, a prominent U.S. pay-TV service, alleges Disney is demanding costly economic terms that would raise prices for consumers and unfairly benefit Disney's competing streaming products. This dispute marks the latest in a series of contentions where Google's YouTube TV has faced similar complaints from other major programmers.
