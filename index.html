          <p>Birmingham City Council declared a major incident due to an ongoing bin strike, resulting in 17,000 tons of uncollected waste.  Council leader John Cotton cited rising public health concerns as the reason for the declaration, highlighting the inability to clear rubbish due to daily picket lines.  The council plans to increase street cleaning efforts with additional vehicles and crews.  *Potential Bias: The article focuses on the council's response and the negative impacts of the strike, potentially downplaying the workers' grievances.*</p>

          <p>A proposed emergency law to overturn new sentencing guidelines in England and Wales, which consider the backgrounds of ethnic minority offenders, will not pass before Easter.  The guidelines aim to address sentencing disparities but have drawn criticism for potentially creating a two-tiered justice system.  Government sources suggest the delay is due to the difficulty of passing such legislation quickly and potential obstruction in the House of Lords. *Potential Bias: The article highlights criticism of the guidelines, potentially overlooking the intentions to reduce bias in sentencing.*</p>
