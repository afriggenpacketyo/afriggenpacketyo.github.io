          <p>Hamas has indicated a "positive response" to the latest ceasefire framework proposed by mediators, expressing readiness for immediate negotiations. The development follows President Trump's announcement of an Israeli-agreed two-month ceasefire, a statement neither side had initially confirmed. While Trump expressed optimism for a deal, Israeli sources indicated support but no firm commitment yet, and Palestinian officials noted Hamas's insistence on guarantees for an Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war. The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 57,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's current government, led by President Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), is facing criticism for its approach to the Republic of China's (ROC) World War II history. The administration is accused of honoring the ROC's wartime victory against Japan while downplaying its historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. This reflects the DPP's broader political stance, which emphasizes Taiwan's distinct identity, in contrast to the Kuomintang (KMT) which governed from the mainland before retreating to Taiwan. The debate highlights the island's ongoing struggle with its complex historical and political identity.</p>

          <p>Severe flash flooding in Texas's Hill Country has led to a "mass casualty event," with at least 24 fatalities confirmed and dozens of people, including children from a summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River reportedly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching residents and officials by surprise as the rainfall far exceeded forecasts. Hundreds of people have been evacuated, many by helicopter, and extensive search and rescue operations are underway with state and federal support. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration, promising unlimited state resources for the affected counties.</p>

          <p>Trinidad and Tobago has bestowed its highest civilian award, the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, upon Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This marks the first time a foreign leader has received the honor, symbolizing the deep friendship between the two nations. The visit focused on strengthening bilateral ties in sectors like energy, health, and security, building on a historical connection that began with Indian indentured laborers in the 19th century. During his visit, Modi also announced that sixth-generation citizens of Indian origin in the nation would now be eligible for Overseas Citizen of India cards.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers do not plan to alter their trade deadline strategy despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy, who is expected to miss about six weeks. Initial fears of a season-ending injury were allayed when tests revealed only a bone bruise with no ligament damage. The team's management expressed relief and confidence that Muncy will return with more than a month remaining before the playoffs. In the interim, the Dodgers will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman, Kiké Hernández, and Miguel Rojas to cover the third base position.</p>

Critics argue that people often cannot afford the hundreds of dollars in fees required to retrieve their cars on such short notice. One company, MyHoopty.com LLC, has been accused of specifically targeting apartment complexes where lower-income people live, towing cars for minor infractions like expired registrations. Residents have formed neighborhood watches to combat the practice, but the company owner maintains he is simply enforcing the rules of the private properties.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed into law a major legislative package that makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent, increases defense and border security funding, and enacts significant cuts to federal safety-net programs. The bill, which passed Congress by a narrow margin, is a key achievement for the administration. Critics, including congressional Democrats and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, have raised alarms over its potential to increase the national debt by over $3 trillion and cause millions to lose health insurance coverage. The administration, however, promotes the law as a major benefit for the military, job creation, and the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, the new tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. Instead, it introduces a new temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older who fall below certain income thresholds. Policy experts clarify that this provides some relief by lowering a senior's overall taxable income, but it is not a repeal of the tax on benefits themselves. The change was structured as a deduction due to procedural rules in Congress, and it will primarily benefit higher-income seniors rather than those who already pay no federal income tax.

          <p>New research indicates that zooplankton, tiny marine animals, play a far more significant role in mitigating global warming than previously understood. According to the study, these creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean's surface in Antarctica before sinking deep into the ocean to hibernate. This process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million cars. This discovery forces a reassessment of the Southern Ocean's carbon storage capacity and highlights the importance of these overlooked "unsung heroes" of the marine ecosystem.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Bans Direct Action Group Palestine Action as a Terrorist Organization</h2>

          <p>The direct action group Palestine Action has been officially proscribed as a terrorist organization in the UK after a High Court judge and the Court of Appeal rejected a last-minute bid to block the ban. The proscription means that supporting the group, including through membership, is now a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government moved to ban the group, which engages in civil disobedience and property damage against companies linked to Israel's arms industry, following an incident that caused millions in damage to planes at an RAF base. The group's lawyers argued the ban was an "authoritarian abuse" of power against a non-violent protest group.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy indicates that the new tax law will provide the largest benefits to the wealthiest 1% of households, particularly those in states without a personal income tax. In 2026, the top 1% in states like Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas are projected to see their tax bills fall by over $100,000 on average. This is because they benefit from provisions like lower income tax rates and a higher estate tax exemption without being negatively impacted by the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions. Conversely, the wealthiest in high-tax states like California and New Jersey will see a much smaller average tax cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Arizona-based economics professor, Dr. Bishara Bahbah, has emerged as a key backchannel negotiator between Hamas and the Trump administration. After being contacted by Hamas in April due to his connections as president of "Arab-Americans for Trump," he has been working from Qatar to facilitate communication. Dr. Bahbah's involvement, which he claims was instrumental in the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, represents an unconventional diplomatic effort. This unique channel operates alongside official Qatari mediation, highlighting the complex and multi-layered efforts to secure a permanent ceasefire and hostage release.</p>

          <p>At the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom, a same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins named Scampi and Flounder are successfully raising a chick. Zoo experts gave the pair one of two eggs laid by another penguin couple to increase the chances of both chicks surviving. This practice is part of the zoo's efforts to support the population of Humboldt penguins, which are listed as a vulnerable species. While this is the first chick for Scampi and Flounder, same-sex penguin parenting has been observed in other zoos, with both parents typically sharing incubating, feeding, and parenting duties.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to protest the Trump administration's immigration policies and the newly approved federal budget. The rally targeted the surge in funding for mass deportations and border enforcement included in the "Big Beautiful Bill." Protesters, including local politicians, expressed anger that tax dollars are funding aggressive immigration raids that have created fear in their communities, rather than social services. The demonstration highlights the ongoing public backlash against the administration's hardline immigration stance and the fiscal priorities codified in the new law.</p>

          <p>Germany began its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the win was deserved, the team's performance was marred by wastefulness in front of goal and a significant injury concern. Captain Giulia Gwinn left the field in tears during the first half with an apparent knee injury, a major blow for the eight-time champions given her history of two previous ACL tears. The extent of the injury is not yet known, casting a shadow over the team's otherwise successful start to the tournament as they prepare to face tougher group stage opponents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order that will change access and fee structures for U.S. national parks. The order directs federal agencies to charge foreign tourists higher entry fees than U.S. residents and to give Americans preferential treatment in lotteries or permit systems for recreational access. Additionally, the order revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the management and storytelling within national parks. This move aligns with the administration's broader policy of dismantling government DEI programs established under previous administrations.</p>
