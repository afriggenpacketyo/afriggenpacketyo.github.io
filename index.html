          <p>A search is ongoing for Donald Henson, who the FBI accuses of committing an "act of terror" by ramming his car into the entrance gate of their Pittsburgh field office. After the crash, Henson allegedly threw an American flag over the gate before fleeing on foot. While no one was injured, the FBI considers it a targeted attack and notes Henson, a former military member with possible mental health issues, had recently visited the office with a complaint that lacked a federal nexus.</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the company after nearly five decades, citing a dispute with parent company Unilever over the brand's social mission. Greenfield stated that Unilever has silenced the ice cream maker's activism, violating the independence agreement made during the 2000 acquisition. The conflict escalated after Ben & Jerry's decided to stop sales in Israeli settlements in 2021, and this departure marks a significant rift between the brand's activist roots and its corporate ownership.</p>

          <p>A Guardian investigation has found that the Trump administration has significantly reduced federal efforts to combat human trafficking across multiple departments, including State, Justice, and Homeland Security. Key initiatives have been cut, grants for non-profits delayed, and experienced staff have been forced out or reassigned, with a notable shift in focus at DHS from trafficking investigations to immigrant deportations. Anti-trafficking advocates and former officials warn that these actions undermine decades of progress and leave survivors with fewer options for protection.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has drawn sharp criticism from across the political spectrum after vowing to "absolutely target" hate speech following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Legal experts and prominent conservatives quickly condemned her remarks, pointing out that there is no "hate speech" exception to the First Amendment, making such targeting unconstitutional. Following the backlash, Bondi issued a statement clarifying that her intention was to address incitement of violence, but concerns remain about the administration's broad interpretation of illegal threats.</p>

          <p>In her campaign for Virginia governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger is highlighting endorsements from two former Republican members of Congress, Barbara Comstock and Denver Riggleman. This move aims to attract moderate voters ahead of early voting in a closely watched race against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. The election is seen as a key test of the political climate during Donald Trump's second presidential term, particularly in a state that has been trending Democratic but showed tighter margins in the last election.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's overall inflation rate remained at 3.8% in August, consistent with the previous month, despite food and non-alcoholic drink prices rising at their fastest pace in 19 months. The annual cost of food surged by 5.1%, driven by price hikes for items like beef, butter, and milk, outpacing average wage growth. Economists suggest these increases are partly due to businesses passing on higher minimum wage and National Insurance costs to consumers, keeping inflation well above the Bank of England's 2% target.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a quarter-point interest rate cut to support a weakening U.S. job market, which saw only 22,000 jobs added in August. This anticipated move, the first in nine months, comes as the central bank faces intense pressure from President Trump to lower rates more aggressively. The administration's efforts to influence the Fed, including installing a new board member and attempting to fire another, have raised concerns about the erosion of the central bank's political independence.

          <p>The zarf, a Turkish word for 'envelope,' refers to the ornate, often bejeweled holders for small coffee cups that were a symbol of luxury and status during the Ottoman Empire. Serving coffee in Turkey is a culturally significant ritual recognized by UNESCO, and the zarf was an integral part of this tradition, functioning as both a practical handle and a statement of elegance. While modern cardboard coffee sleeves are sometimes colloquially called zarfs, purists argue the term should be reserved for the historical, artistic items that represent a rich cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has seen a systematic effort to dismantle checks on presidential authority, exemplified by the firing of officials in independent agencies like the Merit Systems Protection Board. These actions, which are being challenged in over 300 lawsuits, test the legal limits of a president's power to remove executive officers without cause, a departure from over a century of civil service protections. Critics argue this approach erodes the separation of powers and could politicize government functions, while supporters claim it is a necessary assertion of executive authority.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has granted a temporary injunction blocking the UK government from removing a 25-year-old Eritrean man to France under a new "one in, one out" returns agreement. The man's lawyers successfully argued he needed more time to provide evidence that he may be a victim of modern-day slavery, making this the first legal challenge to the recently implemented pilot scheme. The ruling raises questions about the viability of the deal, as it could set a precedent for others facing removal to launch similar legal claims.</p>

          <p>A Belgian music festival's decision to cancel a concert by the Munich Philharmonic because its Israeli conductor, Lahav Shani, had not sufficiently condemned his government's actions has ignited a fierce debate. German officials and Jewish leaders labeled the move antisemitic, while others drew comparisons to the dismissal of Russian conductor Valery Gergiev for his support of Putin. The controversy highlights the intense and polarizing nature of cultural boycotts, with critics arguing they stifle free expression and deepen societal divisions rather than achieving political goals.</p>

          <p>The CEO of luxury retailer Fortnum & Mason, Tom Athron, has stated that tariffs implemented by the Trump administration have negatively impacted its tea exports to the United States. Stricter country-of-origin rules have meant that tea blends containing ingredients from China or India are subject to enormous tariffs, forcing the company to significantly increase delivery fees for U.S. consumers. This has created logistical challenges and made American customers wary of purchasing the brand's iconic products, which were previously not subject to such high import duties.</p>
