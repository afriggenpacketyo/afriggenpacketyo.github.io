          <p>Taiwan is set to test a domestically developed kamikaze sea drone this month to bolster its naval defenses against increasing pressure from mainland China. The drone, developed under the "Kuai Chi Project" by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, will undergo combat capability evaluations before further tests later this year. The defense ministry has allocated over $25 million for the project, with plans to begin mass production in 2026, and the army intends to acquire more than 200 of these vessels to support coastal assault operations. The attack vessel will feature an AI-enabled targeting system, autonomously locking onto and striking enemy ships, emphasizing range, precision, mobility, unmanned capability, and AI integration as core elements of Taiwan's asymmetric defense strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent election, Poland saw a shift as conservative historian Karol Nawrocki narrowly defeated liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, marking a move to the right after a period of centrist governance. This election is viewed as a reminder of the resilience of populism and the ongoing challenges to liberal democracy. The previous Tusk government had some success in restoring judicial independence and unlocking EU funds, but failed to deliver on key promises, leading to voter frustration. Poland's foreign policy, particularly its role as a NATO frontier with Ukraine, remains critical, with increased military spending and diplomatic realignment towards Brussels. The outcome suggests that deep dissatisfaction and polarization persist within the Polish electorate, indicating that the restoration of liberal institutions was merely a narrow interlude.</p>

          <p>MI5 is facing increased scrutiny after a High Court judge expressed a lack of confidence in the Security Service's account of false evidence provided in the case of a violent neo-Nazi agent. The judge, Mr. Justice Chamberlain, ordered MI5 to hand over secret documents and raised concerns about the "correctness" of new evidence from a senior MI5 officer. This follows earlier revelations that MI5 lied to courts about an agent, known as X, who used his position to coerce and terrorize his girlfriend. A panel of High Court judges will now consider potential actions, including contempt of court proceedings, regarding MI5's false evidence, raising serious questions about the agency's internal investigations and transparency.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity contracted in May at the fastest rate since September 2022, according to a private survey, primarily due to a sharp decline in new export orders resulting from U.S. tariffs. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell below 50, indicating contraction, for the first time since last year, with foreign demand dropping to its lowest level since July 2023. The job market also weakened, with employment shrinking for the second consecutive month, and factories' finished goods inventory accumulated due to falling sales and shipment delays. This contraction highlights increasing uncertainty in the external trade environment and adds to domestic economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

The officials were joined by representatives from Asian countries, signaling renewed focus on the gas project, which could provide gas to Alaska residents and facilitate LNG exports.

          <p>Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene has resigned after failing to secure enough support in a parliamentary confidence vote, triggered by weeks of public protests against corruption, inequality, and rising living costs. Oyun-Erdene received only 44 votes in the 126-seat parliament, far short of the 64 needed to remain in office. Prior to the vote, Oyun-Erdene warned that the motion could cause instability and threaten democracy, but reports of lavish spending by his son and a drop in Mongolia's Corruption Perceptions Index fueled the protests. He will remain in a caretaker role until a successor is appointed within 30 days.</p>

          <p>The UN secretary-general has called for an independent investigation into the killing of Palestinians near an aid distribution center in Gaza, amid disputed reports that Israeli forces opened fire on people waiting for aid.

The Red Cross said its hospital received 179 casualties, 21 of whom were dead. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency put the death toll at 31. Israel's foreign ministry responded by branding his comments a "disgrace" in a post on X, and criticised him for not mentioning Hamas.</p>

          <p>The UK government is threatening to sue Roman Abramovich to ensure that the Â£2.5 billion from the sale of Chelsea Football Club goes to humanitarian causes in Ukraine. The funds have been frozen in a UK bank account since the sale, following Abramovich's sanctioning after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The disagreement centers on whether the money should be used exclusively for Ukrainian humanitarian efforts, as the UK government insists, or for "all victims of the war in Ukraine," as Abramovich has proposed. The government remains determined to see the proceeds benefit those suffering in Ukraine and is prepared to pursue legal action if an agreement cannot be reached.</p>

This action follows a series of similar threats from the Trump administration and comes after a transgender athlete won multiple medals at the state high school track and field championships.

He emphasized that these actions, while not military operations, carry a military message and place immense pressure on Taiwan.
