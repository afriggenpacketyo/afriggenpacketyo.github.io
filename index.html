          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 18:57:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a rare presidential visit to the Federal Reserve, Donald Trump publicly clashed with Chairman Jerome Powell over the costs of the headquarters' renovation. Despite the confrontation, Trump indicated he would not fire Powell, a threat he had previously suggested. The visit is seen as part of Trump's ongoing pressure campaign for the Fed to lower interest rates, which he believes would benefit the U.S. economy by reducing debt payments. The event highlights the unusual tension between the White House and the traditionally independent central bank.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany, France, and the United Kingdom are scheduled to meet with Iranian officials to discuss the nation's nuclear program, following threats of reimposing UN sanctions. The talks aim to revive diplomacy after nascent U.S.-Iran negotiations were derailed by military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. European powers hope to persuade Tehran to resume cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and re-engage in limiting its uranium enrichment. However, with deep distrust on both sides, analysts believe a major agreement is unlikely, viewing the meeting primarily as a step to keep diplomatic channels open.</p>

          <p>Comcast-owned E! Entertainment Television is canceling its long-running nightly program, 'E! News,' with the final episode scheduled for September 25. The network cited a shift in audience preference towards consuming breaking entertainment news on social media throughout the day rather than tuning in for a nightly show. While the channel's digital news operations will continue, the cancellation will result in approximately 20 job eliminations. The move comes as E! and other Comcast cable channels are being spun off into a new company, Versant, separating them from the parent company's core assets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has signed an executive order aimed at making it easier for local governments to remove unhoused people from streets and public areas. The order seeks to reverse legal precedents that limit authorities' ability to compel individuals into mental health treatment and redirects federal funds toward these programs to "restore public order." This move comes amid a worsening homelessness crisis and follows a Supreme Court ruling that allows cities to penalize people for sleeping outside. Critics, like the National Homelessness Law Center, argue the policy is punitive and will exacerbate the problem rather than address its root causes.</p>

          <p>Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX, experienced a major network outage that affected tens of thousands of users globally. The disruption lasted approximately 2.5 hours before service was mostly restored, according to the company. The outage occurred shortly after T-Mobile launched its new satellite-powered service in partnership with Starlink, which is designed to provide mobile connectivity in remote areas. While the cause was not immediately specified, the incident highlights potential vulnerabilities in the growing satellite internet infrastructure that serves many rural and underserved communities worldwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid renewed scrutiny of Donald Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein, questions have arisen as to why the Biden administration did not previously release the investigation files. A key obstacle is the legally mandated secrecy of grand jury testimony, which constitutes a significant portion of the files and can only be unsealed by a judge under exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, the FBI rarely releases evidence that does not lead to criminal charges, in order to protect individual privacy and ongoing investigations. Even if the Biden administration had sought their release, it would have required court approval, which was not guaranteed.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that would have prevented individuals from suing to enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The action preserves, for now, a key enforcement mechanism of the landmark civil rights law. The case originated in North Dakota, where Native American tribes challenged a state redistricting plan as discriminatory. While the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals had sided with the state, the Supreme Court's intervention maintains the status quo nationwide. However, the long-term viability of this right remains uncertain, as the justices are set to rehear a similar case from Louisiana.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price experienced a significant drop after the company reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of investor expectations, declining over 8% in one day. The electric vehicle maker is grappling with increased competition, weakening consumer demand, and the upcoming elimination of a key federal tax credit. CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the potential for "a few rough quarters" ahead, while also pointing to autonomous driving technology as the company's long-term future. The results reflect ongoing challenges for the company, including damage to its brand from Musk's political activities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent episode of NPR's "Consider This" podcast examines the significant shifts in federal education policy since President Trump's inauguration. Despite Trump's vow to close the Department of Education, his administration has actively used its authority to influence American classrooms. The discussion highlights recent actions, such as the withholding of billions of dollars in funding for K-12 schools, as part of a broader effort to drastically change the federal government's role in education. The segment explores the implications of these changes for students, teachers, and school districts across the country.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has launched a new political party aimed at challenging the established political order and advocating for wealth redistribution. Now an independent Member of Parliament, Corbyn, along with MP Zarah Sultana, described the yet-unnamed party as a grassroots, community-led alternative to what they call Labour's "control freaks" and the "divisive" politics of Reform UK. The move signals a formal break with the current Labour leadership under Keir Starmer and seeks to build a political movement to the left of the mainstream party on key economic and social issues.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson commented on the ongoing friction between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating he understands the president's frustration over interest rates. While stopping short of endorsing Trump's threats to fire Powell, Johnson suggested a "rocky road" lies ahead for the Fed chair before his term expires in 2026. Johnson argued that lowering interest rates, which the Fed has kept steady to combat inflation, would help solve the housing crisis and save the nation money. His remarks reflect the continued political pressure being applied to the central bank's monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that investors own 19% of all homes in California, a clear indicator of the state's severe and ongoing housing affordability crisis. While the rate is near the national average, it underscores the challenges for individual homebuyers in a state with a significant housing shortage and soaring prices. The data shows higher concentrations of investor ownership in rural and mountain counties compared to urban coastal areas. Critics argue that while investors provide market liquidity, their profit-driven model puts upward pressure on prices, making it even harder for families to purchase homes.

          <p>A discussion on CNN's "NewsNight" grew heated when conservative commentator Scott Jennings insulted fellow panelist Keith Boykin during a segment about Columbia University's settlement with the Trump administration. After being called out for interrupting, Jennings called Boykin "whiny," prompting a tense exchange where Boykin repeatedly challenged him to say the full insult. The on-air moment drew criticism online and was analyzed by a therapist, who described the name-calling as a dismissive tactic intended to reduce the other person's power. The incident reflects the often-uncivil nature of contemporary political discourse in media.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is undergoing a major reorganization that will force thousands of employees to relocate from the Washington D.C. area and accept salary cuts. The plan aims to reduce the department's financial footprint by moving over half of its capital-region staff to five new hubs across the country. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins stated the move will better serve farmers and reduce bureaucracy. However, critics and experts warn the upheaval will weaken support for farmers, complicate wildfire response by the U.S. Forest Service, and result in a mass loss of experienced staff and institutional knowledge.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize the state of Palestine, with the decision to be formalized at the United Nations in September. Citing France's historical commitment to peace in the Middle East, Macron has grown increasingly frustrated with Israel's war in Gaza and the resulting humanitarian crisis. The move makes France the largest European power to take this step, joining over 140 other nations. Israel's Prime Minister condemned the decision, stating it "rewards terror" and would create a launch pad to annihilate Israel rather than promote peace.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has made a direct plea to resident doctors in England to halt their planned five-day strike over pay, warning it would cause a "huge loss for the NHS." The strike, organized by the British Medical Association (BMA), is set to begin Friday. The government has offered a 5.4% pay rise, but the BMA argues that real-term wages have been eroded by about 20% since 2008 and is seeking full pay restoration. The walkout threatens to cause significant disruption, potentially leading to the cancellation of over a million appointments and treatments.</p>
