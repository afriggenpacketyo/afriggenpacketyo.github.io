          <p>The US Men's National Team played to a 1-1 draw against Ecuador in Austin, Texas, with Folarin Balogun scoring the equalizer in the 71st minute, marking his second consecutive goal for the team. Despite controlling possession and constructing attractive offensive plays, the US players felt the outcome was less than their performance deserved against a disciplined Ecuadorian defense. Coach Mauricio Pochettino continues to emphasize long-term development for the 2026 World Cup, prioritizing strong performances over immediate results. This game, coupled with an encouraging display against Japan, highlights the team's increasing comfort with a three-man backline and overall progress in competing with formidable international opponents, suggesting a positive trajectory for the squad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK, alongside France and Germany, has declared its readiness to use the full value of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's war effort, aiming to increase pressure on President Vladimir Putin and facilitate negotiations. This move, undertaken in cooperation with the US, goes beyond previous actions that only used profits and interest from the assets. With over £25bn of Russian assets frozen in the UK and an estimated €211bn in the EU, leaders discussed a €140bn loan to Ukraine. The announcement follows recent extensive Russian missile and drone strikes across Ukraine, which caused power cuts and casualties, prompting Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to call for decisive action and more sanctions.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Aces secured their third WNBA championship in four seasons, defeating the Phoenix Mercury 97-86 in a four-game sweep of the Finals. A'ja Wilson delivered a stellar performance with 31 points, complemented by 18 points each from Chelsea Gray and Jackie Young. The Aces dominated offensively throughout the series, consistently scoring over 90 points per game. Although the Mercury mounted a brief comeback in the fourth quarter, the Aces maintained their lead, never trailing in the decisive game. Phoenix faced challenges, including the absence of injured forward Satou Sabally and the ejection of coach Nate Tibbetts, ultimately unable to slow down the powerful Las Vegas squad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced new 100% tariffs on imports from China, effective November 1, in response to what he termed China's "extraordinarily aggressive position on trade" regarding export controls. This move comes after China imposed restrictions on rare-earth minerals and sent a "hostile letter" to the world about impending large-scale export controls. The announcement triggered a stock market sell-off, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all tumbling. Trump also suggested he might cancel an upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, although he later clarified it was not definitively off. The tariffs are "over and above" existing 30% duties, signaling a significant escalation in the trade dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

Guitarist Joff Oddie emphasized the band's progression through their albums, culminating in "The Clearing," which embraces 1970s FM pop radio sounds, a stylistic turn from their earlier alt-rock. This evolution reflects their diverse tastes and a newfound confidence in connecting with audiences through varied musical expressions, even if it surprised some critics.</p>

          <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has rejected a Trump administration proposal that tied federal funding to specific policies, including capping foreign admissions, restricting leaders' political comments, and adopting a binary gender definition. MIT President Sally Kornbluth stated the compact was inconsistent with the university's core values and would "restrict freedom of expression" and academic independence. While MIT already uses standardized tests and has low international enrollment, the university maintains that scientific funding should be based solely on merit. This rejection follows previous federal funding cuts to MIT under the Trump administration, highlighting ongoing tensions between the government and higher education institutions over academic autonomy.</p>

          <p>Maiwand Banayee, a 45-year-old former Taliban fighter, has written a book, "Delusions of Paradise," detailing his journey from being ready to die for the Taliban to deradicalization. Radicalized at 14 in a Pakistani refugee camp during the Afghan civil war, Banayee was lured by promises of glory and an erotic afterlife. He joined the Taliban in 1996, enforcing their laws and propaganda, but began questioning his path after witnessing cruelty and disrespect. Now living in the UK, he works for the NHS and hopes his story will prevent a new generation from being exposed to extremism, especially with the rise of religious schools in Afghanistan since the Taliban's 2021 return to power.</p>

          <p>Many people experience "autumn blues" as days shorten, leading to tiredness and lethargy, often linked to decreased serotonin and increased melatonin. The article highlights two main approaches to combat this seasonal shift. Some, like Lotts Dlandu, actively combat it by planning social events, avoiding working from home, and maximizing exposure to natural light. Others embrace the season by creating a cozy environment with baths, candles, and warm drinks, romanticizing the colder months. Experts emphasize the importance of a balanced diet, exercise, time outdoors, and consistent sleep schedules. For more severe symptoms, seasonal affective disorder (SAD) may be a factor, warranting a GP visit.</p>

The government had incorrectly claimed Ghana and Eswatini would take him, while Costa Rica, which agreed to grant him refugee status, was not pursued.

Wilders, known for his anti-Islam and anti-immigrant stance, has been under constant police protection since 2004 due to death threats.

While the number of affected customers and service restoration timeline remain undisclosed, this incident highlights a broader issue of infrastructure theft.

Key moments included US envoys refining the plan with Qatari, Turkish, and Egyptian leaders, and an apology from Israeli PM Netanyahu to Qatar for a past airstrike.

Experts like BAAPS President Nora Nugent note evolving techniques and weight-loss medications as factors, but warn against complex procedures for younger individuals and highlight significant risks.

Lawyers report that many immigrants, fearing arrest, are now skipping court dates, which can lead to automatic deportation orders. Data shows that a significant portion of those arrested at Federal Plaza since Trump's inauguration had no criminal convictions, indicating a broadened scope of enforcement.

          <p>Joshua Rash was tragically murdered in a Sacramento encampment when 62-year-old Richard Bradford shot him in an attempt to kidnap Rash's dog. Rash, armed with a metal pole, tried to protect his companion but was fatally wounded. When authorities found Rash's body, his loyal dog remained faithfully by his side, a poignant testament to their bond. Bradford was later sentenced to 76 years to life for second-degree murder, with the jury also finding he used a weapon and was a convicted felon. The article does not disclose what happened to the dog following the heartbreaking incident, leaving its fate unknown after such a profound display of loyalty.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old military horse from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, has retired to the country after sustaining injuries during a runaway incident in central London. Quaker was one of five horses spooked by construction noise, leading to them bolting through the city, colliding with vehicles, and causing injuries to personnel and the animals themselves. Quaker suffered bleeding and a small break, necessitating surgery and ultimately preventing his return to duty, unlike the other four horses. The Horse Trust sanctuary, which provides respite and retirement for military horses, has taken Quaker in, ensuring he can enjoy a peaceful life after his service.</p>

          <p>China, in collaboration with the United States and Thailand, has seized a record 4,973.4kg of methamphetamine near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. The operation, which occurred in February but was only recently disclosed, involved the Chinese anti-drug agency and Coast Guard acting on intelligence from the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Royal Thai Police. Seven suspects were arrested in what marks the largest single maritime drug seizure in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. Representatives from the three nations have since met to strengthen cooperation and deepen efforts to dismantle international drug trafficking syndicates, highlighting a significant win against organized crime.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Silicon Valley is increasingly concerned about a potential AI bubble, with critics questioning if the rapid rise in AI company valuations is due to "financial engineering." OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged some parts of AI are "bubbly," though he believes his company is different. Warnings have come from the Bank of England, IMF, and JP Morgan. Early AI entrepreneur Jerry Kaplan fears a severe economic downturn if the bubble bursts, given the vast sums involved. Complex deals, like OpenAI's investments with Nvidia and AMD, are being called "circular financing," where companies invest in customers to boost demand. While some hope infrastructure investments won't be wasted, concerns about unsustainable growth and the drying up of funding are mounting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major U.S. online retailers have removed millions of listings for prohibited Chinese electronics, including home security cameras and smartwatches from companies like Huawei and Hikvision, following a crackdown by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). FCC Chair Brendan Carr stated these items were either on a U.S. barred list or unauthorized, posing national security risks by potentially allowing China to surveil Americans or disrupt communications. The FCC plans further restrictions, including a vote this month to prohibit authorization of devices with Covered List components and potentially ban previously authorized equipment. This action is part of broader U.S. efforts against Chinese tech companies deemed national security threats.</p>

          <p>Erroll Southers, an ex-FBI agent and USC security expert, is stepping down from the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners after a two-year tenure marked by controversy. Southers, who led the search for a new LAPD chief, faced condemnation from activists for his past counterterrorism research in Israel, a topic that became particularly sensitive due to the ongoing crisis in Gaza. Citing a desire to spend more time with family and pursue other professional opportunities, Southers' departure underscores the increasing difficulty in filling positions on this influential civilian panel. His resignation leaves another vacancy on the commission, which has struggled with appointments and public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>New UK passports, set to be issued from December, will feature King Charles III's coat of arms on the cover, marking the first full redesign in five years. The updated documents will also showcase natural landscapes from all four UK nations, including Ben Nevis and the Giant's Causeway, and incorporate enhanced anti-forgery security features. While passports have been issued in the King's name since 2023, this change finalizes the transition of royal insignia on the cover, replacing Queen Elizabeth II's coat of arms. The government advises citizens to check passport validity and renew in advance of travel, emphasizing the blend of British heritage with modern security.</p>

          <p>Security footage has been released showing former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez before and after an altercation in downtown Indianapolis that led to him being charged with a Level 5 felony battery. The footage shows Sanchez, a Fox Sports analyst, stumbling and walking aimlessly just past midnight, then running towards an alley where he reportedly confronted truck driver Perry Tole. Tole claims he acted in self-defense, pepper-spraying and stabbing Sanchez after Sanchez became aggressive and allegedly smelled of alcohol. Sanchez is seen fleeing the scene with stab wounds. The charge could be upgraded depending on Tole's injuries, which include a large gash on his cheek.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>La Niña, the climate pattern typically linked to drought, has officially returned to the Pacific Ocean, signaling a potentially dangerously dry winter for Southern California. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirmed the re-emergence of these conditions, which significantly contributed to the region's previous below-average rainfall and destructive wildfires. Southern California continues to experience severe drought, and experts warn that a weak, second-year La Niña could further intensify these challenges, even as warming ocean temperatures magnify some of its impacts. NOAA forecasts a 55% probability of La Niña persisting through at least December, increasing the likelihood of drier-than-average conditions for the southern half of the state.</p>

          <p>A significant increase in Chagos Islanders arriving at Heathrow Airport to claim British citizenship has sparked a dispute over housing costs for local councils. Hillingdon Council, which has seen over 600 arrivals since last July, anticipates spending £2m this year on its legal duty to house homeless British-Chagossians, straining its finances. Many islanders are leaving Mauritius, feeling unsafe after the UK agreed to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a deal they view as a betrayal. They fear prosecution for supporting UK sovereignty, with some, like Damien Dursonial, arriving to seek safety and recognition as British citizens, highlighting the complex humanitarian and political dimensions of the situation.</p>
