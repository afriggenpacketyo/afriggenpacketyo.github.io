          <p>The United States and Britain announced a trade deal that would reduce tariffs on some imports, including steel, cars, and ethanol. The agreement, hailed as a success by both countries, marks the first trade deal since President Trump announced broad tariffs in April. However, the deal is still being finalized and could take weeks or more of additional negotiations. The agreement provides relief for Britain's auto industry, which faced higher tariffs that endangered jobs. While the deal is a positive step, it is not expected to be an economic game-changer, as British goods exports still face higher tariffs than before.</p>

          <p>Cameron Hamilton, the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was removed from his position after he testified before Congress that the agency should not be eliminated. This decision came a day after Hamilton stated that FEMA was vital to communities in times of need, contradicting President Trump's previous suggestions to disband the agency. The move raises concerns about the administration's commitment to disaster preparedness and response, especially with the hurricane season approaching. The article explores the implications of this leadership change and the ongoing debate over FEMA's role.</p>

          <p>Columbia University's approach to pro-Palestinian protests has shifted, becoming more assertive compared to previous incidents.

The article explores the evolving dynamics of pro-Palestinian activism on campus and the university's efforts to balance free expression with maintaining order.

          <p>Affirm's stock experienced a significant decline after the company provided revenue guidance for the current quarter that fell short of analysts' expectations. Despite reporting better-than-expected earnings per share for the prior quarter, the company's outlook dampened investor sentiment. Affirm's business performance is closely linked to consumer spending, with its buy now, pay later loans being popular among retailers of electronics, apparel, and travel. The U.S. economy's contraction in the first quarter of 2025, influenced by Trump's tariffs, added to concerns about the company's near-term prospects.</p>

The charges stemmed from a 2022 accusation by a woman who claimed Haggis sexually assaulted her over two days. Haggis has maintained his innocence, claiming the encounter was consensual.
