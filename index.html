          <p>President Trump and Russian President Putin have convened in Anchorage, Alaska, for a critical summit aimed at negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting, which excludes Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, is being closely watched by European allies who fear a potential deal might compromise Ukraine's territory and sovereignty. Both leaders are accompanied by high-level delegations, including secretaries of state and defense ministers, to discuss a potential ceasefire, economic cooperation, and broader security issues. The outcome of these direct talks is anticipated to significantly shape the future of the conflict and regional stability.</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell by nearly 14% after the company issued a weak financial forecast, citing demand pressures and uncertainty in its China market. The company's projected revenue and earnings per share for the upcoming quarter fell short of analyst expectations. CEO Gary Dickerson attributed the downturn to macroeconomic issues and trade-related uncertainty, noting that Chinese clients are reducing their spending after a period of rapid expansion. Despite the poor outlook, the company's earnings and revenue for the previous quarter exceeded estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A copy of the parenting book "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" was recently returned to the San Antonio Public Library, nearly 82 years after it was checked out in 1943. The book was discovered by a person in Oregon among their late father's belongings and was mailed back with a letter explaining its long journey. The sender speculated their grandmother, who moved to Mexico City for a U.S. Embassy job, had borrowed it. Fortunately for the family, the library stopped charging late fees in 2021, saving them from a potential fine of almost $900.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun preemptively canceling hundreds of flights as a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants looms, threatening to ground the nation's largest airline. The carrier announced a gradual suspension of operations, which could impact about 130,000 travelers daily if a full work stoppage occurs. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract negotiations stalled over key issues, including wages and unpaid work time. The airline has stated that customers with canceled flights will be eligible for full refunds and that it is trying to arrange alternative travel options.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting a new, American-made electric pickup truck designed to be highly affordable by simplifying the base model and offering extensive customization options.

However, the vehicle's competitiveness is being questioned, especially after the rollback of federal EV tax credits, which raises its starting price. Analysts are watching to see if consumers will still be attracted to the truck at a higher price point compared to other available models.</p>

          <p>Rapper Sean Kingston, legally named Kisean Anderson, has been sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison for his involvement in a million-dollar fraud scheme. He was convicted alongside his mother for orchestrating a plan to obtain luxury goods, including an SUV and jewelry, without payment by using fake wire transfer receipts. Kingston and his mother were arrested in May 2024 following a raid on his rented Florida mansion. In addition to his prison sentence, he will face three years of supervised release and is also confronting separate state-level fraud charges.</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has approved a 21% budget cut in response to recent congressional legislation that stripped approximately $1 billion in funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The CPB, a key financial supporter of public media like PBS and NPR, is now winding down its operations. These cuts are expected to severely impact local member stations, particularly smaller ones and those in rural areas, with some already announcing staff reductions.

This move has fueled market speculation that another round of activist pressure could be imminent, similar to a successful campaign in 2022-2023 that pushed for greater efficiency and profitability. Analysts suggest this renewed pressure could force management to refocus on core business growth and margin expansion. The stock had been underperforming recently amid concerns about the impact of AI on its business model and skepticism over recent acquisition strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

This issue, known as "boarding," affects approximately one in ten pediatric mental health ER visits for children on Medicaid. The primary causes for these visits are depressive disorders and suicidal ideation. Experts attribute the problem to a nationwide shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds and inadequate outpatient mental health services, which forces families to turn to ERs that are ill-equipped for long-term psychiatric care.</p>

The analysis also highlights that high-income areas, such as resort towns like Jackson Hole, Wyoming, will experience disproportionately large tax cuts.

          <p>Airlines are finding the peak summer travel season less predictably profitable as consumer behaviors change and economic pressures mount. Carriers have reduced their August flight schedules as travelers increasingly book trips in late spring or shift European vacations to the fall to avoid heat and crowds. This year, airlines also cut fares to attract customers hesitant due to economic uncertainty, which impacted initial profit forecasts. In response, carriers like American and Southwest are adjusting their 2026 schedules to better align with these new demand patterns, reflecting a more complex and challenging operating environment.</p>

          <p>Four-time Olympic champion Michael Johnson has announced that his new athletics circuit, Grand Slam Track, will not proceed with its 2026 season until all athletes from its inaugural 2025 season are paid. The upstart league, which attracted top talent with the promise of high salaries and prize money, is reportedly facing a shortfall of around $13 million. Johnson stated that committed funding failed to materialize due to circumstances beyond his control, leading to the cancellation of the season finale and the current financial crisis.

          <p>The new film "East of Wall" is a docu-fiction hybrid that tells the story of a struggling South Dakota ranch matriarch and her rodeo-star daughter, who play versions of themselves. The review praises the movie for its authentic depiction of the hardships and resilience required to run a horse ranch while dealing with financial uncertainty and personal loss. While the film's narrative structure is sometimes less polished than other works in the genre, its strength lies in the lived-in performances of its first-time actors. The movie successfully captures the spirit of renegade women forging their own path in a demanding environment.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent statements about crime in Washington, D.C., which he used to justify a federal takeover of the city's police, reveals his claims are misleading. While D.C. did experience a crime spike in 2023, data from the city's police department and independent organizations show a significant decrease in violent crime and homicides in 2024 and 2025. When compared to other major U.S. cities, rather than states, Washington D.C.'s homicide rate is not the highest in the nation. The President's framing omits the recent downward trend in crime rates across both the city and the country.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a financial stake in Intel, a D.A. Davidson technology analyst has described the potential intervention as "essential" for U.S. national security. The argument is that government support is necessary to revitalize the struggling chipmaker and reduce American dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. Intel's stock rose over 6% on the news. This move would align with the administration's goal of bringing more high-end technology manufacturing back to the U.S., potentially using funds from the CHIPS Act to structure the deal.

          <p>The U.S. economy is presenting a confusing picture, with conflicting data points leaving economists and the central bank uncertain about the future. While the labor market has shown worrisome signs with sluggish job creation, consumer spending has remained surprisingly resilient, helping to avoid a recession so far. President Trump's tariff policies and immigration crackdown are seen as risks that could lead to "stagflation," a combination of stagnant growth and rising prices.

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic reflects on the literary craft of Scottish author Muriel Spark, focusing on her most famous novel, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." The article highlights Spark's "steely command of omniscience" and her exploration of adolescent moral education through the story of a group of schoolgirls influenced by their unorthodox teacher in 1930s Edinburgh. The essay notes that the novel's central theme is rooted in Spark's Catholic faith, examining how the characters navigate the powerful, god-like influence of their teacher. It concludes that Spark realistically portrays the lasting impact such a magnetic figure can have on a young person's life.</p>

Ukraine seeks a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from its internationally recognized territory and an end to the conflict on its terms. Conversely, Russia is expected to push for territorial concessions, including recognition of its control over annexed regions, and guarantees against Ukraine's future NATO membership.
