          <p>Ulta Beauty and Target have announced the termination of their "shop-in-shop" partnership, which will conclude in August 2026. The collaboration, initiated in 2021, saw over 600 Ulta Beauty locations open within Target stores, a move intended to drive customer traffic and boost sales in the beauty category. The dissolution of the deal is seen as a potential setback for Target, which has been facing declining sales and store traffic amid broader business challenges. Analysts suggest that operational issues at Target may have contributed to the decision to end the partnership.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in UnitedHealth, acquiring over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. This move comes as a surprise given the insurer's recent struggles, including a Justice Department investigation and a significant drop in its stock price this year. The investment, potentially made by one of Buffett's lieutenants, caused UnitedHealth's shares to surge in after-hours trading, reflecting market confidence in Berkshire's value-investing strategy. Berkshire also disclosed new smaller stakes in several other companies, including Nucor and homebuilders Lennar and DR Horton.</p>

The former president's involvement highlights the national significance of the political standoff in Texas.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by coach Brian Flores against the NFL can proceed to trial. The court rejected the league's attempt to move the case into its internal arbitration process, which would have been overseen by Commissioner Roger Goodell. The ruling stated the NFL's arbitration system "provides for arbitration in name only" and lacks independence. Flores' 2022 lawsuit alleges systemic racism in the hiring and promotion of Black coaches, a claim supported by two other coaches who later joined the suit.</p>

They criticized the president's description of the city as a "lawless wasteland," arguing such rhetoric is dehumanizing and counterproductive to public safety. The clergy emphasized that long-term solutions, not a military presence, are needed to address crime's root causes, such as poverty and lack of mental health services.

However, after failing to secure a significant role, he has opted to return to rugby in his home country. Rees-Zammit expressed excitement about joining Bristol, a club whose values align with his own ambitious goals.</p>

Ryan Wear is accused of selling investors non-existent water vending machines and using new investor funds to pay returns to earlier ones. The second man, former fund manager Jordan Chirico, allegedly invested over $100 million of client money into the fraudulent company while concealing his personal financial stake in it. The scheme reportedly targeted many retail investors, including military veterans, and both men face up to 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>For retirees seeking stable income amidst economic volatility, utilizing multiple annuities can be a viable but complex strategy. Financial experts suggest that owning different types of annuities, such as fixed and variable, can help balance guaranteed income with potential for market growth. However, this approach requires careful coordination of liquidity, as each contract has unique surrender periods and withdrawal penalties. Managing multiple annuities also increases paperwork and the need for a clear organizational system, making professional financial and tax advice crucial for effective implementation.

On the ground, the airdrops create chaos and desperation, as residents scramble for the pallets, which often land unpredictably and are seized by the strongest individuals.

For Trump, the summit represents an opportunity to project himself as a global peacemaker and potentially end the war, a key promise from his campaign.

          <h2>Historical and Geographical Factors Make Alaska an Ideal Venue for Trump-Putin Summit</h2>

          <p>Alaska was chosen as the location for the summit between Presidents Trump and Putin due to its unique geographical and historical connections to both the U.S. and Russia. Geographically, it offers a relatively convenient and secure location for both leaders. Historically, Alaska was once a Russian colony before being sold to the U.S. in the 19th century, leaving a legacy of Russian Orthodox communities in the state. During the Cold War, it became a strategic frontline for U.S. defense, and its proximity has been used by Russians seeking to enter the U.S. more recently.</p>

          <h2>Experts Warn Tariff-Related Price Hikes Are Being Temporarily Absorbed in Supply Chain</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While consumers have not yet felt the full impact of recent tariffs, logistics experts warn that price increases are currently being absorbed in the "middle mile" of the supply chain. U.S. importers have front-loaded their freight to avoid higher rates, causing inventory to build up in warehouses and distribution centers. This has temporarily shielded consumers from inflation, but experts expect these higher costs to be passed on as the stored inventory moves to retail shelves in the coming months. The situation has created a bifurcated peak season and increased demand and prices for warehouse space.</p>

          <p>At MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, researchers are developing AI to enable humanoid robots to operate safely and effectively in human environments. Led by Professor Daniela Rus, the team is training a robot named Ruby to perform tasks like preparing a drink by collecting data from humans. Students wear sensors to capture motion and force, teaching the robot nuanced actions like how tightly to grip an object. The goal is to create machines that can perform tasks repeatedly and adapt to changing surroundings, moving beyond the repetitive functions of current industrial robots.</p>

          <h2>A History of Deference and Distrust Defines Trump-Putin Relationship Ahead of Summit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 14:43:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The relationship between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, marked by a complex history, adds a layer of intrigue to their upcoming summit in Anchorage. Trump has often expressed a desire to work with Putin and was notably deferential during their 2018 Helsinki summit, where he appeared to side with Putin's denial of election interference over U.S. intelligence findings. However, Trump has recently expressed frustration with Putin over the war in Ukraine, admitting that the Russian leader's assurances have been "meaningless." This vacillating history, from public alignment to private irritation, creates an unpredictable dynamic for their high-stakes negotiations over the war.</p>

          <p>A Department of Justice employee has been fired and charged with a felony after he admitted to throwing a sandwich at a federal agent in Washington, D.C. The incident occurred amidst the increased federal law enforcement presence in the city, with the man, Sean Dunn, allegedly yelling profanities at the officers before the assault. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the termination on social media, stating that disrespect for law enforcement would not be tolerated in the administration. Dunn, who worked as a trial attorney, was charged with one count of assaulting a federal law enforcement officer.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to block a Mississippi law that requires social media companies to verify users' ages and obtain parental consent for minors. The decision allows the law to take effect while legal challenges continue in lower courts. The tech industry group NetChoice had sued, arguing the law unconstitutionally restricts free speech by limiting access to a wide range of information. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that the law is likely unconstitutional under current precedents but agreed with the court's denial of an emergency stay for procedural reasons.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer is selling its entire position in Coterra Energy, citing the company's poor performance amid lackluster energy commodity prices. The investment was initially intended as a hedge against potential energy price spikes, but the company's strategy of shifting between crude oil and natural gas has not been successful this year. Cramer noted that a company "can't outrun your commodity" when the prices for both are weak. The potential for a deal between President Trump and Russia to increase oil supply further solidified the decision to exit the position at a loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The AI software company Palantir has experienced a dramatic surge of over 1,700% since its 2020 direct listing, reaching a market valuation of over $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Army, which now account for 55% of the company's revenue. While its U.S. commercial revenue is also growing rapidly, its international commercial segment has declined. The company's valuation is exceptionally high compared to its peers, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio far exceeding that of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, reflecting immense investor optimism about its future.</p>
