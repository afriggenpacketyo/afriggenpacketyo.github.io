          <p>Juneteenth, a portmanteau of June and nineteenth, marks the day in 1865 when the last enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom, more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. The holiday gained federal recognition in 2021 amid growing calls for acknowledgment of emancipation's significance in U.S. history. While some corporate sponsorships for Juneteenth events have tapered off, communities nationwide continue to celebrate with parades, concerts, and cultural events. Opal Lee, known as the "Grandmother of Juneteenth," played a pivotal role in advocating for the holiday's federal recognition, emphasizing its meaning of freedom for everyone. The holiday is a reminder of the country's foundation on centuries of slavery.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are debating the worth of high-yield savings accounts, noting that while interest rates have decreased, they still offer better returns than traditional savings accounts. High-yield accounts are recommended for short-term financial goals and emergency funds, but are not a substitute for long-term investing. The accounts provide an opportunity to earn more interest compared to traditional savings accounts, with rates remaining relatively high due to competition among online banks. Experts advise considering CDs as an alternative and emphasize that high-yield savings accounts should be part of an overall financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An increasing number of bankruptcy filings include retail credit card debt, exacerbated by record-high interest rates. Store credit cards typically have higher interest rates than traditional cards, reflecting the risk associated with their holders. Despite banks raising rates in anticipation of capped late fees, these rates remain elevated even after the caps were not implemented. This situation makes it harder for consumers to pay off debt, contributing to a rise in bankruptcy filings involving retail credit card debt.

          <p>The Stanley Cup suffered damage during the Florida Panthers' celebration of their championship victory, with a crack in the bowl and a dent in the bottom. This is not an unusual occurrence, as the trophy has endured various mishaps throughout its 131-year history. The Hockey Hall of Fame plans to repair the Cup before the celebration parade on Sunday. Previous incidents include the Tampa Bay Lightning dropping the Cup during a boat parade and the Colorado Avalanche denting it on the ice.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the hollowness of Juneteenth as a federal holiday, arguing that it is celebrated amidst a national retreat from racial egalitarianism. The author notes that the holiday's establishment coincided with a backlash against racial justice initiatives, including the dismantling of DEI programs and threats to civil rights protections. While Juneteenth celebrates emancipation, the author suggests it now serves as a reminder of the hypocrisy of commemorating progress while the government undermines policies that made it possible. The author concludes that what was promised was a reckoning, what was received was a day off.</p>

Critics argue that the focus should be on providing affordable healthcare, childcare, and support for families, rather than offering one-time financial incentives. The underlying assumption that individuals inherently want children is also challenged, with calls for greater recognition of diverse life goals and choices.</p>
