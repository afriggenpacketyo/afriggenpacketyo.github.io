          <p>A top gambling regulator warns that the booming U.S. gambling industry is becoming a "highway without speed limits," urging lawmakers to consider nationwide rules on advertising and exclusion lists. Jordan Maynard, chair of the Massachusetts gaming commission, calls for greater oversight to protect consumers from harm. He highlights the need for regulators to balance the industry's economic benefits with the social impact of gambling's rise. Maynard's scrutiny has faced resistance from operators, who often warn that regulations will drive gamblers to illegal platforms.</p>

The FBI informed the Costellos of the attack due to their visible Jewish identity, as they display a mezuzah on their door. Soliman, an illegal Egyptian immigrant, admitted to planning the attack and expressed a desire to harm "Zionist people"; he is being held on a $10 million bond and faces multiple charges, including attempted murder and federal hate crimes.</p>

Ohio, which involves a heterosexual woman who sued for discrimination after not being hired for a management position and subsequently demoted, with a lesbian hired instead.

The case highlights the complexities of discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, particularly concerning sexual orientation.

          <p>Ukrainian forces launched a drone barrage targeting Moscow, with at least 10 drones shot down on approach, according to the city's mayor. Simultaneously, Russian forces continued their long-range strikes into Ukraine, with the Ukrainian air force reporting numerous drones and missiles fired into the country. President Zelenskyy emphasized the need to strengthen Ukraine's air defense capabilities and urged Western partners to do more to pressure Putin. Zelenskyy framed Russia's attacks as evidence that Putin is not genuine in his willingness to negotiate a peace deal.</p>

Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that this investment will create jobs and boost security. However, research backers emphasize the need for a decade-long plan to train workers and address challenges such as visa costs and inflation to maintain the UK's scientific reputation.</p>
