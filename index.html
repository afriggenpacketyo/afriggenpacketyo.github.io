          <p>Audio recordings from former President Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur have been released, revealing instances where Biden joked about being a "young man" despite struggling with his memory. The recordings, which corroborate the transcripts released earlier, capture Biden's difficulty recalling key events such as the death of his son Beau and the year Donald Trump was elected. Hur's report, while declining to press charges, described Biden as a sympathetic elderly man with a poor memory, sparking criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. Biden ultimately dropped out of the presidential race in July, citing age and mental acuity concerns, leading to Kamala Harris' defeat by Trump in the November election.</p>

          <p>Beth Potter, an Olympic triathlon bronze medalist, achieved second place in the World Triathlon Championship Series held in Yokohama, Japan. Potter finished closely behind Jeanne Lehair of Luxembourg, despite recording the fastest run leg of the race. The event saw reigning Olympic and world champion Cassandre Beaugrand crash during the bike leg. Weather conditions led to adjustments in the bike course, and Potter's group managed to catch up with the leaders by the third lap. In the Para races, Lauren Steadman secured a comfortable victory in the women's PT5 category, while Michael Taylor won silver in the men's PT4.</p>

          <p>The Sunday Times rich list has sparked a debate about extreme wealth and its impact on society, with some arguing that the term 'rich list' is inadequate to describe the concentration of wealth. The gap between the wealthy and the average person has tripled since 1989, raising concerns about the power that extreme wealth grants individuals in shaping politics and harming the environment. There is growing support for establishing an 'extreme wealth line,' similar to the extreme poverty line, to define the point at which wealth becomes harmful to society and requires policy intervention. The article suggests measures such as raising tax rates or compelling donations to charity for those exceeding this line.</p>

          <p>Germany has tightened its border controls, particularly along the Austro-German border, to combat illegal immigration, as announced by Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt. This move signals a shift from former Chancellor Angela Merkel's open asylum policies, with a focus on prioritizing 'order' alongside humanity. Asylum-seekers are now being turned back at the border, with exceptions only for vulnerable individuals. The increased border security measures, involving additional police officers and advanced surveillance technology, have led to a rise in thwarted illegal entry attempts. This policy change comes amid electoral successes of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD), but has faced criticism from neighboring countries like Poland.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has voiced reservations about banning the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), despite the party being classified as a 'confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor' by Germany's domestic intelligence agency. Merz emphasized the need for concrete proof that the AfD is actively working against the liberal and democratic order in Germany, suggesting that banning a political party should be approached with caution to avoid appearing as a means of eliminating political opponents. While a majority of Germans believe the AfD's agenda conflicts with democracy, the rule of law, and human dignity, the approach to dealing with the party remains a divisive issue within German society.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, revealing insights into the origins and diversification of Indigenous groups. The findings suggest that the early settlers split into distinct groups, adapting to different environments and leading to the formation of unique genetic traits. This research provides a valuable genetic and cultural understanding of present-day South American communities and helps preserve the legacy of endangered Indigenous groups.</p>

          <p>Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry showed their frustration during the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow, with Lowry lashing out at the course and Hatton swearing at his club. Lowry's outburst came after being denied relief for an embedded ball, leading to a bogey. Hatton's temper flared after pulling his tee shot into a creek, resulting in a costly triple bogey. Both players are likely to face fines for their on-course behavior, highlighting the pressures of the championship.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans early Friday morning, prompting a large-scale manhunt. The inmates, who may have received assistance from jail workers, broke out through a hole in a cell wall and left the facility in civilian clothes after shedding their orange jail uniforms. As of Friday night, three of the escapees had been captured, while the remaining seven are considered armed and dangerous. The escape has led to criticism of the Sheriff’s Office and an investigation into security failures, including defective locks and doors, as well as inoperable security cameras.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has implemented a series of tariffs against various countries and industries, some of which are active, while others have been paused or exempted. Active tariffs include a 10% universal tariff, 25% on cars and auto parts (with exceptions), 30% on Chinese imports (with exceptions), and 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered by the USMCA. Paused tariffs include 'reciprocal' tariffs and higher tariffs on Chinese goods. Key exemptions have been made for goods covered by the USMCA and certain electronics imported from China. Trump continues to threaten more tariffs on specific industries, but their implementation remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Poland is preparing for a presidential election that could determine the future of the pro-European, center-left government led by Donald Tusk. The election pits left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Tusk, against national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, who is supported by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party. The outcome will decide whether Tusk's government can advance its reform agenda, which has been stymied by the current president's vetoes and referrals to the constitutional court.
