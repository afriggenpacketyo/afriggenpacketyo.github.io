        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Footwear company Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, marking the end of its nearly three-decade run as a public company. The acquisition price represents a 30% premium to Skechers' current market valuation, leading to a surge in shares by over 25% following the announcement. Skechers' CEO, Robert Greenberg, will remain in his position after the acquisition is complete, and he believes this partnership will support the company's long-term growth. The deal occurs amidst challenges in the retail industry, including uncertainties stemming from global trade policies, although sources indicate that 3G Capital's interest predates these recent concerns.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education is resuming collections on defaulted student loans after a nearly five-year pause, coinciding with data showing delinquency rates among borrowers are at an all-time high. TransUnion analysis indicates roughly 20% of student loan borrowers are at risk of defaulting, exceeding the previous high in 2012. Borrowers in default may face wage garnishment and damage to their credit scores, potentially losing an average of 63 points, and up to 175 points for those with higher credit scores. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stated that taxpayers will no longer serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies, as the Biden administration's attempts to provide debt relief were blocked by courts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA as Newark Airport continues to experience significant delays and cancellations. Schumer cited a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, old technology, and DOGE cuts to the FAA as contributing factors to the ongoing disruptions. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights a day at Newark, and the FAA has instituted a "flow constrained area," typically seen in Florida due to heavy summer traffic or storms. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to release details of a plan to revamp the air traffic control system this week, aiming to address the staffing shortages and technological issues.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's presence in an upscale Austin enclave has sparked controversy as neighbors complain about the construction of a 16-foot chain-link fence and other unpermitted security measures around his $6 million mansion. Residents have voiced concerns over increased traffic, constant security personnel shifts, and disruptions to their quiet neighborhood. The complaints escalated to a Zoning and Planning Commission meeting after Musk's team sought retroactive permission for the projects, which violated six city ordinances. While Musk's representatives argue the security measures are necessary due to his high profile, neighbors express frustration over the lack of communication and disregard for local regulations.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are clashing over whether to repeal Biden-era clean energy tax credits, which are essential for some of their constituents, particularly in rural Alaska. The Inupiat village of Noatak, which relies on expensive diesel fuel flown in to power their homes, is now in doubt as Republicans seek to defund the Biden-era law. Senator Lisa Murkowski is advocating for keeping the tax credits, arguing that their repeal would create uncertainty and jeopardize energy sector projects. The debate highlights a divide within the Republican Party between fiscal conservatives and those representing areas benefiting from clean energy investments.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on movies made outside the United States, citing a threat to national security, has drawn criticism and concerns about xenophobia. The proposed tariff appears to target American productions that shoot overseas for tax credits, rather than foreign films. While some argue this could incentivize more U.S. film production, others worry it will limit the visual scope and diversity of international locations in big-budget filmmaking. The article suggests that Trump's announcement trades on a bit of fashionable xenophobia, implying that movies shot in other places carry dangerous levels of propaganda.</p>

          <p>Amanda Hess's new book, Second Life: Having a Child in the Digital Age, examines the pervasive trend of parents seeking expertise and optimization in child-rearing through apps, gadgets, and online courses. Hess argues that the illusion of control sold by parenting experts is ultimately unhelpful, as the true experience of parenthood cannot be replicated or perfected through technology. The article explores the pressure on parents to resolve the "problem" of parenting with techniques that stamp out childishness itself, highlighting the commodification of parental helplessness. Hess suggests that while some advice is helpful, the idea of mastery in parenting is an illusion, and that the meaningful part of parenting lies in accepting the lack of control.</p>

          <p>Meta is phasing out traditional fact-checking on Facebook, Threads, and Instagram, shifting towards a Community Notes program where users can contradict posts with clarifying or corrective text. This move, following Elon Musk's similar approach on X, aims to prioritize free expression and sidestep political scrutiny over content moderation decisions. Community Notes relies on algorithms to assess notes based on diverse positive feedback, aiming to bridge divides by accounting for varying user biases. While this approach may be cost-effective and trusted by users, it's best suited for nitpicking individual falsehoods and may not counter sophisticated disinformation campaigns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education is restarting collections on federal student loans in default, potentially causing significant damage to borrowers' credit scores. A TransUnion analysis found that consumers facing default have seen their credit scores fall by an average of 63 points, with super prime borrowers experiencing drops of up to 175 points. Experts warn that the impact worsens for those with better credit scores, making it harder to obtain credit and potentially leading to sharply higher interest rates. Borrowers should be aware of the potential consequences as collections resume.</p>

          <p>A new assessment by the European Central Bank reveals that European consumers are increasingly avoiding U.S. products and services due to President Trump's trade war. Tariffs and threats of reciprocal duties have prompted Europeans to shun American brands, with some using apps to identify and avoid U.S.-made goods. The shift suggests a potential long-term change in consumer preferences, driven by concerns over Trump's treatment of allies and trade policies. Even a small tax on American products could deter European consumers, indicating a deeper unease with U.S. brands.</p>

          <p>Central Park's north end, which had fallen into disrepair after major redevelopment in the mid-20th century, has undergone a serene makeover. During the city’s financial crisis of the 1970s, this northern section of the park, surrounded by less affluent, historically Black and Latino neighborhoods, fell into disrepair. The project encased the meer in a concrete retaining wall, and much of the landscape was paved over and built up, including with an ice rink/pool.

The author suggests that News Corporation's outlets may now be a negative force for conservatives, distorting their views and making them out of touch with middle Australia. The decline in influence is attributed to the broader trend of mainstream media losing power and the public's increasing distrust of news outlets that lack objectivity.
