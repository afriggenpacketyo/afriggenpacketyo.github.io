          <p>Senior Pentagon officials provided details on Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. mission to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff calling it the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The operation involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri to Iran, supported by fighter jets and refueling planes, while another group of B-2s acted as decoys, and over 75 precision-guided weapons were used. Initial assessments indicated severe damage to the Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with Defense Secretary Hegseth calling the attack an "incredible and overwhelming success." The U.S. warned Iran against retaliation and emphasized that the operation did not target Iranian troops or civilians. </p>

          <p>Chinese companies, known for their risk tolerance in overseas markets, are facing escalating geopolitical risks, political unrest, and security threats in conflict-ridden African nations. These ventures, particularly in mineral-rich countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sahel region, have seen attacks on mining sites, kidnappings of Chinese workers, and hijackings of Chinese-owned vessels. President Xi Jinping has called for severe punishment for those behind attacks targeting Chinese nationals, reflecting the severity of these threats. Despite these challenges, Chinese firms continue to invest heavily in Africa, balancing economic interests with the growing dangers in unstable regions.</p>

          <p>Kyoto experienced a record high of 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, with overall visitors reaching 56.06 million, the second highest on record. Despite overtourism concerns, a survey by the Kyoto city government revealed high satisfaction levels among both foreign and Japanese tourists, with over 90% expressing satisfaction with their visit. Temples, shrines, and historical sites remain popular attractions, though Japanese visitors were more likely to be bothered by crowds. To combat overtourism, Kyoto plans to implement a lodging tax increase in 2026, with revenues directed toward strengthening measures to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, President Trump addressed the possibility of regime change in Iran via a post on Truth Social. Referencing his "Make America Great Again" slogan, Trump questioned why a regime change wouldn't occur if the current Iranian leadership could not "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN." This statement comes after Trump authorized the bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, an operation he described as a "spectacular military success," radically shifting his views from his campaign promise of ‚Äúno more wars.‚Äù The president's comments signal a potential shift in U.S. policy towards Iran, opening the door to regime change.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is under renewed focus as Japan approaches its first zero giant panda moment in over half a century, amid escalating Sino-U.S. rivalry. With current pandas in Japan due to return to China, experts speculate Beijing may loan new pandas to mend relations with Tokyo, though the gesture's diplomatic impact may be limited. The pandas have symbolized friendship, and a new loan could coincide with a potential visit by a Chinese political leader. However, historical tensions and China's increasing military activities pose challenges, and the pro-Taiwan stance of a town mayor could affect panda allocations.</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a parenting expert identified five phrases that often trigger defiance in children. These phrases, such as "Because I said so" and "Stop crying," can activate a child's fight-or-flight response, hindering cooperation. Instead, the expert suggests using language that respects a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries, such as explaining decisions and acknowledging feelings. By fostering emotional safety and involving children in problem-solving, parents can create an environment where cooperation feels natural and raise emotionally resilient adults.</p>

          <p>Concerns are growing about child cyberstalking, with reports of children as young as 10 and 11 being reported to police for suspected offenses. Experts say the normalization of digital surveillance, where constant online monitoring is seen as a sign of love and care, is fueling these behaviors. The government is urged to educate young people about healthy relationships in the digital age, emphasizing that sharing locations and checking online activity should be a choice, not a condition of trust. Police are working to improve tracking of online offenses and expand the use of Stalking Protection Orders to safeguard victims.</p>

          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, is now available via NHS GPs in England, but only for individuals meeting strict criteria, including a BMI of 40 or over and multiple health conditions. This staggered approach ensures those most in need receive treatment while managing resources, with long-term plans to broaden availability. Patients will also receive "wrap-around" care, including exercise and diet support. While some GP practices caution patients not meeting the criteria against booking appointments, concerns arise that demand will exceed supply, and some GPs need training to safely administer the injections.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it a "spectacular military success" aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with Defense Department officials confirming the use of B-2 Spirit bombers and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles. Trump warned Iran against retaliation, while the U.S. communicated that regime change was not planned. The strikes have drawn mixed reactions from U.S. lawmakers and international officials, raising concerns about escalating tensions in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. This vital trade route, connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitates the transit of millions of barrels of oil daily. The U.S. has called on China to prevent Iran from closing the strait, as any interference could disrupt international energy markets and economies. Secretary of State Rubio warned that such a move would be "suicidal" for Iran, likely triggering backlash from numerous countries.</p>

Prime Minister Starmer has repeatedly called for de-escalation, raising questions within the government about the legality of involvement. The U.S. chose to act alone, sending planes directly from America, avoiding the need for the UK to authorize use of its military base on Diego Garcia. Depending on Iran's response, the UK may face difficult trade-offs between maintaining a good relationship with the U.S. and pursuing de-escalation efforts.</p>
