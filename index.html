        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China executed Zhong Changchun for fatally stabbing a 10-year-old Japanese schoolboy in Shenzhen last September; the boy died from his injuries. The Japanese embassy expressed solemnity over the execution, considering the murder of an innocent child an unforgivable crime and urging China to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals. The incident, occurring on a politically sensitive date, heightened fears among Japanese living in China and fueled diplomatic tensions amid allegations of xenophobia. This execution follows a series of attacks on foreigners in China, including the stabbing of four American teachers in Jilin, with heightened online nationalism contributing to anti-foreigner sentiment.</p>

          <p>China's CATL, the world's largest EV battery supplier, announced its second-generation Shenxing battery, claiming a new global record for superfast charging technology. The company states the battery can add 520 km (323 miles) of driving range in just five minutes of charging time, potentially exceeding BYD's recent fast-charging system. If proven feasible on a larger scale, CATL's technology could alleviate consumer concerns about EV range and convenience, placing it ahead of Western competitors like Tesla and Mercedes-Benz in charging speeds.</p>

          <p>Individuals with ADHD often struggle with "time blindness," making it difficult to accurately perceive and manage time, which can impact work and relationships. Time blindness stems from neurological differences affecting executive functions like planning and attention. Strategies to manage this include breaking tasks into smaller steps, using visual timers, and creating structured schedules to improve time estimation and adherence to deadlines. Understanding the neurological basis of time blindness can help foster self-compassion and promote effective coping mechanisms.</p>

          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar presents a complex challenge for central banks worldwide, requiring them to balance the benefits of a stronger local currency against the risks to export competitiveness and inflation. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and potentially allow for interest rate cuts, it may also complicate export strategies and prompt concerns about capital flight. Central banks are cautiously weighing currency devaluation to avoid sparking a currency war and destabilizing the global economy.</p>
