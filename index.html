          <p>A 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck Istanbul, Turkey, causing widespread fear and prompting residents to evacuate buildings. The earthquake's epicenter was located in the Sea of Marmara, southwest of Istanbul, at a shallow depth of approximately 6 miles. Several aftershocks followed, including one measuring 5.3, leading the disaster management agency to urge residents to stay away from potentially unstable structures. While initial reports indicated no serious damage or injuries, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality confirmed the absence of critical incidents. Turkey is situated on major fault lines and experiences frequent seismic activity, recalling the devastating 2023 earthquake that resulted in over 53,000 fatalities.</p>

          <p>The European Union has fined Apple 500 million euros and Meta 200 million euros for violating the bloc's digital competition rules. Apple was penalized for preventing app makers from informing users about cheaper options outside its App Store, while Meta was fined for requiring Facebook and Instagram users to either see ads or pay to avoid them. These penalties are issued under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), aimed at giving consumers and businesses more choice and preventing Big Tech companies from dominating digital markets. Both companies plan to appeal the decisions, arguing the EU is unfairly targeting American businesses.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed thousands of acres, leading to mandatory evacuations for approximately 3,000 residents in Ocean and Lacey townships. The fire, which started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has prompted the closure of major roads, including parts of the Garden State Parkway, and cut off power to around 25,000 homes and businesses. While evacuation orders have been lifted for some areas, Route 9 remains closed. Firefighters are working to contain the blaze, which is currently only 10% contained, and protect over 1,300 structures under threat, though no injuries have been reported.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The anti-abortion movement in the U.S. is increasingly pushing for legislation that would treat fetuses as people, potentially subjecting women who have abortions to homicide charges. This shift is attributed to the movement's growing alignment with the Republican party and the rise of "abortion abolitionists" who believe women should be punished for having abortions. While such measures are unpopular with the majority of Americans, the movement is focusing on influencing judges and courts rather than public opinion. Experts suggest this reflects a broader trend of abandoning democratic norms and prioritizing ideological consistency over voter sentiment.</p>

          <p>The UK government aims to clear the driving test backlog by next summer, reducing the number of learner drivers waiting more than five months for practical tests. The government plans to provide at least 10,000 extra driving tests per month to tackle the issue. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged that current waiting times are "totally unacceptable" and outlined measures to double training capacity and incentivize qualified examiners to return to the frontline. The government is also consulting on changes to the test booking system to address the delays.</p>

The author argues that the emphasis on inherited destiny and messianic figures diminishes the importance of ordinary rebels and collective action. The franchise's later installments, including the introduction of Rey as the daughter of the Emperor, reinforce this trope, suggesting that societal change is best left to extraordinary individuals.
