          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated on Truth Social that Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson should be imprisoned for what he described as their failure to protect federal immigration officers. Both officials responded on X, with Pritzker framing the call as a step toward authoritarianism and Johnson noting it was not the first time Trump had sought the unjust arrest of a Black man. The exchange occurs amid heightened tensions in Chicago over the increased presence and enforcement actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has led to local executive orders limiting federal access to city property.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of gold has surpassed a record $4,000 per ounce as investors seek safe-haven assets due to global economic and political instability. This significant rally is fueled by concerns over trade tariffs, the ongoing U.S. government shutdown delaying key economic data, and a weakening U.S. dollar. Central banks have also been major buyers, shifting away from U.S. treasuries to diversify their reserves. Analysts note that while the surge is driven by short-term uncertainty, the long-term trend is supported by strategic purchases from institutional and retail investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's massive investment in science and technology, which grew to 3.3 trillion yuan in 2023, is not being distributed equitably, creating significant hurdles for researchers at non-prestigious institutions. The article highlights the story of a physicist who abandoned his career after eight failed grant applications, illustrating a systemic issue where the bulk of funding is allocated to a small number of top-tier teams. This imbalance poses a challenge to Beijing's ambition to achieve global leadership in science and technology by potentially stifling a broader base of innovation and talent.</p>

          <p>Share prices for major European car manufacturers, including BMW and Volkswagen, fell after the European Commission announced plans to significantly increase steel tariffs and reduce import quotas. The proposal, aimed at protecting the domestic steel industry, would double tariffs to 50% on excess imports and has sparked panic within the automotive sector. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) warned that the measures go too far, threatening automakers with higher costs and contributing to inflation, and called for a more balanced approach.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reported that the demand for AI computing power has risen dramatically, especially in the last six months, as AI models advance from simple queries to complex reasoning. He described this as two exponential trends occurring simultaneously: rapid improvement in AI capability and a surge in user demand. Huang emphasized that demand for Nvidia's advanced Blackwell GPU is very high, but also raised concerns about the need for new energy generation, like natural gas or nuclear power, to support the industry's massive data center buildouts.

This concentration, combined with geopolitical tensions and other global risks, could trigger a sudden downturn with significant impacts on the wider UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers found that patients taking these medications can exhibit abnormal patterns of radiotracer uptake on FDG PET-CT scans, creating "hot spots" that might be misinterpreted by doctors. This could lead to unnecessary follow-up tests, incorrect cancer staging, or delays in proper treatment. The findings highlight the importance of imaging professionals documenting a patient's complete medication history to ensure accurate scan interpretations.</p>

          <p>After a two-year winning streak, cocoa prices have plunged to their lowest level since early 2024, with U.S. futures dropping significantly this week. The sharp decline has been driven by new crop producer sales following government price hikes in Ivory Coast and Ghana. However, investment banks like Citi and Societe Generale are cautioning that the commodity has become "extremely oversold." They note that money managers have taken historically weak speculative positions, making the market vulnerable to a short squeeze that could quickly drive prices back up. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American public sentiment towards Israel has undergone a significant transformation, with polls now showing a majority of Americans holding a negative view of the country and rising sympathy for the Palestinian cause. This shift, accelerated by the war in Gaza, is most pronounced among Democrats and younger voters, and is beginning to alter the political landscape. A growing number of politicians are now openly critical of Israel's actions, and the influence of powerful pro-Israel lobby groups like AIPAC appears to be diminishing, signaling a potential long-term change in U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques a 20-point plan for Gaza, reportedly drafted by Tony Blair and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, as a neocolonial project that prioritizes business interests over political solutions. The author argues the plan, which envisions Gaza as a special economic zone overseen by international business figures, reflects an imperial worldview that has previously failed in the Middle East. The piece suggests the proposal reduces politics to crude dealmaking and self-interest, fusing public power with private profit while ignoring the need for a legitimate, Palestinian-led political future.</p>

          <p>France is facing a protracted political crisis, highlighted by the recent collapse of its government, as it struggles to implement unpopular budget measures amid a deepening debt burden. A key point of contention is a proposal to remove two public holidays to boost productivity and help the country compete with economic giants like the U.S. and China. This has sparked widespread discontent, framing a national debate over whether to sacrifice France's prized social model and work-life balance for the sake of fiscal health and international competitiveness.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "Make Me Commissioner," veteran sportswriter Jane Leavy explores what she sees as wrong with modern baseball and offers solutions to revitalize it. The article reviews her work, noting her critique of the sport's over-reliance on data and analytics, which she argues diminishes the "human element" that makes the game special. While the reviewer feels recent rule changes like the pitch clock have already improved the game's pace, they praise Leavy's book as a celebration of baseball's storytelling tradition and a passionate call to preserve its cultural relevance.</p>

The analysis suggests that white-collar occupations in fields like technology and finance, which rely heavily on cognitive reasoning skills, are the most exposed to disruption. In contrast, jobs that require significant physical labor or direct human interaction, such as construction or nursing, are considered more insulated from AI's current capabilities. For now, experts see AI primarily augmenting human roles rather than fully automating them.</p>

Polling data shows the party is primarily supported by voters over 75, a trend described as unsustainable. Proposed solutions range from increasing the party's presence on social media platforms like TikTok to implementing policies that give young people a "stake in society," such as making homeownership more attainable. The challenge lies in communicating complex policies effectively to a generation accustomed to short-form content.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) indicates that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act has become significantly weaker over the last five years. The report finds the agency is increasingly issuing warnings with no real consequences instead of meaningful penalties like fines, even for severe cases of animal neglect at facilities like dog breeders and research labs. This trend is attributed to severe understaffing, the chilling effect of a 2024 Supreme Court ruling on agency fines, and a general shift in administrative priorities.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are highlighting qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) as a highly effective but often overlooked tax strategy for retirees. This allows individuals aged 70½ and older to donate up to $108,000 directly from a pretax IRA to an eligible charity, with the amount excluded from their adjusted gross income. This method is more beneficial than a standard deduction because it can help retirees satisfy their required minimum distributions (RMDs) and potentially lower their Medicare premiums without increasing their overall taxable income.
