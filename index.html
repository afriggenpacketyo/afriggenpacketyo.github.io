          <p>A significant military escalation occurred on the Thai-Cambodian border, resulting in at least 12 deaths, primarily civilians on the Thai side. The conflict involved artillery, rockets, and Thai airstrikes, reportedly triggered by a mine explosion that injured Thai soldiers. Both nations have sealed border crossings and engaged in diplomatic retaliation, with Cambodia calling for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting to address what it calls "Thailand's aggression." The United States has expressed grave concern over the escalating violence and the harm to innocent civilians, urging an immediate cessation of hostilities.</p>

          <p>Intel reported second-quarter revenue that exceeded analyst expectations, but also announced a net loss of $2.9 billion and significant cuts to its foundry investment plans. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan stated there are "no more blank checks," canceling factory projects in Europe and slowing construction in Ohio to align investments with confirmed customer demand. The company is also undergoing major restructuring, including a 15% workforce reduction, as it aims to regain market share and make its operations more economically sensible.

          <p>The Trump administration has withdrawn Alina Habba's nomination to be the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a strategic move that allows her to serve in an acting capacity. This decision follows a complex procedural conflict where a federal court had appointed her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the position as Habba's initial interim term was expiring. By pulling the nomination, the administration circumvents a law that would have prevented her from serving as an acting officer while under Senate consideration, escalating a clash between the executive branch and the judiciary over the leadership of the key prosecutor's office.</p>

          <p>During a rare presidential visit to the Federal Reserve, President Trump and Chairman Jerome Powell engaged in a public disagreement over the costs of the central bank's headquarters renovation. Trump claimed costs exceeded $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed on the spot. Despite the tension and his ongoing pressure for interest rate cuts, Trump suggested he is backing away from threats to fire the Fed chair, stating he believes Powell will "do the right thing." The visit was seen as part of the president's campaign to influence the independent central bank's monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

This diplomatic effort aims to de-escalate recent kinetic conflict and revive negotiations between Iran and the United States, which have been stalled since military strikes in June.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at making it easier for local governments to clear homeless encampments and compel individuals into treatment. The order seeks to reverse legal precedents that limit authorities' ability to enforce such measures and redirects federal funds towards treatment and institutional settings to "restore public order." This action comes amid a worsening homelessness crisis and follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that affirmed cities' power to penalize public camping. Critics, like the National Homelessness Law Center, argue the policy is punitive and will exacerbate the problem.</p>

          <p>This article explores the reasons why the full collection of Jeffrey Epstein investigation files were not released during the Biden administration, despite political pressure. The primary obstacles are legal, as grand jury testimony is traditionally secret to protect the integrity of the process and can only be unsealed by a judge under exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, the FBI rarely releases evidence from investigations that does not lead to criminal charges, in order to protect individual privacy and ongoing operations. Even if the Biden administration had wanted to release the documents for political reasons, it likely lacked the legal authority to do so without court approval.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's injunction and permit the cancellation of hundreds of National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants. The administration targeted these grants, worth approximately $783 million, for termination because they were linked to research on topics like diversity, equity, inclusion, and gender identity, which it deemed contrary to its policy objectives. A federal district court had previously blocked the cancellations, finding the NIH engaged in "no reasoned decision-making." The administration is now asking the high court for an emergency stay, arguing lower courts are improperly elevating their own policy judgments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging local laws that limit cooperation between city officials and federal immigration enforcement agents. The suit alleges that these "sanctuary city" policies obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration law and endanger public safety by preventing the transfer of non-citizen criminals to federal custody. This legal action escalates the Trump administration's ongoing conflict with sanctuary jurisdictions and comes shortly after a Customs and Border Patrol officer was shot by an undocumented immigrant in Manhattan, intensifying the political debate over immigration enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily preserved the ability of individuals and groups to sue under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The court issued a stay against an outlier ruling from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which had uniquely determined that only the U.S. Attorney General, not private parties, could bring lawsuits to enforce Section 2 of the act. The case originated from a challenge by Native American tribes in North Dakota over a legislative map they argued diluted their voting power. While the stay is a temporary victory for voting rights advocates, the underlying issue may be revisited by the court in a similar case from Louisiana.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price fell over 8% after the company released a disappointing second-quarter earnings report, which saw a 16% drop in automotive sales and a 12% decline in total revenue compared to the previous year. CEO Elon Musk warned of potentially "rough quarters" ahead, citing intense competition and the upcoming elimination of a key federal EV tax credit. The company's performance and Musk's political activities have damaged the brand's reputation with some consumers, and the company is increasingly pinning its future hopes on the long-term development of autonomous driving technology.

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has launched a new political party alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana. The currently unnamed party aims to "take on the rich and powerful" and provide a grassroots, community-led alternative to what they describe as the "control freaks" of Labour and the "dangerously divisive" politics of Reform UK. The move formalizes a split on the British left, with the new party expected to advocate for policies on tax and nationalization that are significantly to the left of the current Labour Party.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed his understanding of President Trump's frustration with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, predicting a "rocky road" for the central bank leader. While stopping short of endorsing a firing, Johnson sided with Trump's call for lower interest rates, arguing it would help with housing affordability and save the nation money, despite economists' concerns about inflation. The comments highlight the continued political pressure being applied to the independent Federal Reserve, with the House Speaker suggesting that "desperate times call for desperate measures" regarding monetary policy.

          <p>New data indicates that investors own 19% of all homes in California, a sign of the state's ongoing and deep-seated housing affordability crisis. While the statewide rate is just below the national average, ownership is highly concentrated in certain areas, with seven rural and mountain counties having over 50% investor ownership. The report notes that with traditional homebuyers sidelined by high prices and mortgage rates, investors are providing market liquidity. However, policy experts argue this trend puts upward pressure on prices, exacerbating the affordability problem for ordinary residents. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is undergoing a major reorganization that will force thousands of D.C.-area employees to relocate to new hubs across the country and take salary cuts. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins stated the move is to reduce the department's financial footprint in the capital and better serve farmers, but critics warn it will cause a mass loss of experienced staff. This upheaval follows previous staff reductions and comes amid concerns that it will weaken the agency's ability to provide critical services, including support for farmers and wildfire response, at a time of increasing strain.</p>
