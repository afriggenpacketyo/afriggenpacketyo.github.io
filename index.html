          <p>Elon Musk publicly criticized NASA administrator Sean Duffy, questioning his intelligence and accusing him of "trying to kill NASA" after the agency expressed openness to using moon landers not exclusively from SpaceX. Duffy responded by emphasizing that competition among innovators benefits America and that NASA is determined to return astronauts to the moon before China. This article highlights that SpaceX's Starship program, despite a $2.9 billion contract for the Artemis III mission, has faced delays and explosive failures, prompting NASA to consider rival proposals. Musk, however, defended SpaceX's progress as rapid compared to the industry.</p>

          <p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation has urged the Trump administration to pause the demolition of the White House East Wing until a comprehensive review of President Trump's proposed ballroom plans is completed. This article highlights the group's concern that the "proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself" due to its substantial size. While the Trust lacks statutory authority to halt construction, it advocates for legally required public review processes and public comment. Other architectural organizations, including the Society of Architectural Historians and the American Institute of Architects, have also voiced similar concerns regarding the ballroom's scale and its potential impact on the historic White House grounds.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports saw a 4.2% year-on-year increase in September, snapping a four-month decline, primarily driven by robust growth in shipments to Asia. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued to tumble, dropping by 13.3%, indicating that a recent trade deal has not yet reversed this trend. This article notes that semiconductor exports were a key driver of overall growth, while auto shipments to the US fell significantly. Despite the yen's current weakness, which typically benefits exporters, analysts suggest that policy factors such as tariffs are still having a larger impact on export performance than currency fluctuations.</p>

          <p>Surging copper wire theft is leaving many Los Angeles communities in darkness, with the iconic Sixth Street Bridge notably unlit after seven miles of wire were stolen, costing millions in estimated repairs. A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, is set to kick in next year, aiming to combat the problem by targeting recyclers who buy stolen metal. This article highlights that the law will require buyers to verify seller identity and lawful ownership, making certain scrap metal from public infrastructure illegal to possess without proper authorization. The initiative seeks to reduce theft by making it significantly harder for criminals to profit from selling stolen materials.</p>

          <p>A convicted felon, Billy Joe Cagle, has been federally charged after allegedly threatening to "shoot up" Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and then arriving there with an AR-15-style rifle and dozens of rounds of ammunition in his truck. Cagle made the threat during a FaceTime call, prompting immediate action from law enforcement after the recipient reported it. This article details that authorities quickly located and apprehended Cagle at the airport's South Terminal, subsequently finding the loaded rifle in his vehicle during a safety sweep.

This article highlights that while the device shares aesthetic similarities with the Vision Pro, its key differentiator is the Gemini integration, enabling advanced virtual workspace organization and content generation. The companies view the Galaxy XR as a stepping stone to future AI glasses, but challenges remain in making such niche products mainstream, particularly due to privacy concerns regarding Gemini running in the cloud.</p>

National Guard indicate federal officials plan for a "long-term persistent presence" through America's 250th anniversary celebration in July 2026. This article notes that the District of Columbia's lawsuit alleges the federalization of the Guard violates the U.S. Constitution by overriding local authority and giving the Pentagon pervasive control over troops.

          <p>The United States currently holds a lead in science and technology, but its long-term dominance cannot be taken for granted, especially given China's clear and growing edge in STEM education. This article, reflecting insights from Nobel laureates, suggests that policies like the Trump administration's crackdown on leading US universities and immigration could undermine American innovation. It also highlights how large tech corporations can stifle competition through buying out innovative upstarts or lobbying regulators, a practice that, according to the mathematical modeling of Aghion and Howitt, undermines growth by preventing the "creative destruction" necessary for progress when new products emerge.</p>

He argued that Democrats are now seeking extensions to expiring health insurance subsidies and a rollback of Medicaid restrictions, while Republicans advocate for a "clean" bill to fund the government at existing spending levels. This article highlights McCarthy's view that the current impasse is the reverse of the 2013 shutdown, with each side now blaming the other in a more divided political landscape. He suggests Democrats are "fearful" of their rank-and-file members and "trying to find a message" rather than focusing on a straightforward resolution.</p>

          <p>Haircare experts have debunked four common myths, clarifying that shampoo cannot repair damaged hair, and cold water does not make hair shinier. Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker emphasize that split ends can only be fixed by a haircut, as products merely offer temporary cosmetic fixes. This article explains that claims of making hair grow faster are also untrue, as it's biologically impossible. Furthermore, the experts stress that hair does not "self-clean," and infrequent washing can lead to significant oil buildup, odor, and worsening scalp conditions. They advise against relying on dry shampoo as a substitute for regular washing, recommending its use only once between washes.</p>
