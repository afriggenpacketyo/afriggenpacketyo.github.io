          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can terminate the protected status of approximately 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal of the president's order is pending. This decision allows the Department of Homeland Security to resume removing migrants who had been granted humanitarian parole under the CHNV program. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a dissenting opinion, criticized the majority for disregarding the potential harm to these individuals. The ruling follows a prior decision allowing the revocation of protected status for Venezuelan immigrants, signaling a stricter approach to immigration policies.</p>
