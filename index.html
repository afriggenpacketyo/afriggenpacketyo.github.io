          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated he was not pressured by President Trump on how to vote on interest rates ahead of the recent decision. Miran, who voted for a larger rate cut than the committee approved, confirmed his conversation with the president was brief and congratulatory. He dismissed concerns about his independence, emphasizing his commitment to explaining his differing economic views and his intention to serve only until his term ends in January 2026. The discussion highlights ongoing tensions regarding the Federal Reserve's autonomy under the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed a Republican-led short-term funding bill to avert a government shutdown, sending the measure to the Senate where it faces strong Democratic opposition. The bill, which passed 217-212, includes additional security funding for lawmakers but lacks Democratic priorities, particularly concerning healthcare. Senate Democrats have signaled they will block the measure, making a government shutdown increasingly likely as the September 30 deadline approaches. Both parties are blaming each other for the potential impasse and the disruption it would cause.</p>

          <h2>Control of TikTok's Algorithm Emerges as Key Point in US-China Deal Negotiations</h2>

          <p>The fate of TikTok in the U.S. may depend on a licensing agreement for its powerful algorithm, a major sticking point in negotiations between the U.S. and China. The Chinese government, which previously vowed to block the sale of the algorithm, now appears open to a deal involving "the use of intellectual property rights." This potential framework could allow a new U.S. entity to use the technology under license from parent company ByteDance, though national security concerns about data access and content manipulation remain. A final agreement is pending a call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping made significant progress toward a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call, but did not finalize an agreement. This outcome follows earlier statements from the administration suggesting a deal was nearly complete. Under a U.S. law, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, must divest its American business or face a ban, a deadline President Trump has repeatedly extended, most recently to December 16. The ongoing negotiations reflect the complexities of balancing national security concerns with the app's significant commercial value.</p>

          <p>NATO forces intercepted three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets that violated the airspace of Estonia, a NATO member, for 12 minutes over the Gulf of Finland. Estonia's foreign ministry condemned the act as an "unprecedentedly brazen" provocation and summoned the Russian chargé d'affaires to lodge a formal protest. The incident heightens regional tensions, following recent Russian drone incursions into Polish and Romanian airspace. Top EU and NATO officials described the event as reckless Russian behavior, reaffirming the alliance's resolve to defend its eastern flank against aggression.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Noah Lyles won his fourth successive 200m gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, equaling Usain Bolt's record for titles in the event. Lyles, who had taken bronze in the 100m earlier in the competition, ran 19.52 seconds to defeat a strong field, including his American teammate Kenny Bednarek who took silver. The victory marks a triumphant return to Tokyo for Lyles, who had struggled with depression during the 2021 Olympics held in the same city.

          <p>The suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" by ABC has prompted fellow late-night hosts Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and Jimmy Fallon to respond with a mix of criticism and support. Kimmel's show was taken off the air after he made comments about the reaction to conservative activist Charlie Kirk's death, leading to pressure from the FCC. Colbert called the suspension "blatant censorship," Stewart used satire to mock the idea of a "government-approved" show, and Fallon expressed personal support for Kimmel.

          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a "B2B2C" (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce the financial impact of U.S. tariffs on consumers. This strategy involves routing online sales through a third-party merchant of record, which purchases the goods at a wholesale price and pays the tariff on that lower value, rather than the final retail price. Companies like ESW and Global-e facilitate this process, allowing retailers to absorb tariff costs without raising prices. While some see this as a creative adaptation, customs brokers warn it could be a short-term solution that risks future audits and scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

Additionally, the panel reversed a vote from the previous day, now recommending against covering the combined MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella) shot for low-income children. The chair of the committee, whose members were recently appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., attributed the reversals to the inexperience of the "rookie" panel.</p>

          <h2>House Resolution to Honor Charlie Kirk Creates Division Among Democrats</h2>

          <p>A Republican-sponsored House resolution to honor the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a "courageous American patriot" is causing internal division among Democrats. Kirk was assassinated last week, and the resolution frames his killing as a reminder of the threat of political extremism. While House Democratic leadership has indicated they will vote for the measure, they are not requiring members to do so, leaving it as a conscience vote. Some Democrats plan to vote against it, questioning what is "honorable" about some of Kirk's past statements, highlighting deep partisan tensions.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old prison operational support worker, Megan Breen, has been given a 10-month suspended sentence for engaging in an inappropriate relationship with an inmate at HMP Prescoed in Wales.

The judge cited Breen's remorse, pregnancy, and childcare duties as "exceptional" reasons for suspending the sentence, which also includes rehabilitation requirements and a fine.</p>

          <p>Vice President Kamala Harris's forthcoming memoir, "107 Days," reveals her private concerns about President Joe Biden's ability to campaign for reelection, which she describes as a "recklessness" given the high stakes. The book also provides insights into her vice-presidential selection process, noting that while she felt Pete Buttigieg would be an "ideal partner," she believed adding a gay man to the ticket was "too big a risk." Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, also considered for the role, responded by stating Harris will "have to answer" for not publicly voicing her concerns about Biden's fitness sooner.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new package of sanctions against Russia that includes measures targeting Chinese entities involved in purchasing Russian oil. This 19th round of sanctions since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine aims to further curtail Russia's energy revenues, which have already seen a 90% reduction from European sources. The proposals, which must be approved by all 27 EU member states, also include a ban on EU purchases of Russian liquefied natural gas. The move signals the EU's intent to crack down on third-party countries and companies that help Russia circumvent existing economic penalties.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday, with the 10-year note reaching its highest level in two weeks, even after the Federal Reserve implemented an interest rate cut earlier in the week. The 10-year yield climbed above 4.13%, a counterintuitive move as short-term rates are falling. This trend suggests that investors in longer-term debt are weighing factors beyond immediate monetary policy, such as rising GDP estimates, persistent inflation, and the government's need to issue more debt. The market reaction indicates underlying concerns about the long-term economic outlook and government finances. (not investment advice)</p>

The family expressed immense relief and gratitude to the officials who worked to secure their release after months of concern for their deteriorating health in detention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement that he will designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization" is likely to face significant legal challenges, as experts note the president lacks the authority to make such a designation for a domestic group. Antifa, short for "anti-fascist," is a decentralized movement with no formal leadership or structure, making it difficult to classify as a single organization. Legal scholars argue that such a designation could infringe on First and Fourth Amendment rights, as it would effectively criminalize an ideology rather than specific violent acts, which are already covered by existing laws.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's use of the U.S. Navy to conduct lethal strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs from Venezuela is being criticized as a legally dubious act of a rogue state. The article argues that the justification—that the boats pose an imminent "narco-terrorist" threat—does not meet the standards of international or U.S. law, which require a threat to be "instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means." Critics warn that treating crime as an act of war erodes legal distinctions and grants the president unchecked power to order killings without congressional oversight, potentially implicating military personnel in illegal acts.</p>

The resignation is presented as a significant blow to the era of corporate social responsibility, where businesses align with progressive causes, highlighting growing pressure on companies to remain politically neutral in a polarized environment.</p>

          <p>Chinese shipping company SeaLegend Line has launched a new "Arctic express" service from China to Europe, marking a growing commercial interest in the Northern Sea Route. The vessel is transporting time-sensitive and high-value goods, such as e-commerce parcels and power batteries, aiming to offer a transit time that is faster than traditional sea routes via the Suez Canal but cheaper than rail. The route connects Qingdao to ports in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Poland. This development reflects China's increasing use of the Arctic passage as a viable alternative for shipping to Europe.</p>
