          <p>Tulsi Gabbard has altered her position on Iran's nuclear capabilities, now asserting that Iran could produce nuclear weapons within weeks. This statement comes months after her testimony before Congress, where she stated that Iran was not actively building such weapons. Gabbard attributes her change in perspective to US intelligence, which suggests Iran is close to achieving nuclear weapon capability. The shift follows Donald Trump's disagreement with her earlier assessment and his claim that Iran possesses a "tremendous amount of material" for nuclear weapons; Iran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful. </p>

          <p>Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama, now serving his fourth term with a supermajority, is facing increased scrutiny and is being called the "Ramaduro" of Europe due to alleged corruption and autocratic tendencies. Once a disciple of George Soros, Rama has adapted his political image to align with global elites and regional leaders, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan. Critics argue that Rama's elections have been deeply flawed, raising concerns for a NATO member and aspiring EU state, and that he has worked to undermine Trump-era initiatives in Europe. Rama's leadership is seen as a European version of the ChÃ¡vez-Maduro model, where a leftist autocrat operates under the guise of progressive values while eroding democratic norms.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom's new podcast has drawn attention due to the presence of a single-use plastic water bottle in several episodes, amidst ongoing debates about single-use plastic regulations in California. Environmentalists have criticized Newsom for scaling back SB 54, the state's single-use plastic recycling law, despite his previous commitment to reducing plastic waste. While Newsom's office dismissed the concerns, environmental advocates remain dismayed by the governor's actions. The presence of the water bottle is seen as a symbol of the conflict between Newsom's past environmental stances and current policies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers initially faced criticism for their silence regarding recent immigration sweeps in Los Angeles, with some fans and community leaders calling for a statement in defense of immigrants. After rumors circulated that the Dodger Stadium parking lot was being used for immigration raids, the team eventually announced plans to assist impacted immigrant communities. The Dodgers have a long history with the Latino community, but have also been accused of prioritizing profit over social issues. The team's delayed response contrasts with statements from other members of the Dodgers family, such as Fernando Valenzuela's daughter and broadcaster Jaime JarrÃ­n.</p>

          <p>As the war between Israel and Iran continues, concerns are growing about Israel's ability to sustain its air defenses against Iranian missile attacks. With Iran launching hundreds of missiles and drones, Israel is using its interceptors faster than they can be replenished. Experts worry that Israel may eventually run out of interceptors and have to ration its defenses, focusing on key military targets over civilian infrastructure. While the U.S. is providing assistance, the long-term sustainability of Israel's air defense remains uncertain, potentially allowing Iran to pressure Israel on its nuclear ambitions.</p>

Some scholars suggest examining Boelter's religious background and views on abortion, noting his apparent connection to the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a movement that uses war imagery when discussing political and spiritual enemies. Boelter's past speeches reveal his opposition to abortion and his belief in modern-day prophets and apostles correcting the church, aligning with NAR ideologies.</p>

          <h2>Assisted Dying Bill Advances in UK Parliament, Faces Lords' Scrutiny</h2>

          <p>A bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death has been backed by MPs and now faces scrutiny in the House of Lords. Dame Esther Rantzen, a supporter of the bill, is urging the Lords not to block it, while critics like Lord Shinkwin express concerns about the potential for coercion of vulnerable individuals. The bill proposes strict safeguards, including multiple declarations and assessments by independent doctors and a multi-disciplinary panel, but opponents fear these could be eroded. The debate highlights the complex ethical and practical considerations surrounding assisted dying legislation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he would make a decision on potential U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran within two weeks.

French President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged the real risk of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. Despite these discussions, officials from the UK, Germany, and France reported no significant breakthroughs, but expressed openness to future talks.</p>

          <p>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has increased its military activities around Taiwan in recent years, evolving from occasional sorties to a coordinated campaign. These operations serve both as combat training and strategic signaling. The PLA's actions can be categorized into near-daily aerial patrols, combat-readiness patrols, and large-scale joint forces exercises, each varying in scale and intensity. These activities aim to convey different messages, ranging from asserting sovereignty to demonstrating military capabilities.</p>

          <p>Reporters working for Voice of America and other U.S.-funded networks are expressing concerns about their safety and future prospects, particularly those who are citizens of countries with repressive regimes. Mass layoffs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, along with the imprisonment of a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporter in Azerbaijan, have heightened these fears. Journalists worry about the U.S. government's commitment to protecting them if they face political retribution upon returning to their home countries.

          <p>China's real estate sector is facing a prolonged slump, exacerbated by a shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities will remain suppressed in the coming years. The country's declining population is expected to further reduce home demand, with fewer newborns and an aging population. Despite efforts to incentivize child-bearing, China's fertility rate continues to fall, contributing to the challenges facing the property market.</p>

          <p>Japan's proactive approach to supply chain resilience offers lessons for Western nations facing China's dominance in critical minerals. Following a rare earth export ban by China in 2010, Japan invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects and implemented strategies such as stockpiling and recycling. As a result, Japan has reduced its dependence on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. The country's experience highlights the importance of diversifying supply chains and investing in alternative technologies to mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single supplier.</p>
