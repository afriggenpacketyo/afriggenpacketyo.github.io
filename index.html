          <p>Joby Aviation's stock rose significantly after the company delivered its first electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to the United Arab Emirates.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will lose access to a key satellite data program on July 31, just as the U.S. enters peak hurricane season. The Department of Defense is discontinuing the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, which has provided crucial environmental data since the 1960s, citing cybersecurity risks and modernization needs. While NOAA officials state that their remaining data sources are fully capable of ensuring accurate forecasts, the change comes as the agency is already facing resource constraints.

          <p>Following Senator Thom Tillis's decision not to seek re-election, speculation is mounting that Lara Trump, the former president's daughter-in-law, could be a leading GOP candidate for the North Carolina seat in 2026. President Trump's influence is seen as decisive in choosing the nominee, and Lara Trump is viewed as a fundraising powerhouse with strong name recognition in her home state. Other potential candidates include RNC Chair Michael Whatley and several Republican congressmen.

The defense contended the encounters were consensual and that the case is financially motivated, opting not to call any witnesses.

          <p>The White House asserted that Canada "caved" to pressure from President Trump by rescinding its planned digital services tax (DST). The move came after Trump threatened to terminate all trade negotiations if the tax, which would have primarily affected U.S. tech companies, was implemented. White House officials framed the reversal as a major victory for American businesses and workers. Canada stated it walked back the tax to advance broader trade talks, with both nations now aiming to secure a new trade agreement by late July, highlighting the administration's hardball negotiating tactics.</p>

          <p>Recent polling indicates that a majority of Americans oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," but public opinion is more divided on its specific provisions. Surveys from multiple pollsters show overall opposition to the legislation, with around 55% of voters against it. However, key components like imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients and extending certain tax cuts receive more mixed or even favorable responses. The data suggests a disconnect between the bill's overall perception and the popularity of some of its individual policies, complicating the political messaging for both parties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expected to lift some financial sanctions on Syria to help stabilize the country following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad's regime. The executive order will reportedly terminate a 2004 program that froze Syrian government assets but will maintain targeted sanctions against Assad, his associates, and groups involved in human rights abuses or terrorism. The move follows a meeting between President Trump and Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who argued that the broad sanctions were hindering the transitional government's ability to function. This policy shift aims to support the new leadership while still punishing key figures from the former regime.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom recorded its hottest day of a four-day heatwave on Monday, with temperatures climbing to 33.1C (91.6F) at London's Heathrow Airport. The sweltering conditions, which prompted an amber heat-health alert for most of England, led to a record-hot opening day at the Wimbledon tennis tournament. The UK Health Security Agency warned that the high temperatures are likely to increase mortality rates, particularly among vulnerable populations. While travel was largely unaffected, the heatwave highlights the increasing frequency of extreme weather events in the region.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is acquiring building materials distributor GMS for $5.5 billion, deepening its strategic focus on professional contractors. This deal follows last year's massive $18.25 billion purchase of SRS Distribution and expands Home Depot's ability to service specialized pros in areas like drywall and steel studs. While the move aims to capture a larger share of the pro market as the DIY segment slows, some analysts express reservations. They note the acquisition will be funded with debt, further delaying the restart of the company's stock buyback program. (not investment advice)</p>

One airstrike hit a crowded seaside cafe in Gaza City, killing at least 30 people, including women and children. In separate incidents, Israeli forces reportedly opened fire on Palestinians attempting to get food aid, resulting in at least 22 deaths near Khan Younis and a UN warehouse.
