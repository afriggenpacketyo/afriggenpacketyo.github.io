          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has opened designated sections of the Seine River for public swimming, a legacy project from the 2024 Olympics. The city invested approximately €1.4 billion to improve water quality, which had been compromised by pollution since the ban was enacted in 1923. Three supervised swimming zones with amenities are now available, though authorities will continuously monitor water safety and swimmers' abilities due to strong currents. This initiative is part of a broader city effort to adapt to climate change and enhance urban life.</p>

          <p>Former Wolves captain Conor Coady paid a heartfelt tribute to Liverpool forward Diogo Jota, who died in a car crash at age 28. Coady described Jota as a "dream to work with" and the "heart and soul of the dressing room" during their time together at Wolverhampton. He fondly recalled Jota's tenacity, quiet leadership, and crucial role in the club's promotion and European success. Coady emphasized that Jota was not only a remarkable footballer but an even better person, whose loss is deeply felt beyond the sport.</p>

          <p>Scotland's rugby team narrowly defeated the Maori All Blacks 29-26 in a tightly contested match in Whangarei, New Zealand, to open their summer tour. Both teams scored four tries, but a first-half penalty by Adam Hastings ultimately made the difference for the visiting side. Despite being outmatched in possession and metres gained, Scotland demonstrated clinical attacking and resilient defense, particularly in the final moments. The victory was secured by a largely second-string Scottish squad, which held off a late surge from the hosts to clinch the win.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations of a "binge drinking culture" and serious safeguarding failures at Bangor Cathedral in Wales. Former choir members described inappropriate events, including a "seven last shots of Christ" drinking game on Good Friday and pressure to consume alcohol. The report follows the early retirement of the Archbishop of Wales, Andrew John, after critical reviews highlighted a culture where boundaries seemed blurred. One individual reported being sexually assaulted by a priest-in-training at a cathedral event, leading to calls for significant changes in leadership and procedures.</p>

          <p>The 90-day pause on President Trump's proposed "liberation day" tariffs is set to expire, raising concerns about a potential trade assault on dozens of countries and its impact on the U.S. economy. Despite administration claims that 90 deals could be struck in 90 days, only a few narrow agreements have materialized, leaving steep tariff rates looming. Business leaders and economists warn that even existing tariffs are contributing to inflation, with mid-sized businesses facing billions in additional costs. The administration's strategy of imposing and then partially rolling back tariffs creates ongoing uncertainty for American businesses and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network revealed that over 85 Pride organizations have seen reduced funding, forcing some to cancel, scale back, or charge for previously free events. Organizers attribute the decline partly to a shift away from diversity and inclusion initiatives by global corporations.

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully restored damaged ear tissue in mice by activating what they describe as an "evolutionarily disabled genetic switch." Their research, published in the journal Science, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development. By reactivating this pathway, they achieved complete restoration of the lost tissue, including cartilage. The researchers believe this discovery proves the existence of a fundamental mechanism for regeneration that could potentially be present in other organs and, one day, be applied to humans.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's administration under President Lai Ching-te is facing criticism for its approach to commemorating the Republic of China's (ROC) role in World War II. Critics argue that Lai's government, which emphasizes Taiwan's distinct identity, is honoring the ROC's wartime victory without fully acknowledging its historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. The ROC, founded in 1912, was a key Allied power but its government retreated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War. This creates a complex dilemma as the current leadership seeks to shape a national narrative separate from the mainland's legacy.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean nation's highest civilian honor, becoming the first foreign leader to receive it. The award was presented during Modi's two-day visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties, particularly in energy and health. The visit highlighted the deep historical connections between the two countries, rooted in the 19th-century migration of Indian indentured laborers. As part of the renewed strategic partnership, Modi also announced expanded eligibility for Overseas Citizen of India cards for people of Indian descent in the nation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' front office has indicated that their trade deadline plans will not significantly change following third baseman Max Muncy's recent knee injury. While the collision initially looked severe, Muncy only sustained a bone bruise and is expected to return in about six weeks, leaving him time to recover before the playoffs. General Manager Brandon Gomes stated the team is content to rely on internal options to fill the position in the interim. The unexpectedly positive diagnosis means the Dodgers are not desperately seeking an external replacement and can stick to their original strategy.</p>

          <p>Several shark sightings in the waters off Far Rockaway, Queens, led New York City officials to temporarily close a stretch of beach on the Fourth of July. Drones and lifeguards monitored the sharks, which were observed swimming very close to the shore and beachgoers. The city's deputy mayor for public safety confirmed the sightings and noted that the beach was closed for about an hour as a precaution before reopening. The incident occurred just days after New York state officials had announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for the holiday weekend to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>As the United States takes aim at China's dominant shipbuilding industry, competitors South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to capture a larger market share. South Korea's new presidential administration has pledged to support its domestic industry, which it describes as being in a "major crisis," by focusing on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels. The policy guidelines aim to revitalize the sector through improved production, digitalization, and better working conditions. This strategic shift comes as geopolitical tensions create an opportunity for traditional shipbuilding powerhouses to challenge China's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has cleared the way for the deportation of eight immigrants to countries including South Sudan, denying a last-ditch emergency request to halt their removal. The case, which reached the Supreme Court twice, centers on the Trump administration's policy of deporting individuals with serious criminal convictions, even to countries where they may face danger. Lawyers for the men argued they could face perilous conditions, as South Sudan is in a civil war. The judge ruled that the new claims were substantially similar to those he had previously denied, ending their legal battle.</p>

          <p>A protest in Mexico City against the impacts of mass tourism and gentrification turned violent, with some demonstrators smashing storefronts and harassing tourists. The march, which began peacefully in the popular Condesa and Roma neighborhoods, was organized by locals angry about soaring rents driven by an influx of "digital nomads," primarily from the U.S. Protesters carried signs reading "gringos, stop stealing our home" and demanded stricter housing and tourism regulations. The event highlights growing tensions in the capital, where longtime residents feel they are being priced out of their own communities.</p>

          <p>On the Fourth of July, President Donald Trump signed his administration's major tax and spending legislation into law during a White House picnic. The bill, which Trump called "big, beautiful," enacts significant tax cuts, increases defense spending, and provides more aggressive funding for immigration enforcement. The administration claims these measures will stimulate economic growth and create jobs for American citizens. However, Democrats have heavily criticized the legislation, warning that it will primarily benefit the wealthy at the expense of lower-income families and increase the national debt.
