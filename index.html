          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month after a pause due to trade tensions. Ortberg stated that China has indicated they will take deliveries, with the first shipments occurring next month. Boeing, a major U.S. exporter, has been paying tariffs on imported components for its Dreamliner planes made in South Carolina. However, these tariffs are largely recouped when the planes are exported, mitigating the overall impact on the company's financials. This resumption of deliveries is expected to help Boeing ramp up its Max production, signaling a positive outlook for the company's operations and trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has partially reversed its decision to revoke Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, granting the school 30 days to demonstrate compliance. This decision follows Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's earlier announcement to terminate Harvard's SEVP certification, which would have impacted nearly 7,000 international students. Harvard sued to block the policy, arguing that students were being used as pawns in a retaliatory campaign, and a federal judge issued a temporary order barring the revocation. DHS officials stated that the revocation was necessary because Harvard failed to provide requested information about international students, including disciplinary records.</p>

          <p>An op-ed challenges Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's claim that U.S. export controls on AI chips are a failure, arguing that these controls are about national security, not Nvidia's commercial interests. The author contends that China's drive for technological independence predates the 2022 restrictions and is fueled by substantial state support. While Huang expressed concerns about Nvidia's market share decline in China due to these restrictions, the author notes that Nvidia's overall revenue has surged, driven by strong demand in other markets. The piece concludes that U.S. semiconductor policy aims to protect America's strategic edge in a high-stakes geopolitical contest, even if it means sacrificing some market access for individual companies.

          <p>Despite a recent agreement to suspend tariffs, the United States and China are increasingly using export controls as weapons against each other, potentially disrupting global supply chains. China has restricted exports of rare earth magnets, crucial for various industries, while the U.S. has banned semiconductors from Huawei and suspended shipments for China's commercial aircraft. These actions are impacting industries, with Ford temporarily closing a factory due to magnet supply disruptions.

          <p>A U.S. trade court has blocked the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs, leading to cautious reactions from America's trading partners. While stocks rose internationally, economists noted that Trump could pursue other legal avenues to enact tariffs, leaving the situation uncertain. The court's decision does not roll back sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars, meaning negotiations on these sectors will continue. The ruling blocks across-the-board tariffs enacted after an early April announcement, but the administration could impose tariffs using other trade rules, leading to continued global market instability.</p>

          <p>The United States is considering a potential reduction in troop deployment to South Korea as it assesses its regional strategy to counter China. While 28,500 U.S. troops are currently stationed in South Korea to defend against North Korea, the U.S. aims to optimize its forces across the Indo-Pacific to deter potential Chinese aggression, particularly towards Taiwan. No final decision has been made, but any future troop presence would be designed to address both North Korean and Chinese threats.

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping global trade tariffs, delivering a major blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every one of the world's countries. The court said the US Constitution gave Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, and that this was not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The White House has asked the court to block the order suspending tariffs while it appeals the case.</p>

The court's decision applies to tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), while other tariffs remain in effect. The ruling has led to some added uncertainty for U.S. businesses, which are responsible for paying tariffs when goods are imported.</p>

Short-term CDs currently offer more competitive Annual Percentage Yields (APY) than long-term options due to market uncertainty.

Long-term CDs may be suitable for those seeking certainty and fixed growth, but they are generally riskier in the current environment. A CD ladder strategy, using various maturity dates, can also be beneficial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hormel Foods Corporation is recalling over 256,000 pounds of canned beef stew nationwide due to potential contamination with wood fragments. The affected 20-oz. metal cans of "Dinty Moore Beef Stew" were shipped to retail locations across the country. The recalled products have a "FEB 2028" best by date and lot code "T02045." The issue was discovered after the company received consumer complaints about wood pieces in the stew, though no injuries have been reported.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has sided with a Utah railway project, limiting the scope of environmental impact studies required for federal agency-regulated projects. The 8-0 ruling overturned a lower court decision that had halted the railway, which is intended to transport crude oil, stating that the environmental review was too limited. The court held that agencies need only consider the environmental effects of the project at hand and not potential future or geographically separate projects. This ruling is seen as a setback for environmentalists and a boost for infrastructure development.</p>

          <p>An article argues that the recent court ruling striking down President Trump’s tariffs is not judicial overreach, but a vindication of the rule of law. The ruling is based on the Constitution, which delegates tariff power to Congress, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which the court found did not authorize Trump's tariff orders. The author points out that the lawsuit was brought by states acting as a check on federal power and that the Court of International Trade was specifically created to handle trade disputes. The author concludes that the ruling reinforces the importance of checks on presidential power.</p>

Cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of the data center revenue.

However, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's sales in China, a market that CEO Jensen Huang estimates could be worth $50 billion. Looking ahead, Nvidia is focused on Blackwell and AI inference, with surging demand expected for GPUs used in AI models serving millions of customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top economic advisor to President Donald Trump, expressed confidence that court rulings against aggressive tariffs will be overturned on appeal. Hassett believes the administration's use of tariffs to ensure fair trade is legal and will resume soon. He criticized the judges' ruling and asserted that the administration will continue its anti-fentanyl efforts. Hassett stated that the administration is not planning to pursue alternative measures at the moment, as they are confident the ruling is incorrect. (not investment advice)</p>
