          <p>Official figures reveal that the UK government's borrowing exceeded expectations due to increased expenditure on public sector pay and benefits. The Office for National Statistics reported a borrowing of Â£151.9 billion in the year to March, surpassing forecasts. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is scheduled to address the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington amidst these fiscal challenges.
