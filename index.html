          <p>Mazyar Azarbonyad, a 20-year-old personal trainer, has been sentenced to 14 months in a young offender institution after causing a pile-up of police cars on the A1 near Newcastle. Azarbonyad, who was fleeing from police after a first date, reached speeds of up to 120 mph with his passenger pleading for him to stop. Seven officers were injured and five police cars were damaged during the incident which occurred after Azarbonyad initially pulled over for a defective rear light but then sped away, later claiming his passenger had drugs. Azarbonyad also continued to drive after being given an interim ban and has been banned from driving for three years and must take an extended test to receive a license.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union member states are expected to vote on restricting access to the bloc's procurement markets for Chinese medical device manufacturers, marking the first use of the bloc's international procurement instrument (IPI). This move comes after unsuccessful negotiations with China to open its own tenders to EU firms. The European Commission investigation found clear evidence of China unfairly limiting access by EU medical device producers to its government contracts. Brussels asserts that Chinese manufacturers have largely free access to EU public procurement tenders, while European competitors face restrictions in China due to Beijing's "Buy China" policies, especially in the high-end medical device sector.</p>

          <p>Japan's revenue from the departure tax, collected from travelers, has hit a record high in fiscal year 2024 due to a surge in visitors. The Finance Ministry reported that the total has already reached 48.1 billion yen, surpassing the previous record of 44.3 billion yen in fiscal 2019, though the final receipts are still being gathered. The government imposes a 1,000 yen International Tourist Tax on each traveler leaving the country, regardless of nationality. The country has been attracting more visitors due to a weaker yen and an increase in the number of flights, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba indicating a willingness to increase the departure tax to further promote tourism and address overcrowding.</p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring the potential of microbes found in unusual environments, including household sludge, to help solve environmental problems. The Two Frontiers Project, co-founded by microbiologists James Henriksen and Braden Tierney, seeks to identify microorganisms that can capture carbon dioxide, grow crops in hostile environments, and clean up hazardous waste. The team has already isolated microbes with unique abilities, such as Chonkus, which efficiently consumes carbon dioxide, and bacteria associated with corals that produce antibiotics. They are now surveying homes for interesting goos, partnering with CitSci, believing that extreme environments in showerheads and dishwashers may harbor microbes with carbon-capturing abilities.</p>

          <p>The European Union is preparing countermeasures against the United States following the Trump administration's tariffs on steel, which have complicated ongoing trade negotiations. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Trump agreed to accelerate talks, but the EU is ready to act defensively if negotiations fail. The EU is finalizing an expanded list of countermeasures, which would automatically take effect on July 14 or earlier if a balanced outcome is not reached. While the EU is open to purchasing more liquefied natural gas and defense items from the US, and lowering duties on cars, it is unlikely to concede on scrapping the value-added tax or opening up to American beef.</p>

Nichols characterizes the plan as a "road to repair" rather than using the term reparations, which he considers politically charged.

          <p>Cambodia's government plans to seek a ruling from the U.N.'s International Court of Justice over border disputes with Thailand, including one that recently triggered a fatal military clash. The Cambodian National Assembly has voted to support the government's decision. The government will ask the court to rule on the demarcation of several disputed areas, including where the Ta Moan Thom, Ta Moan Toch, and Ta Kro Bei temples are located. Hun Manet called for the two countries to have their Joint Border Commission continue the work of border demarcation, as well as having the World Court take up the issue.</p>

          <p>A passenger was apprehended at Mumbai airport for smuggling dozens of venomous vipers from Thailand. The snakes, including 44 Indonesian pit vipers, were concealed in checked-in baggage, leading to the arrest of an Indian national. The passenger also possessed three Spider-tailed horned vipers and five Asian leaf turtles. Mumbai Customs released images of the seized snakes on social media. The snakes are a relatively unusual seizure in Mumbai, with customs officers more regularly posting pictures of hauls of smuggled gold, cash, cannabis or pills.</p>

Cloning has become reliable and lucrative enough to be the basis for companies around the world, which are churning out clones of super-sniffing police dogs, prizewinning show camels, and high-genomic-scoring livestock. While the public remains wary of this genetic tinkering, thousands of clones have already been produced, raising questions about genetic diversity and animal welfare. The cloning process, called somatic cell nuclear transfer, still follows the same basic steps first developed in 1952 to copy a frog embryo.</p>

Charismatic Christians, who believe in the Holy Spirit's power to heal and prophesy, are the fastest-growing group of Christians. The rising popularity of Spirit-filled worship and emphasis on personal contact with God has paralleled secular society’s exaltation of private experience over tradition or reasoned argument. Even as partisan politics have come to display the dynamics of fundamentalist sects, there are signs that the 60-year slide of organized religion in the West has slowed.</p>

The initial shake-up will focus on modernising the complex airspace in and around London, with changes potentially including planes climbing quicker during take off and descending more smoothly. The changes would be the largest to UK airspace since it was first designed in the 1950s, at which time there were only around 200,000 flights a year.</p>
