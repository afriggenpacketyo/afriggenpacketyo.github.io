        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hugo Boss shares experienced a significant increase after the fashion retailer announced a smaller-than-anticipated decline in first-quarter sales, with revenues falling 2% on a currency adjusted basis to 999 million euros. Despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainties, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance, forecasting sales between 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion euros. Weaker sales were primarily due to reduced demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, attributed to an uncertain consumer outlook. The company continues to closely monitor economic developments and remains vigilant regarding elevated uncertainties, including ongoing tariff discussions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative leader, unexpectedly fell short of securing a majority in parliament to become chancellor, receiving only 310 votes out of the required 316 in the Bundestag. This outcome is seen as unprecedented in modern German history, as no candidate has failed in this manner since 1949. The setback undermines Merz's aspirations to provide stability after the previous government's collapse, with the far-right Alternative for Germany party seizing on his failure. The Bundestag will reconvene to continue the process of electing a chancellor, amidst confusion and speculation about potential dissent within the coalition.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian drones attacked Moscow for the second consecutive night as Russia prepared for Victory Day celebrations, with Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reporting that 19 drones were shot down en route to the capital. The attacks caused temporary flight suspensions at four Moscow airports, but there were no reported casualties or serious damage. These strikes forced the cancellation of the Victory Day parade in occupied Crimea, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissing Putin's proposed ceasefire as a "theatrical performance."

          <p>According to TRANSCOM records, the U.S. military briefly halted 11 flights carrying artillery shells and weaponry to Ukraine due to a verbal order originating from the office of then-Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. The order caused confusion among top national security officials, as President Trump had not explicitly directed a halt to Ukraine aid during a related Oval Office meeting. The White House claims Hegseth was following Trump's directive to pause aid, but the flights resumed within a week, costing TRANSCOM $1.6 million. The incident highlights policy-making inconsistencies within the Trump administration and a lack of clarity in its command structure.</p>

          <p>DoorDash, the American food delivery company, has announced its acquisition of British rival Deliveroo for Â£2.9 billion ($3.9 billion). The acquisition, agreed upon by Deliveroo's board, will see DoorDash acquire all issued and to-be-issued shares of Deliveroo for 180 pence a share, marking a 44% premium to Deliveroo's previous closing price. Tony Xu, CEO of DoorDash, expressed excitement about the merger, stating that it will allow the combined entity to serve over 40 countries and provide local businesses with necessary tools and technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The acquisition of Deliveroo by DoorDash underscores the diverging fortunes of companies listed on US versus UK stock markets. While both companies began as food delivery services, DoorDash's valuation has soared, enabling it to acquire Deliveroo, which is finally turning a profit. The deal exemplifies a broader trend of companies shunning the London Stock Exchange in favor of US listings due to higher valuations and greater access to capital. The UK market's undervaluation and shrinking appetite for UK stocks among domestic investors contribute to this issue, leading to US firms acquiring UK-listed companies.</p>

          <p>Liz Peek, in a Fox News opinion piece, suggests that Kamala Harris' potential 2028 presidential run indicates a lack of viable Democratic leadership and a reliance on far-left policies. Peek contends that Harris failed to offer meaningful change during her time as Vice President and criticizes her for aligning with progressive figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. The article argues that the Democratic party's embrace of progressive ideals alienates moderate voters and undermines their chances of electoral success.

Goldman Sachs noted that per capita tourism revenue was still 10% below pre-pandemic levels, indicating persistent deflationary pressure and continued consumption downgrading.

          <p>President Trump's funding cuts are undermining HIV prevention efforts in the South, reversing progress made during his first term.

These cuts are affecting community-based groups that provide testing, outreach, and support to underserved communities, potentially leading to more infections and deaths.

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding the use of the military at the southern border, raising legal questions about the limits of the Posse Comitatus Act. A 170-mile stretch of federal land has been designated as a military installation, allowing military personnel to temporarily detain and search individuals for "unauthorized entry." Critics worry about the lack of clarity regarding the use of force and the blurring of lines between military and law enforcement roles. Concerns are also raised about the potential impact on military readiness and recruitment.</p>

          <p>Critics warn that the Justice Department is being politicized under Attorney General Pam Bondi, despite her vows to end its purported weaponization. Bondi's supporters claim she is addressing weaponization head-on, while critics argue she is transforming the department into President Trump's personal law firm. Concerns include the marginalization of career professionals, political interference in decision-making, and the dropping of cases against Trump's allies. The resignation of prosecutors in protest over the dismissal of the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams highlights these concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House after a period of strained relations due to Trump's tariffs and suggestions of annexing Canada. Carney, who recently won Canada's election, campaigned on concerns about Trump's rhetoric and its impact on Canada's trade-dependent economy. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of annexing Canada and using "economic force" to achieve this. The meeting is viewed as an opportunity to reset the relationship between the two countries, as tensions have risen due to the Trump administration's policies.</p>

While prices may increase, Temu and Shein's ability to offer competitive prices and adapt to consumer trends will allow them to maintain a strong presence in the American market.

The Communist Party's Politburo signaled a potential turning point by emphasizing the need to stabilize employment, enterprises, markets, and expectations while increasing household income and consumption. While supply-side reforms have transformed China into a powerhouse in emerging sectors, the country now faces the challenge of translating that success into stronger domestic demand.
