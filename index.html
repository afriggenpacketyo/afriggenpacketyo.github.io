          <p>A Chinese think tank reports that Vietnam has continued its land reclamation efforts on features it occupies in the South China Sea. Over the past six months, nearly 0.78 sq km of land has been reclaimed on 11 features in the Spratly Islands, an area contested by China and Vietnam. Since October 2021, Vietnam has reclaimed over 8.5 sq km and is also constructing military-related facilities, including harbour basins, wharves, and a 3,000-meter airstrip on Barque Canada Reef, according to the think tank's social media posts, signaling a continued effort to assert its presence in the region.

          <h2>UK Government Struggles to Reduce Foreign Aid Spending on Asylum Seeker Hotels</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 04:09:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is finding it difficult to cut the amount of foreign aid used to pay for hotel accommodation for asylum seekers. The Home Office plans to spend £2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only slightly less than the £2.3 billion spent in 2024/25. This money is intended to alleviate poverty overseas but is instead being used to cover accommodation costs for approximately 32,000 asylum seekers in UK hotels. Critics argue that this diversion of funds leads to significant cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development projects worldwide, with officials suggesting the Home Office lacks incentive to reduce ODA spending because it doesn't affect their budget.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>King Charles is reportedly displeased by a potential pheasant shortage at Sandringham Estate, which could disrupt the royal family's cherished Christmas shooting tradition. The shortage may force the cancellation of the traditional Boxing Day shoot, a central part of the royal family's holiday plans. The king has historically opposed importing birds, preferring to maintain the estate's game population, but this eco-friendly approach has not been successful this year. Some suggest this change could allow the king to prioritize reconciliation with Prince Harry, while others note the king's willingness to adapt traditions, as demonstrated by his unconventional Christmas speech location.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is expressing concern over the increasing number of African military officers receiving training in China. General Michael Langley, head of US Africa Command (AFRICOM), notes that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is replicating US training programs for African personnel. This comes as the US shifts its approach towards encouraging African countries to be self-reliant, while China becomes a major supplier of military equipment, especially in the Sahel region, as junta-led leaders distance themselves from Western partners. The Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid have impacted US military assistance programs like IMET, potentially opening the door for increased Chinese influence.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across southern England, parts of the Midlands, and most of south Wales. The warning, effective until 18:00 BST on Saturday, indicates that some areas could receive 10-15mm of rain in less than an hour, with potential for 30-40mm over several hours. The weather agency also warns of frequent lightning, hail, and strong, gusty winds, which could disrupt transport, cause short-term power loss, and potentially damage buildings. While the storms are expected to ease off in the west by mid-afternoon, the forecast suggests a significant shift from the record-breaking dry spring experienced in England last month.</p>

          <p>Tehran has strongly criticized the US travel ban affecting Iranians and citizens of 11 other predominantly Middle Eastern and African countries, labeling it a sign of a "racist mentality." Donald Trump's executive order, which revives restrictions from his first term, has been justified on national security grounds following an attack at a pro-Israel rally in Colorado. The Iranian foreign ministry official, Alireza Hashemi-Raja, stated that the policy violates international law and deprives millions of people of the right to travel based on nationality or religion. The ban targets nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, reflecting continued strained relations between Iran and the US.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported in error by the Trump administration, has been returned to the United States to face smuggling charges. Garcia appeared in federal court in Nashville, with the indictment alleging his involvement in smuggling undocumented migrants into the US. His lawyer calls the charges "fantastical" and an abuse of power, asserting that the Trump administration returned him not to correct an error but to prosecute him. Garcia's case has become a symbol of escalating tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary.</p>

          <p>South Korea's newly elected president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to adopt a more cautious approach to Taiwan and prioritize strengthening economic ties with China. This contrasts with his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, who emphasized closer military cooperation with the US and Japan and expressed concerns about China's activities in the Taiwan Strait. Observers anticipate continuity in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan, but foresee a potential recalibration in Seoul's foreign policy towards China and North Korea. Lee's election has prompted speculation about changes in South Korea's foreign policy direction.</p>
