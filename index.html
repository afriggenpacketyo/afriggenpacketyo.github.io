          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is considering expanding its arms exports to strengthen ties with allies and bolster its defense industry. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani aims to promote defense exports, while Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba attended a defense exhibition, signaling a shift in policy. This move is driven by security concerns and a desire to improve interoperability with allies through standardized maintenance and joint training. Japan also seeks to develop its defense industrial base, which has suffered due to reliance on U.S. weapons purchases, and to achieve economies of scale through exports.
