          <p>Senior Pentagon officials have provided details regarding the U.S. operation, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, which involved bombing three nuclear sites in Iran. The mission included seven B-2 Spirit bombers, in-flight refuelings, and the deployment of Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from a U.S. submarine. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the strikes on the Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan "an incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people. According to Hegseth, the operation demonstrated that American deterrence is back, and the world should listen when the president speaks.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced that "Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated" following U.S. strikes on three major nuclear enrichment facilities. He emphasized that the mission was a precision operation to neutralize threats to national interest posed by the Iranian nuclear program and to defend U.S. troops and ally Israel. Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine confirmed "severe damage and destruction" to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Caine stated that the full extent of the damage would take time to assess, but initial reports indicated significant destruction across all three sites.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, describing it as a "spectacular military success."

          <p>Following the U.S. bombing of key nuclear sites in Iran, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has stated that Iran's nuclear program has been "devastated."

These attacks followed Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure, triggering a war between the two countries. While President Trump has claimed the facilities were "completely and fully obliterated," these claims have yet to be verified, though the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization confirmed the attacks.</p>

          <p>The United States conducted bombing attacks on three nuclear sites in Iran, prompting mixed reactions from global leaders. The strikes, which involved 125 U.S. military aircraft, targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, resulting in "extreme damage and destruction" according to U.S. officials. Iran launched missiles in response, hitting parts of Tel Aviv and Haifa, while Iran's Foreign Minister condemned the U.S. strike and reserved the right to respond. The article presents various strategic options Iran might consider in response to the U.S. attack, including doing nothing, retaliating hard and fast, or retaliating later at a time of its choosing.</p>
