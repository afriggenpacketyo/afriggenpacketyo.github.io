          <h2>Global Matcha Demand Leads to Supply Shortages and Price Increases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 18:41:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide surge in matcha's popularity, fueled by social media and tourism in Japan, is causing significant supply chain issues. Demand is outpacing supply, leading to shortages for cafes and retailers, with some suppliers seeing a month's worth of stock deplete in days. Factors like heatwaves affecting crops, a shrinking farmer population, and new U.S. tariffs are exacerbating the problem, pushing prices higher for the specialized green tea powder. The situation has prompted calls for more mindful consumption and the use of lower-grade matcha for culinary purposes to preserve high-quality tea.</p>

          <p>The Syrian city of Sweida has been devastated by intense sectarian violence between Bedouin clans and the Druze minority, leading to over 1,300 deaths and mass displacement. The article recounts a brutal attack on the Radhwan family, where gunmen killed 13 members, highlighting the extreme brutality of the conflict. The violence, which includes summary executions and shelling, has overwhelmed the city, turning it into what residents describe as a slaughterhouse. This crisis underscores the instability under Syria's new government and the deep-seated mistrust among different factions, with external powers like Israel also becoming involved.</p>

          <h2>Expert Warns of Imminent Mass Starvation in Gaza as Aid Remains Severely Restricted</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 18:40:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Gaza is on the verge of a catastrophic famine, with its population critically weakened after months of inadequate nutrition and restricted aid access. According to Jeremy Konyndyk of Refugees International, the situation has become dire since a ceasefire expired and Israel imposed a near-total blockade, with the current aid system being dangerously ineffective. The population's exhausted coping mechanisms and weakened health mean a rapid increase in deaths from both starvation and disease is likely if large-scale, professional humanitarian efforts are not allowed to resume immediately. The article argues that starvation is being used as a weapon of war, with the U.S. being complicit by not effectively pressuring Israel to allow sufficient aid.</p>

          <p>An attack in central Nigeria's Plateau state resulted in the deaths of 14 people who were returning from a local market. Gunmen reportedly intercepted their vehicle in the Bokkos area and opened fire, killing men, women, and children in the assault. The region has been a hotspot for violent conflicts, often stemming from disputes over land between farming and herding communities. The incident has prompted calls for increased security from local residents, as the area suffers from a sparse government presence and has seen hundreds of deaths in recent years from ongoing violence.</p>

          <p>Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) is experiencing a historic moment, with multiple artists simultaneously charting on the Billboard Hot 100 for extended periods. This trend, driven by a multi-million dollar industry ecosystem, is seeing faith-flavored music, particularly from male country-influenced artists, break into the mainstream. The article explores how megachurches influence the genre's production and how a vast industry supports the recreation of this worship experience in smaller churches. This boom reflects a broader cultural moment where conservative politics, masculinity, and faith are intersecting in popular music, raising questions about its impact on listening habits and the cultural landscape.</p>

          <p>Skydance Media is set to finalize its $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global, a move that promises significant changes for iconic brands like CBS, MTV, and Paramount Pictures. The new ownership, led by David Ellison and backed by RedBird Capital, has pledged to find $2 billion in cost savings, signaling impending layoffs and major restructuring. Key questions remain about the future of the Paramount+ streaming service, the viability of traditional broadcast TV, and the creative and journalistic independence of assets like "60 Minutes" and "South Park."

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will release $5.5 billion in congressionally approved education funds that it had previously frozen. The funds, intended for the 2025-26 school year, support programs such as educator training, arts education, and support for English language learners. The initial decision to withhold the money, justified by claims of misuse for a "radical left-wing agenda," drew widespread criticism from educators and even prominent Republican lawmakers. Following the backlash, the Office of Management and Budget completed its review and directed the Department of Education to release the funds, a move praised by concerned lawmakers and school officials.</p>

          <p>Two high-ranking officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Jeff Dillen and Stephen Volz, have been placed on administrative leave. Both men were central to the 2020 investigation into "Sharpiegate," where agency leaders were found to have violated scientific integrity by altering a hurricane forecast to align with President Trump's incorrect statements. The move has fueled speculation of retaliation, as it comes just before the confirmation hearing for Neil Jacobs, the former NOAA chief implicated in the scandal, to lead the agency again. NOAA has stated the actions were for unrelated performance issues, but staffers and former officials express skepticism and concern about the ongoing politicization of the science agency.</p>

His tenure has been marked by mass departures of career prosecutors, low morale, and accusations that his actions are politically motivated rather than aimed at public safety.

Two flight attendants sustained injuries during the incident, which is now under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration.

This vote has the potential to shift the balance of power in the legislature, which has been in a state of political deadlock since the January elections. The issue is deeply divisive, with both sides claiming to be defending Taiwan's democracy, while Beijing has accused the ruling party of orchestrating the recall to suppress opposition.</p>

          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell was questioned about roughly 100 different people during her two-day meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, according to her lawyer. Her attorney stated that Maxwell answered every question honestly and did not refuse to discuss anyone, though he did not specify who was named. The meeting comes amid public pressure on the Trump administration to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. President Trump, when asked about the situation, deflected questions and said he had not considered a pardon or commutation for Maxwell, though he acknowledged he has the power to do so.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has arrived in Scotland for a four-day private visit, landing at Prestwick Airport before heading to his Turnberry golf resort. During brief remarks to the press, he commented favorably on UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney, both of whom he is scheduled to meet. Trump also used the opportunity to criticize European immigration policies and wind farms, telling Europe to "get your act together." The visit, which includes a trip to his Aberdeenshire course, is accompanied by a major security operation and planned protests, and precedes an official state visit to the UK in September.</p>

          <p>The direct involvement of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in interviewing convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell is being described as highly unorthodox and troubling by multiple former federal prosecutors. Experts find it unprecedented for such a high-ranking official to personally conduct an interview with a convicted cooperator, a role typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge. Concerns were raised that Maxwell, desperate for a reduced sentence, may not be a credible source and that Blanche is not positioned to assess her truthfulness. The situation is viewed by some as a political move to address public pressure regarding the Epstein files, rather than a standard pursuit of justice.</p>

A major point of contention is the introduction of AI-powered self-service kiosks, which workers fear will eliminate their jobs and diminish the fan experience.

          <p>President Trump's strategy of setting a new baseline tariff of at least 15% on foreign goods is expected to drive up costs for American consumers, according to economists. Despite the administration's claims that foreign exporters will bear the cost, companies like Nestlé and General Electric have indicated they will pass on the increased operational costs through price hikes. While the full impact has not yet been felt, analysts predict that prices for a range of imported goods, from apparel to electronics, will mount in the second half of the year. The new tariff regime could increase overall U.S. prices by 2% over the next two years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An executive order signed by President Trump on homelessness has sparked both outrage and cautious hope among local officials and advocates. The order's harsh language frames homelessness as a problem of "vagrancy" and "drug addiction," calling for the removal of encampments and tying federal funds to the enforcement of anti-camping laws. It also seeks to shift policy away from "housing first" and "harm reduction" models toward treatment-focused, and potentially coercive, approaches like civil commitment. While some see a push toward criminalization, others note the order could potentially provide funds for programs like Los Angeles's Inside Safe, creating ambiguity about its ultimate impact.</p>
