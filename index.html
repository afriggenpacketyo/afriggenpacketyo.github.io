          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries asserted that if a federal shutdown occurs, it will be because Republicans want it to happen, as they control all branches of government. He stated Democrats will not be intimidated by the Trump administration's warnings to agencies about potential mass firings. Jeffries emphasized his party's commitment to extending the Affordable Care Act's tax credits as a necessary component of any stopgap funding legislation. This stance creates a high-stakes political confrontation just days before the funding deadline.</p>

          <p>The FBI has determined that the suspect in the deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility, Joshua Jahn, undertook significant planning before the attack. Director Kash Patel stated Jahn had downloaded lists of DHS facilities, researched ballistics, and used apps to track ICE agents. A handwritten note recovered by authorities expressed a desire to inflict "real terror" on ICE agents, clarifying they were the intended targets, not the detainees. The attack, which killed one detainee and injured two others, has intensified the national debate on political violence.</p>

Stevens also accused Kennedy of spreading dangerous conspiracies regarding vaccines and politicizing agencies like the FDA and CDC.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have led to lower monthly payments for home equity loans, making them a more affordable borrowing option. For a $75,000 loan, a 10-year term now averages around $923 per month, while a 15-year term is about $726, both lower than costs earlier in the year. The article notes that with average home equity at $313,000, many homeowners can borrow such amounts without overleveraging their property. It advises borrowers to compare these fixed-rate loan costs with variable-rate HELOCs to determine the best fit for their financial needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, President Donald Trump urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to stop buying oil from Russia to curtail Moscow's funding amid the war in Ukraine. The discussion occurred as Turkey seeks to rejoin the F-35 fighter jet program, from which it was removed after purchasing a Russian air defense system. Trump expressed optimism about lifting sanctions and resolving the F-35 issue, suggesting a deal could be reached quickly. The meeting highlights the complex diplomatic balancing act between the NATO allies on issues of defense and energy security.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered numerous generals, admirals, and their staff from across the globe to an urgent, in-person meeting at Quantico, Virginia. The gathering is considered rare, if not unprecedented, due to its size and short notice. While the Pentagon has not disclosed the agenda, speculation centers on Hegseth's previously announced plans to reduce the number of four-star positions by 20%. Other possibilities include the rollout of the new National Defense Strategy, which may emphasize homeland defense operations.</p>

          <p>A new revision of "The Sacred Harp," a Christian songbook first published in 1844, was celebrated by over 700 singers in Atlanta. The tradition, which uses "shape notes" for sight-singing, has seen a resurgence among younger, more diverse participants, including people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals. The latest edition features 113 new songs from 49 living composers, a significant increase that reflects the changing demographics of the community.

          <p>A new study on Maria Branyas Morera, who died last year at 117 as the world's oldest person, suggests her extreme longevity resulted from a combination of genetics and lifestyle. Researchers at the University of Barcelona found she possessed unique genetic variants that protect against many disorders. Additionally, her habits, including not smoking or drinking and consuming a diet rich in olive oil, fish, and daily yogurt, likely contributed. The study posits that the beneficial bacteria from yogurt may have helped combat chronic inflammation, a key factor in aging and disease.</p>

Recent incidents, including Russian drones entering Polish territory and fighter jets violating Estonia's airspace, have led to explicit warnings. Polish and UK officials have threatened to shoot down future unauthorized aircraft, a stance surprisingly endorsed by President Trump.

If the two storms get close enough, they could engage in a rare meteorological phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two cyclones orbit each other. In some cases, a stronger storm can absorb a weaker one, though it is more common for them to "dance" around a common center before separating. While this outcome is considered unlikely, it adds a layer of complexity to forecasting the storms' ultimate paths and strengths.</p>

          <p>Pediatricians and infectious disease specialists are refuting medical advice given by President Trump, who suggested parents should wait until a child is 12 to administer the hepatitis B vaccine. Doctors stress that this is "extremely dangerous," as infants are at the highest risk of developing chronic, life-threatening liver disease if infected. They explain that the virus can be transmitted not just sexually, but also from mother to child at birth or through contact with infected bodily fluids on surfaces. Universal vaccination of newborns since 1991 has reduced infection rates in young people by 99%.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for music producer Sean "Diddy" Combs have asked a federal judge to either vacate his two prostitution convictions or grant him a new trial. Combs, who has been jailed since last September, was convicted in July of arranging interstate travel for prostitution but was acquitted of more severe sex trafficking charges. His lawyers argue the conviction was an unprecedented misuse of the 1910 Mann Act and that Combs has been punished enough, with his reputation and career destroyed. The judge has not yet ruled on the request ahead of his scheduled sentencing on October 3rd.</p>

          <p>Billy Vigar, a 21-year-old striker for Chichester City FC and a former Arsenal academy player, has died after sustaining a "significant brain injury" during a match last Saturday.

His family and former clubs, including Derby County and Hastings United, expressed their devastation, remembering him as a beloved figure in the sport.</p>

The memo advises agencies whose funding will expire to consider issuing reduction-in-force notices, a significant escalation from the temporary furloughs seen in past shutdowns. This move increases pressure on Congress to reach a funding agreement.

          <p>As part of a major turnaround effort, Starbucks plans to close hundreds of its U.S. and Canada stores and lay off close to 1,000 non-retail employees. In a message to staff, CEO Brian Niccol stated the cost-cutting measures are necessary to build a "stronger, and more resilient Starbucks." The company expects its total store count to decrease by about 1% by the end of the fiscal year. The restructuring will cost an estimated $1 billion, covering employee separation benefits and costs associated with exiting leases for the underperforming locations.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt at high levels and interest rates remaining elevated despite Federal Reserve cuts, this article explores the value of debt relief options for struggling borrowers. It notes that unlike mortgages, credit card APRs are not directly tied to the Fed's rate and are unlikely to decrease soon. Because interest compounds daily, carrying a balance becomes increasingly costly over time. The article suggests that strategies like debt consolidation, balance transfers, or formal debt management plans can provide a more effective path forward than waiting for rates to fall.

          <p>This opinion article argues that if Republicans are serious about protecting free speech, they should pass specific legislation rather than engage in "tit-for-tat" speech policing against the left. Citing suggestions from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), the author proposes several changes. These include eliminating FCC content regulations, requiring federal officials to report "jawboning" communications with social media companies, and passing a federal anti-SLAPP law to deter frivolous lawsuits. The piece contends such laws would safeguard expressive rights for all Americans, regardless of which party is in power.</p>

          <p>Researchers analyzing a million-year-old human skull found in China, named Yunxian 2, propose it could significantly alter our understanding of human evolution. Originally thought to be Homo erectus, the new analysis suggests it is an early form of Homo longi, a sister species to Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. If correct, this implies that our own species, Homo sapiens, may have emerged at least half a million years earlier than the current consensus of around 300,000 years ago. While some experts urge caution, the findings could rewrite a key chapter of our evolutionary history.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is facing a backlash from fellow Labour Party MPs over his perceived leadership ambitions and criticism of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. While Burnham claims some MPs have urged him to stand, a BBC survey of the parliamentary party found little appetite for a leadership challenge. Many MPs expressed frustration with Burnham for promoting himself during a difficult time for the government. Starmer dismissed the issue as "personal ambitions" and defended his government's fiscal policies against Burnham's calls for increased borrowing and spending.</p>

A key component involves copying TikTok's powerful content algorithm and retraining it to run exclusively on data from its U.S. user base.

Analysts note that while companies risk losing some subscribers, many viewers now consider these services essential, giving the platforms pricing power. This trend is forcing consumers to be more selective, leading to a "seasonal" subscription model where users hop between services based on content.</p>
