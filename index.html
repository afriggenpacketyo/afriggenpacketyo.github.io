          <p>Thomas Robinson, operating as The Wee Tea Plantation, has been jailed for three and a half years for defrauding luxury hotels and stores by selling foreign-grown tea as Scottish. Robinson falsely claimed his tea was grown in Scotland and even sold tea plants that he said were engineered to grow in Scotland, but actually came from Italy. High-end establishments like Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel and London's Dorchester Hotel were among his customers, with Robinson falsely claiming his tea was the "Queen's favorite." His scam also impacted genuine tea growers who purchased plants from him that failed to thrive. The Balmoral Hotel expressed disappointment and apologized to its guests for the deception. Optimism is low due to the deliberate and long-term nature of the fraud.</p>

          <p>Following democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory over Andrew Cuomo in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, Republicans are using the results to portray Democrats as extreme radicals. The National Republican Congressional Committee claimed Mamdani represents the "new face of the Democrat Party" and is a "socialist nightmare." Mamdani's platform includes eliminating bus fares, making City University of New York tuition-free, freezing rents on municipal housing, and providing free childcare. While progressive groups celebrate Mamdani's win as a shift towards a dynamic future, moderate Democrats express alarm, fearing it could hinder efforts to defeat Trumpism. The victory is seen as a barometer of the Democratic Party's direction, with implications for upcoming elections.</p>

The students are calling for accountability for the collapse of a canopy at Novi Sad Railway Station that killed 16 people eight months prior.

The students have warned that if snap elections are not called, citizens could take measures of civil disobedience to protect their democratic rights, and the protest is scheduled for Vidovdan, a significant date in Serbian history.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese defense experts are skeptical of claims that US strikes have obliterated Iran's nuclear facilities, citing assessments that core components remain intact. They point to the depth of Iran's underground facilities exceeding the penetration capabilities of the bombs used, and reports that Tehran may have moved enriched uranium before the attacks. One expert noted that the Fordow facility is buried about 80 to 90 meters underground, while the US's "bunker buster" bomb is said to penetrate 60 meters. Analysts suggest that the US likely did not achieve its intended operational goal in completely destroying the facilities.</p>

Factors contributing to this decline include reputational damage from CEO Elon Musk's political activities and rising competition from traditional automakers and Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD.

          <p>After decades of advocating for action against Iran's nuclear program, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is claiming a "historic victory" following 12 days of strikes on Iran. The strikes were followed by a US-brokered ceasefire, despite initial reluctance from President Trump. The situation marks a shift from past US efforts to deter Israel from attacking Iran, but Trump expressed displeasure at Israel's continued attacks after the ceasefire was supposed to take effect. Netanyahu's actions have helped him divert attention from domestic political problems, and he boasted about the strikes despite Trump's criticism.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) indicates that the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months. The assessment found that the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, but some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes. President Trump has claimed the facilities were "completely and totally obliterated," while the White House has criticized the assessment as "flat-out wrong." The assessment provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume its work, ranging from a few months to less than a year.</p>

The judge ordered the selection of a third-party monitor to review the data being produced by the city on its homeless housing and encampments goals.

          <p>Public speaking consultant Bill McGowan, who has coached numerous celebrities and CEOs, identifies a common communication mistake: the overuse of corporate jargon. McGowan argues that using bland and boring words and phrases in an attempt to sound smart can confuse people and come across as inauthentic. He advises against writing speeches or presentations for the eye, which often includes longer, flowier phrases, and instead recommends writing for the ear, using language that is similar to how people talk in everyday conversation. By avoiding jargon and using clear, relatable language, individuals can connect more effectively with their audience.</p>

          <p>Eurostar passengers are facing severe delays after cable theft near Lille, France, which has caused trains to be rerouted and journey times to be extended. This disruption follows two separate incidents on Tuesday in which two people died on the LGV Nord line, further impacting services. Passengers are advised to postpone their journeys, and five trains between London and Paris have already been cancelled. The railway line has been repaired, but delays are expected to persist throughout the day, leaving passengers stranded and stations overcrowded.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the Republican-controlled Legislature in a dispute with Democratic Governor Tony Evers, restricting the governor's veto powers. The court struck down Evers' partial veto of a Republican bill and affirmed the Legislature's authority to place funds for state programs into an emergency fund under its budget committee's control. This decision is likely to result in the Legislature exerting greater influence over spending and crafting budget bills to circumvent Evers' vetoes.

Cassidy's criticism comes after Kennedy fired all 17 members of ACIP and replaced them with individuals, including some with anti-vaccine views.
