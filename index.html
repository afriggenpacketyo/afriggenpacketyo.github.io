          <p>The United Kingdom's annual inflation rate unexpectedly rose to 3.6% in June, surpassing economists' forecasts of 3.4%. According to the Office for National Statistics, the increase was primarily driven by motor fuel and food prices, with core inflation also ticking up to 3.7%. The higher-than-expected data prompted a slight rise in the British pound against the dollar. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves acknowledged that the cost of living continues to pressure working people, indicating more government action is needed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma farmer was killed after being trapped in an enclosure with two water buffaloes he had purchased just one day prior. First responders were initially unable to reach the victim, Bradley McMichael, due to the animals' aggressive behavior, and had to dispatch them to access the scene. McMichael was found with fatal lacerations, and authorities believe he became trapped while tending to the newly acquired livestock. The investigation into the tragic incident is currently ongoing.</p>

          <p>The MLB All-Star Game was decided by a home run swing-off for the first time, with the National League defeating the American League 7-6 overall. After the game ended in a 6-6 tie, Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs in the tiebreaker to secure the win and earn MVP honors. A unique aspect of the new format involved Dodgers third base coach Dino Ebel pitching to the NL hitters during the high-pressure event. The exciting conclusion was widely praised by players and managers for energizing the exhibition game.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests the U.S. dollar's long-standing dominance as the world's reserve currency is eroding due to declining global trust in American financial stewardship. The article points to the rise of the BRICS economic bloc, which is increasingly conducting trade in national currencies and has surpassed the G7 in purchasing power parity. Movements in Africa to abandon the CFA franc and European nations repatriating gold reserves are also cited as evidence of a shift toward a multi-polar monetary system. This trend is further fueled by concerns over the U.S. weaponizing the dollar through sanctions. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the Centre for Retail Research, over 17,000 retail sites are projected to close this year, resulting in the loss of nearly 202,000 jobs.

The author contends that Trump was persuaded only after European allies demonstrated they would foot the bill, framing it as a deal that benefits the U.S. financially. The analysis suggests Trump's support is unreliable and driven by pique at Vladimir Putin for not accepting a ceasefire deal, rather than a genuine commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty.

          <p>In his 11th All-Star Game, veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw served as a sentimental favorite and team leader, delivering a pregame speech to his National League teammates about the importance of the event. The 37-year-old, a special "Legend Pick" by the commissioner, pitched briefly in the second inning to a loud ovation, possibly his final appearance in the midsummer classic. Kershaw, who was mic'd up for the broadcast, showed a lighter side, joking with the announcers during his outing. Fellow players expressed their deep respect for the future Hall of Famer's presence and class.</p>

The move aims to regulate the complex and often chaotic system that allows college athletes to earn money from their personal brand, which has generated millions for top players since 2021. This action follows a House subcommittee's advancement of a bill to supersede the current patchwork of state laws governing NIL. The White House is engaging with the issue amid bipartisan concerns that the current system lacks protections for student-athletes.</p>

Prosecutors allege the 47-year-old was motivated by an affair and financial difficulties, and that he administered a final fatal dose while his wife was in the hospital. The defense argues the evidence does not prove he poisoned her, describing the victim as "broken" by her husband's infidelity. Craig has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and other charges, including soliciting the murder of an investigator.</p>

          <p>The White House delivered an ultimatum to the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the nation's largest public utility: fire CEO Don Moul or be fired themselves. The board refused, arguing in a letter that Moul's brief tenure has aligned with President Trump's energy goals. This conflict arose after country singer John Rich, a Trump ally, protested a proposed TVA gas plant near Nashville, a project the utility has now backed away from. Sources suggest the move may be a pretext for Trump to install a more closely allied CEO and potentially set the stage for privatizing the government-owned utility.</p>
