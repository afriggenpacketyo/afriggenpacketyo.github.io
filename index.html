          <p>A shooting outside a bar in Cleveland, Ohio, has left five individuals injured, one of whom is believed to be a suspect. The incident, which occurred Sunday evening in The Flats neighborhood, reportedly stemmed from an altercation that began inside a nearby establishment and escalated outdoors. Cleveland police responded to the scene, where they administered aid before all five victims were transported to the hospital. The conditions of the injured have not been released, and the investigation into the shooting is currently ongoing with no arrests announced yet.</p>

          <h2>China-US Study Reveals Mars Has a Solid Inner Core, Challenging Previous Assumptions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 22:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative study between Chinese and American researchers has found that Mars possesses a solid inner core, a discovery that contradicts previous models of the planet's composition. By analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, the team determined the solid core has a radius of about 600 kilometers, proportionally similar to Earth's. This finding is significant because planets are not expected to form solid inner cores without sufficient time to cool. The discovery places Mars alongside Earth and the Moon as the only known bodies in our solar system with this feature, potentially reviving theories about past plate tectonics on the Red Planet.</p>

          <p>A man believed to be Thomas Phillips, a fugitive who had been hiding with his three children in remote New Zealand wilderness for nearly four years, has been shot and killed during an armed confrontation with police. The incident occurred after authorities responded to a farm shop break-in and pursued a quad bike, leading to an exchange of gunfire that also left one officer critically injured. One of Phillips' children was found at the scene and is now in custody, while an urgent search is underway for the other two missing children. The case has captivated the nation since the family first disappeared in 2021.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index saw a significant 1.5% rise, and the Topix index climbed to a new record high after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his intention to resign. The market's positive reaction is attributed to investor excitement over potential successors, particularly Takaichi Sanae, who is seen as a proponent of deregulation and economic growth. While the political future remains uncertain, investors are optimistic that new leadership could introduce policies favorable to the market. In contrast to the stock market rally, the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, and government bond yields continued to rise amid fiscal uncertainty.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece by Rahm Emanuel in The Wall Street Journal posits that the United States has historically required an external threat to foster internal political unity, suggesting China now fills that role. The author of the responding article critiques this premise, arguing that it misrepresents China's intentions and overlooks America's own internal divisions as the source of its political turmoil. The article refutes the idea that China views the U.S. as a strategic adversary rather than a competitor. It concludes that blaming China for America's domestic problems, such as the re-election of Donald Trump, is a flawed perspective that ignores internal accountability.</p>

In a social media post, Trump called on all foreign firms investing in the U.S. to prioritize hiring and training Americans.

This was the first time a sitting or former president attended the US Open in over two decades, continuing a trend of Trump making appearances at high-profile sporting events.

However, he appears to lack the necessary support, continuing the political crisis that began after President Emmanuel Macron's snap election in 2024 weakened his centrist government.

This arrangement, known as "living apart together" (LAT), allows them to pursue different life goals while remaining happily married, maintaining their connection through regular communication. While only a small percentage of married couples live separately, the article notes it is a choice made by some high-profile figures as well. Experts suggest that for some, living apart can provide personal space and help maintain a sense of individual identity within the marriage.</p>

          <p>According to Bank of America's head of global research, international investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, increasingly allocating capital to Asia. This shift is reportedly driven by the region's burgeoning artificial intelligence sector, a weakening U.S. dollar, and expectations of looser U.S. monetary policy. While U.S. stocks attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020 to 2024, investment has slowed this year, with funds now being split more evenly with international markets. BofA projects the global AI market will quadruple to $1.2 trillion by 2030, with a substantial portion deployed in the Asia-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chrysler has issued a recall for more than 91,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee plug-in hybrid electric vehicles from model years 2022 to 2026. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a software error in the hybrid control processor can cause an unexpected loss of drive power. This sudden propulsion loss could increase the risk of a crash without any prior warning. Chrysler has stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this defect. A remedy is currently being developed, and affected owners will be notified starting in October.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse on Sunday night created a spectacular "Blood Moon," which was visible to stargazers across Asia and parts of Europe and Africa. This phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that makes the lunar surface appear a deep red. The reddish hue is caused by sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out blue light and allows red light to pass through and illuminate the moon. While observers in Asia had the best view of the total eclipse, those in the Americas were unable to see the event.</p>

Nine-year-old Alice Aguiar, six-year-old Bebe King, and seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe were murdered last year by Axel Rudakubana, who was sentenced to life in prison. The first phase of the inquiry will examine the killer's history and his interactions with various agencies to identify any missed opportunities to prevent the attack.

          <p>The U.S. is projected to lose approximately $30 billion in international tourism revenue this year, as factors like the country's political climate and a strong dollar deter foreign visitors. The World Travel & Tourism Council has sharply revised its forecast for international spending downward. This decline is benefiting other countries, particularly Canada, Mexico, and nations in Latin America, which are seeing an increase in visitors who might have otherwise traveled to the U.S. The U.S. share of global international travel is expected to fall to its lowest point in decades, with no recovery anticipated in the near future.</p>

This financial strain is compounded by a budget deficit and the fact that city services have not been restored to pre-pandemic levels after significant cuts. The city council is being asked to approve the emergency declaration to address the growing financial challenges and potential impacts from changes in the national economy.</p>

          <p>Customs officials in Nigeria have intercepted an illegal shipment of more than 1,600 parrots and canaries that were being transported from Lagos to Kuwait without the required permits. This seizure highlights Nigeria's role as a major hub for the illegal wildlife trade, a multi-billion dollar industry that threatens global biodiversity. Conservation experts note that the trade is fueled by corruption and lax enforcement of international conventions designed to protect endangered species. Animal smuggling not only endangers the creatures involved but also poses risks to local ecosystems by removing key species or introducing invasive ones.</p>

Trump's clarification came as he continues to float plans to deploy the National Guard to Democratic-led cities to combat crime and assist with immigration enforcement.
