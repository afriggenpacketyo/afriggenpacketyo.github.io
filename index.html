          <p>A 90-year-old amateur golfer in the U.K. celebrated his milestone birthday by scoring his first-ever hole-in-one after playing for three decades. John Payne achieved the remarkable feat on a 200-yard par-three hole, an event he described as a "miracle" and a "once-in-a-lifetime shot." Despite deteriorating eyesight, he continues to play regularly and stay active with gym sessions, attributing his longevity and mobility to his active lifestyle. The achievement was celebrated by his family and the local golf club community.</p>

          <p>Tesla investors are showing increasing skepticism towards CEO Elon Musk's futuristic promises, such as fully autonomous robotaxis, as the company faces immediate challenges. The electric vehicle maker reported a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive sales for the second quarter, coupled with thinning profits and increased competition. Despite Musk's bold claims about AI superiority and future growth, the stock has underperformed, reflecting a market more focused on current profitability and operational hurdles than on long-term, speculative ventures.

          <h2>Study Finds Hazardous 'Forever Chemicals' in Reusable Period Products</h2>

          <p>A US research team has discovered the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals," in many reusable period products. These toxic substances, linked to cancer and fertility issues, were found in nearly a third of tested items like period underwear and menstrual cups, likely added during manufacturing. The chemicals pose a risk through skin absorption and contaminate the environment upon disposal, undermining the products' eco-friendly claims. Researchers urge consumers to demand PFAS-free products to drive industry change.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 75-year-old dog trainer, discovered he had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a fatal lung disease, after a routine pre-surgery X-ray revealed scarring in his lungs. Initially given less than a year to live, he was initially resistant but ultimately underwent a successful double-lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic. The procedure gave him a second chance at life, and he has since recovered significant lung capacity. Now, he is training a new therapy dog named "Encore" to celebrate his renewed life and perspective.</p>

          <p>According to sources, U.S. President Donald Trump is interested in visiting China in October or November, although a previously rumored September trip is no longer being considered. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are reportedly working to arrange the visit, which could occur before or after the APEC summit in South Korea. Recent high-level talks between the two nations' top diplomats were described as positive, suggesting a shared consensus on facilitating a leader-level summit. Hurdles remain, but discussions are ongoing to finalize the details for a potential meeting later this year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, following political pressure. This move comes as speculation mounts over the extent of Trump's relationship with the late sex trafficker. However, legal experts suggest that these transcripts may not reveal significant new information about Epstein's network of abusers or potential cover-ups. They argue that more revealing details are likely contained in unreleased FBI interview summaries and internal Justice Department memoranda.</p>

The album features a more subtle, R&B-influenced, and melancholic sound, which seems to resonate with the current cultural mood. This article suggests that the music's reserved and gentle quality fills a void in a landscape dominated by stale hits. The album's success reflects a broader trend towards downtempo, introspective music, possibly indicating a collective sense of malaise or a desire for soothing, complex sounds.</p>

The piece contends that while the Epstein story is sensational, these complex and less-discussed problems will have a far greater impact on the future of the country and the world.

          <p>Tennis star Venus Williams joked that she returned to competition for the health insurance benefits, a comment that resonated widely and highlighted the complexities of the U.S. healthcare system. As a professional athlete with an intermittent work schedule and specific health needs, her situation illustrates the challenge of securing coverage outside of traditional, full-time employment. The article explains how job-based insurance, COBRA, and the Affordable Care Act function, noting that even a wealthy celebrity like Williams is not immune to the anxieties and "job lock" associated with America's employment-linked insurance model.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has condemned the Hong Kong government for offering cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists living in Britain. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries labeled the bounties an act of "transnational repression" and reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights and safety of Hong Kongers in the UK. The 19 targeted individuals are accused of violating Beijing's national security law. This is the latest in a series of such rewards targeting activists who have fled abroad, many to the UK under a special visa scheme.</p>

The incident occurred early Friday morning while four people were playing video games in a dorm room, leading to a campus-wide shelter-in-place order. New Mexico State Police have arrested and charged an 18-year-old suspect, John Fuentes, with first-degree murder and other offenses. The university closed its central campus for the day but has since announced that normal activities will resume, while offering counseling services to the community.</p>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan have rejected an attempt to recall two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT), a China-friendly party. The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to shift the balance of power in the legislature where an opposition bloc currently holds the majority. The failure of the recall effort, which was driven by anger over the KMT's blocking of key legislation, means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face significant legislative resistance. Another recall vote against seven more KMT lawmakers is scheduled for August.</p>

The notice did not specify the duration of the ban, but it signals a crackdown on misconduct within China's sensitive defense-industrial complex.</p>

          <p>President Trump's extensive use of tariffs, justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), is facing a crucial legal test in a federal appeals court. A lower court previously ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, a decision that was paused pending appeal. The outcome of this case could invalidate many of Trump's major trade actions, including tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, and his "reciprocal" tariff policy. Legal experts believe the case is destined for the Supreme Court and could dismantle the core of the administration's trade strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

From his working-class origins and founding of heavy metal with Black Sabbath to his notorious solo career fueled by excess, he constantly defied expectations. He later reinvented himself as a beloved, bumbling television father on the reality show "The Osbournes," showcasing a different side to his "Prince of Darkness" persona.

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, conditions in Niger have not improved and have worsened in some areas, according to analysts. The junta, which cited insecurity and economic woes to justify its takeover, has seen a crackdown on civil liberties, job losses in the NGO sector, and a deepening rift with regional body ECOWAS. With the coup leader recently sworn in for a five-year term, prospects for a swift return to civilian rule appear dim.

          <p>Germany is facing a significant rise in loneliness, especially among its younger population, a trend experts attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic and the influence of social media. Studies show that one in five teenagers feels lonely, which can impact school performance and make them more susceptible to authoritarian thinking and political extremism. Sociologists note that loneliness is also prevalent in rural areas with fewer social opportunities and among the middle-aged who face unemployment. This growing social issue is now seen as a potential threat to both individual well-being and democratic stability.</p>

While the British Medical Association states that striking is a last resort, affected patients are experiencing an emotional toll from the repeated postponements.

The author recalls how, in the 1990s, Combs became a formidable ambassador of "Black cool," representing ambition, success, and the ability to bridge street culture with mainstream luxury. For a generation, he was an aspirational figure who seemed to embody a new kind of freedom and success. The article laments how the verve and swagger he once represented have now curdled into something rancid and heartbreaking.</p>

          <p>As climate change leads to hotter and more frequent heat waves, more Americans are spending their summers indoors to avoid the heat, potentially contributing to a form of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). This "summer depression" involves symptoms like low energy and sadness, which may stem from a lack of sun exposure and social isolation, analogous to winter SAD. While summer SAD is less studied, experts are concerned about the escalating mental health impacts of extreme heat, which is also linked to mood disorders, anxiety, and aggression, creating a difficult choice between enduring heat outdoors or isolation indoors.</p>

The Dodgers are in need of right-handed relief pitching, and Jansen is having a solid season, though he is a pending free agent on a struggling Angels team. While Jansen expressed a desire to help the Angels win, he acknowledged the business side of baseball and would be open to a non-closer role on a contending team.
