          <h2>India Faces Pressure to Finalize US Trade Agreement Ahead of Tariff Deadline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 02:29:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is under increasing pressure to secure a trade deal with the United States before an August 1st deadline, which would raise tariffs to 26%. The urgency is heightened by a recent US-Japan trade agreement and India's own deal with the UK, where it protected sensitive agricultural sectors. Analysts suggest the U.S. also has strategic interests in a deal, viewing India as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific and a potential manufacturing alternative to China. India is leveraging its multi-alignment strategy and its role in BRICS to negotiate favorable terms while balancing geopolitical pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automaker Volkswagen announced a significant 36.3% drop in second-quarter profits, attributing the decline to US tariffs, rising costs, and a shift towards lower-margin electric vehicles. The company plans to proceed with restructuring, including cutting 35,000 jobs by 2030. In separate news, Germany's new conservative-led government has increased deportations by over 2,000 in the first half of the year compared to 2024. This tougher migration policy has drawn criticism from a leading migration researcher who calls it a "bluff" that undermines EU law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Strikes Down California's Ammunition Background Check Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 02:18:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional. In a 2-1 decision, the court found the law infringes upon the Second Amendment right to bear arms, stating the state failed to prove it aligns with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the ruling as a "slap in the face" to gun violence prevention efforts, while the state's attorney general is considering legal options. The plaintiffs, including an Olympic shooter and a gun rights group, hailed the decision as a victory against overreaching gun control.</p>

          <p>China has stepped into a mediation role following deadly border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia, urging both nations to exercise restraint and de-escalate the situation. A Chinese official emphasized that both countries are "good neighbours" to China and important ASEAN members, expressing hope for a peaceful resolution. The conflict, which erupted along their shared border, involved artillery and rocket fire, resulting in multiple deaths, primarily civilians.

          <p>A severe hunger crisis is unfolding in Gaza, with residents struggling daily to find food amid constant Israeli bombardment and a near-total blockade. International organizations like the WHO and WFP report that a large portion of the population is starving, with malnutrition-related deaths increasing significantly. Food prices have surged, and access to aid is severely limited and dangerous, with an average of only 28 trucks entering daily, far below what is needed. Displaced Palestinians describe a desperate situation where they have lost significant weight and face the constant threat of dying from either airstrikes or starvation.</p>

The German automaker cited the negative impact of U.S. import tariffs, competition from Chinese brands, and higher sales of lower-margin electric vehicles as key challenges. The company now expects its operating return on sales to be between 4% and 5%, down from a previous forecast of 5.5% to 6.5%. This adjustment reflects the significant pressure the automotive sector faces from global trade disputes and market shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England have commenced a five-day strike, marking the 12th walkout in a long-standing pay dispute with the government. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has pledged to minimize disruption by ordering hospitals to avoid canceling treatments except in exceptional circumstances, a shift from previous strikes that focused only on emergency care. The British Medical Association (BMA) warns this approach could stretch staff too thinly and reiterated that restoring pay, which they claim has fallen by a fifth since 2008 in real terms, is the only solution. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has urged the doctors to call off the strike.</p>

          <p>Six university students have died after falling into an industrial flotation tank during a field trip to a copper-molybdenum mine in Inner Mongolia, China. The students, from Northeastern University, were visiting the mine when a grating panel reportedly gave way, causing them to fall into the slurry-filled tank; a teacher was also injured. The incident has led to growing calls in Chinese state media and from the public for a thorough investigation and stricter safety measures. The Inner Mongolia regional government has assembled an accident investigation team to determine the cause and recommend corrective actions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8 billion merger between Skydance Media and Paramount Global. The deal, which places brands like CBS and Paramount Pictures under Skydance's control, was approved after Skydance pledged to install an ombudsman to handle bias complaints at CBS News. The approval came shortly after Paramount settled a $16 million lawsuit with President Donald Trump and cancelled "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," moves that critics have condemned as politically motivated to secure the merger's approval from the Trump administration.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. The suit claims these policies intentionally obstruct federal immigration enforcement and lead to the release of dangerous criminals. The move follows a recent shooting of a CBP officer, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant, and promises by Homeland Security officials to "flood the zone" with agents in sanctuary cities. The mayor's office stated it supports the essence of the laws but agrees they go too far in protecting violent criminals.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to experimentally observe and measure quantum friction between two solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, they discovered a counterintuitive effect where friction did not always increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds slid more easily. The team attributed this phenomenon to changes in electron movement within the bent material, which locked them into fixed energy levels and reduced the conversion of motion into heat. The findings could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanoscale devices and machines.</p>
