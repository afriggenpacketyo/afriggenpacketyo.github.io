          <p>In an economic climate marked by persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a secure savings option, with top accounts offering returns that outpace the current inflation rate. The article highlights that online banks typically provide more competitive rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions due to lower overhead costs. It also notes an inverted yield curve phenomenon, where short-term CDs, such as those with six-month to one-year terms, currently offer higher interest rates than long-term ones. Financial experts suggest strategies like laddering CDs to maximize returns in this environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Multiple states are cautioning that the federal government shutdown could halt the distribution of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in November. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees the program, has informed states of insufficient funds to cover payments if the shutdown persists, affecting over 40 million Americans who rely on this aid for groceries. While the USDA possesses a multi-billion dollar contingency fund that could be used, it remains unclear if the administration will choose to deploy it, leaving millions of vulnerable individuals in a state of uncertainty regarding their food security.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown will force active-duty U.S. military members to work without receiving timely pay until a funding resolution is passed by Congress. While civilian employees deemed essential will also continue working, their pay is similarly delayed. Unlike in previous shutdowns, a legislative measure to ensure military pay continues has not yet passed. In response, some financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA are offering no-interest loans to affected service members to help mitigate financial hardship during this period of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>While the U.S. government shutdown is not expected to halt the mortgage industry, it may cause delays for certain borrowers, particularly those seeking government-backed loans. Applicants for conventional mortgages from private lenders should see minimal impact. However, those pursuing loans insured by the FHA or VA, or issued by the USDA, might face processing slowdowns due to worker furloughs. A significant concern is the potential disruption to the National Flood Insurance Program, which could complicate closings for homes in high-risk flood zones.</p>

          <p>Despite the government shutdown causing hundreds of thousands of federal employees to be furloughed or work without pay, members of Congress and the president will continue to receive their salaries. This is because their compensation is guaranteed by the Constitution and funded through a permanent appropriation that does not require annual renewal. In contrast, most federal workers, including congressional staff, will have their paychecks delayed until a funding agreement is reached. A 2019 law ensures that all furloughed federal employees will receive back pay once the shutdown concludes.</p>

          <p>A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding legislation, forcing federal agencies to cease all non-essential operations. This affects a wide range of services, with essential employees like active-duty military and air traffic controllers required to work without immediate pay. Programs with permanent funding, such as Social Security and Medicare, continue to operate, though administrative services may be delayed. The economic impact can be significant, as the last major shutdown in 2018-2019 cost the economy an estimated $11 billion, highlighting the widespread disruption caused by legislative gridlock.</p>

          <p>The UK Foreign Office has added eight more countries, including Japan, Mexico, and Russia, to its travel advisory list concerning the risk of methanol poisoning from counterfeit alcoholic drinks. This update follows several incidents involving British nationals, highlighting the danger of consuming homemade or illicitly altered spirits. Methanol, a toxic industrial chemical, is sometimes added to drinks by unscrupulous sellers to cut costs. Officials are urging travelers to purchase sealed drinks from licensed venues and to be aware of symptoms like blurry vision and confusion, which require immediate medical attention.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for significant wind and rain expected on Thursday across southern and eastern England, as well as parts of Wales. A deepening low-pressure system is predicted to bring heavy rainfall, with totals potentially reaching 50mm, and strong north-westerly winds gusting up to 65mph. While the impacts in the UK may not be severe enough to warrant naming the storm, meteorological agencies in France or Belgium might name it Storm Benjamin due to potentially stronger effects on the continent. Residents are advised to prepare for localized flooding and travel disruptions.</p>

The attack, which killed two other crew members, was part of a series of U.S. operations targeting narcotics vessels in the Caribbean. A second survivor, a Colombian citizen, was repatriated and remains hospitalized. The incident has drawn criticism from some South American leaders who view the U.S. actions as part of a failed regional strategy, while President Trump defended the strike against what he called "terrorists."</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced plans to cut business red tape by scrapping "needless form filling" and simplifying corporate rules, a move the Treasury estimates will save firms nearly £6 billion annually. The reforms include streamlining the company merger process and removing lengthy reporting requirements for over 100,000 small businesses. Business Secretary Peter Kyle also suggested that temporary regulatory exemptions could be granted for new AI technologies to foster rapid growth. Critics, however, argue the measures will be ineffective if the government proceeds with tax hikes for employers.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's optimistic statements about securing a "fantastic deal" with China, analysts remain skeptical about the likelihood of a comprehensive trade agreement in the near future. Trump's remarks, which included a call for China to purchase more soybeans, were paired with a threat to impose 100% tariffs if negotiations fail. This mixed messaging comes as the U.S. signs a critical minerals deal with Australia aimed at reducing reliance on China. Experts view the conciliatory signals as a willingness to continue dialogue but believe significant hurdles remain before a lasting resolution is reached. (not investment advice)</p>

An energy assistance advocacy group warns that families may be forced to ration heat, and is urging utility companies to suspend disconnections for overdue bills until the federal funding is released.

          <p>The recent unveiling of an unflattering bronze statue of Tina Turner has reignited a conversation about why so many memorial statues of famous figures fail to capture their likeness. Art experts suggest that the push for hyper-realism is a primary factor, as even minor inaccuracies can create an uncanny and unsettling result. The pressure of deadlines and the conservative nature of commissioning committees often lead to a lack of artistic imagination and risk-taking. This contrasts with more abstract and successful memorials, like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which prioritize conveying an essence or emotion over literal representation.</p>

The 2-1 ruling stated the planned 60-day deployment was a "measured response."
