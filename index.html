          <p>Miguel Uribe Turbay, a Colombian presidential candidate, was shot in the head at a campaign event in Bogota. The 39-year-old senator was addressing a small crowd when the attack occurred. Police have arrested a 15-year-old suspect, and Uribe's wife has asked for prayers as he fights for his life. The Centro Democratico party, to which Uribe belongs, has condemned the attack, emphasizing the threat it poses to democracy and freedom in Colombia. The incident has raised concerns about political violence in the country as it approaches the next election. The candidate is currently in critical condition and receiving medical treatment. Optimism around the event is low considering the violent nature of the attack.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement operations. These protests, which began Friday evening, have seen clashes between demonstrators and authorities. President Trump signed a memorandum to address what the White House Press Secretary called "lawlessness" in California. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the federal government's move as "purposefully inflammatory" and warned that it would escalate tensions. The deployment highlights the ongoing conflict between the federal government and California over immigration policies. The move has sparked controversy and raised concerns about federal overreach.</p>

          <p>The UK government's upcoming Spending Review will include an Â£86 billion package for the science and technology sector to fund research into drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries. The package includes up to Â£500 million for regions across the UK, allowing local leaders to decide how the funds are spent. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that investing in the sector would create jobs and boost security. Research backers have cautioned that the government needs to do more to secure the UK's global reputation for science, including a decade-long plan to train workers and address visa costs for overseas scientists. The investment aims to benefit communities across the country by directing funding to specific areas of expertise.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that microplastics from polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after ingestion. Researchers in China and the United States discovered that these microplastics altered gut metabolism and damaged the gut barrier in mice. This damage could potentially contribute to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. The study's corresponding author, Cui Xuejing, stated that this is the first time microplastics have been found to enter the body's metabolic cycle. The increased use of PLA in food packaging and disposable tableware has led to greater oral exposure to these microplastics.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have excavated an ancient workshop on the Greek island of Paros, revealing unfinished marble sculptures and other artifacts. The excavation took place at the Floga archaeological site, which has been studied since the mid-1980s. The latest dig uncovered new architectural remains, eating vessels, and storage items, documenting the site's continuous use over time. Artifacts discovered include semi-finished marble sculptures of Aphrodite, clay heads of female figures, clay molds, and pottery fragments. The site was reorganized at the end of the third century B.C., serving as both a residential space and a sculpture workshop, as indicated by the discovery of a room with a pebble floor and wall paintings.</p>

          <p>The disappearance of Jermain Charlo in June 2018 remains unsolved, with the Missoula Police Department and other agencies actively investigating the case. Charlo was last seen at The Badlander bar in Missoula, Montana, and security footage shows her with her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance. DeFrance initially claimed he dropped her off at a supermarket, but later changed his story, stating he dropped her off in a residential area. Cellphone data indicated Charlo's phone pinged off a cell tower near DeFrance's residence after her disappearance, and DeFrance later admitted to discarding her phone in Idaho. Despite numerous searches and investigations, Charlo has not been found, and DeFrance has never been named a suspect.</p>

After a cautious first year, the government aims to convince investors that its economic plans are real and prioritize long-term challenges like industrial energy prices and social care costs. The chancellor's focus is on long-term capital spending, earmarking 2.7% of GDP for capital spending, the highest sustained level in nearly half a century. The review also includes increases in spending on research and development to boost science-led growth, with a marquee project being the high-speed rail line between Liverpool and Manchester.

The referendum proposes reducing the wait time from 10 years to five, aligning Italy with most other European nations. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has announced she will boycott the vote, deeming the current citizenship law already "excellent." The referendum, initiated by citizens and supported by civil society groups, requires a 50% voter turnout to be valid. The debate over who gets to be Italian is sensitive, especially with the influx of migrants and refugees, though this referendum targets legal workers and their families.</p>

          <p>China has signaled its readiness to engage in talks regarding rare earth exports and has approved qualified export applications. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that it acknowledges the growing global demand for medium and heavy rare earths in civilian sectors. As a responsible major power, China has considered the legitimate needs of other countries and will continue strengthening its compliance review process. Rare earths are a key point of discussion in trade negotiations between China and the United States, and this move suggests a willingness to address concerns and facilitate compliant trade. The Vice-Premier will meet US officials in London this week to discuss the topic.</p>

          <p>Iranian rapper Tataloo, once a supporter of a hard-line presidential candidate, now faces a death sentence for "insulting Islamic sanctities." Tataloo's music gained popularity among Iranian youth for challenging the theocracy, especially after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini. His lyrics became increasingly political, criticizing authorities in music videos. The Iranian Supreme Court upheld his death sentence, leading to concern from activists. Tataloo's career evolved from underground music to endorsing hard-liners before facing legal troubles and ultimately imprisonment. This case highlights the risks faced by artists who challenge the Iranian government.</p>

          <p>President Trump is deploying 2,000 National Guard troops to California without the consent of Governor Gavin Newsom to quell immigration protests. Trump invoked a rarely used law to federalize the National Guard, citing the need to protect ICE and other federal personnel. Newsom accused the White House of "sowing chaos" and escalating tensions. The deployment highlights the ongoing conflict between the federal government and California over immigration enforcement. This action has raised concerns about federal overreach and the use of military force against civilians.</p>

          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, shares her experience of returning to work part-time after having her first child, highlighting the importance of flexible working arrangements for new parents. She believes offering such flexibility is crucial for addressing recruitment and retention issues in the teaching profession. The government is trying to improve flexible working as part of its pledge to recruit 6,500 new teachers, and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has encouraged more schools to offer flexible hours. Data suggests that the number of teachers has fallen, and targets for trainee teacher recruitment were missed. However, the number of teachers leaving the profession has slightly improved compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Plans by the UK government to modernize and potentially expand its nuclear weapons arsenal are undermining international non-proliferation efforts. The move is expected to fuel a global nuclear arms race led by the US, China, and Russia. This increases the risk of lower-yield tactical nukes being deployed in conflict zones. Critics argue that this policy perpetuates illusions about Britain's global power status. The government justifies the additional Â£15bn investment by citing a changed global threat, but the move is seen as hypocritical and dangerous.</p>

Rhodes draws parallels with Vladimir Putin's Russia and Viktor Orban's Hungary, where political and personal interests are fused.

Trump criticized the Mayor and Governor, stating that if they can't do their jobs, the federal government will step in. Despite these claims, the Los Angeles Police Department reported that demonstrations were "peaceful."</p>
