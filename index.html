          <p>The team bus for the Wales women's national football team was involved in a traffic accident in Switzerland while en route to a training session for their Euro 2025 match against France. The Football Association of Wales confirmed that all players and staff on the bus were uninjured, though the driver of the other vehicle involved was hospitalized with minor injuries. As a result of the incident, the team's planned training session at the stadium was canceled, but they later trained at their base. French manager Laurent Bonadei expressed his support for the Welsh team.</p>

          <p>Top-ranked tennis player Aryna Sabalenka secured her spot in the Wimbledon semi-finals after a difficult three-set victory over German veteran Laura Siegemund. Despite being the clear favorite, Sabalenka struggled initially, losing the first set before rallying to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 in a match lasting nearly three hours. Siegemund's unconventional style and slower pace of play tested Sabalenka's composure and resilience. This victory keeps Sabalenka on track for a potential first Wimbledon title, having reached the finals in the last three major tournaments.</p>

          <p>At least 109 people have died after catastrophic flash floods struck the Guadalupe River area in Texas during the July Fourth weekend.

          <p>The first report from the official inquiry into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal has detailed the "disastrous" human cost for the hundreds of sub-postmasters who were wrongfully prosecuted. The report by Sir Wyn Williams reveals that the false accusations led to severe mental health crises, including suicide attempts, alcohol addiction, and divorces among the victims. The inquiry makes urgent recommendations, including providing free legal advice, compensating family members, and initiating a restorative justice program. It also criticizes the Post Office for its adversarial approach and delays in delivering financial redress to those affected.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, conspiracy theories suggesting that "cloud seeding" caused or exacerbated the disaster have spread on social media, amplified by some political figures. This fact-check article dismisses these claims as false, citing multiple meteorological and atmospheric science experts. Scientists explain that cloud seeding cannot create massive storm systems and that any particles from recent operations would have dispersed long before the flood. Experts affirm that the flooding was caused by a combination of natural weather phenomena over a flood-prone region, warning that climate change will likely make such extreme events more common.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision limiting the power of lower courts to issue universal injunctions has advanced the Trump administration's goal of ending birthright citizenship. While the policy itself has not been ruled constitutional, the court's procedural decision raises the possibility that the executive order could take effect in parts of the country not covered by specific, narrower court orders. Legal challenges are now shifting, with plaintiffs seeking class-action status to create broader protections. The underlying constitutional debate over the 14th Amendment is expected to eventually return to the Supreme Court for a final decision.</p>

The proposed model aims to make voluntary service more attractive with higher pay, while allowing the government to call up conscripts if there are not enough volunteers during a crisis. This plan is a response to the changed security landscape in Europe and seeks to bolster the Bundeswehr's numbers to meet new NATO guidelines.

The move, which India claims is a response to cross-border terrorism, threatens Pakistan's water supply, as the Indus Basin irrigates 80% of its arid land and supports its agriculture-based economy. While India's ability to immediately cut off water is limited, the suspension creates deep uncertainty and has been labeled an act of "weaponizing water" by Pakistan.

          <p>The historic Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts the Norman conquest of England in 1066, will be loaned to the UK for the first time since its creation over nine centuries ago. The 70-meter-long embroidery will be displayed at the British Museum in London from autumn 2026 to July 2027, while its home museum in France undergoes renovation. This landmark cultural exchange, a symbol of shared Anglo-French history, will also see British treasures like the Sutton Hoo artifacts travel to Normandy. The loan is expected to create a blockbuster exhibition, allowing a new generation to see the famous historical artifact.</p>

          <h2>IRS Clarifies That Churches Can Endorse Political Candidates Without Losing Tax-Exempt Status</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy shift, the IRS has stated in a federal court filing that churches and other houses of worship can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This move effectively reinterprets the Johnson Amendment, a 70-year-old provision in the U.S. tax code that has historically barred such endorsements. The clarification came as part of a settlement in a lawsuit brought by religious groups who argued the amendment violated their First Amendment rights. The change aligns with a long-standing goal of President Trump to repeal the amendment, potentially altering the role of religion in politics.</p>

          <h2>Consumer Inflation Expectations Decrease Despite Tariff Concerns, NY Fed Survey Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 11:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer expectations for inflation have fallen back to levels seen before the Trump administration's tariff announcements. In June, respondents anticipated an inflation rate of 3% for the upcoming year, down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April, suggesting that fears of a tariff-driven price spike have subsided. While the overall outlook has eased, consumers still expect significant price increases in specific areas like medical care, college education, and rent. The survey also showed improved optimism regarding employment. (not investment advice)</p>

It will examine his history, including previous attacks, possession of weapons, and online research into extremist violence. The inquiry aims to deliver achievable recommendations to protect the public from similar horrors, balancing civil liberties with the need for intervention in high-risk cases.</p>

The increase, which included 42 of its bestselling 737 Max jets, is the company's best performance since a door plug blowout on a flight in January 2024 triggered a new crisis and slowed operations. For the second quarter, Boeing handed over 150 airplanes, its strongest Q2 result since 2018.

          <p>This article analyzes the successful Democratic primary campaign of Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, highlighting his strategic coalition-building as a lesson for the American left. Mamdani, a vocal advocate for Palestinian rights, secured a decisive victory partly through a cross-endorsement with Brad Lander, a self-identified progressive Zionist. This alliance demonstrates a political model that prioritizes shared local goals, such as housing and transportation, over rigid ideological purity on divisive foreign policy issues. The author suggests this approach of building broad coalitions, rather than enforcing purity tests, is crucial for the future success of progressive politics.</p>

While details of a potential "one in, one out" migrant returns deal remain unconfirmed, the UK Prime Minister's office stated that months of negotiations are now "bearing fruit."

          <p>A new tax-and-spending package signed by President Trump includes a significant change for higher education by increasing the tax on the endowment income of the nation's wealthiest colleges. The previous flat 1.4% tax has been replaced with a multi-tiered rate of up to 8%, targeting large research universities. Higher education experts warn this could lead to revenue shortfalls at affected institutions, potentially causing them to raise tuition or reduce financial aid. Yale University, for example, estimates it will pay an additional $280 million in the first year, prompting a hiring freeze and other cost-cutting measures. (not investment advice)</p>
