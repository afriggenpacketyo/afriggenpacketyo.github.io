            <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia student and Palestinian activist, expressed concerns to CBS News that his citizenship interview might be a "honey trap" just a day before his detention by immigration agents. Mahdawi, a green card holder from the West Bank, was taken into custody at his interview in Vermont, prompting his attorneys to petition for his release, alleging punishment for protected speech. He co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union and participated in protests against Israel's war in Gaza. A judge has temporarily blocked his deportation while the case is reviewed, raising questions about free speech and due process.</p>

            <p>Nvidia expects to incur a $5.5 billion hit due to tightened U.S. export regulations on chip sales to China. The new rules require licenses for exporting Nvidia's H20 AI chip, a popular product in China, citing concerns about its potential use in Chinese supercomputers. This development occurs amidst escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Experts suggest the estimated impact is significant but manageable for Nvidia. Some anticipate potential exemptions or policy changes, given the broader impact on the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has given the Trump administration two weeks to submit evidence of efforts to return Kilmar Ábrego García, wrongly deported to El Salvador, accusing officials of inaction. Judge Paula Xinis warned against "gamesmanship" and said she would determine if the government had acted in good faith or was in contempt of court. The Supreme Court has ordered the administration to "facilitate" the 29-year-old's release, though El Salvador's President Bukele said he did not "have the power" to return him.</p>

            <p>A study indicates a decline in the popularity of disposable e-cigarettes in the UK before the government's ban on their sale, set to take effect on June 1. Researchers believe users are switching to refillable vapes in anticipation of the ban, aimed at reducing litter and youth vaping. The percentage of young adults using disposable vapes has nearly halved in the last year. Overall vaping use has stalled among adults, following a period of significant growth, prompting health experts to evaluate the overall impact of vaping.</p>

            <p>President Trump's strategy to revitalize the US chip industry through tariffs faces significant challenges, including a lack of skilled workers and a complex manufacturing ecosystem dominated by Asia. Experts argue that replicating Asia's chip manufacturing prowess will be difficult, despite government subsidies and investments. The industry's reliance on global collaboration and skilled labor, potentially hindered by immigration policies, poses further obstacles. The tariff policy is expected to prompt a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in key economies.</p>

            <p>The Elsinore fault zone, one of the largest in Southern California, poses a significant earthquake risk despite its historical quietness. Capable of generating a magnitude 7.8 earthquake, it runs through several communities, including Temecula and Corona. A rupture racing up the Elsinore fault onto the Whittier fault would pour energy into the L.A. Basin. The Elsinore fault zone is a reminder that California is at major risk of significant earthquakes because it sits on the edge of a tectonic plate boundary.</p>
