            <h2>China Directs Museums to Promote Ethnic Unity and National Identity</h2>

            <p>Chinese museums are now tasked with promoting ethnic unity and countering 'wrong historical views,' according to a directive from a top ethnic policy official. Museums are instructed to avoid portraying the Han ethnicity in confrontational contexts with ethnic minorities and to emphasize a unified 'China story' using archaeological findings. This initiative aims to cultivate a sense of community and present China as 'diverse but unified,' respecting and accommodating differences. Some museums have already begun implementing these directives, creating courses that view Chinese civilization from specific regional perspectives.</p>

            <p>US airstrikes on a Houthi-controlled oil terminal in Yemen resulted in at least 74 deaths and numerous injuries, according to Houthi officials, who are calling it a 'war crime' due to it being a civilian facility. The US military claims the strikes targeted the Ras Isa facility to disrupt Houthi fuel supplies and revenue streams, responding to attacks on Red Sea shipping and Israel. Thousands of Houthi supporters rallied in Sanaa to condemn the strikes, while the US military defends the action as a means to weaken the Houthis' economic power. Iran has strongly condemned the strikes as 'barbaric'.</p>

            <p>President Trump posted a photograph that appears to be digitally altered, showing the hand of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to El Salvador. Trump claimed the image, which features 'MS-13' tattoos, proves Abrego Garcia's gang affiliation, despite a lack of evidence and court orders demanding his return to the US. Social media users have expressed doubt over the authenticity of the image, while Senator Chris Van Hollen, who visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, accused the Salvadoran government of staging a meeting to misrepresent Abrego Garcia's situation.</p>

Tommy Edman's early home run provided the Dodgers with the only run they needed in this matchup between the last two World Series champions.

            <p>The ACLU is petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to block the deportation of Venezuelan detainees, arguing the Trump administration is rapidly deporting them under a wartime law without due process. Detainees across the country have been transferred to a facility in Texas and told they will be removed, prompting the ACLU to seek an emergency order. This follows previous deportations of Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, raising concerns about the administration's deportation practices and its adherence to legal procedures. The Supreme Court had previously ruled that while the wartime authority could be invoked, immigrants must be given a chance to challenge their cases.</p>

            <p>A Somali film highlighting the futility of clan vendettas has gained tragic significance after one of its actors was killed in a clan-related revenge killing. Guudey Mohamed Geedi, who played a character trying to prevent a clan killing in the film 'Clan Vengeance,' was shot dead in a village outside Warsheikh. The film, which has gone viral, serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing cycle of violence in Somali society. The director hopes the film will raise awareness and encourage people to understand that revenge does not bring resolution.</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has granted clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation. Bin, a former gang member, was sentenced in 2008 for shooting at a rival's home, injuring a bystander. He became a minister in prison and demonstrated good behavior, leading to a reduced sentence. Newsom's pardon follows efforts to help immigrants targeted for deportation, restoring some of Bin's rights and potentially allowing him to remain in California. The governor also issued a posthumous pardon to Sgt. Richard Allen Penry, a Vietnam War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient.</p>

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by defying his order to halt deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members. The court put a temporary hold on Boasberg's determination finding probable cause the administration committed contempt of his March 15 oral and written rulings to turn the planes around. The order does not rule in either way on the merits of Boasberg’s inquiry.</p>

            <p>The US bond market is being closely watched due to recent volatility sparked by trade tariffs. An unusual rise in US government bond rates suggests investors are losing confidence in the economy. This impacts public spending, household finances (mortgages, credit cards), and business lending rates. Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs (except for China) followed the bond market's reaction, highlighting its influence. The situation is compared to Liz Truss's mini-Budget in the UK, with potential risks to the US dollar and economy.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has begun releasing approximately 10,000 pages of previously classified records related to the 1968 assassination of Democratic Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The release, ordered by President Trump, includes scans of handwritten notes by convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan, witness interviews, crime scene photos, and FBI memos. The disclosure could reignite speculation about the assassination, as RFK Jr. has expressed doubts about Sirhan's sole responsibility. An additional 50,000 pages of files have been discovered and are being prepared for release.</p>

            <p>The UK Supreme Court has ruled that legally, the term "woman" means a biological woman, providing clarity that had been missing from equality law conversations. The ruling argues that for the Equality Act to be consistent, the term woman has to mean a biological woman, and does not include biological males, even if they have certificates to say they have changed gender. This decision has sparked contrasting reactions, with some celebrating it as a victory for common sense, while others view it as devastating for trans rights. The ruling intends to provide a clear framework for equality laws, but leaves many practical questions unanswered.</p>

They fear that AI images threaten intellectual property rights and reduce the demand for their work. While some acknowledge the potential usefulness of AI, they emphasize the importance of originality and human touch in art.</p>
