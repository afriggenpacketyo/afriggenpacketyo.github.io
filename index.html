        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A popular Mexican band, Los Tucanes de Tijuana, received a fine of over $36,000 for performing "narcocorridos" that glorified drug cartels during a concert in Chihuahua. City officials stated that nearly a third of their songs alluded to or glorified illegal acts, and the band had previously faced bans in Tijuana for similar actions. Several Mexican states have restrictions on this controversial music subgenre, though President Claudia Sheinbaum opposes a ban, instead advocating for music competitions promoting peace. The United States recently revoked visas for a band displaying images of a wanted drug lord, highlighting the consequences for artists who extol criminals, and musicians in Mexico sometimes face cartel violence themselves. The optimism score reflects the negative impact of cartel glorification on society.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is refocusing on Tesla after a tumultuous period by President Trump’s side, with the company facing several challenges. These include rebuilding Tesla's reputation, delivering on autonomous driving technology, keeping up with competition, and completing a charging network. Musk's association with the Trump administration damaged the brand, and the company faces increasing competition from traditional carmakers and EV startups. Tesla's profit plummeted 71% in the first quarter, and the company may be hurt by the loss of a federal electric vehicle credit.

          <p>Caroline Fraser's book "Murderland" explores the serial killer epidemic in the U.S. during the 1970s and '80s, focusing on Seattle and Tacoma, where Ted Bundy grew up. Fraser links the killers to ASARCO, a mining corporation that released high levels of lead and arsenic into the air. She argues that the science is speculative until the book's conclusion, where she highlights recent data mapping explicit links between the smelter and the men brought up in its shadows.

          <p>The Glendale City Jail is housing immigrants detained by federal agents, operating under a longstanding contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This arrangement has raised concerns as it appears to sidestep California's sanctuary laws, which prohibit local law enforcement from assisting in federal immigration enforcement.
