          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended her pointed remarks directed at Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent majority opinion concerning universal injunctions. Speaking at a public event in New York, Barrett stated she felt Jackson's dissent was argued in strong terms that "warranted a response," comparing her own sharp writing to adding a little Tabasco. While emphasizing her deep personal respect for Justice Jackson and attributing her approach to attacking ideas, not people, Barrett maintained that she "set the calibration right" in the exchange over the scope of judicial power.</p>

          <p>The Department of Defense is considering a Justice Department request to authorize up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges. This initiative aims to address the massive backlog of over 3.4 million cases currently overwhelming the nation's immigration courts. The plan has drawn criticism from groups like the American Immigration Lawyers Association, who argue that military lawyers lack the specialized, complex knowledge of immigration law required for such roles, potentially undermining due process for immigrants.</p>

          <p>A recent labor market study analyzing over a billion job postings indicates a surge in demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills, with employers offering significant salary premiums. Jobs requiring at least one AI skill advertised salaries that were 28% higher on average, a figure that rose to 43% for roles requiring two or more. The demand is not limited to the tech sector; fields like marketing, public relations, and finance are increasingly seeking AI-proficient employees, suggesting that AI literacy is becoming a valuable differentiator across all industries.

Prosecutors successfully argued that Adelson orchestrated the murder-for-hire plot due to a bitter custody dispute involving her daughter and grandchildren. The verdict concludes a decade-long saga that has seen multiple individuals, including Adelson's son, convicted for their roles in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formalized a trade deal with Japan by signing an executive order that establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most Japanese imports, including automobiles. As part of the agreement, Japan has committed to investing $550 billion in U.S. projects and increasing its purchases of American agricultural and aerospace products. The finalization of the deal comes as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces significant internal pressure and discontent within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party, with analysts speculating he may not survive an upcoming leadership challenge.

          <p>An Indiana bankruptcy lawyer named Mark S. Zuckerberg is suing Meta, the parent company of Facebook, for repeatedly disabling his account under the false pretense that he is impersonating the company's famous founder. The attorney claims his account has been suspended five times, costing him thousands of dollars in advertising revenue and disrupting his 38-year-old law practice. After the lawsuit was filed, Meta acknowledged the error, reinstated the lawyer's account, and stated it is working to prevent the mistake from happening again.</p>

Winners in states with no income tax on lottery prizes, such as Florida and Texas, would receive the largest after-tax amounts. Conversely, states with high income tax rates, like New York, would see the lowest payouts after both federal and state taxes are withheld. The article also notes that the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece contends that the change is a superficial attempt by the administration to project toughness, ignoring the strategic wisdom of post-WWII leaders like Truman and Eisenhower.</p>

          <p>An attorney for Ed Hodgkiss, the recently fired football coach at Bishop Montgomery High School, has released a statement suggesting school officials were involved in an effort to build a top-tier team through improper means. The statement claims officials were trying to compete with powerhouse programs by recruiting transfer students, five of whom were later declared ineligible, leading the school to forfeit its season. The attorney alleges that the transfers were legitimate and that the school was deploying a strategy to attract top talent.</p>

          <p>Authorities in China's Hunan province are considering a novel application for the country's central bank digital currency, the e-CNY, to resolve persistent payment defaults and chain debts. The proposed model would leverage the digital yuan's traceability to ensure funds directly reach the end of a payment chain, making transactions more transparent. This initiative represents a potential expansion of the digital currency's use beyond its current retail and payment scenarios, aiming to tackle complex financial issues within the economy.

The inquiry follows President Trump's attempt to fire Cook based on unconfirmed claims she lied on mortgage documents, an action Cook is challenging in court as unconstitutional and a threat to the Fed's independence. This investigation is the third such inquiry the DOJ has initiated against Democratic-appointed officials, a pattern critics have described as politically motivated "lawfare."</p>

Mamdani dismissed Cuomo as "Donald Trump's puppet" and said he would rather debate Trump directly on issues like cuts to SNAP benefits.</p>

The art form is particularly popular among millennials, with over 40% having a tattoo, and is now being featured in art exhibits, reflecting its growing acceptance as a legitimate form of self-expression.</p>

          <p>This analysis by Professor Sir John Curtice examines the rapid rise of Reform UK, which has been leading in polls for five months by successfully capturing the pro-Brexit, socially conservative vote. The article argues that the party's support is not just a protest vote but a fundamental realignment, with nearly half of the Conservative's 2019 voters now backing Nigel Farage. While the current fragmented political landscape benefits Reform, its long-term success will depend on the performance of the Labour government and whether the party can broaden its appeal beyond its core base.</p>
