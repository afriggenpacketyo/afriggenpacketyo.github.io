          <p>Tech billionaire Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, Founders Fund, has disclosed a 9% stake in Bitmine Immersion Technologies, a company focusing on an ether treasury strategy. The news prompted a significant surge in Bitmine's stock price, with shares climbing over 12%, and also lifted the stock of other companies with similar crypto-focused plans. This investment comes as interest in Ethereum and related assets grows, partly due to new European stock trading initiatives by Robinhood and advancing US stablecoin legislation. The move highlights increasing institutional confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jemima Goldsmith, the ex-wife of imprisoned former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, has accused the government of threatening to arrest their two sons if they visit Pakistan. This follows a government advisor's warning against the sons participating in upcoming nationwide protests demanding their father's release, organized by Khan's PTI party. While the government states the sons are welcome as lawful visitors, they would face legal consequences for breaking laws, including political activity violating visa conditions. Analysts are divided on the potential impact of their participation, with some believing it could galvanize support while others fear it could further divide the party.</p>

          <h2>UK Health Review Recommends Renaming 'Physician Associates' to 'Assistants' to Avoid Patient Confusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 10:02:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) be renamed 'assistants' to clarify their roles for patients. The review, prompted by safety concerns and high-profile patient deaths, also suggests they wear distinct uniforms and see patients only under limited circumstances, such as for minor ailments after triage. While the government accepted all recommendations, the doctors' union BMA believes the changes don't go far enough in defining scope of practice. Conversely, the union for PAs and AAs warned that the new restrictions could potentially lengthen patient waiting lists.</p>

          <p>A new form of identity theft is emerging where scammers exploit old, forgotten landline numbers still linked to financial accounts. The article details a case where a thief used number porting to transfer a victim's landline to a mobile device, which they then used to intercept two-factor authentication codes. This allowed the scammer to reset passwords, lock the victim out of their bank and investment accounts, and drain their funds before the fraud was detected. To prevent this, experts recommend auditing account recovery options, using authenticator apps instead of SMS codes, and requesting port-out protection from phone carriers.</p>

This initiative provides a crucial safety net for daily wage earners who must choose between their health and their livelihood amid record-breaking temperatures.

Each reactor can power over 750,000 homes, and the total project is projected to generate $75 billion in economic value nationwide. This announcement aligns with President Trump's executive orders aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050.

          <p>A new survey reveals that a majority of U.S. homeowners are unwilling to sell their homes in 2025, regardless of where mortgage rates move, entrenching the so-called "lock-in effect." This reluctance stems from homeowners not wanting to give up the historically low mortgage rates they secured before 2022 for the significantly higher rates of today. The phenomenon is keeping housing inventory historically low and contributing to record-high home prices, which makes it difficult for all buyers, especially first-timers. According to the Bankrate survey, 54% of homeowners would not feel comfortable selling at any mortgage rate this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a rare collaboration between rivals, Amazon utilized a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to successfully launch a batch of 24 Project Kuiper internet satellites into orbit. The mission is a significant step for Amazon as it races to build its low-earth orbit satellite constellation to compete with SpaceX's dominant Starlink service. Amazon is under a Federal Communications Commission deadline to deploy roughly 1,600 satellites by mid-2026, necessitating a rapid launch schedule with multiple providers. The partnership highlights the immense logistical challenges and high stakes in the burgeoning satellite internet market, a key battleground between billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.</p>

The iconic Ailsa Course last hosted the major in 2009, before the Trump acquisition. While The R&A has not removed Turnberry from its pool of venues, the logistical challenges and the massive scale of the modern championship present considerable hurdles before a return can be seriously considered.</p>

While these rates make affordability a significant hurdle, experts suggest that borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure better-than-average rates.

Sports scientists explain that actively raising an athlete's core body temperature, either through intense exercise in warm clothing or passive methods like saunas, can be more effective than traditional altitude training. This stress stimulates beneficial physiological adaptations, such as increased blood volume and improved oxygen delivery to muscles. The practice, once considered eccentric, is now a mainstream strategy for gaining a competitive edge in endurance sports.</p>
