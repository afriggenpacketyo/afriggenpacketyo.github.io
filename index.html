          <p>Recent Russian aerial attacks across Ukraine have resulted in at least 13 deaths and 56 injuries, marking one of the largest combined assaults on Kyiv since the start of the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attacks, stating the world is more certain that Moscow is prolonging the war and calling for additional sanctions targeting key sectors of the Russian economy to push Moscow to agree to a ceasefire. Amidst the conflict, prisoner swaps between Russia and Ukraine continue, with hundreds of soldiers and civilians being exchanged in recent deals facilitated by talks in Turkey. A Kyiv resident expressed her wish for a ceasefire, lamenting the bombing of innocent people, including children, highlighting the severe impact of the conflict on civilian populations.</p>

          <p>A power cut in southern France, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. Approximately 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas experienced a loss of power, with officials reporting an electricity substation was set on fire and a pylon at another location was damaged. Despite the disruption, organizers of the international film festival assured that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, utilizing an alternative power supply.

The USS F-1 collided with its sister ship, USS F-3, sinking in just 10 seconds and resulting in the loss of 19 crew members.

Fetterman stated that he felt unfairly shamed into fulfilling senatorial duties like attending committee work and casting procedural votes, which he dismisses as a “performative” waste of time. He claims that media scrutiny has portrayed him as mentally unfit, which he believes is a product of his decision to spend more time at home. Despite his frustration, Fetterman is now attending hearings and votes to demonstrate his capability to perform his job, though he admits to having little interest in the day-to-day work of serving in the Senate.</p>

          <p>California has initiated a project to create new wetlands on the shore of the shrinking Salton Sea, aiming to provide habitat for fish and birds and control lung-damaging dust. The state began filling a complex of shallow ponds with water, marking its largest effort to address the environmental problems plaguing the Salton Sea. The habitat area in Imperial County is being filled with water after an adjacent area called East Pond received its first water in April, leading to the first 2,000 acres of the Species Conservation Habitat Project. The project intends to create lower-salinity habitats where fish and birds can thrive, helping birds migrating along the Pacific Flyway.</p>

          <p>Myanmar is embroiled in a scramble for rare earth minerals, with their exploitation causing environmental harm and deaths in the country's Kachin State. Activists report that in-situ leaching techniques, used for mining rare earths, pose significant risks to the environment and local villagers. Toxic leakage from the mining ponds is devastating nearby environments, and workers lack adequate protection from the chemicals. Global Witness reported that Chinese producers of permanent magnets are sourcing rare earths from Myanmar, with these magnets being used by global auto giants and wind power firms. The KIO wrested control of most of the mineral-rich region, leading to new negotiations between KIO and Chinese producers on taxing rare earth extraction.</p>

          <p>United Airlines will require all domestic passengers without checked luggage to check in at least 45 minutes ahead of departure, starting on June 3, an increase from the previous 30-minute requirement. The airline states that the change will increase efficiency and streamline their process, allowing agents more time to assist passengers with luggage, seating, and arrangements. The check-in time limits for domestic travelers with and without checked in bags is 45 minutes, while the check-in time for international travelers remains unchanged at 60 minutes. The airline will enforce this rule without exceptions, making last-minute check-ins no longer acceptable.</p>

          <p>Five years after the murder of George Floyd, the Black Lives Matter movement continues to advocate for justice and equality, though initial hopes for change have largely gone unfulfilled, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has ordered the cessation of DEI programs in federal agencies and threatened to withdraw funding from public schools teaching about racism. Despite these setbacks, the conversation around racism has evolved, and some states have banned the knee-to-neck maneuver used on George Floyd. According to the non-profit Mapping Police Violence project, the police killed at least 1,260 people in the US in 2024.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council is set to vote on whether to renew an arms embargo on South Sudan, with Amnesty International warning that the conflict could worsen without it. The UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo on South Sudan in 2018, and its sanctions regime on the country dates back to 2015. Amnesty describes as an open violation of the embargo the deployment of armed Ugandan soldiers and military equipment to South Sudan since March 11, 2025. Amid the reported violations, there's growing concern over whether the UN can effectively intervene and what a renewal of the arms embargo could even mean.</p>
