          <p>A coalition of advocacy groups, including the ACLU and Indivisible, has organized a second wave of "No Kings" protests across the United States to challenge what they describe as abuses of power by the Trump administration. Organizers anticipate millions will participate in over 2,600 planned events, focusing on issues like immigration policies and the deployment of troops in American cities. In response, Republican leaders have labeled the demonstrations as "Hate America" rallies, while organizers maintain they are exercising their constitutional right to peaceful protest against authoritarianism. Several states have placed law enforcement and the National Guard on standby.</p>

          <p>Musician D'Angelo, born Michael Eugene Archer, has passed away at the age of 51 after a battle with pancreatic cancer, leaving behind a profound legacy in Black music. The Richmond, Virginia native was a pivotal figure in the neo-soul movement, known for his albums "Brown Sugar" and the critically acclaimed "Voodoo." This article reflects on his career, noting his complex relationship with fame, particularly after the iconic video for "Untitled (How Does It Feel)," and his deep roots in the Pentecostal church, which influenced his unique fusion of the sacred and secular. His final album, "Black Messiah," released in 2014, cemented his status as a socially conscious artist.</p>

          <p>As the average cost of a Halloween costume rises to over $37, Christophe Waggoner of Austin, Texas, is helping families in need by creating and donating costumes for free. For the past nine years, Waggoner has been thrifting for clothes and materials, which he then redesigns into unique costumes at his home. He hosts events where children can pick out a costume, and he notes that this year has been his busiest due to increased financial pressures on families. Waggoner, who spends over $5,000 annually on this project, believes every child deserves the chance to celebrate Halloween, regardless of their family's financial situation.</p>

Roberts emphasized the need for accountability for anyone implicated in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking scandal. Prince Andrew's decision to step back further from public life comes ahead of the posthumous release of Giuffre's memoir, which details her allegations against him.</p>

          <p>Nathan Thomas, a sophomore at Jefferson County High School, is advocating for greater youth involvement in local governance by proposing the creation of a Youth City Council in Wrens, Georgia. He presented his idea to the Wrens City Council, outlining a structure that would mirror the adult council and provide a platform for young people to organize events and have a voice in community affairs. Thomas believes this initiative is needed due to the city's large youth population and sees it as a model for a similar county-level organization. His goal is to foster future leaders and give young residents a meaningful role in their local government.</p>

          <p>A new study from Macromedia University in Hamburg reveals a significant bias in German media, where foreign crime suspects are mentioned approximately three times more often than their actual representation in police statistics. The research, conducted for the Mediendienst Integration, indicates this disparity has sharply increased since 2015 and contributes to a distorted public perception of crime and migration. Professor Thomas Hestermann, who led the study, noted that this pattern of reporting, while often unintentional, aligns with a right-wing populist agenda. Criminologists cited in the article emphasize that crime is linked to socioeconomic factors like poverty, not a person's origin.</p>

Postecoglou failed to secure a single win in his eight games across all competitions, leaving Forest in the relegation zone.

The commutation came less than three months into Santos's prison term, following a public push from Republican allies like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Santos had written an open letter to Trump pleading for fairness and describing harsh prison conditions.

While Yemen's Houthi rebels have frequently attacked shipping in the region, they have not claimed this attack, and an EU naval force suggested the fire may have been accidental.

          <p>Contrary to common stereotypes, a recent study from DatingNews.com and the Kinsey Institute indicates that men are more inclined than women to accelerate relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found that a primary motivator for men is financial savings. Experts suggest this trend is also linked to men's reliance on romantic partnerships as their main source of social and emotional support, as traditional masculinity often discourages close, intimate friendships with other men. This can lead to lower psychological well-being for single men compared to single women, who tend to maintain stronger support networks.</p>

          <p>In a new paper, NASA astrophysicist Robin Corbet offers a straightforward explanation for the Fermi Paradox, the mystery of why humanity has not detected signs of alien intelligence. His "radical mundanity" hypothesis suggests that while other civilizations may exist, they are likely only slightly more advanced than our own and face similar technological and financial limitations in exploring the cosmos. According to this theory, aliens lack capabilities like faster-than-light travel and eventually abandon costly interstellar exploration or signaling efforts after finding no one else. This sober perspective contrasts with more speculative theories like the zoo hypothesis or the idea that advanced civilizations become imperceptible to us.</p>

          <p>Zions Bancorporation's market value dropped by $1 billion after the company revealed it had made $60 million in loans that are now unlikely to be repaid, sparking a selloff in regional bank stocks. The bank's subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, has filed a lawsuit alleging that the borrowers, managers of funds named "Cantor Group," engaged in a scheme to eliminate the collateral securing the loans. According to the lawsuit, the borrowers secretly subordinated the bank's first-priority interest and transferred the underlying properties, making the collateral irretrievably lost. The disclosure has raised broader concerns about credit quality within the regional banking sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he will no longer use any of his royal titles, including Duke of York, in a move agreed upon with King Charles III. The decision follows mounting pressure related to his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and allegations of sexual assault made by Virginia Roberts Giuffre. In a statement, Andrew said the continued accusations were a distraction from the work of the Royal Family, though he continues to deny the allegations. This step further diminishes his public role, five years after he initially stepped back from royal duties following a widely criticized BBC interview about the scandal.</p>

The group allows men to be vulnerable and discuss pressures related to masculinity, systemic racism, and personal struggles without judgment.

          <p>A student trip to China, once a routine part of international studies, has become a politically charged endeavor for students in Texas. Krislyn Massey, a master's degree student at the University of North Texas, had to organize her trip through a non-profit after her university canceled its own programs to China. This caution stems from a Texas state law that restricts public universities from entering into agreements with China and other designated countries, reflecting the heightened geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing. The situation illustrates how political friction is directly impacting academic and cultural exchange opportunities for American students.</p>

She identifies three major mistakes: applying only for highly competitive national scholarships, not applying to enough scholarships, and writing generic essays. Greene recommends focusing on local, state-level, and "intersectionality" scholarships with more specific criteria to narrow the applicant pool. She also stresses that applying for scholarships is a numbers game and suggests students should aim to submit between 100 to 200 applications to maximize their success.</p>

The selection was made through an online vote organized by the publisher PONS Langenscheidt, with nearly two million people participating.
