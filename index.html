          <p>The Trump administration warns that millions of Americans could lose flood insurance coverage if Democrats do not support a House-passed spending bill that extends the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Administration officials highlight the urgency of protecting policyholders during hurricane season, noting a lapse could disrupt thousands of property sales and leave many without coverage. Home builders echo concerns, stating past disruptions negatively impacted property sales and consumer confidence. The article emphasizes the NFIP's history of stopgap extensions and the potential for severe consequences if a deal isn't reached by the September 30th deadline.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 20:50:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has successfully grown its first rice crop in an experimental trial in east England, a development aided by the country's hottest summer on record. Ecologist Nadine Mitschunas, the UK's sole rice-grower, leads this ambitious project by UKCEH to explore future food production methods amidst climate change. While currently risky for commercial planting, researchers believe rice could become a viable crop if average temperatures continue to rise. Beyond food, growing rice on waterlogged peat soils could help lock away greenhouse gases, offering a potential model for sustainable farming and climate change mitigation.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sanctions on Iran, freezing assets, halting arms deals, and penalizing ballistic missile development, effective Sunday. This 'snapback' mechanism, part of the 2015 nuclear deal, further pressures Iran's economy, where the rial is at a record low, driving up food prices and increasing public anxiety. France, Germany, and the UK triggered the sanctions due to Iran's restricted nuclear monitoring and stalled negotiations with the U.S. The article highlights fears of renewed conflict with Israel or the U.S., rising internal repression, and widespread economic hardship impacting daily life for many Iranians.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son, David, are rapidly expanding their influence in the US media industry, with deals involving major companies like TikTok and Paramount. Their growing power is partly attributed to Larry Ellison's close relationship with former President Donald Trump, who has endorsed their ventures. David Ellison's Skydance recently acquired Paramount, gaining control of CBS, and the family is reportedly eyeing Warner Brothers Discovery, which includes CNN. This surge in media ownership has sparked concerns about market concentration and potential political influence, with some lawmakers calling for scrutiny of their acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters marched in Buenos Aires, Argentina, demanding justice for three young women whose torture and murders were reportedly broadcast live on social media. The victims, Morena Verdi, Brenda Del Castillo, and Lara Gutierrez, were found buried in a house yard five days after their disappearance. Investigators link the triple femicide to drug gangs, suggesting it was a 'punishment' and 'warning' message for breaking gang rules. Police have arrested five suspects, though the alleged Peruvian mastermind remains at large. Instagram's parent company, Meta, has disputed that the livestream occurred on its platform.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of federal troops to Portland, Oregon, and other ICE facilities, citing threats from 'antifa' and 'domestic terrorists,' authorizing 'Full Force' if necessary. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland officials swiftly pushed back, stating there is 'no need' for military troops and calling any federal takeover a 'threat to communities.' Portland's Chief of Police reported no uptick in violent unrest, contrary to the president's claims. This move comes amid a broader Trump administration crackdown on alleged 'domestic terrorism' and follows an influx of federal agents in the city.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes affect the user experience of shoe racks. Their research, inspired by cluttered hostel corridors, identified the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius as the culprit behind shoe odor. Experiments demonstrated that a short blast of ultraviolet-C (UVC) light effectively kills these microbes and eliminates the smell. The article highlights their innovative prototype for a UVC light-equipped shoe rack, aiming to improve domestic comfort and hygiene, showcasing the delightful intersection of mundane problems and scientific inquiry.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has reached a confidential settlement with Dominion Voting Systems in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit over his unsubstantiated claims of election rigging in 2020.

This settlement follows similar agreements by Fox News and Newsmax with Dominion over election claims.

Negotiations broke down last December, with federal mediation making little progress, and the union rejecting a proposal for minimum 2% annual raises in April.

          <p>Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve has been suspended for one WNBA playoff game and fined for her aggressive behavior and comments towards officials during and after her team's loss to the Phoenix Mercury. The league cited her pursuit and verbal abuse of an official, delayed court exit after ejection, inappropriate comments to fans, and critical remarks in a post-game press conference. Reeve's anger stemmed from a non-foul call that led to a game-sealing layup and an injury to her player. This marks a rare playoff suspension for a WNBA coach, highlighting ongoing concerns about officiating in the league.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened to a powerful Category 5 storm in the Atlantic, with forecasts indicating it will remain a major hurricane for several days. While not expected to make landfall, there's a possibility it could interact with Tropical Depression Nine, a developing storm nearby, in a rare phenomenon called the Fujiwhara effect. This effect describes two storms merging or spinning around a common center, though a significant interaction is unlikely given Humberto's dominance. South Carolina has declared a state of emergency, urging residents to prepare for potential impacts from the second system, which is forecast to approach the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>UN General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock has warned that the UN is at a 'make-it-or-break-it moment,' highlighting the urgent need for reform. This opinion article argues that China's global initiatives could offer a viable path for the necessary changes. The article critiques the contradictions of some UN member states, noting Germany's role as a major arms supplier to Israel despite calls for peace, and the United States as the primary enabler of Israel's military actions. It suggests that such double standards underscore the systemic issues that China's alternative approaches might address within the international body.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated cartoon image on Truth Social depicting himself firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him 'YOU'RE FIRED!' The article notes Trump's repeated criticisms of Powell for his interest rate policies, despite a recent rate cut. While no U.S. president has ever fired a Fed chair, Trump has attempted to remove other Fed officials, raising concerns about the central bank's independence. Economists and investors fear that such an action could cause longer-term interest rates to rise, potentially undermining the Fed's mandate for stable inflation and low unemployment.</p>

          <p>The UK government will guarantee a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain, which has been severely impacted by a prolonged cyberattack that halted production. Business Secretary Peter Kyle stated the loan aims to protect jobs in the West Midlands, Merseyside, and across the UK, as JLR's 700 suppliers face financial strain. The car manufacturer, owned by India's Tata Motors, has suspended production for weeks, incurring an estimated cost of £50 million per week. This government intervention, through the Export Development Guarantee, seeks to boost JLR's cash reserves and ensure backlog payments to suppliers.</p>
