          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 01:01:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Italy is grappling with a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate hits a record low, with women averaging just 1.18 babies. Small towns like Fregona are experiencing sharp population declines, leading to the closure of local businesses and schools, which threatens their very existence. Despite government initiatives like cash bonuses and tax breaks, many Italians find the support insufficient to offset the high costs and lack of accessible childcare. The article highlights that without significant structural changes to support families and a potential increase in immigration, Italy's population is projected to shrink by five million in the next 25 years.</p>

          <p>Three veteran deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department were killed in a devastating explosion at a training facility in East Los Angeles. The victims, identified as Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn, were all esteemed members of the Arson Explosives Detail with a combined 74 years of service. Sheriff Robert Luna described the men as heroes who exemplified courage and selfless service, marking this as one of the agency's deadliest internal tragedies. An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the blast, with authorities exploring a potential link to explosives seized a day prior.</p>

          <h2>Tyler Glasnow Shows Encouraging Progress in Dodgers' Shutout Loss to Brewers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:39:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers losing 2-0 to the Milwaukee Brewers, pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a promising performance in his second start after returning from injury. He pitched six strong innings, allowing only one run and demonstrating increased fastball velocity, a positive sign for the team's postseason aspirations. Glasnow has historically struggled with injuries and maintaining focus, but his recent outings suggest a simplified, more athletic approach may be yielding results. His dependability is seen as crucial for the Dodgers' rotation, especially as they hope he can form a powerful trio with Yoshinobu Yamamoto and a returning Blake Snell.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China regarding strategies to counter Beijing's economic coercion. During his tenure, relations between Australia and China deteriorated, particularly after his government called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19, which led to Chinese tariffs on Australian goods. Morrison's testimony comes as his successor, Anthony Albanese, pursues warmer ties with China. The hearing will also feature Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, who is known for his critical stance on China's use of economic pressure against other nations.</p>

          <p>A recent study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, can inadvertently accelerate the spread of cancer to other organs. The findings provide a potential explanation for why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis in areas like the lungs even after successful initial treatment. The research team also identified that combining specific drugs with chemotherapy could inhibit this detrimental effect in mice. Based on these promising results, a clinical trial involving human breast cancer patients is now underway to test the new combination therapy approach.</p>

The MoD stated it will "robustly defend" against any legal claims, citing an independent review that found it highly unlikely individuals would be targeted solely for being on the leaked spreadsheet. The breach exposed the details of over 19,000 people, many of whom now fear retribution from the Taliban. Despite the risks and a lawsuit being prepared by a law firm representing over 1,000 Afghans, the government is not planning proactive payouts.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle tag and adhere to a nighttime curfew amid fears he might flee the country while facing trial. Bolsonaro is accused of orchestrating a coup plot to overturn the 2023 election results, a charge he denies. The restrictions, which also include a ban on social media and contact with certain individuals, were imposed after police raided his properties. The case has drawn international attention, with U.S. President Donald Trump calling it a "witch hunt" and threatening tariffs, prompting the U.S. to revoke visas for Brazilian judicial officials involved.</p>

          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom are under an amber weather warning for severe thunderstorms expected to bring torrential rain and dangerous flash floods over the weekend. The Met Office forecasts that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, leading to likely flooding of homes and businesses, significant transport disruption, and power outages. The heavy rainfall follows a recent heatwave, which has left the ground dry and unable to absorb water effectively, exacerbating the flood risk. The warning covers a large area including London and the south coast, with yellow warnings in place for other parts of England and Scotland.</p>

Originally launched in 2018 as a major health tourism initiative with a projected investment of 1.65 billion yuan, the project was plagued by a broken capital chain and poor decision-making. As a result, only a fraction of the funds were spent, leaving most of the planned buildings abandoned and a "severe waste of resources."

          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Engineering University have proposed a new electromagnetic railgun design that could nearly double the firing power of existing models. The innovative concept involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single weapon, which they project could launch a 30kg projectile at Mach 7. This development addresses a key limitation of the current naval railgun, whose power constraints limit shells to 15kg, making them too light for significant wartime impact. The researchers state this advancement is necessary to overcome the technological hurdles that have hampered the military application of railgun technology.</p>

          <p>England experienced a record 2,801 water pollution incidents in 2024, with the number of serious cases rising by 60% from the previous year, according to the Environment Agency. A cross-party parliamentary committee labeled the situation "woeful" and criticized regulators for being "missing in action." The data reveals that water companies significantly missed their target to reduce pollution incidents, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water being the worst offenders for serious events. Critics blame years of underinvestment and weak regulation, while the industry points to suppressed investment caps and is now planning a record £104 billion investment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan legislation allows banks and other financial institutions to issue stablecoins backed one-for-one by U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, aiming to enhance consumer protection and integrate digital currencies into the mainstream financial system. Supporters believe the law will bolster the U.S. dollar's global status and facilitate faster, lower-cost transactions. At the signing, Trump hailed the act as a massive validation for the crypto community and a potential revolution in financial technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A top adviser at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has called for the global financial system to rewrite its rules to adapt to a future dominated by tokenization. Shin Hyun-Song, head of the BIS economic department, warned that the rise of stablecoins presents new challenges for payment infrastructure and regulatory oversight. He noted that the cross-border and pseudonymous nature of stablecoin transactions could complicate efforts to combat money laundering and require banks to adapt their customer verification processes. This call for reform comes as the stablecoin market grows rapidly, attracting both investors and increased scrutiny from global regulators. (not investment advice)</p>

The turnaround was further fueled by Trump's directive to the Department of Justice to seek the release of Epstein-related grand jury testimony.

The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if travelers comply with their visa conditions, such as not overstaying.

          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common condition, after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. According to the White House physician, tests confirmed CVI, which occurs when veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool in the legs. Vascular surgeons explain that CVI affects about one in three U.S. adults and is often caused by weakened vein valves, with risk factors including age and prolonged sitting. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise, with the president's physician describing his condition as benign and manageable.</p>

The ruling addresses concerns from attorneys for Byron Black, 69, that the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator could repeatedly shock him in an attempt to restore his heart rhythm during the lethal injection, causing extreme pain. The order requires a certified professional to be on hand to disable the device moments before the execution proceeds. The state, which had argued the device was unlikely to activate, is expected to appeal the decision ahead of the August 5 execution date.</p>

This move aims to quell a growing controversy among Trump's supporters, who were angered by the administration's earlier decision not to release more files on the deceased financier. The request for transparency comes a day after The Wall Street Journal reported on a sexually suggestive letter allegedly sent from Trump to Epstein in 2003, which Trump denies. A judge must approve the release, which would likely involve a lengthy process of redacting sensitive victim information.</p>
