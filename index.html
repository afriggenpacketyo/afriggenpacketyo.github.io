            <p>Members of the Community United Methodist Church in Pacific Palisades, California, gathered at the site of their church, which burned down in January during wildfires, to commemorate Good Friday and Easter. Pastor John Shaver, who also lost his home in the fire, emphasized the community's resilience and determination to rebuild, focusing on being a "community without walls." The church, a century-old landmark, held a cross walk through the neighborhood, stopping at nine locations to read Bible verses, and plans to incorporate salvaged items into the new structure. Despite the devastation, community members expressed hope for the future and the town's eventual rebuilding, seeing the events mirroring the crucifixion and resurrection narrative.</p>

            <p>An article reflects on the evolution of China's advancements in quantum technology over the past decade, specifically noting how initial skepticism in Western media has transformed into recognition of China's significant progress. The South China Morning Post reported in 2014 on China's development of a "hack-proof" quantum communication network, which was initially met with disbelief. However, by 2017, mainstream Western media began to acknowledge China's quantum technology, marking a shift in perception.
