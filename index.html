          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans, a company source said Saturday. The two plants are Nissan's main Oppama plant, where the company pioneered electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant of its unit Nissan Shatai Co., which builds commercial vehicles. Together, the two plants make up about 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The decision remains uncertain pending talks with labor unions, parts makers, and municipalities. This move is part of a broader effort to cut costs and return to profitability by fiscal 2026.</p>

          <p>Chinese defence scientists are working to transform traditional rocket artillery into a system capable of striking aerial targets. A research team at the National University of Defence Technology has developed the Tianxing-1, a small rocket with lift-enhancing wings and adjustable tail fins. This guided munition can transition into a glide phase after launch, autonomously adjusting its trajectory to engage targets. While slower than hypersonic glide missiles, the Tianxing-1 aims to provide an affordable means of intercepting aerial threats. The system operates on principles similar to hypersonic glide missiles.</p>
