          <p>Palantir increased its revenue projections for the year, indicating a significant rise in both commercial and government revenue, especially in the artificial intelligence sector. CEO Alex Karp noted a 'tectonic shift' in the adoption of AI software, reflecting the company's central role in providing operating systems for modern enterprises. The company's commercial revenues saw a 71% increase, and government sales jumped 45%, driven by U.S. defense sector adoption. Despite the positive report, Palantir's shares experienced an after-hours dip of approximately 8%.</p>

This action is the latest in a series of exchanges between Israel and the Houthis, who claim solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

          <p>The president and two other top officers of the Los Angeles Fire Department’s labor union were suspended from their posts Monday after an investigation by the union’s parent organization found $800,000 in credit card purchases that were not properly accounted for. The investigation began last October when the new treasurer of the union, Jason Powell, raised concerns to the IAFF about alleged improper record-keeping and use of union funds. The Times first reported on the audit, along with the suspension of Walker, who had been accused of improperly depositing more than $75,000 of funds from the union’s charity for injured firefighters into his personal accounts from December 2022 to January 2024.</p>
