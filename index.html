          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki, backed by President Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland is expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence in continued cooperation with Poland. Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party for a fresh start and has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies.</p>

          <p>CNN data reporter Harry Enten reported that the TACO trend, which stands for "Trump Always Chickens Out," is gaining traction. The term is used by investors to describe President Trump's tendency to announce big tariffs, causing market fluctuations, and then backing off. Enten said this trend is "quite troubling" for Trump because it undermines his image of following through on his statements. Searches for Trump and "TACO" have increased significantly.</p>
