          <p>New photographs of China's Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50 sixth-generation fighter jets reveal potential capabilities, including drone control and supersonic cruising. The images show the J-36 on the ground at Chengdu Aircraft Corporation's facility and in high-definition test flights. Defense experts note the J-36's three weapons bays and dorsal intake for a third engine, suggesting supersonic cruising capabilities. This third engine likely provides the additional thrust needed for sustained supersonic flight, enhancing the fighter's operational range and combat effectiveness. Optimism surrounding the advancement of military technology is tempered by the need for global stability.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that the Trump administration's deportation program has positive net approval, particularly among Republicans, but views are heavily influenced by perceptions of who is being targeted. Support is high when people believe the program prioritizes dangerous criminals, but it drops if they think it targets others. Half of Americans feel Trump is deporting more people than expected, and most in this group disapprove of the program. The poll also shows concerns about the program's potential economic impact and the possibility of legal residents being mistakenly deported. Views on tariffs are also net negative, with most Americans believing they will lead to higher prices.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused First Minister John Swinney of running a "dishonest and disgraceful" campaign in the recent Holyrood by-election. Sarwar claims the SNP's tactics pushed voters towards Reform UK, while Swinney justified his "two-horse race" remark by citing Labour's vote share collapse and a surge for Reform. Labour won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse seat unexpectedly. Swinney indicated he would consider a cabinet reshuffle following the defeat. Reform UK finished third, attracting criticism for an advert targeting Sarwar.</p>

          <p>At least four Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire near an aid distribution center in Gaza, according to local health workers. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that troops fired warning shots after issuing a verbal challenge to a group moving towards them, deeming them a threat. The incident occurred near Rafah at a site set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), backed by Israel and the US. The IDF stated that Palestinians should only move to and from GHF sites between 6:00 and 18:00 local time, with other times considered an active combat zone.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has denounced the potential deployment of US Marines in his state as "deranged," following the Secretary of Defense's threat amid immigration protests. The protests erupted after immigration raids led to clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Trump promised to send in the National Guard, a move Newsom criticized as inflammatory. Tensions escalated as border patrol personnel deployed tear gas and protesters threw objects. The Los Angeles mayor stated that the National Guard had not yet been deployed.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses how Trump's policies have reduced the perceived threat of American conspiracies aimed at subverting the Communist Party in China through peaceful means. Mao Zedong warned of "peaceful evolution" through Western values and inciting dissent. China has since become a major economic power, while the US has shifted away from nation-building. This has led to a decline in the perception of the US as a subversive influence within China.</p>

The poem references Blake's notion that persistence in folly leads to wisdom. The speaker concludes by acknowledging life's explosive and generative nature, recognizing the presence of birthing stars within it.</p>

However, Musk's recent criticism of Trump's policies has undermined some of Gingrich's praise. The book also touches on Gingrich's past ethical issues and his disagreements with Trump on Iran and immigration.
