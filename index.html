          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 22:30:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New policy included in President Trump's tax law has initiated significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), marking the largest reduction in its history. This change is projected to impact over 2.4 million Americans, potentially reducing their monthly food assistance by $72 to $231. While independent grocers anticipate hardship, large discount retailers like Walmart may see increased traffic as low-income consumers seek more affordable options. Experts also raise concerns about a potential decline in nutritional value as families trade down to stretch their food dollars.</p>

          <p>The UK Justice Department announced that the Justice Secretary will now have the authority to veto new sentencing guidelines proposed by the independent Sentencing Council. This reform, introduced via the Sentencing Bill, ensures that future guidelines require explicit approval from both the Justice Secretary and the Lady Chief Justice. The move follows a dispute over guidance that would have considered the background of minority offenders, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood emphasizing that policy must be set by parliamentarians accountable to the public.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old survivor of the Annunciation Catholic Church shooting, Weston Halsne, is scheduled for surgery to remove a bullet fragment lodged near his carotid artery. Weston, who bravely recounted the attack and credited his friend Victor for shielding him, is recovering well despite the ordeal. The shooting tragically killed two children and injured 21 others, including 18 children. An online fundraiser for Weston's medical costs has raised nearly $60,000, reflecting widespread community support.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump escalated his criticism of India's trade relationship with the U.S., labeling it a "totally one sided disaster!" on Truth Social. His comments followed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Trump reiterated concerns about India's purchases of Russian oil and arms, and high tariffs on U.S. exports, despite India's reported offer to cut tariffs. This ongoing dispute has strained U.S.-India ties, prompting India to defend its trade policies and highlight hypocrisy from Western nations.</p>

The image, taken in a secret Libyan mortuary in 2011, scored a "high probability" match with Sadr, suggesting he was killed. Sadr, a revered Shia leader, vanished in Libya in 1978 after a meeting with Muammar Gaddafi, with theories suggesting his moderate influence threatened Iranian hardliners or the PLO.

          <p>China is spearheading efforts to establish a development bank for 10 Eurasian countries within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), aiming to mitigate risks associated with U.S. dollar-dominated trade. An official statement confirmed the SCO's decision to create the bank and accelerate consultations on its operation. Analysts believe this concessional lender would be a logical step forward, enhancing infrastructure development and insulating member nations, including Russia and India, from potential U.S. economic pressures. This initiative underscores a broader trend towards de-dollarization and multilateral financial institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced he will award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, two days after Giuliani was seriously injured in a car crash. Trump praised Giuliani as the "greatest Mayor in the history of New York City, and an equally great American Patriot." This decision is controversial, given Giuliani's recent disbarment and criminal charges for amplifying false claims about the 2020 election, which led to a $148 million defamation judgment against him. Giuliani is expected to be discharged from the hospital soon.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a crucial human fossil discovered in Greece, to at least 286,000 years old, placing it firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era. This groundbreaking analysis, using advanced uranium-series dating, resolves decades of debate over its age and suggests the skull belongs to a distinct, more primitive human population, possibly Homo heidelbergensis, coexisting with emerging Neanderthals. The findings challenge previous assumptions and significantly reshape understanding of human prehistory in southeastern Europe, highlighting a complex evolutionary story.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" that the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, will be visible across much of the UK in the coming days, potentially as far south as the Midlands. Heightened solar activity, specifically a fast-moving coronal mass ejection, is responsible for this rare opportunity. While cloud cover and light pollution remain factors, those with clear, dark skies could witness a memorable display. Monday night offers the best chance, with visibility continuing into Tuesday.</p>

          <p>The recent football transfer window has sparked a heated debate about player power versus club ethics, exemplified by cases like Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa, who reportedly refused to train to force moves. While some critics called their behavior "despicable," others argued that clubs have historically "stomped all over players," creating a hypocritical standard. Isak's British record transfer to Liverpool and Wissa's move to Newcastle highlight that such tactics can be effective, contrasting with Marc Guehi's professional conduct that didn't secure his desired transfer.
