        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation gauge for the Federal Reserve, rose to 2.3% annually in May, up from 2.1% in April. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, also increased to 2.7%. This uptick in inflation occurred as consumer spending saw its first monthly decrease since January, falling by 0.1%. Economists suggest the spending pullback may be a temporary correction after consumers bought goods earlier to get ahead of tariffs, which have so far had only a modest impact on overall prices.

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, has upheld a Texas law requiring pornography websites to verify the age of their visitors. The ruling affirms that states have the authority to implement such measures to prevent minors from accessing sexually explicit material. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, stated the law does not unconstitutionally burden adults' First Amendment rights. The dissenting justices argued that the law should be subject to stricter judicial review as it impedes adult access to constitutionally protected speech.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced $30 million in funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private aid organization. The group has faced severe criticism from the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies, which have labeled its distribution hubs "death traps" due to numerous civilian casualties reported nearby. The U.S. State Department defended the funding, attributing the violence to Hamas and urging other nations to support the GHF. The organization's methods and the circumstances surrounding its operations remain highly controversial, with reports of Israeli forces firing on civilians near the aid sites.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the USNS Harvey Milk, a naval ship named for the assassinated gay rights leader, will be renamed the USNS Oscar V. Peterson. The new name honors a Navy chief watertender who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism during World War II. Hegseth stated the change was part of an effort to remove politics from ship naming, a move made just before the final weekend of Pride Month. The original naming in 2021 honored Milk's service in the Navy Reserve before he was forced to resign over his sexuality.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has limited the authority of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block government policies. The ruling stemmed from legal challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, though the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion argued that such broad injunctions often exceed the power granted to courts by Congress. The decision is seen as a victory for the Trump administration, which has frequently been hindered by these sweeping judicial orders, but critics argue it weakens a crucial check on executive power.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking $787 million in damages. The suit alleges that Fox News host Jesse Watters knowingly aired a deceptively edited clip to falsely claim Newsom had lied about a phone call with Donald Trump regarding the deployment of the national guard. Newsom's legal team contends the network manipulated footage to create a false narrative, violating California's Unfair Competition Law. The governor has stated that he will drop the case if the network retracts the claims and issues an on-air apology.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that parents can opt their elementary school children out of instruction that conflicts with their religious beliefs, specifically concerning books with LGBTQ+ themes. The case was brought by a group of Muslim, Catholic, and Orthodox Christian parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, after the school district ended its opt-out policy. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, argued that forcing participation imposes an unconstitutional burden on the parents' right to guide their children's religious development. The dissenting justices warned the decision could create chaos for public schools and impose significant administrative burdens.</p>

The government also reversed a planned freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit for existing recipients.

The plaintiff, John Lousteau, detailed a life of addiction and mental health struggles following the abuse by camp director Stanley Repucci.

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren SÃ¡nchez are celebrating their wedding with a multi-day, multi-million-dollar event in Venice, Italy, attended by a host of celebrities and business leaders. The affair, estimated to cost around $50 million, includes several receptions and parties at exclusive, historic locations throughout the city. The extravagant celebration has drawn criticism and protests from some local residents and environmental groups. They argue the event highlights the negative impacts of over-tourism and the use of the historic city as a playground for the ultra-wealthy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him "terrible" and "a very stupid person" during a recent NATO summit. This has fueled speculation on Wall Street that Trump may attempt to name a "shadow chair" to influence monetary policy before Powell's term officially ends in 2026. The political pressure comes as the Fed navigates key decisions on interest rates, with traders now increasing bets on multiple rate cuts this year. Potential successors reportedly being considered include Scott Bessent and Kevin Hassett, among others. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For a 65-year-old retiree, a $300,000 immediate fixed annuity could generate a guaranteed monthly income of approximately $1,942 for a man or $1,861 for a woman. The exact payout depends on factors like gender, life expectancy, and prevailing interest rates, which are currently favorable for locking in higher income streams. While annuities offer predictable income to safeguard against market volatility, potential buyers should consider the trade-offs. These include a lack of liquidity, the tax implications of the income, and the risk of inflation eroding purchasing power over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beyond headline inflation figures, a deeper look into the U.S. economy reveals that tariffs are directly causing price increases on a range of consumer goods. Logistics companies report being tasked with re-ticketing millions of items in warehouses with price hikes of 8% to 15%. Simultaneously, retailers and manufacturers are shrinking their inventory and reducing the variety of products they import due to trade uncertainty and concerns about consumer softness. This combination of rising prices and reduced availability points to ongoing economic pressure from the trade war with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With auto insurance rates continuing to climb, experts suggest several key moments when consumers should consider switching providers. While prices are rising industry-wide due to factors like repair costs and severe weather, shopping around is advised if your current insurer doesn't offer the specific coverage you need. Other reasons to switch include seeking better customer service, wanting more policy choices than a captive agent can provide, or simply looking for better overall value.
