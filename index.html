          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology student, has pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, thereby avoiding the death penalty as part of a plea agreement. In court, he admitted his guilt on all counts and will receive four consecutive life sentences plus ten years for burglary, waiving his right to appeal. The decision has divided the victims' families, with some expressing fury over the deal while others support it for providing closure and a guaranteed life sentence. This plea marks a significant development in the high-profile case that has garnered national attention for over two years.</p>

          <p>A federal jury delivered a split verdict in the trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs, finding him not guilty of the most serious charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking by force. He was, however, convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution involving two women. The verdict is seen as a major setback for prosecutors, who had accused the music mogul of leading a criminal enterprise that abused women. Combs, who faced a potential life sentence, will now face a much shorter term, with his bail hearing scheduled to determine if he will be released from custody.</p>

This renewed enthusiasm comes as ether-based ETFs see significant inflows and companies like Robinhood expand tokenized trading options.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that homeowner's insurance premiums are projected to increase in all 50 states this year, a trend driven by severe weather events and rising replacement costs. While states like California and Florida face sharp hikes due to wildfires and storms, even states in the Midwest are seeing double-digit increases from events like hail storms and floods. This national phenomenon is causing a ripple effect, as large insurance companies balance their risk by raising rates or reducing coverage across the country. The rising costs are becoming a significant factor in housing affordability and the overall cost of living for many Americans.</p>

These 'bonus meals' are designed to boost morale and help astronauts feel connected to Earth. The project represents a unique fusion of haute cuisine and space exploration, bringing French gastronomy to an extraterrestrial setting.</p>

          <p>India established a solid position at the close of day one in the second Test against England, reaching 310-5, largely thanks to a patient century from captain Shubman Gill. Despite an admirable effort from England's bowlers on a flat pitch at Edgbaston, India managed to build crucial partnerships throughout the day. England's captain Ben Stokes chose to bowl first, and while his team secured key wickets, Gill's unflustered performance, supported by Ravindra Jadeja, ensured the tourists ended the day with a slight advantage. The day's play sets up a competitive continuation of the Test match.</p>

          <p>The High Court in London has ordered a new, 'robust and independent' investigation into how the British security service, MI5, provided false evidence to multiple courts. The ruling came after judges rejected two previous internal inquiries as being procedurally deficient and unreliable. The case originated from a BBC investigation which revealed MI5 had lied about its relationship with a neo-Nazi state agent who had abused women. The judges commended the BBC for its role in exposing the matter, which has become a significant test of the credibility and accountability of the UK's intelligence agencies.</p>

These findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that coffee, particularly when consumed without high-calorie additives, can be part of a healthy lifestyle.

The fire was likely caused by moisture in a transformer, a fault that operator National Grid had been aware of since 2018 but had not fixed. The report also found that while Heathrow knew a single grid connection failure would force a shutdown, it had not invested in a solution. Furthermore, National Grid was unaware of the critical importance of the substation to the airport's operations. Heathrow is now considering legal action against National Grid for what it calls 'clear and repeated failings'.</p>

This article suggests that Trump's hardline tactics, aimed at enforcing party loyalty, may alienate swing voters in key states like North Carolina and Maine.

With the legislation facing potential defeat due to internal GOP divisions, Trump is acting as the 'best closer' for his party's leadership, personally speaking with lawmakers who remain undecided. This hands-on approach, which includes a public pressure campaign on social media, underscores the high stakes for the administration.

          <p>This article details the severe financial repercussions that occur when a credit card issuer closes an account due to prolonged non-payment. Beyond late fees, consumers face significant damage to their credit scores from both the missed payments and the closure itself, which increases their credit utilization ratio. The outstanding debt does not disappear and is often sold to a collection agency, leading to further negative marks on credit reports and aggressive collection efforts. A closed account signals high risk to other lenders, potentially resulting in reduced credit limits on other cards and difficulty obtaining new loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Members of the UK Parliament have voted decisively to classify the direct-action group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization under the Terrorism Act 2000. Once the order takes effect, membership in or expressed support for the group will become a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The move follows a series of actions by the group, including breaking into an RAF base and painting aircraft, which the government has labeled as escalating and aggressive. While some MPs argued the actions should be handled under existing criminal law, the government maintained that proscription was necessary due to the group's methods.</p>

Economic forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office suggest the bill will provide only modest economic growth, which would be dwarfed by the cost of higher interest payments on the increased debt.

He wrote the book to provide a much-needed resource for men, who are often sidelined and lack support during fertility treatments. Parchman advocates for more open communication and vulnerability among men facing infertility, which accounts for at least 30% of all cases.</p>

The incident occurred near the economic capital, Bujumbura, following accusations from the group.

          <p>This analysis argues that the Trump administration's plan to roll back clean energy incentives while promoting fossil fuels could have significant negative economic consequences for the United States. The policy, part of the 'big, beautiful bill,' would hobble the country's fastest-growing energy sectors just as demand from new data centers is surging. By throttling the cheapest and most rapidly deployable energy sources like solar and wind, the U.S. risks higher electricity prices and slower overall energy growth.

          <p>This article outlines seven indicators that suggest credit card debt settlement could be a viable strategy for individuals overwhelmed by their balances. These signs include minimum payments consuming over 20% of take-home pay, making payments without reducing the principal balance, and considering borrowing from retirement accounts. Other red flags are maxed-out credit cards, using cash advances to pay other bills, and accumulating debt due to unforeseen circumstances like job loss. When traditional repayment plans are unrealistic, debt settlement can offer a faster, albeit credit-damaging, path to resolving unmanageable debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An intense heatwave across Europe, with temperatures exceeding 40Â°C (104Â°F), has turned deadly, claiming at least six lives in Spain, Italy, and France. In Spain, two farmers died after being trapped by a wildfire in Catalonia, while heat-related illnesses led to deaths on beaches in Sardinia and in a French hospital. The extreme heat is also fueling dangerous wildfires in Greece, prompting evacuations in multiple regions. The UN's climate agency has stated that such extreme heat events are becoming more frequent and intense due to human-induced climate change, with cities being particularly vulnerable.</p>
