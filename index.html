          <p>The Trump administration is offering migrants in the U.S. illegally free airline tickets and a $1,000 stipend to voluntarily self-deport. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will use the CBP Home app, previously used under the Biden administration for legal entry, to facilitate the process. Eligible immigrants will receive travel assistance and the stipend after their departure is confirmed, and those who sign up will be deprioritized for arrest by ICE, incentivizing them to leave the country. DHS officials argue that this initiative is a more dignified and cost-effective way to manage unauthorized immigration, saving the government money compared to the average $17,121 cost of arresting, detaining, and deporting a migrant.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas, including the capture and holding of Gaza territory, according to an Israeli official. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that the 2.1 million residents of Gaza will be moved for their protection, although he did not specify the extent of territory to be seized. The cabinet also approved a plan, in principle, to deliver aid through private companies, ending a two-month blockade, though the UN and aid agencies have criticized the proposal. The plan is expected to be implemented after President Trump's visit to the region, providing a window for Hamas to agree to a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.</p>

Wall Street analysts have downgraded many automotive stocks, including Ford, due to this instability. Ford CEO Jim Farley declined to detail any financial impact the tariffs are expected to have on the company or whether it planned to pull its 2025 guidance.</p>

          <p>Film tariffs will be included in trade negotiations between the UK and US after President Donald Trump announced a potential 100% tariff on foreign-made films. The UK government stated it would take a "calm and steady approach" to talks to ease pressure on UK businesses. UK filmmakers have warned that freelancers in the industry could face job losses if US productions are pulled, while a union called the tariffs a potential "knock-out blow." Uncertainty remains about whether the tariffs will affect British films exported to the US or co-productions with US firms.</p>

          <p>Footwear giant Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, taking the company private after nearly three decades as a public entity. The price represents a 30% premium to Skechers' current valuation, and shares of Skechers soared more than 25% after the announcement. The transaction occurs during a challenging time for the retail and footwear industries, which are affected by discretionary spending and supply chain issues. Skechers had withdrawn its full-year 2025 guidance due to macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is facing opposition from neighbors in West Lake Hills, Texas, over his mansion, which has violated city ordinances with unpermitted construction. Residents have complained about a 16-foot chain-link fence, an outward-facing camera, and increased traffic due to security personnel. The matter reached a contentious Zoning and Planning Commission meeting, where officials voted against recommending variances for the projects. Unless the City Council disagrees, Musk may have to tear down or modify the fence and gate to comply with local rules.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are divided over whether to repeal Biden-era clean energy tax credits, which are a lifeline for some constituents, particularly in Alaska. In remote villages like Noatak, residents rely on expensive diesel fuel flown in for heating, and solar panel projects have been implemented to reduce costs. However, the future of these projects is uncertain as some Republicans seek to eliminate clean energy tax credits to fund President Trump’s agenda. Senator Lisa Murkowski has been an outspoken proponent of keeping the tax credits, citing the need to support rural communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a potential 100% tariff on movies not shot in the United States has been criticized as xenophobic and ignorant. Trump cited a threat to “national security” from movies not shot in the US, but the details remain unclear. The move has been interpreted as an attempt to address the decline of Los Angeles film productions by making it more expensive to shoot elsewhere. Critics argue that it overlooks the financial and creative complexities of film production and promotes a nationalistic view that devalues international cultural exchange.</p>

However, Amanda Hess's book, *Second Life: Having a Child in the Digital Age*, suggests that online preparation cannot truly ready one for parenthood, as the experience is unique and unpredictable. Hess analyzes the online attention economy, highlighting how parenting experts sell the illusion of control through apps, gadgets, and courses. The book suggests that commodified advice has led parents to believe that more information is better than good information.</p>

A new assessment by the European Central Bank found that European consumers are starting to avoid U.S. products and services, regardless of cost, due to Trump's tariffs and treatment of allies. The study found that even a 5 percent tax on American products would incline Europeans to shun them, and there is a growing preference to move away from U.S. products and brands altogether.</p>
