          <p>Demonstrators have gathered in cities across the United States for "No Kings" protests challenging what organizers describe as President Trump's authoritarianism. The nationwide rallies, with major events in New York and Washington D.C., have prompted Republican governors in states like Texas and Virginia to place National Guard troops on standby. While organizers frame the protests as opposition to corruption and cruelty, some Trump allies have linked the movement to extremist groups without evidence, raising tensions around the widespread demonstrations.</p>

          <p>Following Prince Andrew's decision to relinquish his Duke of York title and other honors, the brother of Virginia Giuffre has publicly called for King Charles to also strip him of the title of 'prince.' Sky Roberts, whose late sister accused the prince of sexual abuse, stated that this step is necessary for accountability. Prince Andrew settled a civil case with Ms. Giuffre in 2022 but has consistently denied the allegations against him regarding his association with Jeffrey Epstein. The move to renounce his titles came amid increasing pressure and ahead of the posthumous publication of Giuffre's memoir.</p>

          <p>An apartment balcony collapse in Cincinnati's Corryville neighborhood has resulted in at least ten injuries, with one person reported to be in critical condition. The incident occurred Friday evening at a complex near the University of Cincinnati, and some of the injured were students celebrating after an exam. The wooden, third-floor balcony gave way for reasons that are still under investigation by fire and police officials. The university has offered to provide housing assistance and grief counseling to any students affected by the collapse.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has dismissed head coach Ange Postecoglou just 39 days into his tenure, making it the shortest permanent managerial reign in Premier League history. The decision was made only 17 minutes after the team's 3-0 loss to Chelsea, which left the club with just one point from five league matches under his leadership. Postecoglou failed to secure a single win in his eight matches across all competitions, leaving Forest just one point above the relegation zone. The club is expected to seek a quick replacement, with former managers like Sean Dyche being considered.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos has been released from a New Jersey prison after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. The commutation followed a public push from Republican allies like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and an open letter from Santos pleading for fairness. Trump acknowledged Santos was a "rogue" but stated the sentence was excessive. The decision has drawn criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, reigniting debates over presidential power on a day when nationwide protests against perceived authoritarianism were planned.</p>

          <p>A Cameroonian-flagged tanker loaded with liquefied petroleum gas is ablaze in the Gulf of Aden after its crew abandoned the vessel, with one mariner reported missing. The cause of the fire on the ship, named the Falcon, is disputed; British officials suggest it was struck by a projectile, while an EU naval force believes it was an accident. The incident occurred in a region where Yemen's Houthi rebels have frequently attacked shipping, though they have not claimed responsibility. Authorities have warned that the fully loaded vessel poses a risk of explosion, and rescue operations are underway.</p>

          <p>A significant security flaw in ChatGPT's Deep Research tool, dubbed 'ShadowLeak,' temporarily allowed hackers to steal Gmail data using invisible prompts embedded in emails. Security researchers at Radware discovered the zero-click vulnerability, which required no user interaction and executed entirely in the cloud, bypassing conventional firewalls and antivirus software. OpenAI patched the issue in August after being notified, but the incident highlights the growing risks associated with AI integrations having broad access to third-party applications like Google Drive and Dropbox.

          <p>An American who retired from a law career at age 41 shares his experience moving to Portugal, the top country Americans wish to relocate to. He found that early retirement, initially a source of uncertainty, became an opportunity for growth and financial improvement, with his net worth continuing to increase due to a lower cost of living and continued investment. By saving an estimated $5,000 per month compared to his life in Washington, D.C., he emphasizes that retirement can be a new beginning for building wealth. He also highlights the importance of finding purpose through new routines, hobbies, and community engagement.</p>

          <p>The German phrase "Das crazy," a blend of German and English, has been voted the Youth Word of the Year for 2025, announced at the Frankfurt Book Fair. The expression, which translates to "That's crazy," is used by young people to convey surprise, speechlessness, or irony in a brief and humorous way. Its selection, determined by a public online vote organized by publisher PONS Langenscheidt, reflects the strong influence of English and internet culture on modern German slang. The term narrowly beat out "goonen," a slang word for excessive self-gratification.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake in Keurig Dr Pepper and has initiated discussions with the beverage company's management. The move comes after KDP's stock fell 25% following the announcement of a controversial merger with coffee company JDE Peet's, a deal that investors criticized for its structure and financial leverage. Starboard, known for its operational expertise, may seek to influence the company's direction and restore investor confidence, potentially by seeking board representation. This situation is reminiscent of Starboard's successful engagement with Ritchie Bros Auctioneer during a similarly unpopular merger.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge argues that delaying children's access to smartphones and social media until at least age 16 can lead to better mental health and success in adulthood. She advises parents to begin conversations about responsible technology use by late elementary school, years before a child receives a device. Key strategies include teaching children about online privacy and the value of their time away from screens. Additionally, Twenge stresses the importance of setting and enforcing firm rules, such as using basic, non-internet-connected phones first and implementing parental controls to moderate usage.</p>

He identified a market gap for stylish, professional coats that could withstand harsh winter weather, a niche traditional Italian wool coats often missed. After testing his first prototype in a supermarket's walk-in freezer, he successfully sold his initial run of 200 coats in three months. Today, his brand is profitable and worn by billionaires and financiers, with products sold in over 100 stores worldwide, including Saks Fifth Avenue.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett outlined his investment philosophy, categorizing assets into three types and explaining his preference for productive assets over non-producing ones like gold. He described gold as an item people buy only with the hope that someone else will pay more for it later, noting that it generates no intrinsic value on its own. In contrast, he favors investments like farms or businesses that produce tangible goods or services, allowing for rational valuation based on their expected output. This approach, he argued, makes the success of an investment dependent on the asset's performance, not on market sentiment or fear. (not investment advice)</p>

Many reject the 'liberal' label, viewing the Democratic party as too centrist and beholden to corporate interests.
