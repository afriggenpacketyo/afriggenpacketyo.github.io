          <h2>Iconic 1975 Photograph of Fatal Fire Escape Collapse Led to Major Safety Reforms in Boston</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 20:20:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A haunting 1975 photograph by Stanley Forman captured a young woman and a two-year-old girl falling from a collapsed fifth-story fire escape in Boston. The image, which won a Pulitzer Prize, depicted the death of 19-year-old Diana Bryant, though her goddaughter Tiare Jones survived by landing on her. The photo's widespread publication served as a major catalyst for public awareness and legislative action. Within months, Boston enacted a new city code mandating that all fire escapes be certified as safe every five years, a regulation that subsequently influenced similar safety reforms across the United States, creating a lasting legacy from the tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has directed national sports governing bodies to comply with a presidential executive order, effectively barring transgender women from competing in women’s sports. This new policy requires federations like USA Swimming and USA Track and Field to update their rules to align with the federal mandate, which threatens to rescind funding from non-compliant organizations. The move has been condemned by civil rights groups, such as the National Women’s Law Center, as discriminatory and harmful to athletes. It reflects a broader, contentious debate over transgender participation in sports that is playing out at state, national, and international levels.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Announces New Trade Agreement with Japan, Including 15% Reciprocal Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 20:14:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which he described as the "largest Deal ever" made with the country. The agreement includes reciprocal 15% tariffs on Japanese exports and a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion into the United States. Key provisions of the deal involve Japan opening its markets to American products, including cars, trucks, and agricultural goods like rice. This development comes as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces political pressure following his coalition's loss of majority in the upper house elections, with a favorable deal seen as a potential way to bolster his position.

          <p>WNBA star Brittney Griner shared harrowing details about her time in a Russian prison, revealing she was placed in a cell with a woman convicted of heinous crimes. Griner explained that inmates were not separated by the nature of their offenses and her cellmate was incarcerated for creating and selling videos of her husband sexually abusing their child. This woman was reportedly tortured by other inmates, who would extinguish cigarettes on her. Griner described the experience as deeply unsettling, causing her to lose sleep and feel immense distress, highlighting the brutal and indiscriminate conditions she endured during her nearly 10-month detention before being released in a prisoner exchange.</p>

          <p>Federal judges in New Jersey have taken the rare step of removing interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a personal attorney to President Trump, from her position. The judges appointed her first assistant, veteran prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, to lead the office, citing the expiration of Habba's 120-day interim term without Senate confirmation. However, the Justice Department swiftly responded by removing Grace, with Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing the judges of being "rogue" and undermining the president's authority. Habba's tenure was controversial, marked by clashes with Democratic senators and politically charged prosecutions that drew criticism for politicizing the office.</p>

          <p>A House Appropriations Committee has advanced a measure proposed by Republicans to rename the opera house at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts after first lady Melania Trump. The proposal, introduced by Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, was included as an amendment in a federal funding bill. This move aligns with President Trump's increasing influence over the D.C. cultural institution, where he serves as board chairman and has appointed numerous allies to its board of trustees. Democrats criticized the renaming as a divisive political maneuver, while supporters argued it was a fitting way to recognize the first lady's appreciation for the arts.</p>

Hershey's leadership stated the price change is a direct reflection of these rising ingredient costs and not related to trade policies.

          <p>Despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' expectations, Texas Instruments saw its stock fall in after-hours trading. The decline was attributed to the company's disappointing forecast for the upcoming third quarter. The chipmaker projected third-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of consensus estimates, raising concerns among investors about future performance. During the second quarter, the company's revenue grew by 16% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in its analog chip business, which is a key supplier for the automotive and industrial sectors. The weak guidance overshadowed the otherwise positive quarterly results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's ambitious Qianfan satellite network, intended to compete with SpaceX's Starlink, may be encountering significant delays due to a severe shortage of available rockets.

However, to meet international regulatory deadlines for spectrum use, the company must launch hundreds of satellites within the next few years. An engineer familiar with the situation stated that China's current rocket manufacturing and launch capacity is struggling to meet the massive demand, potentially jeopardizing the project's aggressive timeline.</p>

          <p>A Boston court dismissed more than 120 criminal cases, including some involving domestic violence and assault on police officers, because defendants could not be provided with legal representation. This is the latest consequence of a months-long pay dispute that has led public defenders in Massachusetts to stop taking new clients. The judge invoked a protocol requiring cases to be dropped if a defendant lacks an attorney for 45 days. Prosecutors expressed alarm over the threat to public safety, while advocates stressed that the dismissals are a necessary consequence of a constitutional crisis stemming from inadequate pay for public defenders.</p>

Recently, however, their dynamic has shifted, with Bezos donating to Trump's inaugural fund and Trump praising Bezos as a "good guy."
