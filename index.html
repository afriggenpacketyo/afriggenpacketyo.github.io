          <p>According to royal experts, Kate Middleton's success as a modern royal is due to her adherence to royal rules and traditions, a stark contrast to Princess Diana's more rebellious approach. Unlike Diana, who married Prince Charles at a young age and faced immense press scrutiny, Kate was older and more prepared when she married Prince William. Royal experts suggest that Kate learned from Diana's experiences, avoiding the pitfalls of rushing into royal life and maintaining a focus on duty. This article highlights the support system Kate has, including her family and Prince William, which Diana lacked, enabling her to navigate royal life with greater ease and stability.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached a temporary agreement to significantly ease tariffs imposed in recent months, signaling a potential de-escalation in their trade war. Both countries will reduce reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, providing a window for further negotiations to address economic and trade concerns. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the temporary reductions would lower U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China would reduce its levies on American imports to 10%. This move has buoyed commodities and currency markets, offering hope for a more balanced trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party (PKK), a Kurdish militia group, has announced its intention to lay down arms and disband, a decision that could significantly alter Turkish politics and regional dynamics. This announcement follows calls from the PKK's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who urged the group to disarm and pursue Kurdish rights through political means. The PKK's statement echoes Ocalan's sentiment, suggesting that the group has fulfilled its mission by elevating the Kurdish issue to a level where it can be resolved through democratic politics. This move could end a conflict that has claimed over 40,000 lives and potentially expand President Erdogan's support among Kurds.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical stocks have fallen following Donald Trump's promise to use executive powers to cut prescription drug prices in the US, aiming to align them more closely with other countries. Trump stated he would sign an order to reduce prices by 30% to 80% and introduce a "most favored nation" policy, ensuring the US pays the lowest price globally. This announcement triggered a sell-off in pharmaceutical stocks amid concerns about potential profit declines. While the American government already negotiates prices for some medicines under Medicare, Trump's proposed order could have broader implications for the industry.</p>

          <p>Sugar, prevalent in many foods, can lead to addiction by lighting up pleasure centers in the brain, altering neuronal pathways, and causing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Neuroscience studies show chronic sugar overconsumption can change dopamine signaling and stress-related pathways. While it may not be a substance addiction like nicotine, sugar overconsumption is linked to health problems such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. Experts recommend reducing added sugars gradually, increasing protein and fiber intake, and governments stepping in to increase the availability of healthy food.</p>

Sweeting, 25, was reported missing after failing to return from a solo hike up Mitre Peak. Despite a large-scale search involving local volunteers, helicopters, and search dogs, police have made the difficult decision to pause efforts. The Milford Sound area, where the search was focused, is described as extremely dangerous and challenging terrain. Police remain in contact with the family and will review their efforts.</p>

          <p>Despite the declining consumption of sake in Japan, Kenbishi, the country's oldest sake brand, remains committed to traditional brewing methods to maintain its quality. Brewing takes place during the winter season, with brewers staying onsite for six months and consuming around 1,500 bottles of sake. Kenbishi uses traditional wooden equipment, such as the "dakidaru," to control the temperature of the yeast starter mix. President Masataka Shirakashi believes that preserving the taste of Kenbishi sake requires protecting traditional brewing methods and equipment.</p>

          <p>China is seeking to deepen its ties with Latin America as President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva of Brazil visits Beijing and other officials from the region are hosted. This move comes as President Trump aims to draw Latin American countries closer to the U.S. orbit, raising concerns about a new Monroe Doctrine. China's assistant foreign minister emphasized that Latin America seeks independence and self-determination, not a new Monroe Doctrine. Lula sees China as a partner in rebalancing global power and a geopolitical counterweight to U.S. hegemony.</p>

          <p>Britain's armed forces are facing significant challenges, including dwindling troop numbers, weak morale, and aging equipment, amidst growing geopolitical uncertainty. A Strategic Defence Review is underway to identify threats and recommend solutions, but doubts remain about its potential impact. Troop numbers are down, with the regular Army struggling to meet its target of 73,000 soldiers. There are also concerns about weaknesses in NATO commitments, including ammunition shortages and limited ground-based air defenses. Low morale and cases of harassment further compound the challenges.</p>

          <p>The US and China have reported progress in trade talks held in Switzerland, with both sides describing the discussions as "productive and constructive." The White House called it a "trade deal" but provided no specific details. The talks were the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory levies and financial market turmoil. Following the talks, officials suggested that a deal could help reduce the US's trade deficit, but substantial tariff reductions are needed to significantly impact international trade flows.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The legislation includes new work and eligibility requirements, which Democrats warn will cause millions of Americans to lose coverage. A preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office suggests that the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade. The legislation faces uncertain politics, with some Republicans opposing cuts to health care safety net programs.</p>

          <p>A major power outage affecting Spain, Portugal, and the south of France has ignited a debate about the role of renewables and energy security. The blackout, one of Europe's worst, plunged much of the region into darkness and disrupted transportation and communication. Some observers have suggested that reliance on wind and solar energy may have contributed to the outage. However, Spanish authorities have stated that record levels of renewable energy were not the cause of the incident, and investigations are underway to determine the root cause.</p>
