          <p>A controversial plan to sell over 600,000 acres of public land in 11 Western states has been withdrawn from a major Republican spending bill. The provision, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced significant backlash from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as conservation and recreation groups. Lee stated the withdrawal was due to an inability to guarantee the land would only be sold to American families and not foreign interests or large corporations. Conservation advocates celebrated the decision but remain vigilant against future attempts to privatize public lands.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection, citing a political environment where independent thinking has become an "endangered species." His decision follows a public clash with former President Donald Trump, who criticized Tillis for opposing a major budget bill due to its "devastating" cuts to Medicaid funding for his state. Trump had threatened to support a primary challenger against Tillis, escalating the intra-party conflict over the legislation. Tillis emphasized his pride in bipartisan work during his career.</p>

          <p>The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released a new analysis of the Republican budget bill, estimating it could cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose their health insurance coverage. The report also projects the legislation would add almost $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, primarily due to significant tax cuts favoring wealthier Americans. These figures are complicating Republican efforts to pass the bill, as they fuel criticism over deep cuts to healthcare programs like Medicaid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British police are reviewing video footage after Bobby Vylan, a rapper from the punk duo Bob Vylan, led the crowd in chants of "death to the IDF" at the Glastonbury Festival. The incident drew condemnation from the Israeli embassy and UK government officials, who called the rhetoric "appalling" and "hateful." The BBC, which broadcast the performance live, said it had issued an on-screen warning about strong language. The investigation will determine if any criminal offenses were committed during the politically charged performance at the major music festival.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) in the context of the recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. It argues that preliminary judgments made just days after the event are often unreliable, as a full assessment requires integrating various intelligence sources over time. The author suggests that while President Trump's claim of "obliteration" is likely an overstatement, the cumulative effect of the strikes was probably severe, given the precision munitions, advanced aircraft, and extensive intelligence used. The analysis cautions against both over-exuberant claims of success and hasty dismissals of the strikes' effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced that he has secured a buyer for TikTok, the popular video-sharing app currently owned by Chinese company ByteDance. In a recent interview, Trump stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform, with more details to be revealed in the coming weeks. The sale is contingent on approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes is likely. This development comes as the administration has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations due to national security concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

Such collapses are common in Sudan's artisanal mining sector, which suffers from poor safety standards.

However, sources cited in the article caution that the reliability of these communications is questionable, as officials may not be truthful in their assessments.
