          <p>Overnight Russian drone and missile attacks have resulted in at least eight deaths and over 30 injuries across several regions of Ukraine, including Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, and Mykolaiv, marking a significant escalation in the conflict. The Kyiv region experienced what officials described as a "massive night attack," leading to casualties and infrastructure damage. Meanwhile, Russia's defense ministry claimed its air defense units intercepted numerous Ukrainian drones over Russian territory, including the Moscow region, without reported casualties. These exchanges highlight the ongoing intensity of the conflict and the continued targeting of civilian areas. Optimism is low given the human cost and the escalating nature of the attacks.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay, Rachel Feintzeig reflects on her obsession with the HBO series "The Last of Us," a show about a zombie apocalypse, and how it serves as a distraction from the anxieties of the real world. She finds that immersing herself in a fictional, terrifying scenario provides a temporary escape from the real-world problems she faces. Feintzeig recalls a therapist recommending horror movies to cope with grief after a miscarriage, finding that focusing on someone else's fictional suffering can be strangely liberating. The author humorously anticipates the end of the season and the need to find a new terrifying alternate reality to escape to.</p>

          <p>A British fishing vessel has been impounded by French authorities for allegedly fishing illegally in French waters, leading to diplomatic tensions. The vessel was seized in the English Channel and is being held in Boulogne. The UK Foreign Office is providing support to the British national involved. The incident follows criticism of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's deal with the EU regarding fishing access. Conservatives have accused France of double standards, citing their failure to prevent illegal migrant crossings while swiftly acting against the fishing vessel.</p>

          <p>Michelle Renee, a California mother, was kidnapped and forced to rob her own bank in 2000, after which she and her daughter were strapped with fake dynamite. Despite her cooperation and the capture of the perpetrators, she was subjected to intense scrutiny and accused of being complicit during the trial. The defense focused on her past as a stripper and financial difficulties to discredit her, even though investigators found no evidence of her involvement. This case highlights the challenges faced by victims of crime when their credibility is questioned, and the long-lasting impact of trauma on their lives.</p>

          <p>Doctors in Japan are denouncing the continued COVID-19 restrictions at hospitals, arguing they violate human rights by limiting patient visitations, even for terminally ill individuals. Despite the government downgrading the threat level of COVID-19, many hospitals still impose strict visitation rules, including mask requirements, temperature checks, and limited visitor numbers. This has led to situations where families are unable to see hospitalized loved ones, with some doctors suggesting the restrictions are more for convenience than effective infection control.

          <p>A new study reveals that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety onto their pets. The research found that dogs of owners with higher job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This connection is driven by "work-related rumination," suggesting that thinking about work off the clock can spread stress from humans to pets. Dogs are sensitive to their owners' moods and changes in routines, highlighting the importance of managing work stress to protect the well-being of pets.</p>

With an already taxed bullpen, the Dodgers were reliant on Gonsolin's performance, but his loss of command forced the team to make difficult choices.

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, becoming the first train company to transfer to public ownership under the Labour government. The government hopes to improve services and use profits to reinvest in infrastructure, though lower fares were not promised. Unions have expressed concerns over outsourcing to private companies, while the Conservatives have called on Labour to deliver on its promises. SWR trains will now be the responsibility of DfT Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR).</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing distress at the World Exposition in Osaka, with visitors cringing at the insects landing on food and raising health concerns. While the midges do not bite, dead ones can cause allergic reactions if inhaled. The insects are believed to be emerging from the Water Plaza, and the expo organizer is taking action by spraying insecticide, treating areas with a growth inhibitor, and installing insect repellent lights. The governor has also sought help from an insecticide maker to address the problem.</p>
