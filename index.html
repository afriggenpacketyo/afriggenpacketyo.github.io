          <p>Two Chinese students have been charged by the U.S. government with smuggling fungus, an event that coincides with increased scrutiny of Chinese academics by the Trump administration. The FBI made the arrest as part of a broader effort to crack down on what the administration perceives as intellectual property theft and espionage. This action underscores the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China regarding academic and research integrity. The charges reflect a heightened awareness and stricter enforcement measures concerning the movement of sensitive biological materials. Optimism surrounding this is low given the political nature of the incident.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the Navy to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a ship named after the gay rights activist, during Pride month. This decision has sparked controversy, with a defense official stating the timing was intentional. Harvey Milk was one of the first openly gay men elected to public office in the U.S., serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors before his assassination. The USNS Harvey Milk is one of several ships named after prominent civil rights leaders. The decision to rename the ship is contentious, given Milk's legacy and contributions to LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has strongly criticized President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," calling it a "disgusting abomination" and labeling it "outrageous" and "pork-filled." Musk expressed his disappointment with the bill's price tag, arguing that it increases the deficit and undermines the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded that Trump is aware of Musk's stance. Several Republican senators echoed Musk's concerns, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune disagreed, asserting Musk is entitled to his opinion. Musk recently departed as a "special government employee," after falling short of his goal to slash $1 trillion from the federal budget.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has lowered its forecast for UK economic growth due to U.S. tariff barriers and high interest payments on government debt. The OECD cut its expectation for UK growth this year to 1.3% from 1.4% predicted in March. The think tank cited the UK's "very thin" buffer in public finances and called on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to boost tax revenue and cut spending. The OECD also highlighted better-than-expected UK economic growth between January and March but cautioned that "momentum is weakening" due to "deteriorating" business sentiment.

          <p>Fresh investigations could be launched into 287 child sexual exploitation cases that had been dropped by local police forces, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. The cases have been handed to a national police taskforce for review. The taskforce will assess whether to reopen the cases and pursue new lines of inquiry. This initiative follows a request for police forces in England and Wales to re-examine historic gang exploitation cases where no further action was taken.</p>

          <h2>Trump Officials Crafting Rule to Prevent Asylum-Seekers From Getting Work Permits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits. This proposal would effectively pause the decades-old policy of allowing asylum applicants to work lawfully while their cases are decided. The changes aim to address concerns about the asylum system being exploited by economic migrants. Advocates worry that this could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and drive them to work illegally.</p>
