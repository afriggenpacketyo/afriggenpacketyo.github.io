          <p>Asia-Pacific markets fell following U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on highly valued equity prices and an uncertain rate-cutting trajectory. This economic shift occurred alongside the historic appointment of Anna Breman as the first female governor of New Zealand's central bank. The article also highlights a surge in South Korean defense stocks, spurred by President Trump's support for Ukraine, contrasting with the flat performance of Hong Kong and mainland China markets. Furthermore, Super Typhoon Ragasa brought severe weather to Hong Kong, while Alibaba committed to boosting its artificial intelligence investments.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding plans to significantly increase its capital expenditures on artificial intelligence infrastructure beyond the initial 380 billion yuan, as confirmed by CEO Eddie Wu Yongming at the Apsara Conference. Wu articulated a vision for Alibaba Cloud to become a leading global full-stack AI service provider, from computing power to advanced models. He believes Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will mark a new beginning, potentially automating 80% of existing jobs and fostering "super scientists" to address global challenges. This strategic boost mirrors similar increased AI spending by major U.S. tech companies like Nvidia.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel Live! returned to ABC after an indefinite suspension following comments Kimmel made criticizing the MAGA movement's reaction to Charlie Kirk's killing. Audience members described his monologue as "emotional" and well-received, noting no apology was issued for the remarks Disney deemed "ill-timed and insensitive." The suspension occurred amidst suggestions from FCC Chair Brendan Carr that ABC could risk losing broadcast licenses. This incident is the latest in President Trump's scrutiny of media companies, recalling a previous $16 million settlement with ABC over a defamation lawsuit concerning E. Jean Carroll's sexual assault claims.</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva secured a congressional seat in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, succeeding her late father and further reducing the Republican's narrow House majority. Her victory in the left-leaning, Hispanic-majority district was anticipated, given the significant Democratic voter advantage. Grijalva campaigned on fighting President Trump’s agenda and pledged to sign a petition for the release of Jeffrey Epstein's files. This win leaves two vacant seats in the House, with special elections pending in Texas and Tennessee, and highlights the shifting political landscape in battleground states.</p>

          <p>A malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter at the United Nations frustrated President Trump, leading the White House to suggest intentional sabotage. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called for an investigation if the escalator was deliberately stopped. However, a U.N. spokesman stated that a videographer from Trump's delegation may have inadvertently triggered the escalator's safety shutoff. The White House also operated the teleprompter when it failed. Trump leveraged these mishaps in his speech to criticize the U.N.'s competence, further highlighting his administration's distancing from the organization and its reduced financial contributions.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic in Texas plans to reopen its Cypress Lake location next summer, less than three months after a devastating flood in the Texas Hill Country killed 27 girls and counselors at its Guadalupe site. The camp's owners announced that future planning and procedures will adhere to new camp safety legislation, bravely championed by victims' families. The Guadalupe site remains too damaged for reopening next summer, but a memorial will be built for those lost.

          <p>A theoretical paper suggests that a record-shattering 220 petaelectronvolt neutrino event, KM3-230213A, could be the first observational evidence of Hawking radiation from an evaporating primordial black hole. Physicists Alexandra Klipfel and David Kaiser propose that such events could explain other high-energy neutrinos and offer a partial solution to the dark matter mystery, assuming primordial black holes constitute most of it. The research posits that a dying primordial black hole, if located within 2,000 astronomical units of Earth, could emit sextillions of neutrinos matching the observed energy signature. This groundbreaking theory, if confirmed, would revolutionize our understanding of black holes and the Universe.</p>

Lane returned to practice after an upper body injury, but his status remains "inconclusive," according to Coach Lincoln Riley. Paige was absent from practice, having left the previous game early with an injury that caused a reshuffle of the offensive line. While USC's offense performed well without Lane in their last game, the potential absence of these key players poses a challenge as they enter a critical stretch of their conference schedule.</p>

          <p>Nexstar Media announced its television stations would continue to preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" upon its return to ABC, following Kimmel's controversial comments regarding Charlie Kirk's death. This decision mirrors Sinclair's earlier move, meaning the late-night show will not air on dozens of ABC affiliates owned by these two major corporations. Nexstar stated its commitment to fostering "respectful, constructive dialogue" and will monitor the show. The company, currently awaiting FCC approval for a $6.2 billion acquisition, noted that Kimmel's show remains available on Disney-owned streaming platforms, while its stations prioritize local news and programming.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh was found guilty by a Florida jury of attempting to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2024, facing life in prison. Routh, who represented himself, was convicted on all five charges, including assaulting a federal officer. During the verdict reading, he reportedly attempted to harm himself with a pen, leading to U.S. marshals intervening. Prosecutors argued Routh had weeks to plot the attack, with a loaded weapon and safety off, despite his claims of non-violence. This article highlights the justice system's commitment to punishing political violence, sending a clear message against such acts.</p>

The remains, belonging to a petite white woman aged 30-50, were found under a headstone marked "Unknown Woman 1946." The case went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence went missing. The discovery of the remains' location by the Human Identification Program offers new hope for resolution. Authorities plan to subject the remains to advanced forensic testing, aiming to restore the victim's name and bring closure after nearly 80 years.</p>

Taiwan experienced barrier lake overflows and walls of water due to the storm's outer rim.

          <p>This article addresses the emergence of spurious online claims that Kamala Harris won the 2024 presidential election due to fraud, drawing parallels to the 2020 election denialism. Elections experts, including Justin Grimmer, debunk these theories, noting similarities in flawed statistical analyses and a reliance on innuendo rather than concrete evidence. Claims, such as an alleged NSA audit, lack credible proof and ignore public state audit processes. The article emphasizes that such fraud theories require believing in widespread, silent conspiracies across multiple parties, which is highly improbable, and highlights the frustration of repeatedly refuting misinformation.</p>
