Despite this downturn, cumulative profits for the year have only fallen by 1.1%, and some analysts remain optimistic about the country's overall economic growth. Citi Bank recently upgraded its 2025 growth forecast for China to 5%, citing strong first-half performance and resilient exports to regions like Southeast Asia and the European Union, which have offset a sharp decline in shipments to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a surprising primary defeat, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has decided to continue his campaign for New York City mayor as an independent. This move comes after progressive state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani secured the Democratic nomination, capitalizing on support from younger voters and endorsements from prominent figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. While Cuomo has not fully committed to an active campaign, his name will remain on the November ballot, potentially splitting the vote in a general election that also includes incumbent Mayor Eric Adams running as an independent.</p>

          <p>China's Defence Ministry has issued a stern warning to the Philippines, cautioning against "self-inflicted destruction" for hosting U.S. anti-ship missile systems. The statement described the move as binding Manila to the "US war machine," which Beijing claims undermines regional security and stability. This escalation in rhetoric follows the recent use of the U.S. NMESIS missile system during joint military exercises, which the Philippine military states will remain in the country as a deterrent. The tensions are further compounded by China's denouncement of Manila's plan to encourage fishing in disputed South China Sea waters.</p>

          <p>President Trump is advocating for a significant tax-and-spending bill that includes extensions of his first-term tax cuts and increased funding for immigration enforcement. However, in a recent pitch to congressional leaders, he notably omitted his previous deadline of having the bill ready by July 4, suggesting potential delays in the Senate. The proposed legislation is highly controversial, with Democrats criticizing its deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The bill's passage remains uncertain as it faces a potential logjam in the legislative process.</p>

          <p>A classified briefing for senators on the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities has revealed a stark partisan divide regarding the operation's effectiveness. Republican allies of President Trump, like Senator Lindsey Graham, endorsed the president's claim that the sites were "obliterated," setting back Iran's program by years. Conversely, Democrats such as Senator Chris Murphy accused Trump of misleading the public, arguing the strikes only caused a setback of months and that no coherent long-term strategy was presented. The briefing proceeded without the Director of National Intelligence, further fueling controversy about the administration's transparency.</p>

According to NASA, the space rock, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weighing over a ton, entered the atmosphere at 30,000 miles per hour. It ultimately exploded 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, creating a pressure wave that produced audible booms heard by residents on the ground.

The project, led by GreenRoots, involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with heat-reflecting light colors, and painting rooftops white to combat dangerously high temperatures. This urban laboratory approach is a response to research showing dense urban areas can be up to 20 degrees hotter than greener ones, a problem worsening with climate change. The initiative provides a potential template for other cities looking to create more livable urban environments.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has fired Omead Afshar, Tesla's vice president of manufacturing and operations, as the automaker contends with declining car sales in key markets. Afshar, who reported directly to Musk, led a large team responsible for areas including North American sales and operations in Europe. His termination follows a previous internal investigation in 2022 and comes as Tesla's stock has underperformed this year. The company is facing increased competition from European and Chinese EV brands and has also dealt with brand damage linked to Musk's political activities.</p>

          <p>In his first public remarks since a ceasefire, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared victory over Israel and claimed to have delivered a "big slap in the face" to the United States. Despite his assertions of targeting numerous military sites, reports indicate Iran's missile attacks caused minimal strategic damage, while U.S. and Israeli strikes reportedly "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. Amidst these claims, Iran passed legislation to halt cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a move the agency's chief warns could provoke a new major international crisis.</p>

          <p>Brendan Foley, CEO of the spice maker McCormick, stated that the company is focused on the impact of new tariffs on its agricultural supply chain. While 90% of products sold in the U.S. are made domestically, many key ingredients like black pepper must be sourced from various international markets. Foley expressed confidence in the company's ability to mitigate the financial impact, noting that their diverse global sourcing provides flexibility. The comments came after McCormick reported better-than-expected earnings, with shares rising as consumers continue to prioritize at-home cooking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against the notion that the stock market rally is too narrow, pointing to a diverse group of top-performing S&P 500 stocks as evidence of broad success. He highlighted gains in varied sectors, including a solar energy company (Enphase), a copper miner (Freeport-McMoRan), a crypto platform (Coinbase), and a utility (NRG Energy). Cramer suggested that the breadth of leadership, which also included biotech, data center, and energy stocks, indicates a genuinely bullish and robust market environment, contradicting warnings from those who feared a lack of diversity in the rally.

          <p>Nike announced it anticipates a potential $1 billion incremental cost in the upcoming fiscal year due to new tariffs, a challenge it plans to fully mitigate over time. The company's strategy includes adjusting its supply chain, increasing prices, and working with partners, aiming to reduce its manufacturing in China to the high single-digit percentage range. This news came as Nike reported a significant profit decline in its fourth quarter as part of its ongoing turnaround plan. Despite the challenges, the company's outlook was better than feared, with executives stating the worst financial impacts are behind them. (not investment advice)</p>
