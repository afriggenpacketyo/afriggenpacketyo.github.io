          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry will investigate the violent 1984 clash between police and miners known as the 'Battle of Orgreave.' Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to address unanswered questions that have persisted for over 40 years regarding the events and the subsequent failed prosecutions of 95 miners. Campaigners, who have long sought this investigation, expressed cautious optimism, hoping it will finally bring truth and justice to the affected mining communities. The inquiry will be chaired by the Bishop of Sheffield and will examine both the confrontation and the controversial evidence used against the miners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports of rare-earth magnets to the United States surged by 660% in June following a preliminary trade agreement that eased Beijing's export licensing requirements. These magnets are critical components for high-tech industries, including electric vehicles and wind turbines, and China dominates over 90% of the global market. The increase in shipments provides relief to American and European companies that faced production disruptions due to shortages caused by the earlier restrictions. This development highlights China's significant leverage in the global supply chain for these essential materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has asserted he is '100%' confident the club followed correct procedures concerning former midfielder Thomas Partey. Partey, who left the club in June, was subsequently charged with five counts of sexual assault involving three women, which he denies. The charges relate to incidents reported to have occurred in 2021 and 2022, while he was an active player for the team. Arteta declined to comment on the specific legal matters but firmly supported the club's handling of the situation when questioned during a pre-season tour.</p>

          <p>Automotive group Stellantis has announced it anticipates a net loss of approximately €2.3 billion ($2.7 billion) for the first half of the year. The company, which owns brands like Jeep, Fiat, and Peugeot, attributes the expected loss to several factors, including pre-tax charges, increased industrial costs, and the initial impact of U.S. tariffs. Stellantis also reported a 6% year-on-year decline in second-quarter vehicle shipments, with a significant 25% drop in North America. The preliminary figures were released ahead of the full financial results scheduled for July 29. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Visitors to the United States requiring a nonimmigrant visa will soon have to pay a new 'visa integrity fee' of at least $250. This fee, part of the newly enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is in addition to existing visa application costs and cannot be waived. The provision states that travelers may be able to have the fee reimbursed after their visa expires, provided they comply with all visa conditions, such as not overstaying. However, details on the implementation, collection, and reimbursement process remain unclear, causing concern among travel industry associations.</p>

          <p>Richard Tillman, the 44-year-old brother of the late U.S. Army Ranger and former NFL player Pat Tillman, has been arrested in San Jose. He is suspected of intentionally driving a vehicle into a post office and then setting the building on fire early Sunday morning. The Almaden Station Post Office was considered a total loss following the blaze. Federal investigators reported that the phrase 'Viva La Me' was spray-painted on the building's exterior, but the motive for the attack remains under investigation. Pat Tillman famously left his NFL career to enlist in the Army and was killed in Afghanistan in 2004.</p>

Scheduled to open in 2027, the airport is part of a broader infrastructure-led strategy to create new growth opportunities.

          <p>Intense price wars are sweeping across key industries in China, from electric vehicles to food delivery, as companies compete for price-sensitive consumers. While this competition offers attractive deals, it is squeezing corporate profits and contributing to deflationary pressures. There are growing concerns that the race to the bottom could lead to compromised product quality and safety, as well as negatively impact wages and the broader economy. In response, China's state media and government have begun to criticize what they term 'irrational' competition, signaling a potential shift toward greater regulation. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this significant setback, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, prioritizing challenges like rising prices and trade negotiations with the U.S. The election results reflect voter frustration over economic issues and a series of political scandals. The outcome was also influenced by the rise of the right-leaning Sanseito party, which drew conservative votes away from the LDP with its nationalist and anti-immigration rhetoric.</p>

The vehicle then appeared to bounce off the trampoline and was flung into the air, ultimately lodging itself in the attic of a nearby barn about three meters off the ground.

His gang is linked to a surge in violence in Ecuador, and he is also a suspect in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate.

Patients and small-scale studies report that these drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, can help manage PCOS symptoms like irregular periods, weight gain, and hormonal imbalances by improving insulin sensitivity. While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, the effectiveness of GLP-1s in addressing the condition's metabolic aspects has generated hope.

The man, Keith McAllister, had entered the scanning room to help his wife off the table when the machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the 9kg weight-training chain. According to his wife, the force 'snatched him' into the machine, causing a 'medical episode' that proved fatal. This tragic accident underscores the extreme dangers of bringing metallic objects near MRI machines, which exert incredibly strong magnetic forces.</p>
