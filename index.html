          <p>Actress Helen Hunt, 61, shared her experiences with Hollywood's beauty standards and the "misery and shame" she felt early in her career. Hunt explained that she decided to move beyond those expectations, influenced by Sondra Ray's book, "The Only Diet There Is," which encourages loving every bite of food. She realized that internalizing societal pressures could ruin her life and chose to focus on self-acceptance instead. Christina Applegate also spoke about her struggles with eating disorders due to pressures from being portrayed as beautiful and sexy on "Married… with Children."</p>

Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp expressed concern about potential cuts to police numbers and urged the government to protect their budget.

          <p>Reform UK's deputy leader, Richard Tice, insisted that the party knows "exactly what it is doing" after a tumultuous 48 hours in which its chairman, Zia Yusuf, resigned and then returned in a different role. Yusuf initially quit, citing that trying to get the party elected was not "a good use of my time," but later stated his decision was "born of exhaustion." Tice explained that Yusuf had been working around the clock and that the party was reorganizing to distribute the workload. The party is expected to appoint a new chairman and deputy chairman next week.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the coast of Southwestern Mexico, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. While there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect, the storm is expected to bring two to four inches of rainfall to portions of Mexico's western states, potentially leading to flooding and mudslides. The storm is also likely to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the southwestern coast. Barbara is forecast to continue strengthening and is expected to become a hurricane on Monday.</p>

The vehicle veered onto the woman, who was helping direct traffic after a previous accident, despite the presence of a driver who should have intervened. The fatality has prompted a federal investigation into Tesla's "Full Self-Driving" software, which has been found responsible for multiple crashes.</p>

The author notes that some students and professors are already taking steps to limit technology use, such as banning electronic devices in classes and forming a "Luddite Club." The author suggests that Pomona, with its resources and small campus, is well-suited to experiment with tech-free initiatives, potentially differentiating itself from competitors. The author also notes the importance of teaching critical thinking and communication skills, which may be undermined by excessive technology use.</p>

However, support drops significantly if people believe the program is not focused on dangerous criminals. Most Americans think the president is trying to help U.S. manufacturing and business.

During Mao's era, there was a great fear that the US would infiltrate the Chinese consciousness and turn the people against the Communist Party. Three generations later, China has emerged as one of the world’s largest economies and a rising power increasingly viewed as a challenger to America’s superpower status. Meanwhile, the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts and vowed to stop offering lectures on how others should live or govern.</p>
