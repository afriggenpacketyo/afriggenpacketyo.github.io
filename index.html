          <p>A Japanese research team found that listening to a specific 100-hertz sound for one minute may alleviate motion sickness symptoms. This non-pharmaceutical approach could be particularly relevant with the rise of self-driving vehicles, which increase passenger motion sickness. The study, published in the journal Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine, suggests that the sound stimulates the inner ear, improving balance and reducing nausea and lightheadedness.  Further research and safety testing are needed before widespread application.</p>

          <p>California regulators proposed regulations to allow testing of self-driving heavy-duty trucks on public roads.  This would overturn an existing ban and align California with other states already conducting such tests.  The proposal is subject to a public comment period and is expected to face opposition from safety advocates and labor unions concerned about job displacement.  The proposal includes enhanced data-reporting requirements for manufacturers.</p>
