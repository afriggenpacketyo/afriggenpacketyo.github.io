          <p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, repeatedly avoided direct answers regarding the termination of U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey, who is the daughter of former FBI director James Comey. Maurene Comey was known for prosecuting high-profile cases, including those against Sean "Diddy" Combs and Jeffrey Epstein, and Leavitt deferred all questions about the firing to the Department of Justice. Additionally, Leavitt affirmed President Trump would not appoint a special prosecutor for the Epstein case and mentioned Attorney General Pam Bondi's visit to Alcatraz as part of the administration's plan to reopen the prison.</p>

          <h2>Lawmakers Propose Classifying Extreme Heat as a Major Disaster</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 15:25:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, with some Republican support, has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the Stafford Act. This change would allow federal FEMA funds to be directed to communities for heat-related emergencies, such as establishing cooling centers and undertaking heat adaptation projects like planting trees. Proponents argue it's necessary as heat causes more deaths than any other weather event, but some, including a former FEMA administrator, contend that heat is already eligible and the focus should be on hazard mitigation grants. The White House has not commented on the proposal.</p>

          <p>British Member of Parliament Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party following an investigation into controversial comments she made regarding racism. In a recent interview, Abbott reiterated her view that racism experienced by Jewish and Traveller people is different from that faced by Black individuals because it is not based on skin color. This stance doubles down on previous remarks from 2023 that led to an earlier suspension. As a result of the new suspension, Abbott, the longest-serving female MP in the Commons, will now sit as an independent member.</p>

          <p>Greek police have arrested five individuals, including the ex-wife and her boyfriend, in connection with the murder of University of California, Berkeley professor Przemyslaw Jeziorski.

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged three more alleged MS-13 gang members in Maryland with a racketeering conspiracy that includes murder and drug trafficking. The charges stem from the July 2024 killing of a homeless man, which prosecutors describe as a brutal retaliatory murder intended to earn the suspects promotions within the gang. Surveillance footage reportedly captured the attack, and two of the men were later arrested in possession of a handgun and cocaine. The U.S. Attorney's office emphasized its commitment to dismantling criminal organizations that terrorize communities.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria, ostensibly to protect the Druze minority during internal unrest, signal a significant escalation in Israel's military campaign. Analysts suggest Israel's motives are multifaceted, including deflecting from Prime Minister Netanyahu's domestic political and legal troubles and creating an informal buffer zone in southern Syria. Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has condemned the attacks, accusing Israel of exploiting the unrest to sow division. Experts note that Israel's strategy appears aimed at keeping Syria weak and fragmented, a goal furthered by the recent clashes that have undermined the Damascus government's authority.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older adults, after he experienced mild swelling in his legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that a comprehensive examination, including ultrasounds, confirmed the benign condition and ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The diagnosis occurs when leg veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing pooling and swelling. Leavitt also attributed recent bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, asserting that he remains in excellent overall health.</p>

          <p>The viral "princess treatment" trend on TikTok, where women expect partners to perform all manner of services from ordering their food to paying their fines, is sparking a debate about modern relationship dynamics. This article explores how the trend, while often playful, promotes a high-maintenance and passive role for women, framing traditional gender norms as a form of empowerment. Relationship experts suggest these expectations may be an extreme reaction to the poor treatment many women have experienced or witnessed. However, they also warn that such transactional tests can hinder genuine connection by reducing dating to a series of self-focused demands.</p>

          <p>For individuals on a fixed income from Social Security, managing debt can be particularly challenging, but consolidation remains a potential option. While Social Security benefits count as income for loan applications, qualifying for a traditional debt consolidation loan with favorable terms can be difficult due to limited budgets and debt-to-income ratios. Alternative strategies include home equity loans for homeowners or enrolling in a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency, which negotiates lower interest rates with creditors. Other relief options for those who don't qualify include debt settlement, direct negotiation, or, as a last resort, bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic legislators have introduced the Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2025, a bill aimed at making excessive price hikes by large corporations illegal. The proposed legislation explicitly targets companies that may use factors like President Trump's tariff policies as cover to inflate prices beyond what is necessary. The bill would empower the FTC and state attorneys general to litigate abuses and require companies with over $100 million in revenue to publicly disclose significant price changes and their cost structures. Proponents argue it is a necessary tool to protect families from corporate greed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Arcadia, California couple is under investigation for child neglect and endangerment after 21 children, many born via surrogacy, were removed from their home. The investigation began when a 2-month-old baby was hospitalized with significant head trauma, allegedly after the parents waited two days to seek medical care. Surrogate mothers who carried children for the couple have come forward, alleging they were deceived about the family's circumstances. One surrogate described being told the couple wanted many children quickly due to the father's age, and later discovered through social media that other women were simultaneously pregnant for them.</p>

The summer-long celebration includes the debut of a new show with a lifelike Walt Disney animatronic and the return of the popular "Paint the Night" parade.

Analysts believe this direct-to-consumer model may not negatively impact the companies' net pricing, as the drug is already heavily rebated to these middlemen.

Analysis of state contracts, some of which reportedly went to political donors, revealed that money intended for hurricane response was used for the jail's construction, security, and rush fees. The revelation has drawn sharp criticism from Florida Democrats, who accuse the governor of irresponsibly creating a deficit during hurricane season for a controversial project.

This move is seen as another attempt to undermine Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly threatened to fire for not lowering interest rates.
