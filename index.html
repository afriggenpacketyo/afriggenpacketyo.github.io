        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. airline industry is grappling with an uncertain outlook despite a busy July 4th holiday period. While millions traveled, domestic airfare has decreased by 3% from last year, signaling a potential mismatch between flight capacity and consumer demand. Major carriers like Southwest and Delta have withdrawn their 2025 forecasts, citing economic ambiguity and challenges such as President Trump's tariff policies. Investors are now watching for signs of demand recovery and potential flight schedule reductions for the latter half of the year as airlines prepare to report their earnings.

          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries engaged in a lengthy "magic-minute" speech to vehemently oppose a major Republican tax and spending bill. Jeffries condemned the legislation as an "immoral document" and a "reckless Republican budget," focusing his criticism on its projected impact on healthcare, which he claimed would cause millions to lose Medicaid coverage. The marathon speech delayed the final vote, with Jeffries accusing Republicans of rubber-stamping a bill that would harm the American people while Speaker Mike Johnson praised President Trump's help in securing votes for the measure.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz Foods Company has issued a recall for approximately 367,812 pounds of its Oscar Mayer fully cooked turkey bacon products due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced the recall, which affects various package sizes produced between April and June of this year and shipped nationwide. Although no illnesses have been confirmed, listeriosis can be a serious infection, particularly for pregnant individuals, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems.

          <p>The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits decreased last week, indicating a persistently strong labor market despite broader economic uncertainties. The Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims fell by 4,000 to 233,000 for the week ending June 28, which was lower than analysts had anticipated. This data, a key indicator of layoffs, reinforces the resilience of U.S. employment even as some major corporations like Microsoft and Google have announced job cuts. The four-week average of claims also saw a decline, suggesting underlying stability in the workforce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The cost of U.K. government borrowing has fallen, partially reversing a spike that occurred after Chancellor Rachel Reeves became emotional during a parliamentary session. The yield on 10-year government bonds dropped as markets reacted positively to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's statement of support, in which he said he worked "in lockstep" with the chancellor. Analysts suggest the market's initial negative reaction was due to fears that Reeves might resign, which would remove a key figure associated with fiscal discipline. The episode highlights market sensitivity to political stability and its potential impact on mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated unexpected strength in June, with the economy adding 147,000 nonfarm payroll jobs, significantly higher than the 110,000 forecasted. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report also showed the unemployment rate falling to 4.1%, although this was partly due to a decrease in the labor force participation rate. The robust job numbers, particularly strong gains in government employment, have led market analysts to conclude that a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in July is now highly unlikely. Average hourly earnings saw a modest increase, suggesting that wage-related inflation remains under control. (not investment advice)</p>

The report indicates that the cost for a typical cookout has risen at a 12.7% annualized rate since the tariffs were announced in April, with significant price hikes on items like beer, folding chairs, and grilling tools. For example, prices for popular domestic and imported beers have increased over 9%, while a Coleman camping chair listed on Amazon saw a nearly 48% price jump, according to the analysis.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is handling a historically low number of fully argued cases but has become increasingly active on its emergency docket, often ruling in favor of the Trump administration. This "shadow docket" allows the court to make decisions on an accelerated timeline without full briefings or oral arguments. The article notes that President Trump has frequently used this process to advance assertions of executive power, with the court siding with his administration in 12 out of 15 resolved emergency applications. This trend is raising concerns about the expansion of presidential power and the changing role of the nation's highest court.</p>

          <p>After years of steady growth, public support for same-sex marriage in the United States is reportedly declining, a decade after the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. The article suggests that the political strategy of linking gay rights with transgender rights has potentially contributed to this shift in public opinion. This trend marks a significant reversal from the period following the first legal same-sex marriage in 2004, when support consistently climbed from a minority position to a majority consensus.

This skepticism extends to White House statements about the effectiveness of the U.S. air assault on Iran.

          <p>An official report has found that historical police investigations into child sexual exploitation in Manchester were significantly delayed because the city council provided heavily redacted evidence. The inspectorate noted that some documents had only a few words visible, making it impossible to assess their value for two major operations, Green Jacket and Bernese. While Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has reportedly made significant improvements in its handling of such cases, past failings have led to an "irrecoverable loss of trust" for some victims. A new, more efficient information-sharing protocol has since been established between the police, council, and prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Dr. Marwan Sultan, the director of the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza, was killed along with several family members in an Israeli airstrike on his home in Gaza City. The Israeli military stated it had targeted a "key terrorist" from Hamas in the area and is reviewing claims that civilians were harmed. The Hamas-run health ministry condemned the killing, praising Dr. Sultan's long medical career. This event occurs as the conflict continues, with the UN reporting that no hospitals remain functional in the north Gaza governate due to the ongoing military operations and damage from previous attacks.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent sales boost from promotions, Apple's iPhone sales in China are projected to face significant headwinds in the second half of 2025. According to Counterpoint Research, factors contributing to the anticipated slowdown include weakening consumer spending, an "ageing" iPhone 16 cycle, and aggressive competition from domestic rivals like Huawei in the high-end market. While Apple saw an 8% year-on-year sales increase in the second quarter, driven by discounts and government subsidies, analysts predict this momentum will not be sustained. The outlook highlights the ongoing challenges for the U.S. tech giant in the highly competitive Chinese smartphone market. (not investment advice)</p>

The move represents a major policy shift for California Democrats, prioritizing the creation of abundant housing over potential objections from some environmental and labor groups.

          <p>Merit Street Media, the media network founded by television personality Dr. Phil McGraw, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection less than two years after its launch. The filing in a Texas court reports assets and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million and follows two rounds of significant employee layoffs. Launched in 2023 in partnership with Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), the company aimed to provide programming to counter what McGraw described as a "cultural 'woke' assault." Merit Street Media has also filed a lawsuit against TBN, alleging a failure to provide agreed-upon national distribution for the network.</p>

          <p>A ferry traveling between the Indonesian islands of Java and Bali has sunk, resulting in at least six deaths and leaving dozens of people missing. The vessel was carrying an official manifest of 53 passengers and 12 crew members, but authorities fear the actual number on board was higher, a common issue that complicates rescue operations in the region. So far, 31 survivors have been rescued as the search for others continues. Marine accidents are a frequent occurrence in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where safety regulations are often unevenly enforced, raising persistent concerns.</p>

          <h2>Indonesia and Malaysia Strengthen Ties with Russia Amid Shifting Global Alliances</h2>

          <p>Southeast Asian nations, notably Indonesia and Malaysia, are actively strengthening their relationships with Russia as part of a broader foreign policy strategy to maintain non-alignment and balance their interests between the U.S. and China. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto recently visited Moscow, and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has made several trips, with both leaders praising Russia. This pivot includes exploring expanded trade, energy cooperation, and participation in alternative international forums like BRICS. Analysts suggest this trend is driven by a desire for strategic autonomy and is fueled by growing anti-Western sentiment in the region.</p>
