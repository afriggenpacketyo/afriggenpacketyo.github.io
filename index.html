          <p>Electric air taxi manufacturer Joby Aviation announced plans to significantly increase its production capacity ahead of its goal to launch commercial service in 2026. The company is opening a new components facility in Dayton, Ohio, and doubling the capacity of its main manufacturing hub in Marina, California. This expansion, supported by engineers from partner Toyota, aims to eventually produce up to 500 aircraft annually and will create hundreds of new jobs. The announcement comes as Joby continues to seek FAA certification and recently delivered its first aircraft to the UAE for service next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced it will soon resume exporting its MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China after receiving clearance from the U.S. Commerce Department. The news, which caused AMD's stock to climb over 6%, signals a potential easing of trade tensions that had previously led the company to anticipate significant revenue losses. This development follows similar news from competitor Nvidia and industry-wide lobbying efforts urging the Trump administration to loosen export controls on AI technology. The MI308 chips were specifically designed for the Chinese market to comply with earlier U.S. restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Citigroup reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst predictions, driven by strong performance in its markets and banking divisions. The bank's revenue increased by 8% year-over-year to $21.67 billion, with net income climbing 25% to $4.02 billion, leading to a rise in its stock price. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the record performance in equities trading and significant growth in banking revenues as key successes. Despite the positive results, the bank also noted a 16% increase in the cost of credit, citing a deterioration in the economic outlook compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple has entered into a $500 million agreement with MP Materials, the sole rare earth miner in the United States, to secure a domestic supply of critical magnets for its products. The deal includes Apple purchasing magnets from MP Materials' Texas facility and collaborating on a new recycling line in California. This partnership is a significant step in reducing U.S. reliance on China, which currently dominates the global rare earth supply chain. The announcement, which boosted MP Materials' stock by 20%, aligns with broader U.S. government efforts to strengthen domestic production of these vital technological components.

Speaking ahead of the All-Star Game, Rodriguez credited Manfred's initiatives, such as the pitch timer and shift restrictions, for decreasing game times and boosting attendance and viewership. The endorsement is notable given that Manfred led the investigation that resulted in Rodriguez's full-season suspension in 2014 for performance-enhancing drug use. Despite some controversies, Rodriguez argues Manfred's positive impact on the sport's popularity and finances is undeniable.</p>

The court ruled that the CFPB exceeded its statutory authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

          <p>William "Rick" Singer, the central figure in the "Varsity Blues" college admissions bribery scandal, has been permitted by a federal judge to open a new college counseling service. However, a key condition of the ruling requires Singer to prominently disclose his criminal past to all potential clients on his website and in writing. The mandated statement details his guilty pleas to racketeering, money laundering, and obstruction of justice, as well as his prison sentence and financial penalties. Singer, who was released from prison to a halfway house in 2024, stated he has no problem informing clients of his past actions.</p>

          <p>Prominent Israeli entrepreneur Shahar Segal has stepped down as a spokesperson for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) following widespread criticism and protests. The backlash stems from the hundreds of Palestinian deaths reported near the U.S.- and Israeli-backed group's food distribution sites. Protests erupted at one of his restaurants in Australia, and business partners in Tel Aviv publicly condemned his involvement. Segal and GHF maintain the program was a necessary way to deliver aid without it being diverted by Hamas, but international aid groups have called the distribution model a "death trap" for civilians.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed the growing controversy over the Jeffrey Epstein files, stating that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release "whatever she thinks is credible." Speaking to reporters, Trump claimed he received only a "very quick briefing" on the matter before the Justice Department announced its findings. He also made baseless claims that the files were fabricated by political opponents like Barack Obama and James Comey. The comments come as Trump faces significant pressure from his own base, who are demanding more transparency and are dissatisfied with the administration's conclusion that no secret client list exists.</p>

          <p>An ancient Roman mosaic with an erotic theme, stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II, has been officially returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii. The artwork, which dates to the first century, was repatriated from Germany after the heirs of its last owner contacted Italian authorities to arrange its return. The mosaic, depicting two lovers, is considered a work of extraordinary cultural interest and may have once decorated a bedroom floor. Officials hailed the return as a significant moment of healing and noted a changing mentality where possessing stolen art becomes a burden for later generations.</p>

          <p>Following a devastating loss to Australia where the West Indies were bowled out for 27—the second-worst score in Test cricket history—Cricket West Indies has called an emergency meeting to review the performance. The review will include legendary former players Sir Viv Richards, Sir Clive Lloyd, and Brian Lara. The batting collapse highlighted a stark contrast in quality between the number one ranked Australian team and the eighth-ranked West Indies. Factors contributing to the historic low score included a bowler-friendly pitch, the skill of Australian bowler Mitchell Starc, and a series of poor shots from the West Indian lineup.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June indicated that U.S. inflation is ticking upward, reaching a 2.7% annual rate, the highest since February. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.3%, driven by increases in energy, food, and other categories like apparel and household furnishings. The data suggests that recently imposed tariffs may be starting to impact consumer prices, though analysts note that underlying inflation remains relatively contained for now. This latest report makes a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in July highly unlikely, as price pressures are expected to strengthen over the summer months. (not investment advice)</p>

Democrats pressed Waltz on a controversy where he, as National Security Advisor, added a journalist to a private Signal group chat discussing military strikes, a move one senator called "amateurish." Waltz defended his actions, stating Signal was an authorized communication tool and that a White House investigation resulted in no disciplinary action. Despite the tough questions and criticism of his leadership during the incident, the nomination is still expected to advance.</p>

The White House asserted that during a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump was merely asking a question about Ukraine's capabilities, not encouraging escalation. This clarification comes as the Trump administration simultaneously announced it would send more weapons to Ukraine and threatened Russia with severe tariffs if a ceasefire is not reached within 50 days.
