          <p>Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon title in a remarkably one-sided final, defeating American Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes. This "double bagel" victory marks the first time a woman has won the Wimbledon final without conceding a game since 1911. For the 24-year-old Polish star, this is her sixth Grand Slam title, maintaining a perfect record in major finals. Anisimova, appearing in her first Grand Slam final, struggled with nerves, committing numerous unforced errors throughout the match.</p>

          <p>In a swift 57-minute match, Iga Swiatek claimed her first Wimbledon championship by defeating Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0. The article provides deep context on both players, noting Swiatek's previous Grand Slam wins on other surfaces and a past doping ban from a contaminated supplement. It also highlights Anisimova's remarkable journey to the final, including her 2023 career break for mental health and her stunning semifinal victory over the world's number one player. Despite the loss, Anisimova is set to break into the top 10 rankings for the first time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash has uncovered perplexing details from the cockpit voice recorder. Seconds after takeoff, both of the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position, leading to a total loss of engine power. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why they initiated the cut-off, with the other denying the action, leaving the question of intent or error unresolved. Investigators are now focused on identifying the voices and understanding the sequence of events that killed 260 people.</p>

          <p>Russia has escalated its bombing campaign, launching a massive overnight attack involving hundreds of drones and dozens of cruise missiles across Ukraine, resulting in at least six deaths and numerous injuries. Key targets included the Chernivtsi and Lviv regions in the west, which is a vital hub for foreign military aid, as well as the northeastern city of Kharkiv. Ukrainian officials reported shooting down a significant portion of the incoming projectiles but noted that debris from downed drones also caused casualties. The intensified long-range strikes coincide with Russia's renewed efforts to advance along the front line.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that a 30% tariff will be imposed on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. In letters to the respective leaders, Trump cited persistent trade deficits with the EU and insufficient efforts by Mexico to curb drug trafficking as justifications for the new taxes. The announcement has drawn sharp responses, with the EU vowing to safeguard its interests and Mexico calling the deal unfair.

The study considered how reliant each state is on international trade, particularly with China, and on federal government spending.

However, a recent executive order by President Trump eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on the finished product.

          <p>European Union leaders have presented a united front in response to President Trump's announcement of a 30% tariff on all EU goods, vowing to take all necessary steps to protect the bloc's interests. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the EU is ready to negotiate an agreement by the August 1 deadline, it is also preparing "proportionate countermeasures." Leaders from France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands echoed this sentiment, calling the U.S. move concerning and emphasizing the need for a pragmatic solution to avoid a damaging trade war.</p>

          <p>After years of debate, new online safety rules are taking effect in the UK, legally requiring tech platforms to prevent children from seeing harmful content like pornography and material promoting self-harm. The regulator, Ofcom, will enforce age verification measures, with non-compliant companies facing heavy fines. However, critics and even government sources acknowledge the rules may already be outdated, as they do not fully address risks from AI chatbots or in-app purchases. The government is already considering further measures to address addictive algorithms and screen time as technology continues to evolve.</p>

The victory marks a significant milestone for British tennis, as the last time two Britons won the title was in 1936. The win caps a successful grass-court season for the pair.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Response to Texas Floods Spotlights a Shift in Federal Disaster Management</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent tour of flood-ravaged central Texas highlights a shift in the federal government's approach to disaster response. Unlike past presidents who often focused on connecting emotionally with victims on the ground, Trump's approach emphasizes mobilizing resources while relying more heavily on state and local officials. This strategy reflects a broader administrative goal of scaling back the federal role in emergency management. The discussion among analysts centers on whether this hands-off approach is effective and how it changes the public's perception of presidential leadership during times of national crisis.</p>

          <p>Investigators in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, have successfully used genetic genealogy to solve a cold case from 1997 involving the sexual assault of a nine-year-old boy. The assailant, identified only as John Doe #147, remained at large for nearly three decades. With the help of researcher Barbara Rae-Venter, a pioneer in the field, prosecutors were able to build a family tree using DNA evidence, ultimately leading them to the perpetrator. This breakthrough showcases the growing power of genetic genealogy as a crucial tool for resolving long-unsolved violent crimes.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he is considering revoking the U.S. citizenship of his longtime nemesis, actress Rosie O'Donnell. In his post, Trump called O'Donnell a "Threat to Humanity" and suggested she should remain in Ireland, where she recently moved. Legal scholars note that the president cannot revoke the citizenship of a U.S.-born individual, as it is protected by the 14th Amendment. O'Donnell responded on TikTok, calling Trump a "danger to the nation" and a "mentally ill untreated criminal," continuing their long and public feud.</p>

          <p>According to author James Patterson, who has co-written a new book on the Idaho student murders, Bryan Kohberger likely believed he could commit the perfect crime. Patterson suggests that Kohberger, an introverted and arrogant criminology student, experienced "tunnel vision" during the act, causing him to overlook a critical piece of evidence. This mistake was leaving behind a knife sheath at the crime scene, which contained the DNA that ultimately led investigators to his arrest. The book and an accompanying docuseries explore Kohberger's background, social awkwardness, and potential motives.</p>

However, political science experts are highly skeptical of its potential for success, citing the immense structural and financial advantages of the Democratic and Republican parties. Historically, third parties have succeeded by disrupting and influencing the major parties on specific issues, not by winning elections. With low personal approval ratings and a vaguely defined platform, Musk's venture faces significant hurdles.</p>

The author, who transitioned as an adult, argues against the idea that their own success in life proves gender-affirming care for minors is unnecessary, calling this "survivorship bias." They contend that many who did not have their advantages or support systems likely suffered in silence. The essay posits that just as visibility has helped gay teens, seeing positive trans examples may help young people today.</p>

This is the first recorded death from the disease in the state since 2007.

The pneumonic form infects the lungs and is the most deadly, though it is treatable with modern antibiotics. Officials advise caution when handling sick or dead animals.</p>
