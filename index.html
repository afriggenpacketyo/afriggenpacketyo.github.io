          <p>HUD Secretary Scott Turner declared "faith is back in our government" at the agency's first-ever faith-based disaster recovery event on the National Mall. The gathering, featuring worship leader Sean Feucht, marked a significant shift in how the federal government engages with Christian organizations for recovery efforts. Turner emphasized that faith-based groups are crucial first responders in disasters, providing vital support in rebuilding homes and communities. This event symbolized a transformation for Feucht's "Let Us Worship" movement, gaining federal recognition and a platform after years of clashing with left-leaning local governments over worship restrictions.</p>

The Belarusian demonstrated remarkable composure, especially after failing to serve out the match at 5-4, to claim her fourth major singles title.

This pivotal moment led to a dramatic turn, as the Dodgers ultimately suffered a devastating 4-3 walk-off loss to the Baltimore Orioles. Relief pitchers Blake Treinen and Tanner Scott then struggled in the ninth inning, allowing the Orioles to score three runs and secure an improbable victory.

          <p>China's private holiday accommodation sector is experiencing a significant downturn, with many operators, like Chen Mei, regretting their investments. A brief post-pandemic "revenge travel" boom quickly faded, leading to intense price wars and severely squeezed profits across the industry. This article highlights that a report by Fastdata revealed nearly 60% of operators, many of whom established businesses in the last three years, now regret entering the market, with some feeling they are essentially working for a housekeeper's wage. This situation illustrates a rapid boom-and-bust cycle, leaving entrepreneurs in a difficult financial position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by over 80% following the Trump administration's termination of a long-standing tariff exemption for low-cost imports. This article reports that 88 postal operators worldwide have suspended some or all service to the US for parcels valued at $800 or less, as the burden of customs duty collection now falls on transportation carriers or approved parties. The Universal Postal Union noted "major operational disruptions" due to insufficient time and guidance for compliance with the new rules. The administration defends the move as essential for closing a loophole used to evade tariffs and smuggle illicit goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The EU is set to gradually introduce its much-delayed new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, which will significantly impact non-EU citizens traveling to the Schengen Area. This article explains that the EES will replace traditional passport stamping, requiring travelers to register biometric information, including fingerprints and a photo, and answer four questions at automated kiosks upon their first use. The system aims to enhance security and ultimately streamline travel, but concerns persist about potential long queues, particularly at busy entry points like Dover. The EES will be fully active across all 29 participating countries by April 2026.</p>
