          <p>American universities are experiencing an increasing brain drain as funding cuts and concerns over academic freedom prompt professors to seek positions in other countries. Historians Timothy Snyder and Marci Shore recently left Yale University for the University of Toronto, citing concerns about the direction of American democracy. Immigration specialists are assisting high-profile professors in fields like medical research, AI, and physics to relocate to Canada, Australia, and Europe, with better funding and lab support being key factors in their decisions. One American client is considering offers from Britain, Australia, and China, prioritizing research support in their final decision. </p>

          <p>President Trump convened his national security team to discuss potential military action against Iran amidst escalating tensions with Israel. The administration is preparing for large-scale evacuations of American citizens from Israel, while Trump insists he has not made a final decision regarding a U.S. strike. He claimed Iranian officials are seeking a meeting at the White House, a claim denied by Iran, which also threatened the U.S. with "irreparable damage" if it attacks Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran and Israel have been exchanging missile fire following Israel's preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear program, with the International Atomic Energy Agency reporting that two nuclear centrifuge production facilities in Iran were hit.</p>

          <p>AstroAI is recalling approximately 249,100 mini-fridges due to a potential fire and burn hazard caused by a short circuit in the electrical switch. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has received numerous reports of the mini-fridges emitting smoke, melting, or catching fire, with two fires causing over $360,000 in property damage. The recalled mini-fridges, which have a 4-liter capacity and can hold six cans, were sold online through Amazon.com and Astroai.com from June 2019 to June 2022. Consumers are advised to immediately stop using the recalled mini-fridges and contact AstroAI for a replacement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA reveals a significant link between screen addiction in teenagers and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The study, which followed over 4,000 kids starting at ages 9 to 10, found that a substantial portion of them developed increasing addiction to social media, mobile phones, and video games by age 14. These teens were significantly more likely to report suicidal thoughts and behaviors, with researchers emphasizing that addictive elements of screen use are stronger predictors of mental health issues than just screen time alone. The study highlights the importance of understanding how teens use screens and identifying signs of addiction, such as using screens to avoid real-life problems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social Security is projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year earlier than previously forecast, potentially leading to a 19% reduction in monthly benefits. The updated projection is partly attributed to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which expanded benefits for millions of retirees. Advocacy groups are urging Congress to take swift action to shore up the program, either by raising revenue or cutting benefits. One proposed solution involves lifting the income cap on payroll taxes, while some Republican lawmakers suggest increasing the retirement age; however, this is considered a benefit cut for retirees.

          <p>Hurricane Erick is rapidly intensifying in the Eastern Pacific and is forecast to reach major hurricane status before impacting the coast of southern Mexico. The National Hurricane Center has issued hurricane warnings and watches for portions of the Mexican coast, anticipating destructive winds and life-threatening flash floods. Erick is expected to bring 8 to 12 inches of rain, with some areas receiving up to 16 inches, leading to dangerous flooding and mudslides. Dangerous storm surge is also expected to cause coastal flooding and large waves, particularly impacting areas still recovering from Hurricane Otis in 2023.</p>

          <p>During a preliminary hearing, federal authorities testified that Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado Molotov cocktail attack, used Israeli flags to identify his targets. Soliman allegedly targeted those he considered Zionists, referencing the Muslim liberation year "1187" on clothing items found in his car. The FBI special agent testified that Soliman specifically searched for "Zionists events" in Boulder to find his victims. Soliman's attorney argued that his client differentiated between Zionists and Jews, raising questions about the definition of Zionism and whether it constitutes a political movement or national origin.</p>

The qualification regarding property size, type, and home energy score is being eliminated, extending the benefit to more families, including nearly a million households with children. Energy companies will fund the expansion of the Warm Home Discount, potentially leading to a slight increase in bills for all customers.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach while evaluating the impact of economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to rise, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the economy's relative strength, citing solid labor market conditions and low inflation, but cautioned that new tariffs could drive up inflation and slow economic growth. The Fed's decision means borrowers are unlikely to see near-term relief on lending costs, while savers will continue to benefit from higher interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal authorities are investigating the anonymous delivery of pizzas to the homes of U.S. lawmakers and U.S. Capitol Police leadership, raising concerns about a potential menacing message. Both Democrats and Republicans in the House have received the unsolicited deliveries, which began before the recent attack on state lawmakers in Minnesota. Law enforcement officials believe the deliveries are intended to send a threatening message, indicating that the sender knows where the recipients live. The U.S. Capitol Police are working with federal, state, and local partners to address the matter and protect ongoing investigations.</p>

          <p>The Social Security retirement trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2033, according to the Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report. If the funds are depleted, beneficiaries may only receive 77% of their scheduled benefits. The combined trust funds are expected to have enough revenue to cover scheduled benefits and administrative costs until 2034, one year earlier than last year's projection. The report considers the effects of the Social Security Fairness Act, which enhanced benefits for certain public pensioners, but does not include the potential impact of new tax proposals, tariffs, and deportations.

          <p>The possibility of the U.S. striking Iran's nuclear facilities is being considered, but it presents numerous military challenges, particularly due to the heavily fortified Fordo plant. Built inside a mountain, Fordo can only be penetrated by the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), which only the U.S. possesses and can deploy using the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Experts suggest that multiple bombing rounds would be needed, and even then, the extent of the damage would be uncertain, potentially requiring ground forces. Such a strike could trigger retaliatory attacks by Iran on U.S. assets in the region, escalating the conflict.</p>

The site is believed to be processing uranium isotopes, primarily in the form of uranium hexafluoride gas. Experts suggest that any contamination from a strike would likely be localized due to the gas's heavy molecular weight. While uranium isotopes pose a relatively low level of hazard, the reaction of uranium hexafluoride with water could form hydrofluoric acid, an acutely hazardous material, however, experts have confidence that the dangers are not severe. </p>
