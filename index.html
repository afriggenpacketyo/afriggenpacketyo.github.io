        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Industries Corp. experienced a significant drop in share value after the Toyota Group announced a $33 billion deal to take the company private, indicating investor disappointment. This decision occurs amidst growing pressure on Japanese firms to dissolve long-standing cross-shareholding ties, with the Financial Services Agency advocating for their reduction. Toyota had previously utilized cross-shareholding to defend against potential acquisitions. The deal involves a tender offer of $26 billion for Toyota Industries shares at a price significantly lower than the previous day's closing value. The Toyota Group will establish a new holding company for the deal, with investments from Toyota Fudosan and Toyota Motor Chairman Akio Toyoda, while other financing will be supported by loans from major banks. The announcement suggests a broader trend of unwinding cross-shareholdings within the Toyota Group.</p>

          <p>President Trump has increased tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to 50%, citing the need to revitalize the American industry. The executive order formalizing this move aims to counteract countries that continue to sell excess steel and aluminum at low prices in the U.S. market. The increased tariffs apply to all trading partners except Britain, which has a preliminary trade agreement with the U.S. The action has drawn criticism from key trading partners like Canada and Mexico, who are among the largest exporters of steel to the U.S. Senior EU officials hope to secure an exemption from the higher tariffs during a meeting with U.S. trade representatives.</p>

          <p>Bernie Sanders argues that the Democratic Party lacks a compelling message for working-class people, criticizing their incremental approach to change. He believes Trumpism taps into the understanding that the system is not working for many Americans, albeit with flawed solutions. Sanders highlights the growing wealth inequality in the U.S., where the richest thrive while a majority of people live paycheck to paycheck. He advocates for policies that take on the billionaire class, ensure healthcare for all, and address the housing crisis, arguing that the Democrats' failure to articulate these issues weakens their credibility.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's defense team has chosen not to have her testify in her murder trial, a decision that could significantly impact the outcome. Read is accused of murdering her boyfriend, Boston police officer John Oâ€™Keefe, with the prosecution presenting damaging interview clips. The defense argues that her vehicle never made contact with O'Keefe, and that there was no collision. Legal experts suggest that while Read could perform well on the stand, her statements in televised interviews could be damaging under cross-examination. The jury has been instructed not to hold her silence against her, but her absence from the stand leaves her side of the story unaddressed in court.</p>

However, experts in the U.S. and Canada have challenged this assertion, citing NASAâ€™s Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe, which entered a similar orbit in 2011.

          <p>Australia's economy grew by 1.3% year-on-year in the first quarter, missing estimates due to shrinking public spending, weakened consumer demand, and reduced exports.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) previously cut rates to 3.85% in May to bolster growth amid global trade tensions.

          <p>China is increasing enforcement of export controls on critical minerals as it seeks to maintain its dominance in global supplies amid growing pressure from the United States. Authorities in regions rich in these minerals are inspecting exporters' operations and cracking down on illegal mining activities. This effort aligns with a directive from Beijing to tighten control over strategic mineral exports. The moves come as Beijing continues to assert its influence over critical mineral supplies in response to new U.S. restrictions on technology.</p>
