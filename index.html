          <p>Annalena Baerbock, Germany's former foreign minister from the Green Party, has begun her new role as President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot requested by Russia, a move seen as a reaction to her vocal criticism of the war in Ukraine. Despite some domestic criticism regarding her nomination over a more experienced diplomat, Baerbock aims to act as a unifier and honest broker for all 193 UN member states. Her transition to the international stage comes as her Green Party adjusts to being in the opposition back in Germany.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett discusses her judicial philosophy and addresses critiques of the court's recent decisions. She defends the Dobbs ruling, which overturned Roe v. Wade, stating it returned the issue of abortion to the democratic process rather than making it illegal. Barrett also responds to concerns that the court is enabling an expansion of presidential power under Donald Trump, asserting that the justices' role is to decide legal questions, not to make political judgments. The interview coincides with the release of her new book, "Listening to the Law."</p>

The article explores the normalization of creating sexually explicit content for income, a trend that has grown significantly since the pandemic. While the platform offers a quick way to make money, experts and a documentary filmmaker warn of the serious risks involved. These dangers include potential harm to future job prospects, psychological impacts, and severe safety threats such as stalking and violence from subscribers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's elimination of the "de minimis" loophole, which allowed tariff-free imports under $800, has sparked concern among some small businesses. However, this article argues that the panic is misdirected, as the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected. The author contends that while tariffs will lead to price increases, the broader economy can likely absorb these costs as long as income and wealth continue to grow.

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker successfully paddled a kayak grown entirely from mycelium, the root structure of mushrooms, for over 26 miles from Catalina Island to the California mainland. The 12-hour journey marks a significant achievement in the field of fungal innovation, promoting mycelium as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in aquatic recreation. Shoemaker's project, supported by the arts organization Fulcrum Arts, aims to inspire further research into "AquaFung" materials. While acknowledging the technology is still in its early stages, he hopes his open-source research will encourage others to build upon his work.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade showcased a range of advanced weaponry, including new drones, intercontinental missiles, and directed-energy systems, highlighting significant progress in its military modernization. This technological surge is attributed to a strategic shift towards fostering competition among both state-owned and private defense suppliers. By encouraging experimentation and innovation, particularly in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sector, China has rapidly developed a diverse and technologically sophisticated arsenal. The debut of five new nuclear-capable missile types underscores the intensity and success of this research and manufacturing ecosystem.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested 890 people at a demonstration protesting the UK government's decision to proscribe the group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act. The majority of arrests were for showing support for a banned organization, while others were for offenses including assaults on police officers. Organizers from Defend Our Juries claim the protest was peaceful and accused the police of violence, arguing the ban is unenforceable. The government proscribed Palestine Action in July after activists damaged military aircraft at an RAF base, making it a criminal offense to support the group.</p>

Colombian officials are concerned that losing river access would cripple the town's economy, which relies on trade with Peru and Brazil. The situation has prompted high-level political protests and has led to the scheduling of bilateral commission meetings to address the long-standing border ambiguities.</p>

The prosecution argues the activists deliberately undermined state migration policy, while the defense contends they were saving lives in a desperate situation.

Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb with warmth, white noise, and gentle motion. He also recommends that both parents get involved in settling the baby and stresses the importance of a flexible routine that responds to the baby's needs rather than a rigid schedule.</p>

By providing energy independence from fragile grids and complex systems, solar power is presented as the ideal power source for those concerned with civilizational breakdown.

Opponents, largely Democrats, feel the move threatens their rights and freedoms, is ineffective against crime, and is motivated more by politics than public safety.

With solar and wind power generation growing at a record pace, the existing grid struggles with intermittency and curtailment, where clean energy is generated but cannot be used. Coal plants are being used as a reliable backup to prevent blackouts during peak demand or when renewables fall short, such as during droughts affecting hydropower. This approach provides stability, giving grid operators the confidence to continue integrating unprecedented amounts of new green energy.</p>

          <p>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is facing criticism for its decision to ask broadcast partners not to show any crowd disruptions or negative reactions directed at Donald Trump during the US Open final. This op-ed condemns the move as hypocritical and cowardly, arguing it sacrifices the event's authenticity to shield a politician from public disapproval. The author points out the irony of this censorship at a tournament that has historically embraced progressive values and often televises other forms of disruption. The piece concludes that by sanitizing the broadcast, the USTA is undermining democratic expression and the unique, unfiltered character of the New York-based event.</p>

          <p>Milda Mitkutė, co-founder of the online marketplace Vinted, recounts how the need to clear out her oversized wardrobe before moving to a smaller apartment led to the creation of a billion-dollar company. In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, quickly launched a simple website in Lithuania for selling secondhand clothes, which rapidly gained popularity through word of mouth. After expanding into Germany, the platform grew into the global brand Vinted, which now has over 16 million users in the UK alone. The company overcame early financial struggles to become Lithuania's first tech "unicorn," capitalizing on the growing trend of sustainable, second-hand fashion.</p>

          <p>Erik Prince, the controversial founder of the private military company Blackwater and a supporter of Donald Trump, is reportedly seeking to purchase drone companies in Ukraine. As the conflict has highlighted the strategic importance of unmanned aerial vehicles, Prince is said to be aggressively pitching his services and looking for acquisition opportunities within Ukraine's valuable drone sector. This move comes amid discussions in the Trump administration about potentially using private contractors in a postwar Ukraine. Prince's history of seeking profit from conflict zones and his past attempts to secure business in Ukraine have made some industry players wary of his intentions.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is actively encouraging public school students to recite the Lord's Prayer, following the implementation of a new state law allowing time for prayer and religious readings. This stance is contrasted with his actions in 2017, when his office raised concerns about a prayer room used by Muslim students in a Frisco high school, suggesting it was exclusionary. Critics accuse Paxton of promoting a specific brand of Christian nationalism and violating the constitutional separation of church and state. His actions are seen as an attempt to appeal to his conservative base ahead of a potential U.S. Senate run.</p>

          <p>The head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), William Pulte, is facing scrutiny for his unusual and direct involvement in a criminal referral against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud. Former officials and experts describe the move as "bizarre," noting that such investigations are typically handled independently by the agency's inspector general to avoid political influence. Pulte, a Trump appointee, accused Cook of misrepresenting her primary residence on mortgage applications, an allegation her lawyers call a "clerical error." Critics suggest the referral is politically motivated, as President Trump has used it as a basis to try to fire Cook from the Fed.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent proposal to welcome more Chinese students to the U.S. is being interpreted by political science experts as a strategic maneuver rather than a genuine policy shift. Analysts suggest the move is likely part of a broader negotiation strategy with China, aimed at creating a more positive atmosphere before a potential meeting with President Xi Jinping. Given the prevailing skepticism towards China in the U.S. and the lack of concrete changes to visa procedures, experts caution against viewing this as a fundamental change in relations. The gesture is seen as superficial and tactical in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>The first human case of New World screwworm in the U.S. in over 50 years, found in a traveler returning from El Salvador, highlights a growing threat to American agriculture. The parasitic fly, which lays eggs in the wounds of warm-blooded animals, had been eradicated in North America and held back by a biological barrier in Panama. However, it has resurged through Central America and into Mexico, threatening the U.S. cattle industry with billions of dollars in potential losses. The USDA is investing in new facilities to produce sterile flies to combat the spread, but climate change and modern industrial farming present new challenges to these decades-old control methods.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has voiced concerns about the political "balance" of the UK's Labour cabinet following the resignation of Angela Rayner as Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary. Rayner's exit, prompted by an issue with underpaid stamp duty, has triggered a major government reshuffle and a separate contest for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party. Burnham suggested the contest is an opportunity to discuss the party's internal management and advocated for a new deputy leader from the north of England to counter a perceived "London centricity." He also criticized the party for punishing MPs who dissent from the government line.</p>

It also highlights the use of emergency powers and personal dealmaking to enact policy, rewarding allies and punishing opponents.

          <p>Despite massive investment and stock market growth driven by the artificial intelligence sector, evidence suggests AI is not yet delivering significant real-world productivity benefits for businesses. A recent study found that experienced software developers were actually slower when using AI tools, highlighting a "capability-reliability gap" where AI systems lack the consistency required for professional settings. The article warns that this disconnect between hype and reality could indicate an economic bubble, propped up by a few tech giants. If this bubble were to burst, the resulting market correction could trigger a broader economic downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

While 147 nations already recognize Palestine, key Western powers have historically withheld recognition pending a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel. However, the ongoing war in Gaza has prompted several European countries, including Spain, Ireland, Norway, and now potentially France, to change their stance. The United States continues to use its veto power in the UN Security Council to block Palestine's bid for full UN membership, which remains a significant obstacle.</p>
