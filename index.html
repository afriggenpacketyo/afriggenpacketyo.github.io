          <p>Forest and fire officials in Washington state and Oregon are facing challenges in planning for the upcoming wildfire season due to Trump administration funding cuts and a loss of federal workers. The Forest Service workforce was reduced as part of the Department of Government Efficiency, leading to a loss of experienced and trained personnel. Senators Murray and Merkley are raising concerns about the impact on frontline support for firefighting crews, as trail maintenance crews and biologists also play essential roles in fire operations. The Department of Interior claims funding is not in jeopardy, but officials warn that people are the critical component in successfully managing wildfires.</p>

          <p>According to German news weekly Der Spiegel, Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, known as the "Butcher of Lyon," played a significant role in establishing a major South American drug cartel. Living under the alias Klaus Altmann, Barbie served as a security advisor to drug baron Roberto Suarez in the 1970s, providing expertise in security, military strategy, and secret service work. Barbie also advised the Bolivian security services and helped set up a death squad for dictator Luis Garcia Meza. Additionally, he facilitated collaboration between Suarez's cartel and Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, having been recruited as an anti-communist agent by American Secret Services after the war.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a warning to the public regarding the dangers of products containing tianeptine, often called "gas station heroin" due to its availability in gas stations. Tianeptine, an opioid alternative prescribed as an antidepressant in some countries, is not FDA-approved for use in the U.S. and can lead to serious harm, including death. The FDA commissioner expressed concern about the risk these products pose, especially to young people, and emphasized the importance of public awareness, and the FDA has previously issued warnings and recalls for products containing tianeptine.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced another air traffic control outage, this time lasting approximately 90 seconds, which follows a week of issues for travelers in New Jersey. This incident occurred shortly after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the Trump administration's plan to modernize the U.S. air traffic control system. United Airlines has been limiting flights to and from Newark due to the ongoing problems. The FAA insists that Newark airspace remains safe, but the outages are causing delays as traffic is slowed.</p>

          <p>Real estate analysts are observing a notable decrease in apartment renter turnover in large urban markets. Traditionally, about half of apartment renters in these areas move when their leases expire, but current turnover is around 30%. Factors contributing to this trend include an unaffordable for-sale market, limited rental supply, economic uncertainty, moving costs, and a preference for larger suburban apartments. This low turnover allows landlords to increase renewal pricing and improves cash flow due to reduced turnover expenses, such as repairs and cleaning.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the United States have reached a trade agreement that includes tariffs, signaling that tariffs are likely to remain a key component of U.S. trade policy. Under the agreement, the U.K. can export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% tariff rate, while steel and aluminum exports will be tariff-free. However, a 10% baseline tariff will apply to all other goods imported from the U.K. Analysts suggest that this deal sets a precedent for future trade agreements, with a minimum 10% tariff likely to be imposed on most goods from other trading partners.</p>

          <p>Republicans are exploring Medicaid spending cuts to advance President Trump's agenda, but options are dwindling. House Speaker Mike Johnson has ruled out significant cuts to the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion. The primary remaining option, limiting states' use of a tax loophole to boost federal Medicaid funding, would largely impact poorer, Southern states. These states could face budget shortfalls, potentially leading to reduced health insurance coverage or cuts to hospital payments. The final budget package is expected to require one of these substantial cuts to meet Republican goals, with Medicaid's financing system at the center of the debate.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a retired Supreme Court Justice appointed by President George H.W. Bush, passed away at the age of 85. Souter, known for his independent and often liberal-leaning decisions, became a key figure on the court's liberal wing during his tenure. His 1992 vote to uphold Roe v. Wade, along with Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, angered conservatives. In retirement, Souter cautioned against ignorance of government, warning it could undermine democracy.</p>

          <p>Two men, Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers, have been convicted of criminal damage for cutting down the iconic Sycamore Gap tree in northern England. The Sycamore Gap tree was a prized landmark located along Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland National Park, made famous by Kevin Costner’s film “Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.” Prosecutors used digital evidence, including a video found on Graham's phone, to prove the pair were at the site on the night the tree was felled, despite both men denying involvement.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed lukewarm support for raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans while simultaneously suggesting that Republicans should likely oppose the idea. This comes after Trump considered adding a tax hike on high earners to the GOP's major tax and spending bill. While acknowledging he would "graciously accept" a small tax increase for the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers, Trump cautioned against it due to potential political backlash, referencing George H.W. Bush's broken promise.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 and intended to land on Venus, is predicted to crash back to Earth after spending 53 years in orbit.

While experts say the risk of the half-ton object hitting someone is low, it is not entirely excluded. The object's construction to withstand Venus' atmosphere means it may survive reentry, presenting a potential hazard.</p>
