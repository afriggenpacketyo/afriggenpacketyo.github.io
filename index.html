          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed erupting, sending spectacular fountains of lava high into the air. The eruption is currently contained within the Halemaumau summit crater, posing no threat to residential areas and creating a stunning natural display for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists are closely monitoring the activity as part of an ongoing eruption pattern, while Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners view the event with reverence, connecting it to the volcano goddess Pele.</p>

          <p>Utility bills are increasing in some states, with electricity costs up 5.5% and natural gas up 13.8% over the last year. Experts attribute the rise primarily to a surge in energy demand driven by AI data centers, electrified transportation, and post-pandemic economic activity, rather than a shift to renewables. The article explains that challenges in expanding the energy transmission infrastructure to connect new power sources to the grid are a major bottleneck, leading to higher costs for consumers as supply struggles to meet demand.</p>

          <p>Japan is expanding its defense collaborations with nations like the United Kingdom, as evidenced by recent joint military exercises involving F-35B fighter jets operating from a Japanese warship. Analysts suggest that perceived mixed signals from the United States are prompting Japan to diversify its security ties to better address regional challenges, particularly concerning China. These multinational drills, which also included the U.S., Australia, Spain, and Norway, aim to enhance tactical integration and demonstrate allied strength in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Applications for the T visa, a form of legal protection for immigrant survivors of human trafficking, have sharply increased, but so have processing times and the risk of deportation. While the visa offers a path to safety and a green card for those who assist law enforcement, wait times have grown to nearly 20 months. A policy change allowing for removal proceedings after a denial has heightened fear among applicants, even as recent updates aim to provide earlier access to benefits while cases are pending.</p>

Doctors highlight that these health issues disproportionately affect vulnerable communities and advocate for broader climate-related training for medical professionals to better protect patients on a larger scale.</p>

          <p>Advisors to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are exploring new regulations to reduce the significant amount of food waste generated by all-you-can-eat hotel buffets and traditional large breakfasts. With an estimated 8.7 million tons of food discarded annually in the country, policymakers are considering measures that would encourage more à la carte dining options. The goal is to allow guests to choose what they want rather than being served a vast, standardized array of dishes, much of which goes uneaten.</p>

          <p>Rail operator CrossCountry is warning of major travel disruptions over the bank holiday weekend due to a strike by members of the RMT union. The industrial action will result in a severely reduced timetable, with no trains running on Saturday and very limited service on Monday. The RMT union states the strike is due to the company's failure to honor agreements on staffing, safety, and pay. While the operator says it is committed to talks, passengers are advised to seek refunds or alter travel plans.</p>

          <p>A major political battle over congressional redistricting is escalating between Texas and California, with significant implications for the 2026 midterm elections. After the Republican-led Texas legislature passed a new map to create five more GOP-favored districts, California's Democratic lawmakers countered with a plan to redraw their own map to add five Democratic seats. This article explains the process of gerrymandering and why this unusual mid-decade effort to reallocate political power could spread to other states and shape control of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, named the youngest self-made woman billionaire after her stake in Scale AI soared in value, maintains a rigorous and demanding daily routine. The 30-year-old entrepreneur's schedule includes 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, double workout sessions, and often working through lunch. Guo, now CEO of the content platform Passes, advocates for a 90-hour work week for new founders, arguing that such an intense commitment is necessary to get a company off the ground, a view that reflects a controversial "always-on" Silicon Valley work culture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese defense researchers have developed a new military data link system designed for the extreme conditions of large-scale hypersonic combat. The system reportedly achieves time synchronization accuracy within five nanoseconds, a capability that far exceeds NATO's current Link 16 system. This technological leap enables secure, real-time coordination between multiple hypersonic platforms, ground command, and intelligence assets. Experts suggest this innovation could create a fully networked strike ecosystem, potentially shifting the strategic balance of military power.</p>

          <p>Following an FBI raid on the home of former national security adviser John Bolton, Donald Trump's ex-attorney Michael Cohen offered blunt advice, saying Bolton needs to "lawyer up." Cohen, who experienced a similar raid in 2018, predicts that Bolton will be indicted in connection with a resumed investigation into whether his 2020 memoir contained classified information. Cohen framed the raid as Trump crossing another name off his "enemies list," suggesting it is a form of political retribution.</p>

Fahey's mobility was key throughout the game as he evaded a formidable Santa Margarita defensive line, ultimately securing the win for his team in what felt like a playoff-level matchup.</p>
