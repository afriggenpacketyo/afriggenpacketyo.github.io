          <p>The Children's Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, is urging the government to enact a total ban on AI applications that create sexually explicit images of children, particularly those used for "nudification". Dame Rachel argues these apps disproportionately target girls and young women, causing them to avoid online engagement to mitigate the risk of being victimized. While the government has announced laws to combat AI-generated child sexual abuse material, the commissioner argues it doesn't go far enough. The call comes amid a rise in reported cases of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive protection measures.</p>

This strategy aims to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities amid ongoing warfare and fluctuating international support. The program underscores Ukraine's effort to maintain its position in the conflict even in the face of potential reductions in external military assistance.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley is reintroducing the "PELOSI Act," which aims to prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from trading stocks while in office. The bill would allow investments in diversified mutual funds, ETFs, and U.S. Treasury bonds, but restrict individual stock ownership. This proposal gains traction as President Trump expresses support for such a ban, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also backs the idea. If passed, lawmakers would have 180 days to comply, with violations resulting in profit forfeiture and potential fines.</p>
