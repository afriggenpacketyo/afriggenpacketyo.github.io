          <p>Tiffany Slaton, a Georgia woman, went missing in the Sierra Nevada mountains after being trapped by an avalanche and suffering a fall. Unable to call for help due to a lack of cell service, she relied on her nutrition knowledge and foraging skills to survive. Slaton sustained herself for weeks by eating wild leeks, which are abundant in the Sierra, and melting snow for water. She was eventually found in a cabin by the owner of Vermilion Valley Resort, just a day before her 28th birthday, and said that if she had not been found then, her body would have been discovered in the cabin instead.</p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City on Saturday evening, resulting in injuries to at least 22 crew members, three of whom were seriously hurt. The ship, which was on a goodwill visit and carrying over 200 people, lost the top of two masts in the incident. New York City Mayor Eric Adams confirmed that the bridge did not sustain any structural damage, and the New York Police Department advised residents to avoid the surrounding areas due to heavy traffic and emergency vehicle presence. The Mexican Navy has launched an investigation into the incident, while the New York Police Department believes mechanical issues and a power cut may have contributed to the collision.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide, returned to Rwanda following the seizure of key parts of the region by Rwandan-backed rebels. The repatriation, organized by the U.N. refugee agency, involved mostly women and children, who crossed the border in buses provided by Rwandan authorities. These refugees were among the hundreds of thousands of Hutus who fled Rwanda after the genocide, and the Rwandan government aims to repatriate 2,000 people in total, adding to the more than 101,000 refugees already repatriated over the past decade. The returnees will receive emergency assistance and support for reintegration into Rwandan society.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic tour through the Middle East has underscored a shift in American foreign policy, with Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu taking a backseat to negotiations with Gulf states. Trump's actions, including shaking hands with Syria's new leader and lifting sanctions, have been interpreted as a departure from the long-standing U.S. approach of prioritizing Israel's interests in the region. While the U.S. maintains its support for Israel, Trump's focus on negotiating peace deals with Iran and Yemen, and securing business deals with Gulf nations, signals a new dynamic where Israel is no longer the central player.</p>

          <p>Despite public regret over Brexit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces strong media opposition as he cautiously seeks to improve relations with the European Union. Tabloid newspapers are fiercely critical of any rapprochement, using terms like "surrender summit" and accusing Starmer of betraying the wishes of Brexit voters. This hostile media landscape, combined with the lingering political divisions caused by Brexit, makes it difficult for Starmer to communicate the benefits of closer ties with the EU, even as the U.S.'s commitment to European security becomes less certain.</p>

          <p>Five years after Brexit, Britain and the European Union are cautiously moving towards renewed cooperation, driven by a shared concern over the United States' changing global role. A summit in London is expected to yield a defense and security agreement to bolster European military security, alongside plans to ease food trade regulations and enhance energy cooperation. While disagreements persist over fishing rights and youth travel, the overarching theme is how to navigate a world where the U.S. is pulling back, emphasizing the need for partnership amidst geopolitical turbulence. Experts suggest that while the rapprochement is largely symbolic, it underscores the importance of Britain being linked to European schemes for security purposes.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Kateryna is the sole female combat pilot in the Ukrainian military, flying helicopter missions against Russian troops. Despite an increase in women serving in the Ukrainian armed forces, sexism remains a significant obstacle, with deeply rooted stereotypes among male commanders. Kateryna, who flies an Mi-8 helicopter, says she often finds her abilities doubted but is respected by other pilots and commanders who now recognize her skills. The article highlights the challenges women face in the military, including a lack of appropriate uniforms and persistent marginalization, despite their willingness to serve in combat roles.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart after the retail giant warned that his tariffs would force it to raise prices, asserting that the company could absorb the costs without passing them on to consumers. Walmart, in response, reiterated its commitment to keeping prices as low as possible but cautioned that it would not be able to "absorb all the pressure" imposed by the tariffs. Economists note that businesses must choose between raising prices and laying off workers, and that tariffs will inevitably drive prices up.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent tour of the Gulf region has drawn attention to the deals made during the trip, both for U.S. companies and for the former president himself. Experts have raised concerns about Trump's acceptance of overseas gifts and targeted investments, describing them as "unprecedented" and potentially blurring the lines between U.S. foreign policy and personal financial gain. Simultaneously, agreements struck by major U.S. companies have been noted for diverging from the current administration's policies, particularly regarding the sale of advanced technology.</p>

The band's song, "What the Hell Just Happened," was praised for its musical craftsmanship but criticized for its manic and inconsistent style. Despite a spirited performance and support from Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst, the song failed to resonate with the public vote. The article suggests that the UK needs to find a way to get the public vote back on side and maintain a positive attitude toward the contest.</p>
