          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that ending the war in Ukraine will require concessions from both Kyiv and Moscow. Following a summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, Rubio indicated that while no final deal is imminent, enough progress was made to justify further talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. He emphasized that a lasting peace agreement must address security guarantees for Ukraine and the delineation of territory, acknowledging that neither side can expect to achieve all its objectives in a negotiated settlement. The administration's goal is to create a scenario where a final agreement can be reached to end the ongoing conflict.</p>

Supported by an international network of nonprofits and medical professionals, Dr. Kamara recently performed the country's first-ever spine surgery at Connaught Hospital, overcoming challenges like frequent power outages. His journey from a childhood marked by civil war to becoming a pivotal medical figure highlights a grassroots effort to build a sustainable neurosurgery program from scratch. The initiative is seen as a catalyst for broader improvements in the nation's healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. While its maximum sustained winds have decreased, the hurricane's overall size has grown, prompting a tropical storm warning for the Turks and Caicos Islands and bringing heavy rain and swells to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that can lead to temporary weakening followed by potential re-intensification. Forecast models predict Erin will remain offshore of the U.S. East Coast but could still generate dangerous rip currents along the Southeast.</p>

The event has drawn attention to AFib, an irregular and often rapid heart rhythm that affects millions and can increase the risk of stroke and other complications. Medical experts explain that while the condition is serious, it is often manageable with treatments like cardiac ablation, which has a high success rate.</p>

Investigators recovered at least 36 shell casings, suggesting multiple firearms were used by the assailants, who remain at large. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch noted that while such events are tragic, overall shooting incidents in the city are at a record low for the year.</p>

          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze was disallowed by VAR during a Premier League match against Chelsea, leaving many viewers confused. The decision was made based on a specific rule in the Laws of the Game regarding defensive walls. According to Law 13, when three or more defenders form a wall, all attacking players must be at least one meter away from it when the kick is taken. A Palace player was found to be inside this one-meter zone, leading the referee to correctly nullify the goal and award an indirect free-kick to Chelsea.</p>

          <p>The recent corruption investigations into several high-ranking officials from ethnic minority communities in China, such as Qizhala from Tibet and Liu Hui from Ningxia, signal a significant policy shift. Historically, top government posts in autonomous regions were reserved for non-Han officials as a gesture of ethnic inclusion, and they were rarely targeted in anti-graft campaigns. Observers suggest that these recent downfalls indicate that Beijing is intensifying its push for political discipline across the board. This change implies that ethnicity-based leniency within the Communist Party's elite political structures is no longer a given.</p>

The case went cold for over two decades until a breakthrough in 2014 using genetic genealogy pointed investigators toward Miller. The timeline covers the initial crimes against Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, Miller's earlier violent history, the cold case investigation, and the undercover sting operation at a Chili's restaurant that secured his DNA.

          <p>Investigators captured Bryan Patrick Miller, the "Phoenix Canal Killer," through an elaborate undercover sting at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. Cold case detective Clark Schwartzkopf posed as a security consultant and offered Miller a fake job to arrange a meeting. The goal was to covertly obtain Miller's DNA from a used drinking glass to compare it with evidence from the 1990s crime scenes. Despite the detective's initial doubts about the mild-mannered Miller, the DNA from the glass provided a perfect match to the killer. This crucial evidence led directly to the arrest of Miller, who was also a local personality known as the "Zombie Hunter."</p>

          <p>During his trial, Bryan Patrick Miller's defense team admitted he was the "Phoenix Canal Killer" but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity.

His lawyers claimed he had no memory of the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. Prosecutors countered this by highlighting his memory of other violent acts and testimony from his ex-wife about his deviant behavior, ultimately leading to a guilty verdict and a death sentence.</p>

The Fed faces a dilemma between cutting rates to support a potentially softening labor market and holding firm or raising them to combat persistent inflation.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Russian President Vladimir Putin gained a strategic advantage from his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Anchorage. The author contends that Trump returned empty-handed, failing to secure his primary goal of a ceasefire and instead accepting Putin's position that a comprehensive peace deal must come first. Putin's offer to freeze the frontline in exchange for Ukraine ceding the entire Donbas region is framed as a diplomatic trap that puts pressure on Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. The analysis concludes that the summit sowed further mistrust between the U.S. and its European allies, emboldened Putin, and left Ukraine's defense more reliant on European support.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates a significant portion of the German public anticipates the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party into executive power. According to the survey for Bild am Sonntag, 43% of respondents expect the AfD to appoint a state premier by 2026, with 68% believing it will happen within the next few months. The poll reflects the AfD's sustained strength in national surveys, where it consistently challenges the mainstream parties. The findings also show a divided opinion on the "firewall" policy, where established parties refuse to form coalitions with the AfD, with 47% supporting it and 40% opposing it.</p>

Upon returning to his Beijing home from overseas, she found the house sealed and empty, with most of his valuable possessions and artworks also missing. Fan Zeng announced his marriage to Xu Meng, a 37-year-old TV presenter, last year following the death of his previous wife.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Community violence prevention leaders are criticizing President Trump's call for a militarized law enforcement response to crime in major cities, arguing it disregards decades of progress made by community-led initiatives. Advocates like Aqeela Sherrills state that safety is created through investment in local infrastructure and programs, not just reactive policing. They point to the success of violence intervention models that work directly with individuals most at risk, which have led to documented reductions in homicides in cities like Baltimore and Oakland. The advocates argue the administration's focus on a punitive approach, coupled with recent cuts to federal funding for their programs, will ultimately be ineffective.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Department of Justice's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell case, stating they contain no significant new information and that the public would be "disappointed and misled." This decision has intensified public frustration and speculation about a cover-up, shifting focus to other investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein that the Trump administration could release but has not. Critics and victims' advocates argue that the Attorney General and FBI Director have the power to release these non-grand jury documents, which could hold a "treasure trove" of information, but are choosing not to for political reasons.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by more than 10,000 flight attendants that caused over 700 cancellations. The Canadian Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) ordered the staff back to work and extended their expired collective agreement until a new one is reached through binding arbitration mandated by the Jobs Minister. The union, which is seeking higher salaries and pay for ground time, accused the government of "caving to corporate pressure" and violating workers' rights. The airline has advised that it will take several days to fully stabilize its flight schedule.</p>

          <p>China has lodged a strong complaint with Japan after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering and several cabinet members visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine. The shrine honors Japan's war dead, including convicted Class-A war criminals from World War II, making such visits highly contentious for neighboring countries like China and South Korea. Beijing condemned the tributes, which occurred on the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender, as a "blatant provocation against historical justice." The Chinese foreign ministry urged Japan to reflect on its history of aggression and sever ties with militarism to maintain stable regional relations.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic-era fortress on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been painstakingly renovated into a luxury retreat now on the market for £3 million. Former software entrepreneur Mike Conner purchased the abandoned fort in 2017 and spent nearly five years and a significant investment to make it habitable, overcoming immense logistical challenges like installing running water and electricity. The historic building, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, now features 40 beds, modern amenities, and even a nightclub. Conner hopes the unique, off-grid property will be enjoyed by its next owner, suggesting it has potential as a tourist attraction or exclusive event space.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink has revealed that creating vision boards was a crucial tool in her mental and physical recovery from a torn ACL. The practice, introduced by veteran teammate Dearica Hamby, helped the former Stanford star stay positive and focused during her 13-month rehabilitation. By visualizing her goals—from Olympic rings to simply being a good teammate—Brink was able to combat the anxiety and doubt associated with the long recovery process. This "mental rehearsal" allowed her to return to the court with confidence, making an immediate impact and demonstrating the power of a positive, intentional mindset in overcoming significant athletic setbacks.</p>

          <p>Germany has suspended its humanitarian visa program, potentially preventing around 300 Russians and Belarusians fleeing political persecution from entering the country. The move affects activists, journalists, and Kremlin critics who had already been approved by the German Foreign Office but are now blocked by the Interior Ministry. Among those affected is Alexei Moskalev, who was prosecuted after his young daughter drew an anti-war picture at school. Advocacy groups warn that these individuals are at risk of extradition or abduction if they remain in neighboring former Soviet countries, and they are urging Germany to make exceptions for urgent cases.</p>
