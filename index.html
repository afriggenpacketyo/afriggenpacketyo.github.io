          <p>Over 150 unvaccinated students from two South Carolina schools are under a mandatory 21-day quarantine following measles exposures, state health officials confirmed. This local outbreak contributes to a national surge, with the U.S. reporting over 1,563 measles cases this year—the highest number since 1992, alongside 44 reported outbreaks. The alarming increase is directly linked to declining MMR vaccination rates, which have fallen significantly nationwide to 92.5% for kindergarteners, leaving an estimated 286,000 vulnerable. This article underscores a critical public health crisis driven by reduced immunity and the potential for widespread infection in susceptible populations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have made a strategic adjustment to their pitching rotation for the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, delaying Shohei Ohtani's next start. Manager Dave Roberts announced Yoshinobu Yamamoto will start Game 2, allowing Ohtani additional time to focus on his hitting after a challenging offensive performance in the NL Division Series. This move aims to optimize the team's pitching by keeping Yamamoto on his regular rest schedule for a potential Game 6, while Ohtani works to "recalibrate" at the plate. The article details how this decision, while sacrificing a second Ohtani start, is crucial for the team's overall World Series aspirations and player performance.</p>

          <p>A prominent Christian pastor, Ezra Jin, and dozens of staff and members from the Zion Church, a large "underground house church" in China, have been arrested by Chinese authorities. Jin, whose daughter is a U.S. citizen, was detained at his home, with some individuals facing criminal charges for "illegal dissemination of religious information via the internet." This severe crackdown follows previous government actions against unregistered churches, which the Chinese Communist Party views as foreign-influenced threats to its control. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have strongly condemned the arrests, calling for their immediate release and highlighting profound concerns over religious freedom.</p>

          <p>Southern California is preparing for a "winter-like" storm, expected to bring significant rainfall from late Monday through Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Forecasts predict three-quarters to 1½ inches of rain, with mountain and foothill areas potentially receiving up to 3½ inches, raising concerns for commuters. Burn areas are under a flood watch due to anticipated rainfall rates of half an inch or more per hour, posing a risk of debris flows. This early-season storm's arrival coincides with the official return of La Niña, a climate pattern typically associated with drought, which could still mean a drier-than-average winter overall.</p>

While hundreds of thousands of federal employees face unpaid leave or work without pay, the Trump administration made a notable exception for military personnel, securing funds for their wages this week. This article highlights the escalating political standoff and its increasingly severe consequences for federal workers and essential government services.</p>
