          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, facing scrutiny over his administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs within military academies. Recent policy changes, including the disbanding of student clubs and removal of books related to diversity, race, and gender issues from academy libraries, have drawn criticism from former West Point teachers and military members. These critics argue that such programs are essential for fostering a well-rounded education and do not inhibit the values of the academies. Protests were planned during the ceremony to voice opposition to these changes.</p>

          <p>President Trump has given the green light to the merger between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, reversing the previous administration's decision to block the acquisition based on national security concerns. Trump stated that the partnership would create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with U.S. Steel's headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh. The decision led to a significant surge in U.S. Steel's stock price. Trump plans to hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh to celebrate the deal.</p>

          <p>In a bid to combat the drastic decline of Florida's coral reefs, scientists are implementing a large-scale restoration project by planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles. The Florida Keys have witnessed a staggering 90% loss in healthy coral cover over the past four decades, primarily due to climate change and record ocean heat. The project involves acclimatizing the corals in temperature-regulated seawater beds before distributing them to designated offshore sites, where their progress will be closely monitored. This initiative aims to identify resilient coral strains that can better withstand future environmental stressors and contribute to the recovery of the vital reef ecosystem.</p>

          <p>President Trump is weighing the possibility of taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. This move, supported by investor Bill Ackman, aims to release the firms from federal conservatorship, which some believe could improve their operations. However, critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren warn that privatization could benefit investors at the expense of homebuyers by driving up housing prices. The decision remains uncertain, with the administration evaluating the potential impact on the housing market and mortgage rates.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Evolutionary biologist Yara Haridy and her colleagues discovered that the anatomy of these ancient fish scales is remarkably similar to that of vertebrate teeth. This suggests that the ability to sense pressure and temperature, which causes toothaches, evolved from the sensory structures in the armor of these early fish. The finding sheds light on the evolutionary origins of our skeletons and explains why we experience tooth sensitivity.</p>

          <p>Royal Mail is under investigation by Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets, potentially leading to a fine. The company missed its targets for both first-class and second-class post, with a significant percentage of first-class mail arriving late. Citizens Advice has criticized Royal Mail for increasing stamp prices while failing to deliver on time. Royal Mail maintains that its universal service obligation needs reform, as the company is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK.</p>

The case centered on Ravec, the committee authorizing security for senior royals, which Harry believed had unfairly treated him. The government successfully argued that Ravec had carefully considered his security needs and offered a bespoke plan, which Harry deemed insufficient.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets in a 13-inning marathon, but the victory was overshadowed by concerns about their already depleted pitching staff. A rain delay shortened Clayton Kershaw's start, and the bullpen was forced to cover 11 innings. Despite the challenges, the Dodgers persevered, with Teoscar HernÃ¡ndez delivering a key RBI double in the 13th. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the strain on the pitching staff and the need to carefully manage their workload in the coming days.</p>
