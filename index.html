          <h2>US Economy Grew by an Unexpectedly Strong 3% in Second Quarter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 09:06:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States economy expanded at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, significantly exceeding analysts' expectations of 2.3%. This growth was largely driven by a strong rebound in consumer spending and a substantial decrease in imports, which positively affects the GDP calculation. The report also indicated that a key inflation metric, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, rose to 2.5%, remaining above the Federal Reserve's target. The robust data emerged just before a Federal Reserve meeting where interest rates were expected to remain unchanged, despite calls from the White House for a rate cut.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks has agreed to acquire Israeli identity security company CyberArk for approximately $25 billion. The deal values CyberArk at a 26% premium over its recent share price and is anticipated to close in fiscal year 2026. Palo Alto Networks aims to enter the identity security market, viewing it as a critical technology, especially with the advancement of artificial intelligence. This acquisition is part of a larger trend of major deals in the cybersecurity sector, following Google's significant purchase of Wiz earlier in the year.</p>

          <h2>Second-Quarter GDP Rebounds to 3%, but Trade Fluctuations May Skew the Figure</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy showed a 3% growth rate in the second quarter, a significant turnaround from the previous quarter's contraction. However, economists suggest this figure is distorted by large swings in international trade related to new tariffs. Imports surged early in the year as businesses stockpiled goods, artificially depressing first-quarter GDP, and then plummeted in the second quarter, making the growth appear more robust. When averaging the first half of the year, economic growth was about 1.25%, a slowdown from the previous two years, with some analysts projecting continued sluggishness.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that dental floss could be used as a novel vaccine delivery system. Research conducted on animal models demonstrated that floss coated with a vaccine can effectively release it through the tissue between teeth and gums. This method triggered a strong antibody response on mucosal surfaces, such as the nose and lungs, which is a key entry point for pathogens like influenza. While promising for its needle-free and easy administration, researchers note limitations, such as its unsuitability for those without teeth and the need for more study on its effects in humans.</p>

Similarly, Mexico developed a public alert system and holds national drills, while cities like Vancouver, Canada, are creating networks of 'Disaster Support Hubs' in public spaces to ensure community-led response and recovery.</p>

          <p>Prominent American companies are warning that impending tariffs will lead to significant financial burdens, with some estimating costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Stanley Black & Decker projects an $800 million annualized impact, while Conagra Brands expects a 3% rise in costs for goods, and Tesla has already seen a $300 million increase. These costs stem from higher import taxes on materials like steel and aluminum for packaging and components. While many companies are currently absorbing these expenses, economists caution that they may soon be passed on to consumers through higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The quake occurred on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the movement of tectonic plates can displace a massive column of water, generating waves that travel across the ocean at high speeds. Scientists noted that while powerful, this quake was less energetic than the 9.1-magnitude events that caused catastrophic tsunamis in Japan in 2011 and Indonesia in 2004.

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Allege US Satellite Fleet Poses a Threat to Space Safety</h2>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has criticized the Dove satellite constellation, operated by U.S. firm Planet Labs, as a collection of 'low-cost orbital landmines.' They argue that the hundreds of small, thruster-less CubeSats used for Earth imaging present a growing risk of in-space collisions and uncontrolled re-entry into the atmosphere. The researchers also claim that over 100 Dove satellites in public databases have incorrect or fabricated identification codes, making them difficult to track. Their analysis suggests the constellation, while innovative, may be turning low Earth orbit into a hazardous environment.</p>

          <p>In response to what they term an 'information crisis,' several major U.S. medical organizations are planning to issue their own vaccine recommendations. This move comes as federal health agencies under the new administration have altered guidance on COVID, flu, and RSV vaccines, sometimes against the advice of scientific panels. Groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists will use a comprehensive review of scientific literature to develop evidence-based guidance. They aim to provide clarity for the public and health insurers, ensuring that decisions are based on science rather than politics.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Robert Reich argues that a pattern of silencing media criticism of the current administration is emerging, threatening democratic principles. He cites the departure of columnist Eduardo Porter from The Washington Post, allegedly due to pressure from its owner, and the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show on CBS after he criticized the network's parent company, Paramount. Reich contends that corporate leaders are capitulating to pressure out of fear of retribution against their business interests. He warns that this trend extends to universities and represents a dangerous consolidation of power that stifles necessary public discourse.</p>

          <p>Stocks such as Kohl's and Krispy Kreme have recently experienced volatile trading, characteristic of 'meme stocks,' where price swings are driven by online forums rather than company fundamentals. These stocks are often household names, making it easier to generate widespread interest, and are typically heavily shorted by investors betting on a price decline. Retail traders then coordinate to drive the price up, forcing short sellers to buy back shares to cover their losses, which creates an intense feedback loop that further inflates the stock price.

          <p>An 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, one of the most powerful ever recorded, has triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific Ocean. Evacuation orders were issued in parts of Japan, Russia, and Hawaii, although most have since been downgraded to advisories as initial waves were smaller than feared. In Russia, waves up to four meters high flooded a port and damaged a fish processing facility. The event has prompted a massive, coordinated response from warning centers and emergency agencies across multiple countries to monitor the ongoing threat of strong currents and subsequent waves.</p>

          <p>Total mortgage application volume in the U.S. has dropped to its lowest level since May, declining 3.8% in the last week. The decrease was seen in both purchase and refinance applications, with purchase applications falling 6% for the week. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the dip is driven less by stable but high interest rates and more by consumer uncertainty about the economy and job market. This hesitation is causing prospective homebuyers to delay major financial decisions, despite slowing home-price growth and increasing for-sale inventory in many areas. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement reportedly includes commitments for the EU to purchase $750 billion in strategic commodities like gas, oil, and AI chips from the U.S., as well as invest an additional $600 billion. Analysts suggest this shows Europe's continued reliance on the U.S. for security and strategic goods, and also aligns the two powers more closely on issues related to China.</p>

The company's stock fell as it also revealed a slowdown in sales, particularly among first-time buyers who are facing affordability constraints due to higher interest rates.

          <p>The Trump administration plans to overturn a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finding that greenhouse gases are harmful to human health and should be regulated. This move would dismantle the legal foundation for a wide range of climate regulations, including rules pushing automakers to produce cleaner and more fuel-efficient vehicles. The administration argues the EPA lacks the authority to regulate these emissions, a conclusion based partly on a report from scientists who reject the consensus on climate change. Health advocates warn this reversal could lead to worse air quality and be a major setback in efforts to combat climate change.</p>

          <p>Recent legislation enacting a $1 trillion cut to Medicaid represents the culmination of decades of conservative efforts to reduce the scope of America's largest public health programs. Since their creation in 1965 as part of a civil rights-era push to desegregate healthcare and fight poverty, Medicare and Medicaid have faced ideological opposition. Critics argue the cuts are unconscionable and will lead to nearly 12 million people losing Medicaid coverage. The move reverses a long history of expansion, most recently under the Affordable Care Act, and is expected to disproportionately impact low-income individuals and rural hospitals.</p>
