          <p>A federal judge has barred the Trump administration from using National Guard and other military troops for domestic law enforcement activities in California. The ruling by Judge Charles Breyer found that the deployment willfully violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a law that restricts the military's role in civilian matters. While the injunction is limited to California and has been temporarily stayed to allow for an appeal, the judge warned that such actions could lead to the creation of "a national police force with the President as its chief."</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 economists, including several Nobel laureates, have co-signed an open letter defending Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and the central bank's institutional independence. The letter responds to President Trump's attempt to remove Cook from her position over unproven allegations, an action the signatories argue threatens the credibility of U.S. monetary policy. They emphasize that the Federal Reserve was designed to be insulated from day-to-day politics to ensure stable economic decision-making.</p>

          <p>British comedy writer Graham Linehan was arrested at London's Heathrow Airport in connection with social media posts that were critical of transgender activists. Linehan stated he was met by armed officers and questioned about posts on X, one of which suggested punching trans-identified males in female-only spaces. The arrest has sparked a significant backlash from free speech advocates and public figures like J.K. Rowling, who condemned the action as totalitarian and disproportionate.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun calling up thousands of reservists as it prepares to launch a major offensive to conquer Gaza City, which it describes as a Hamas stronghold. Ground forces are already advancing on the city's outskirts amid heavy bombardment, leading to dozens of Palestinian casualties reported by local hospitals. The United Nations has warned that a full-scale assault would be "beyond catastrophic" for the nearly one million civilians who remain in the area, with a famine already confirmed to be occurring.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times op-ed, nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have sharply criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership. They argue that his recent actions, including the firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez, are "endangering every American's health" by politicizing the agency and undermining the nation's public health system. The former leaders, who served under both Democratic and Republican presidents, called on Congress to exercise its oversight authority.</p>

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling that deemed many of the Trump administration's tariffs illegal has created significant uncertainty for the shipping industry and the U.S. government. The decision could potentially require the refund of billions of dollars in trade duties collected from businesses, though a stay is in place pending a likely appeal to the Supreme Court. For now, logistics professionals report that shippers are in a holding pattern, awaiting a final decision before making any changes to their operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The parliament in Burkina Faso has passed a new law that prohibits "homosexual practices," with punishments including prison sentences of up to five years and financial penalties. The legislation, which takes effect immediately, has been condemned by human rights organizations like Amnesty International as an "alarming setback." This move makes the West African nation, which has been governed by a military junta since 2022, the latest country on the continent to enact harsh anti-LGBTQ+ legislation.</p>

          <p>The continued strategic alignment between Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping is, paradoxically, helping to hold the Western alliance system together, according to an analysis in The Atlantic. Despite President Trump's disruptive approach to traditional alliances, China has failed to improve its ties with Europe and other U.S. partners due to its hardline stance on trade and its support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. By continuing to treat the democratic world as a unified adversary, Beijing and Moscow are reinforcing the very cohesion they seek to undermine.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to potentially pay a 0% tax rate on long-term capital gains, thanks to new deductions in President Trump's recent tax legislation. The 0% bracket applies to individuals with taxable income below certain thresholds, which more investors may now fall into due to a higher standard deduction and other new tax breaks. This allows for strategies like "tax-gain harvesting," where profitable assets are sold without triggering taxes during lower-income years. (not investment advice)</p>
