          <p>A New York Times article explores the science behind mRNA vaccines, their safety, and their potential in medicine, noting that these vaccines, crucial for combating COVID-19 and RSV, face political backlash and funding cuts despite their promise for treating cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune disorders. Scientists discovered mRNA in 1961 and have been studying its potential ever since. The article highlights the vaccines' ability to quickly adapt to new virus strains, but also addresses concerns about long-term effects and potential impacts on DNA, clarifying that mRNA cannot alter a person's DNA. The article conveys cautious optimism, acknowledging the technology's potential while recognizing the challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for condemned inmates are claiming that the execution of Mikal Mahdi by firing squad in South Carolina was botched, causing prolonged suffering. A pathologist hired by the attorneys found that the bullets missed their target, resulting in Mahdi remaining conscious and in extreme pain for up to a minute after the shots were fired. Witnesses reported hearing Mahdi cry out and groan after the shots. The official autopsy lacked detailed examination and verification, raising concerns about the training and oversight of the firing squad. The state allows condemned inmates to choose their method of execution.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that 28 major U.S. cities, including New York, Dallas, and Seattle, are sinking, posing a threat to infrastructure. The sinking is largely due to groundwater extraction, with at least 20% of urban areas in each city affected. Researchers warn that even slight downward shifts can compromise the structural integrity of buildings, roads, and dams. The study emphasizes that the damage may only become evident when it's severe or catastrophic, especially in rapidly expanding urban centers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses different types of bankruptcy and alternatives for managing debt, noting that no type of bankruptcy eliminates every debt. Chapter 7 bankruptcy offers the most comprehensive debt relief by eliminating many unsecured debts like credit cards and medical bills, but requires passing an income-based means test. Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves a structured repayment plan over three to five years, suitable for those with higher incomes or wanting to protect assets. Alternatives like debt consolidation, debt management, and debt settlement are also discussed as options to ease debt burdens without court filings.</p>

          <p>The European Union is planning to increase pressure on the United States by considering tariffs on $107 billion worth of American goods, including agricultural products like soybeans and manufactured goods like airplane parts, in response to duties imposed by the Trump administration.

European officials hope to negotiate to avoid lasting tariffs, but are preparing for a long-term rebalancing of trade relations.

          <p>Apple is requesting a court to pause a recent decision in its case against Epic Games that would require it to allow developers to link out to external payment options, arguing the changes will cost the company substantial sums. Apple claims the ruling is punitive and that it has complied with the court's order, which prevents Apple from restricting app developers from choosing the language or placement of those links. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney stated that the ruling forces Apple to compete, while Apple says developers are already using the order to reduce consumer choice.</p>

          <p>Rwanda repatriated ten of its citizens who were trafficked to Southeast Asia for work, only to find themselves in dire conditions. The government intervened after the Rwandans, trapped in Myanmar and Laos, sought help from a social media influencer. The victims were lured by job scams that promised opportunities abroad. Authorities are concerned about illegal recruitment and human trafficking. Some Rwandans are reportedly trapped in Southeast Asia without communication means after their phones and passports were confiscated.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for maintaining interest rates at the Fed's May 7 meeting, calling him a "fool" for acting "too late" in cutting the central bank's benchmark rate. Trump inaccurately claimed there is "virtually NO INFLATION." Powell has stressed the Federal Reserve's independence, making decisions based on economic data rather than political pressure. The Bank of England, in contrast, cut its main interest rate amid concerns over the potential shock to global growth from Trump's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>A Michigan jury deadlocked in the trial of Christopher Schurr, a former police officer, who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya during a traffic stop in Grand Rapids in 2022, resulting in a mistrial. Schurr testified that he feared for his life when he opened fire after Lyoya grabbed his stun gun. The prosecution argued that Lyoya's actions did not pose a severe threat to Schurr. The central question was whether Schurr's use of deadly force was justified. Lyoya's death sparked protests and heightened racial tensions in Michigan.</p>

Grandparents provide benefits for kids, including better educational and mental health outcomes. The article also highlights the need for policymakers to support grandparents in these roles, especially as they increasingly step in to fill gaps in the child care system.</p>
