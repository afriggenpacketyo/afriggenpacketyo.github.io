          <p>The Trump administration informed several U.S. allies in the Middle East before Israel launched strikes on Iran.  Secretary of State Marco Rubio personally contacted these allies, emphasizing that the strikes weren't a U.S. operation and that the U.S. favored diplomacy.  The communication aimed to distance the U.S. from potential consequences, particularly concerning allies hosting U.S. forces.  Regional allies expressed concerns about a wider war and unintended consequences from the attacks.</p>
