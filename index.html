          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris was forced to close after a significant robbery on Sunday morning. Suspects broke into the Apollo Gallery, which houses the French crown jewels, stealing items of "inestimable heritage and historical value" before escaping on motorcycles. The French Interior Minister stated the theft took approximately seven minutes and involved at least three individuals who used a construction ladder to gain entry. The closure was implemented as a security measure to aid the police investigation and preserve evidence at the scene.</p>

His optimistic forecast comes as China's leadership prepares for a crucial party congress meeting to set the next five-year plan, amidst ongoing economic rivalry with the United States.

          <p>A Suzhou-based robotics company, MyActuator, has seen a dramatic increase in orders from American clients rushing to purchase goods before potential new tariffs take effect. The company reported receiving over 1,000 new orders in a single week, with clients explicitly citing the threat of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports as the reason for the emergency buys. This surge in demand has forced the company's factories to work overtime to fulfill the orders before the proposed deadline, highlighting the immediate supply chain impacts of trade policy rhetoric.</p>

          <p>China's Minister of Transport, Liu Wei, has called for a united front from the global shipping industry to combat what he termed US "unilateralism and protectionism."

Liu defended China's response as necessary to protect its shipping sector, which holds a dominant 53.3% of the global shipbuilding market.

          <p>Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch loyalist of Donald Trump, has recently taken positions that diverge from the Republican party, earning surprising praise from some Democrats.

While she remains aligned with Trump, her independent streak on key issues has fueled speculation about her motives and future ambitions. This shift challenges the narrative of a monolithic Republican party and highlights a populist lane she is carving for herself.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Democratic-led states should consider a form of "fiscal disobedience" to resist what the author describes as the Trump administration's punitive actions. The proposal involves creating state-administered escrow accounts to temporarily hold federal tax revenues collected from their residents and businesses. These funds would be released to the federal government only after it ceases actions like politically motivated funding cuts and military deployments in their cities. The author argues this strategy would transform a one-sided assault into a constitutional struggle over federal power and state sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Labor unions have become a primary force of opposition to the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce and curtail collective bargaining rights. Unions have filed dozens of lawsuits nationwide to block mass layoffs, challenge the reclassification of federal jobs, and prevent the gutting of agencies. A recent significant victory includes a temporary restraining order blocking layoffs resulting from the government shutdown. Legal experts and union leaders describe these actions as a crucial defense of a nonpartisan civil service and a bulwark against what they see as an increasing autocratic threat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California is grappling with a severe morale crisis following multiple rounds of layoffs that have eliminated over 10% of its workforce. The cuts are a direct result of Congress pulling funding for the lab's flagship Mars Sample Return mission due to budget overruns and delays. Employees report a climate of uncertainty and a lack of communication from leadership, turning a once dream-job destination into a place of dread. The funding crisis forces the pioneering space science institution to fight for its future and reclaim its role at the forefront of cosmic exploration.</p>

          <p>A satirical column offers a colorful perspective on the "No Kings" protest held at the state Capitol in Sacramento. The author humorously describes the scene, featuring protesters in dinosaur costumes, the "Raging Grannies" singing protest songs, and a diverse crowd united against what they perceive as authoritarian behavior. The piece highlights the peaceful and somewhat whimsical nature of the demonstration, contrasting the administration's warnings of anarchist threats with the reality of families and elderly activists participating. It frames the event as a grassroots expression of democratic values rather than a dangerous insurrection.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the escalating tit-for-tat trade and technology restrictions between the United States and China are no longer isolated incidents but a core feature of their relationship. For decades, a single US-centric tech ecosystem dominated, but now a systemic rivalry is emerging where each nation leverages its unique strengths. China controls critical rare earth processing, while the US wields powerful sanctioning tools and sets global standards. This dynamic represents a fundamental shift, as both powers test the limits of their influence and challenge the previously established global tech order.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian long-range drone strike has targeted and damaged a major gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg region, approximately 1,700 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The attack on the Gazprom-operated facility, one of the world's largest, sparked a fire and forced it to halt its intake of gas from Kazakhstan. This strike is part of Ukraine's escalating campaign since August to disrupt Russia's energy infrastructure, aiming to hinder its fuel supplies and reduce the revenue funding its war effort.

          <p>A BBC Scotland investigation using secret filming was instrumental in exposing a £28 million timeshare fraud that victimized over 3,500 people, mostly elderly. The company, Sell My Timeshare (SMT), used high-pressure tactics in a "bait-and-switch" scam, luring in owners desperate to exit their contracts and then selling them useless fake "credits." The investigation, which began in 2016, led to police action and ultimately 14 convictions. The man behind the scheme, Mark Rowe, was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison for funding a lavish lifestyle with the defrauded money.</p>

          <p>Fred Done, co-founder of the betting company Betfred, has warned that a potential tax hike on the gambling industry could force the closure of all 1,287 of its UK shops, putting 7,500 jobs at risk. His statement comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers increasing taxes on gambling firms, with some proposals suggesting a rate as high as 50%. Done claims that even a smaller increase would eliminate profitability, stating that 300 of his shops are already losing money. The warning echoes similar statements from other industry players who argue that higher taxes will push bettors to unregulated offshore markets.</p>

The accusation follows President Donald Trump's announcement that the US had destroyed a "drug-carrying submarine" in the same area.

The Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE) organized the protest, citing a lack of transparency and dialogue from the league.
