            <p>Following the halt of AI chip sales to China due to new licensing requirements, Nvidia stated it adheres strictly to U.S. export regulations. This statement came after a House Select Committee launched an investigation into Nvidia's sales, particularly concerning the H20 chip, a modified version designed to comply with previous export restrictions. Nvidia emphasized its role in helping the U.S. trade balance and highlighted its domestic workforce and technological leadership. The company's stock price recently declined nearly 7% amidst these developments, signaling investor concern about future sales and regulations in the AI sector.</p>

            <p>A widespread blackout plunged Puerto Rico into darkness, impacting all 1.4 million power clients just before the Easter weekend. Hospitals are operating on generators, and at least 78,000 customers are without water service. Officials estimate that restoring power could take up to 48 hours, and the cause of the outage is under investigation. This blackout has renewed public criticism of Luma Energy and Genera PR, the private companies responsible for power transmission and generation, with many calling for the government to cancel their contracts. The island's infrastructure is still recovering from previous hurricanes and decades of neglect.</p>

He speculated that teams would likely use Hunter primarily on one side with a limited role on the other.</p>

            <p>CBS secured a temporary legal victory, allowing the network to continue distributing "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" amidst a dispute with Sony Pictures Television. An appellate court paused a lower court ruling that would have stripped CBS of its distribution rights for the shows. Sony terminated its distribution deal with CBS and filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit, alleging unauthorized licensing deals and budget cuts. CBS maintains that Sony's claims are based on dissatisfaction with a decades-old agreement.</p>

            <p>President Trump is planning to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in areas where endangered species live, according to a White House official. The administration is considering repealing the definition of 'harm,' which would remove habitat protections for endangered species. Environmentalists are concerned that weakening the law would lead to increased species extinction. Critics of the Endangered Species Act argue that the law is overly burdensome and hinders economic growth.</p>

The regulations aim to create defensible space around homes and slow the spread of wildfires, applying to about 1,000 homes in the Berkeley Hills starting next year. The proposal follows deadly wildfires in Los Angeles and aims to prevent similar disasters. Experts emphasize that limiting fuel around homes is crucial for stopping the spread of fires.</p>
