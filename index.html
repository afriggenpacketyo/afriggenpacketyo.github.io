          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose 30% tariffs on all goods from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. In letters to leaders, President Trump cited the U.S. trade deficit as the reason for the EU tariff and the flow of fentanyl for the tariff on Mexico. The move has drawn a response from the European Commission, which warned the tariffs would harm businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU stated it would continue working toward an agreement but is prepared to implement proportionate countermeasures if necessary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Government Accountability Office report details extensive security failures by the U.S. Secret Service leading up to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The investigation found that the agency received a credible threat ten days prior but failed to share this intelligence with other law enforcement partners involved in planning the event. The report also identified significant procedural mistakes, including resource misallocation and communication breakdowns, concluding that the shooting was preventable and resulted from systemic mismanagement. These findings have prompted renewed calls for reform within the agency.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," aiming to be a centrist alternative and hold deciding votes in Congress. However, political science experts express doubt about its viability, citing the historical challenges third parties face against the established two-party system. The party's lack of a clear platform and Musk's personal unpopularity, with a 60% unfavorable rating in a recent poll, are also seen as significant hurdles to its success. The entire concept appears to have emerged from a recent dispute between Musk and Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its space exploration program, with ambitious goals to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and retrieve samples from Mars. This progress, including developments in its Mengzhou crew capsule and Long March-10 moon rocket, presents a significant challenge to the United States' long-held dominance in space. While NASA's Artemis program officially has an earlier timeline for a crewed lunar landing, it faces substantial technical hurdles, such as the need for in-orbit refueling, which intensifies the new space race between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched a massive wave of drone and cruise missile attacks across Ukraine, resulting in at least six deaths and numerous injuries in several regions, including Chernivtsi and Lviv.

The intensified aerial bombardment, which prompted neighboring Poland to scramble its fighter jets, coincides with a renewed Russian push along the front lines, placing Ukrainian forces under severe pressure.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a resident has died from pneumonic plague, the first recorded fatality from the disease in the state since 2007. Plague is a rare bacterial infection typically transmitted by fleas from rodents but is treatable with modern antibiotics if caught early. The pneumonic form is the most severe and can spread between people, prompting officials to remind the public to take precautions around wildlife, especially in rural areas of western states where most U.S. cases occur.</p>

          <p>A new book, "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America," provides a deeply sourced account of the recent election, chronicling Donald Trump's successful campaign and the Democratic party's struggles. The authors argue that Trump's victory was not inevitable, exploring a series of "what-if" scenarios, including the impact of the assassination attempt and Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the race. The book contends that Trump drew strength from public frustration with political institutions, which resonated with voters and helped him overcome numerous legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Researchers express concern that political backlash against COVID-19 mRNA vaccines could jeopardize promising cancer research that uses the same technology. Groundbreaking therapeutic vaccines for cancers like pancreatic and melanoma could be stalled due to funding cuts, regulatory restrictions, and public skepticism. Scientists warn that this "tremendous uncertainty," fueled by actions from the Trump administration and some state officials, could halt the trajectory of a technology that holds the potential to revolutionize treatment for many diseases.</p>

          <p>One year after China's Chang'e-6 mission returned the first-ever rock samples from the moon's far side, a scientific debate persists over the age of the South Pole-Aitken basin.

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic argues that modern society increasingly restricts children's free, unstructured movement, to their detriment. Citing health experts and neuroscientists, the article emphasizes that active, playful children develop healthier bodies, superior cognitive skills, and better mental well-being. It suggests that parental fear of injury often deprives children of developing a robust "movement vocabulary," which is crucial for long-term physical resilience and injury prevention, and encourages parents to allow for more creative and uninhibited play.</p>

          <p>Many immigrants in Florida, including U.S. citizens, are altering their driving behaviors due to fear of being targeted by law enforcement based on their perceived immigration status. New state policies have led to unwritten rules, such as avoiding Spanish-language music or stickers, not wearing work uniforms in the car, and carpooling only with trusted, legal residents. The climate of fear has reportedly caused some workers to avoid driving altogether, impacting local businesses and creating a sense of constant anxiety within immigrant communities across the state.</p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has dismissed concerns that a political spat over judicial appointments is damaging the nation's highest court. The controversy began when the conservative CDU/CSU bloc withdrew its support for a Social Democrat (SPD) candidate for the Federal Constitutional Court, causing a planned vote to be canceled. Coalition partners in the SPD accused the conservatives of deliberately weakening democratic institutions, but Dobrindt described the postponement as a normal part of the political process.</p>

Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to understand their financial impact and experiment with opting out, freeing up money that could be used for debt repayment, savings, or investing.
