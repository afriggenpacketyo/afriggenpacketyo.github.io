          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized the World Bank and International Monetary Fund for mission creep, urging them to return to basics as financial institutions while affirming the United States' commitment to a leadership role. Bessent emphasized that "America First does not mean America alone," calling for deeper collaboration among trade partners. He specifically noted that the IMF should focus on global monetary cooperation and financial stability rather than climate change, gender, and social issues, which he deemed outside the IMF's core mission. This critique followed the IMF's warning that Trump's tariffs would negatively impact the U.S. and global economies.</p>

          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, the owner of a paddleboard firm, received a 10-year and six-month prison sentence after four individuals died during a tour she led on the Western Cleddau river in Pembrokeshire in October 2021. Lloyd, an ex-police officer, pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter as she was unqualified to lead such a tour in extremely hazardous conditions. The court found that Lloyd's approach to health and safety was "abysmal," as she lacked proper qualifications and prioritized an exciting route over safety, leading the group over a dangerous weir with a strong current. The victims were not wearing appropriate safety gear, and Lloyd failed to provide a safety briefing or gather necessary emergency contact information.</p>

          <p>Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, a leading Democrat in the Senate, announced that he will not seek reelection, ending a career spanning over four decades in Congress. Durbin, who served as the Senate Democratic whip for 20 years, stated that it was time to "pass the torch," creating a valuable opening within the Democratic leadership. His departure is expected to fuel calls for new, younger leadership within the Democratic Party, with potential contenders like Sens. Brian Schatz and Amy Klobuchar being considered to succeed him. Durbin's retirement marks a significant moment for the party as they navigate opposition to President Trump's agenda.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering reducing tariffs on some Chinese imports to a level between 50% and 65%, a move that boosted U.S. equity markets. These cuts would substantially reduce the tariffs previously set at 145% earlier in the month. Options under review include a tiered system distinguishing between strategic and non-strategic goods, with the latter facing tariffs of 35%. Trump indicated that the duties would not be as high as 145% but would not be zero either, signaling a potential de-escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has burned through 11,500 acres and is approximately 30% contained, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. The wildfire destroyed one commercial building and several vehicles, with 20 structures still at risk, though no injuries have been reported. Acting Governor Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency for Ocean County, while mandatory and voluntary evacuations for approximately 5,000 residents in Ocean and Lacey townships were lifted. The fire, which started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, is being investigated for its cause, and officials expect the acreage to grow as containment efforts continue due to continuing dry conditions.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price increased for a third consecutive day, approaching $95,000, amidst a broader market rally fueled by President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and reduced criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Market strategists suggest this surge reflects investors capitalizing on a dip in an asset that consistently demonstrates its value as a portfolio diversifier and hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and U.S. dollar volatility.

          <p>A school board in southern California voted to prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' sports, mirroring a similar decision made by the Chino Valley school district. The Redlands Unified school board's decision reflects concerns about fairness and scientific differences between men and women, with board members arguing that allowing transgender athletes would deny opportunities for cisgender girls. This move aligns with a broader debate on transgender rights and athletics, as a survey indicated that a majority of California residents, including school parents, oppose biological male transgender athletes competing in women's sports. The decision has sparked controversy, with some accusing the board of discrimination.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for a perceived lack of "moral courage" on transgender issues during Prime Minister's Questions. The accusation follows a UK Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' based on biological sex, potentially excluding transgender women from women-only spaces. Badenoch accused Starmer of dodging the issue, contrasting his stance with the Conservative Party's defense of "common sense." Starmer defended his approach, emphasizing treating everyone with dignity and respect, and criticized past politicization of the issue. The debate underscores ongoing tensions surrounding transgender rights and definitions of gender.</p>

          <p>Tim Walz and I were sitting down for breakfast earlier this month at a Courtyard by Marriott in Independence, Ohio, just outside Cleveland. Walz, who was Kamala Harris’s running mate last year, is still the governor of a state that happens not to be Ohio—or West Virginia, Iowa, Wisconsin, Nebraska, or Texas, all of which he had visited recently. Like Democrats in general, the two-term Minnesota governor is still trying to process the insanity of last summer and fall, the earthquake of Election Night 2024, and the horrors that have spiraled out since then. Also, like Democrats in general, he isn’t sure how best to counter the daily onslaught of the second Donald Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Tim Walz, Kamala Harris's former running mate and current governor of Minnesota, is actively engaging in national politics, particularly in key states like Ohio, to gauge the Democratic Party's future direction. Walz's efforts include labor roundtables, town halls, and roadside stops, reflecting his attempt to address the anxieties and frustrations within the party following recent electoral setbacks. He emphasizes the need for simpler messaging and greater citizen engagement to counter Trump's administration. Walz's activities signal a potential return to the national political stage and a desire to fill a perceived void in Democratic leadership.</p>

          <p>Buprenorphine, a medication that can stop opioid cravings and reduce overdose deaths, is significantly underutilized in the United States, despite its proven effectiveness. The underuse stems from a belief that using drugs to recover from drug use is not true sobriety, cultural stigma, and fears of abuse. The drug's effectiveness is further complicated by the rise of fentanyl, which can cause precipitated withdrawal when combined with buprenorphine. The story of Mallory and her brother Quincie shows the limits of buprenorphine in a fractured approach to recovery.</p>

The anti-abortion movement is now seeking to convince courts that the 14th amendment already recognizes embryos and fetuses as people from the moment of conception. This interest in the 14th amendment is also something of an about-face for the anti-abortion movement, which is predominantly white and has had a convoluted relationship with race for more than a century.</p>
