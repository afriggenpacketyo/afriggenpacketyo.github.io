          <p>The U.S. federal government is on the verge of a shutdown as lawmakers remain deadlocked over a funding agreement. If a deal is not reached by the midnight deadline, up to 4 million federal employees, including military service members and essential workers like TSA officers, could go without pay. A shutdown would also disrupt numerous government services, potentially closing national parks, delaying food safety inspections, and halting some functions at the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services. The last shutdown in 2018 lasted a record 35 days and resulted in an estimated $3 billion of unrecoverable economic losses.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer is challenging Warren Buffett's long-standing advice for average investors to primarily use low-cost S&P 500 index funds. While Buffett advocates for this passive strategy, arguing it consistently outperforms most active managers, Cramer suggests a hybrid approach. He recommends dedicating half of a portfolio to index funds and the other half to a select few individual stocks that investors have thoroughly researched. Cramer contends that average investors can achieve above-average returns by picking winning stocks, a view that contrasts with Buffett's caution that stock picking is a difficult endeavor best left to professionals.

          <p>DoorDash has introduced a new fleet of autonomous delivery robots, named "Dots," on the streets of Mesa, a suburb of Phoenix. These five-foot-tall red bots are designed to handle smaller orders, carrying up to 30 pounds at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour. The company states that Dots are the first of their kind capable of navigating bike lanes, roads, and sidewalks to optimize delivery routes. An AI-powered platform determines which orders are most suitable for robotic delivery, aiming to create a more efficient and economical system for local commerce that doesn't always require a full-sized vehicle.</p>

          <p>Travelers are increasingly encountering attractively priced "self-transfer" flight options from online travel agents, which require passengers to re-check in at a connecting airport. While this can offer significant savings compared to booking a single ticket through an airline, it carries substantial risks. If the initial flight is delayed or canceled, the passenger is responsible for the cost of a new onward flight, as the connection is not protected by the airline.

          <p>Amazon has unveiled a new line of smart speakers and displays, including the Echo Dot Max and updated Echo Show models, designed to integrate its new generative AI assistant, Alexa+. The devices feature faster processors and an "Omnisense" platform that provides Alexa with enhanced contextual awareness, allowing it to recognize users and offer personalized insights. This hardware refresh is seen as Amazon's response to the growing competition in the generative AI space from rivals like OpenAI and Google. The new devices, which start at $99, represent a significant step in Amazon's effort to modernize its hardware for the AI era.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For an $80,000 HELOC, current average rates would result in monthly payments of approximately $966 for a 10-year repayment period or $759 for a 15-year period. These costs are lower than those for home equity loans, personal loans, or credit cards. Because HELOCs have variable rates, borrowers could see their payments decrease further if the Fed continues to cut rates, though they also face the risk of rates increasing in the future.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widely discussed "7-year rule" for credit card debt primarily refers to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which mandates that most negative information, such as late payments and charge-offs, must be removed from a credit report after seven years. This clock typically starts from the date of the first missed payment. Additionally, states have statutes of limitations, often around seven years, that prevent creditors from suing to collect old debts. However, the debt itself does not disappear and collectors may still attempt to contact the individual. Making a payment on an old debt can sometimes restart the statute of limitations, making it crucial for consumers to understand their rights.</p>

          <p>Labor unions in Greece have called for a general strike to protest a controversial government bill that could legalize a 13-hour workday. The proposed reform would allow employees to work for a second employer for up to five additional hours after their primary eight-hour shift. The government argues this merely adapts legislation to the reality that many Greeks already work second jobs, but unions and critics say it will erode workers' rights and lead to exploitation. The strike is expected to halt transportation services across the country as workers rally against what they call a move toward a "dystopia" of overwork and exhaustion.</p>

          <p>Thrive Global CEO Arianna Huffington is speaking out against the pervasive belief that burnout is a necessary component of success. Drawing from her own experience of collapsing from exhaustion in 2007, she argues that scientific evidence shows people are more effective, creative, and resilient when they prioritize rest and well-being. Huffington believes there is a "collective delusion" that equates long hours with achievement, particularly affecting young professionals. She advocates for taking small, incremental "micro steps" to build healthier habits, asserting that taking time to recharge is not a luxury but a crucial strategy for sustainable success.</p>

Siminoff is focused on leveraging AI and a high density of cameras to assist with crime prevention, a direction that has previously drawn criticism from privacy advocates. Ring recently reintroduced a tool allowing police to request footage from users through a partnership with Axon, the maker of Tasers. Siminoff, who says he "backs the blue," maintains that the system is privacy-centric and is aimed at improving public safety by providing law enforcement with valuable evidence.</p>

          <p>In an advice column, author James Parker responds to a reader who has lost their creative passion for writing. Parker shares his own experience of losing his writerly fire, a quality he and a friend termed "the odeness," after publishing a book of odes. He advises that to rekindle inspiration, a writer should broaden their range beyond familiar topics and explore more abstract or unusual subjects. He suggests that odes don't always need to be rapturous or joyful; they simply need to connect with the essential, unique quality of their subject. The column offers a thoughtful reflection on maintaining creative momentum in a challenging environment.</p>

          <p>The historic rivalry between India and Pakistan in cricket has become increasingly politicized, mirroring the nations' ongoing geopolitical conflicts. During the recent Asia Cup, the Indian team reportedly refused to shake hands with Pakistani players, and the post-final trophy ceremony was delayed by a 90-minute standoff. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi linked the team's victory to a recent military operation, drawing a sharp rebuke from Pakistan's interior minister. This breakdown of sportsmanship marks a departure from the past, when "cricket diplomacy" was used to ease tensions, indicating that the sport has become another arena for nationalistic confrontation.</p>

          <p>U.S. health officials have issued an alert for pre-cooked pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The affected products, including Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs and Trader Joe's Cajun-style Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, are linked to a deadly outbreak that has sickened at least 20 people across 15 states and resulted in four deaths and one fetal loss. The USDA and FDA are urging consumers who purchased these items with specific use-by dates to discard them immediately and clean any surfaces they may have touched.

          <p>A new Hulu documentary, "Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery," revisits the groundbreaking all-female music festival of the late 1990s, challenging the caricatures that have overshadowed its significance. Co-founded by Sarah McLachlan, the festival was a pragmatic response to an industry that marginalized female artists, refusing to play their songs back-to-back on the radio. The film highlights the sense of community, safety, and empowerment the tour created for both performers and audiences. It serves as a historical corrective, exploring how Lilith Fair proved the commercial and cultural power of women in music and what its sense of collective purpose means today.</p>

          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, savers can still earn a substantial return of $1,000 or more with a certificate of deposit (CD) account by using a strategic approach. With current rates around 4.50%, depositing $24,000 into a one-year CD can yield over $1,000 in interest. Alternatively, a smaller deposit of $8,200 in a three-year CD could achieve a similar return over a longer period. As rates are expected to continue falling, financial experts advise savers to act promptly to lock in today's relatively high rates before they decline further. (not investment advice)</p>
