            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield spiked to 4.363% and the 2-year yield rose to 3.808% as investors reacted to President Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which include a 104% tariff rate on Chinese imports. These tariffs have triggered retaliatory measures from China and Canada, escalating trade war fears and prompting concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. Some analysts suggest the Federal Reserve might need to intervene to stabilize markets, with growing expectations of an emergency rate cut similar to those during the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis. Investors are closely watching upcoming consumer and producer price index releases for further economic insights. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Kasia Wlaszczyk, a Polish citizen residing in Berlin, along with other pro-Palestine activists, faces deportation from Germany due to allegations of involvement in protests against the Gaza conflict. The deportation orders cite concerns about public order and national security, accusing the activists of antisemitism and supporting terrorist organizations, despite the absence of criminal records or legal proceedings. Wlaszczyk argues that these measures are part of a broader campaign by the German government to suppress pro-Palestinian speech and action, fueled by the adoption of the IHRA definition of antisemitism. She and other activists are fighting the deportation orders, emphasizing their solidarity with the Palestinian people and their right to protest.</p>

            <p>Following President Trump's call for Apple to manufacture iPhones in the United States to avoid tariffs, a tech analyst from Needham expressed doubt about the feasibility of such a move. The analyst argued that Apple's costs would significantly increase, and relocating the supply chain would take years, with some experts deeming it impossible. While the White House maintains that the U.S. has the workforce and resources to support domestic iPhone production, concerns persist regarding the economic impact of tariffs on Apple, particularly given its manufacturing exposure to China and other countries now facing levies. The analyst estimates that Trump's tariffs could increase Apple's costs by approximately 50%. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs on imports from numerous countries, including a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, have officially taken effect, escalating global trade war tensions. The tariffs, which aim to revive America's manufacturing base and open negotiations with trading partners, have been met with vows of retaliation from China and concerns about rising inflation and recession risks. While the White House claims deals will be made to benefit American workers, China insists on fighting the trade war "to the end."

            <p>British Steel faces potential raw material shortages and the risk of blast furnace closures due to a 25% tariff on exports to the U.S. The government is considering nationalizing the Chinese-owned company as a potential solution, amidst debates over transitioning to electric arc furnaces. While the government has offered £500m to support the transition, the company has rejected the offer, citing concerns about the quality of steel produced by electric arc furnaces. The situation has raised concerns about the future of steel production in the UK and the potential loss of high-grade steel manufacturing capabilities.</p>

            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House cannot bar Associated Press (AP) journalists from accessing the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other controlled spaces, citing a violation of the First Amendment. The ruling came after the White House curtailed AP's access due to the news service's refusal to adopt President Trump's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. The judge's order, temporarily paused to allow for appeal, underscores that while the White House can control access, it cannot discriminate against journalists based on their viewpoints. The AP expressed gratitude for the decision, affirming the press's fundamental right to speak freely without government retaliation.</p>

Small businesses, like Sweetwater Organic Coffee Company, are already anticipating having to raise prices due to the tariffs, particularly on coffee sourced from developing countries.

The word itself has a rich history, originating from the Arabic word "taʽrīf," meaning "notification" or "inventory," and evolving through various languages before entering English in the 16th century. Tariffs have been a central part of U.S. trade policy since the country's founding, with their goals shifting from revenue generation to restriction over time. The article explores the historical context of tariffs, including the controversial Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, and examines how the meaning of the word may be evolving in the context of Trump's "reciprocal tariffs."</p>

            <p>The head of the FAA's Air Traffic Organization is retiring early as the agency implements changes at Reagan National Airport following a midair collision, recent close calls, and internal issues. A new management team has been brought in to the air traffic control tower to address safety data trends, performance management, and training. These changes come in response to a deadly midair collision in January and a fight between employees inside the air traffic control tower. The FAA is also investigating a recent close call between a Delta Air Lines flight and an Air Force jet.</p>

            <p>Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, denounced Washington and its allies for their calls for North Korea's denuclearization, asserting that the country will never abandon its nuclear weapons program. Her statement came in response to a meeting between the top diplomats of the United States, South Korea, and Japan, where they reaffirmed their commitment to pushing for the North's denuclearization. Kim Yo Jong insisted that any discussions of denuclearization constitute a hostile act and a denial of North Korea's sovereignty. Tensions in the region have increased as Kim Jong Un continues to flaunt his military capabilities and align with Russia.</p>

            <p>Some Chinese exporters are abandoning shipments mid-voyage and surrendering containers to shipping companies in order to avoid the high costs of President Trump's new tariffs. This drastic measure reflects the significant impact of the tariffs on cross-Pacific trade, with one export company reporting a dramatic drop in U.S.-bound container volume. The new tariffs have triggered a backlash from Beijing and sent shock waves through global markets. Companies are halting shipping plans and scrapping orders as they struggle to cope with the increased costs and uncertainty.</p>
