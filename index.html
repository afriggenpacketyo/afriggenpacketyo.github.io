          <p>Five people died in Gary, Indiana, after a vehicle collided with a South Shore Line train. The incident occurred when the vehicle, carrying five occupants, drove around the gates at the intersection of US 12 and 7th Street and into the train's path. The train, carrying 32 passengers, was stopped just west of Miller Station following the crash. Authorities confirmed that all five people in the vehicle died, while passengers and crew on the train were unharmed. The South Shore Line President expressed condolences to the families of the victims and emphasized the importance of caution around trains and train tracks.</p>

          <p>At least 29 students were killed and hundreds injured in a stampede at Barthelemy Boganda High School in Bangui, Central African Republic, during baccalaureate exams.

Many students were seen jumping from the first floor of the school, and most of the victims died at the scene. President Faustin Archange Touadera declared three days of national mourning, and the Education Minister announced that measures would be taken to investigate the incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of South Carolina, allowing the state to block Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood. The ruling reverses a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, which had allowed Planned Parenthood's lawsuit against state officials to proceed. The case centered on whether a Medicaid beneficiary can sue to enforce their ability to seek care from any qualified provider. This decision is likely to embolden other states to attempt to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs, although federal law already prohibits Medicaid from funding abortions except in specific cases.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and subsequent ceasefire, Congressman Ro Khanna is advocating for the Democratic party to re-establish itself as the anti-war party. Khanna believes this stance is both morally sound and politically advantageous, especially with young voters disillusioned by recent foreign policy decisions. He has partnered with Republican congressman Thomas Massie on a war powers resolution requiring congressional approval for military action against Iran. Khanna argues that the Washington establishment is disconnected from the American public's desire for peace and domestic investment.</p>

While CFOs acknowledge the potential negative impact of tariffs on the economy, they remain optimistic about the stock market and expect bond yields to remain elevated. A slight majority still anticipate a recession either in the second half of the year or in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

An Apple research paper titled "The Illusion of Thinking" found that these models fail to develop general problem-solving capabilities beyond certain complexities. Researchers at Salesforce and Anthropic have also highlighted the issue of "jagged intelligence," indicating a gap between current AI capabilities and real-world enterprise demand. Some experts argue that these warnings may be a strategic move by Apple, which is seen as playing catch up in the AI race.</p>

          <p>The US economy contracted more than previously estimated in the first three months of 2025, according to government data. The Commerce Department reported that real gross domestic product fell by 0.5% in the first quarter, compared to the previously reported dip of 0.2%. The decline primarily reflects downward revisions to consumer spending and exports, which were partly affected by a downward revision to imports. The data came after an import surge triggered by US President Donald Trump's tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, calling it a "historically successful attack" and criticizing the media for focusing on negative aspects. He condemned the leak of a Defense Intelligence Agency report that described the damage as "limited." Hegseth asserted that Trump created the conditions to end the war by decimating Iran's nuclear capabilities. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff provided details about the operation, including the use of bunker-busting bombs, but key questions remain about the status of Iran's highly enriched uranium.</p>

The unconventional staging has drawn comparisons to Eva Perón's appeal to the masses.

As the cost of living rises, most workplace life insurance policies fail to keep pace, with the median basic workplace coverage being just $20,000 or one times a worker's salary. Experts recommend considering supplemental life insurance if your basic workplace policy has a low death benefit, especially if your family financially depends on you and your income.
