          <p>Following Canada's general election, Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Trump have agreed to meet soon to discuss the economic and security relationship between the two countries. Carney, a former central banker, emphasized that any partnership with the U.S. would be on Canada's terms, rejecting the idea of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state. Trump congratulated Carney on his election victory, while the White House deputy press secretary made a controversial comment about making Canada America's 51st state. The leaders affirmed the importance of Canada and the United States working together as independent, sovereign nations for mutual benefit.</p>

          <p>UPS announced plans to eliminate 20,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting strategy linked to delivering fewer packages for Amazon, its largest customer. The company aims to consolidate facilities and its workforce, expecting to save $3.5 billion this year, and may close additional buildings. UPS also cited risks from shifts in global trade policy, particularly the trade war between China and the U.S., which impacts its profitable China to U.S. trade lanes.

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a narrow victory in Canada's election, falling just short of a majority and requiring support from other parties to govern. The election was heavily influenced by President Trump's tariffs and threats to Canada's sovereignty, which boosted Carney's image as an anti-Trump candidate. Carney emphasized the need to protect Canada's interests and independence in dealings with the U.S., warning against American encroachment on Canadian resources and sovereignty. The Conservative Party suffered a defeat, with its leader losing his seat after Trump's actions undermined their campaign.</p>

          <p>Two dozen states are suing the Trump administration over significant cuts to Americorps, arguing the administration is attempting to dismantle the volunteer service organization. The lawsuit alleges that the cuts, linked to Trump's federal cost-cutting push, violate federal law and the separation of powers, as Congress created and funded Americorps. The White House claims Americorps has failed audits and made improper payments, justifying the cuts. California's Governor Newsom stated that the cuts vandalize American values and that the state will fight to stop them.</p>

          <p>The Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong, accompanied by several vessels, has made two rare transits north of the Philippines, which analysts interpret as a "show of force." This occurred as the U.S. and Philippine forces conducted joint drills in the area. The Shandong's passage through the Luzon Strait, a crucial naval choke point, highlights China's ambition to break through the first island chain amid U.S. containment efforts. Aircraft on board the carrier conducted approximately 130 take-off and landing drills during this period.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is advocating for a major reassessment of net zero policies, asserting that current strategies focused on limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production are "doomed to fail." Blair's report emphasizes the need for rapid deployment of carbon capture technology, AI-driven energy grid efficiency, and investment in small-scale nuclear reactors. While not calling for Labour to abandon decarbonization, he stresses the importance of engaging China and India in emissions reduction efforts. Downing Street has rejected Blair's suggestions, affirming the government's commitment to achieving net zero in a way that minimizes disruption to people's lives and behaviors.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers have introduced a plan to overhaul the student loan system, potentially increasing costs for borrowers and eliminating the SAVE repayment plan. The proposal aims to address rising college costs and save over $330 billion by replacing existing income-based repayment plans with a single "repayment assistance plan." This new plan would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%, with a maximum repayment period of 30 years. The plan also includes changes to Pell Grants, Grad PLUS loans, and subsidized loans for undergraduate students.</p>

          <p>North Korea conducted the first test-firing of the weapons system of its new "Choe Hyon-class" warship, according to state media KCNA. The test-firing, attended by leader Kim Jong Un, involved the launch of cruise and anti-air missiles, as well as artillery fire. Kim stated that it is time for North Korea's navy to accelerate nuclear armament for maritime sovereignty and national defense. The 5,000-tonne warship is equipped with the "most powerful weapons" and will be handed over to the navy early next year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring policies to encourage Americans to marry and have more children, including a lump-sum "baby bonus." Trump has expressed support for the idea, suggesting a $5,000 payment to mothers after giving birth. While baby bonuses are used in other countries, critics view the proposals as a distraction from deeper societal investments parents need, including affordable childcare and paid parental leave. There are also concerns that the pronatalist movement is focused on traditional gender roles and reproductive oppression.</p>

Some vendors are delaying shipments as they determine who will cover the extra costs, adding to the uncertainty. Many Korean pantry staples simply can't be sourced domestically at the quality or scale needed, and some U.S. producers are geared toward retail or gourmet markets and can't meet the volume that kitchens need.

Emhoff described the move as a political decision that turned “one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue”. He said he had been informed on Tuesday of his removal from the board, which oversees the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and other Holocaust commemorations. Emhoff, who is Jewish and who led the Biden administration’s efforts to combat antisemitism, said he would continue to “speak out, to educate, and to fight hate in all its forms – because silence is never an option”.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles county officials have approved a $4 billion payout to settle nearly 7,000 claims of sexual assault in juvenile facilities since 1959. The agreement settles lawsuits filed by thousands of people who alleged they were mistreated and sexually assaulted in foster care and juvenile detention facilities. Many of the claims involved the MacLaren children’s center, which was closed in 2003. The approval of the huge payout by Los Angeles county comes at a time when the nation’s largest county – home to about 10 million residents – is facing a tightening bind of financial obligations on its $49bn annual budget.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order softening some of the automotive tariffs his administration put into place earlier this month, as the car industry grapples with regulatory uncertainty and additional costs due to the levies. Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports that had resulted from separate levies. Under the order, additional 25% tariffs on auto parts that were set to start by May 3 will also still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years.</p>
