          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack during a pro-Israel demonstration, has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple state charges, including attempted first-degree murder. According to court documents, Soliman admitted to researching how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube and purchasing the necessary ingredients. He allegedly told police that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and admitted to planning the attack for a year, waiting until after his daughter's graduation. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism after Soliman allegedly threw Molotov cocktails and yelled "Free Palestine" at demonstrators. The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were injured, with some remaining hospitalized. The article notes that Soliman is in the United States illegally after his visa expired and he was denied the purchase of a gun. The investigation is ongoing. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates a widespread decline in childhood measles vaccination rates across the United States since before the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant variations within states. The MMR vaccination rate decreased from 93.92% in the 2017-2018 school year to 91.26% in the 2023-2024 school year across 33 states, with 78% of the 2,066 counties studied experiencing a decline. The study highlights the vulnerability of certain areas to measles outbreaks, pointing to Gaines County in West Texas, the epicenter of a recent outbreak, with a vaccination rate just over 80%. The CDC reports that 96% of U.S. measles cases are among those unvaccinated or with unknown vaccination status, underscoring the importance of herd immunity, which requires over 95% community vaccination. </p>

          <p>Despite a strong recovery in the stock market after April losses, investors are showing skepticism, according to U.S. exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows. Inflows into equity ETFs have decreased by more than half since the market recovered, while investors are favoring ultra-short duration bonds. This suggests a cautious stance on stocks and a potential "reset year" in the bull market, with traders favoring short-term gains over long-term investments. However, retail investors with a long-term focus continue to buy into the U.S. market. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>A judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. The ruling limits the administration's practice of rapidly deporting people accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Judge John Holcomb ruled that the government hasn't provided adequate notice for deportees to challenge their deportation. The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the legality of the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act. </p>

This low participation rate has raised concerns about the legitimacy of the election, which Sheinbaum championed as a key component of the ruling party's transformation of Mexican society. Experts attribute the low turnout to various factors, including the election being held in an off-year, a complex balloting process, and a lack of familiarity with the candidates.
