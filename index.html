          <p>The United States military has stated that it has struck over 800 targets in Yemen as part of its ongoing campaign against the Houthi rebels, claiming to have killed hundreds of fighters and leaders. These actions are in response to Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and are intended to restore freedom of navigation in the region. The Houthis, who control large parts of Yemen, reported that recent US attacks on Sanaa resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children, while the US insists it is acting to counter the threat the Iran-backed group poses to international shipping.</p>
