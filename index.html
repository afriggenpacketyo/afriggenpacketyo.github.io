          <p>Senator Jack Reed expressed shock at President Trump's rejection of intelligence community assessments regarding Iran's nuclear program, suggesting political motives may be at play. Reed highlighted that National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard testified weeks prior that Iran was not actively building nuclear weapons, a conclusion Trump disputed. Reed posited that Trump's stance might be influenced by contemplating military action against Iran, requiring a justification that Iran possesses nuclear capabilities or intentions. Reed also noted that Gabbard has an obligation to correct the record immediately if her testimony was false, and that this correction should not be influenced by Israeli activity. The senator's statement underscores growing tensions between the administration and intelligence agencies on critical foreign policy matters. Optimism surrounding the situation is somewhat low, given the potential for escalating conflict and the administration's disregard for expert analysis.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles to reaffirm the Trump administration's stance on military deployment in the city amid protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. Vance defended the continued presence of the National Guard and Marines, citing potential for renewed protests and accusing local officials of inciting violence. He also mistakenly referred to Senator Alex Padilla as "José Padilla," drawing criticism from Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom, who viewed it as disrespectful and politically motivated. The administration's hardline immigration policies and the deployment of federal troops have fueled tensions between state and federal authorities, with ongoing legal challenges and accusations of misinformation. The situation remains contentious, with differing perspectives on the necessity and impact of federal intervention in local affairs.</p>

          <p>Following his release from immigration detention, Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil asserted that the Trump administration's attempts to silence pro-Palestinian voices have been unsuccessful. Khalil, who was detained for over three months, stated that his existence serves as a message to the administration. His arrest in March sparked demonstrations in New York and Washington D.C., with the U.S. government seeking his deportation based on claims that his activism is detrimental to foreign policy interests. Khalil's release and subsequent remarks highlight the ongoing tensions between the administration and activists advocating for Palestinian rights. His case has become a focal point in discussions about free speech and government overreach.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, arrived in New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention in Louisiana. Khalil, a green card holder, had been in ICE custody for over 100 days as the Trump administration sought to deport him for his role in campus protests against Israel. Upon arrival, Khalil affirmed his commitment to advocating for Palestinian rights, denouncing the administration's actions as a violation of his First Amendment rights. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who greeted him at the airport, echoed these sentiments, criticizing the administration's attempt to punish Khalil for his political speech. The judge ruled that Khalil was neither a threat to the community nor a flight risk, determining that the government's actions appeared to be an attempt to punish Khalil for his anti-Israel speech.</p>

          <p>The city of Pasadena canceled swimming lessons and recreation programs at three parks due to concerns about potential immigration enforcement by federal agents. The decision followed social media posts indicating federal enforcement activity near Villa Parke, prompting officials to act "out of an abundance of caution." The cancellations at Villa Parke, Robinson Park, and Victory Park aimed to avoid escalating conflict associated with unannounced federal actions. This decision comes after recent detentions by federal agents near a Pasadena bus stop, which sparked outrage from local politicians, including U.S. Representative Judy Chu. The situation reflects growing unease and heightened tensions in the community regarding immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the fatal shootings of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband, Vance Boelter, was described as a doomsday "prepper" by the FBI. Boelter's wife told investigators that the family prepared for major or catastrophic incidents and that her husband had warned her to flee, suggesting impending danger. Investigators found cash, passports, and guns in her car, and Boelter had provided her with a "bailout plan." The suspect, who disguised himself as a police officer, is accused of killing Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, and seriously wounding Democratic State Senator John Hoffman and his wife. The shootings have been called an act of targeted political violence, and a list of potential targets was found in Boelter's possession.</p>

Passengers were evacuated from a train in south London due to a fault, highlighting the impact of extreme heat on infrastructure. Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires, and the public is urged to exercise caution to prevent further incidents.

          <p>The United States is reportedly moving B-2 bombers to Guam, according to U.S. officials, as President Trump considers potential involvement in Israel's strikes against Iran. The deployment's connection to Middle East tensions remains unclear, but the B-2 can carry the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, potentially used against Iran's nuclear program. The officials declined to provide further details, including the number of bombers being moved or if they will be moved beyond Guam. Experts are closely monitoring whether the bombers will proceed to Diego Garcia, a U.S.-British military base in the Indian Ocean, which is strategically positioned for operations in the Middle East. The U.S. is also moving other military assets to the Middle East and an aircraft carrier in the Indo-Pacific is heading to the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Pakistan intends to nominate President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his role in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. The Pakistani government cited Trump's "decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership" during the recent crisis. Trump has claimed that the U.S. brokered the ceasefire and used trade as leverage to achieve it, though India has denied any U.S. mediation. The move has drawn mixed reactions, with some praising it as a strategic maneuver and others criticizing it as compromising national dignity. Trump has often expressed his belief that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

Boelter's wife told investigators that her husband had recently sent a message to a group text thread with their children, which “stated something to the effect of they should prepare for war, they needed to get out of the house and people with guns may be showing up to the house”. Law enforcement found a storage locker rented by Boelter in Minneapolis on 10 June. He had last “used his access code” for the locker the day before the shootings. A “hit list” of individuals was found inside what they believe was Boelter’s vehicle.</p>

          <p>A top Ford executive stated that the automaker is shifting its focus away from engine development, believing consumers no longer prioritize powertrains. This decision involves outsourcing engine development and manufacturing to suppliers, potentially leading to shared engine designs across different brands. Ford's strategy is driven by the need to compete with lower-priced Chinese automakers and the push towards electrification. Critics argue that this move could compromise the reliability and performance that customers value, particularly in proprietary engine designs. The shift reflects a broader industry trend towards electrification and cost reduction.</p>

The discovery, made by the French Blood Establishment (EFS), was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion.

Scientists were able to unravel the mystery in 2019 using high-throughput DNA sequencing, which highlighted a genetic mutation.
