          <p>House Democrats are formally requesting a "birthday book" from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, which reportedly contains a letter from Donald Trump. The lawmakers believe the book is relevant to their oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump administration's selective release of related files. This request comes as the House Oversight Committee prepares to depose Ghislaine Maxwell, who is said to have compiled the book. Trump has denied the letter's existence and sued the Wall Street Journal over its reporting.</p>

          <p>Pemiscot Memorial, a vital hospital in Missouri's poorest county, is on the verge of financial collapse, a situation exacerbated by a new bill championed by the Trump administration. The legislation mandates major cuts to Medicaid, a program on which the hospital heavily relies, with estimates suggesting 80% of its revenue comes from Medicaid and Medicare. Local leaders and healthcare providers fear the cuts will devastate the region's already fragile healthcare system, potentially forcing the hospital to close and harming the local economy. The changes are expected to cause 170,000 state residents to lose their health coverage.</p>

          <p>Famed professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, who died at 71, had been contending with significant health problems for years. In a recent interview, he revealed he had undergone 25 surgeries over the last decade, including ten on his back and replacements for both hips, knees, and shoulders. Despite the physical toll from his long career, which he attributed partly to outdated and dangerous ring equipment in his early years, Hogan stated he had no regrets. Medical experts noted that the physical strain and past steroid use likely contributed to his health decline.</p>

          <p>A new study from Keck Medicine of USC reveals a significant increase in advanced liver disease among Americans who are heavy drinkers, even though drinking habits have not changed. Over two decades, the prevalence of significant liver scarring more than doubled in this group, with the risk being particularly high for women, older individuals, and those with metabolic conditions like obesity or diabetes. Researchers are surprised by the magnitude of the increase and note that the demographic of heavy drinkers has shifted. The findings suggest that current US guidelines for what constitutes heavy drinking may be too lenient.</p>

          <p>The death of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner is being mourned not just with nostalgia but with gratitude for the cultural weight he carried, according to this opinion column. The author reflects on how Warner's character, Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show," provided a positive and relatable portrayal of a young Black man navigating life's challenges. Alongside other key characters from shows like "Good Times" and "Fame," Theo offered a counter-narrative to the limited and often negative depictions of Black families in media at the time. Warner's graceful handling of this representative role helped redefine Blackness for a generation.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's public emphasis on deporting "heinous illegal alien criminals," an analysis of ICE data reveals a different reality in the Los Angeles area. In June, nearly seven out of ten immigrants arrested had no criminal convictions, a sharp increase from previous months. This trend coincides with a new directive to increase daily arrests, a quota that experts say is impossible to meet by targeting only those with criminal records. Critics argue the administration is misrepresenting its enforcement actions by highlighting a few serious cases while sweeping up many non-criminal individuals.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, humanitarian expert Alex de Waal argues that Israel's "secure distribution sites" for food in Gaza are not a genuine aid effort but an alibi for the crime of mass starvation. He contends that the amount of aid is grossly insufficient, and the distribution method, which requires desperate people to risk their lives in military zones, favors the strong over the vulnerable. De Waal asserts that the system lacks provisions for the most needy, such as malnourished children, and serves to humiliate and break down Palestinian society. This degradation, he argues, is a central element of the harm being inflicted.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is presenting a paradox, with the median price for an existing home hitting an all-time high in June even as the volume of sales reached a nine-month low. Economists attribute this trend to a divided market where affluent, all-cash buyers and those with significant housing equity continue to spend, driving up prices at the high end. Meanwhile, high mortgage rates are sidelining many first-time and middle-income buyers. This "lock-in effect" also discourages current homeowners with low-rate mortgages from selling, further constraining supply and keeping prices elevated for available properties.

The action also coincides with growing domestic political pressure on the UK to formally recognize a Palestinian state, with over 200 MPs signing a letter in support.

          <h2>Border Conflict Pits US-Allied Thai Military Against China-Backed Cambodian Forces</h2>

          <p>A deadly border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia highlights a significant military imbalance, pitting a well-equipped, longtime US ally against a smaller adversary with strong ties to China. Thailand's military is substantially larger in both personnel and advanced weaponry, benefiting from its status as a major non-NATO US ally and a robust domestic arms industry. In contrast, Cambodia's younger military relies heavily on China for equipment and support, including the development of the Ream Naval Base. The conflict over a century-old border dispute showcases the differing geopolitical alignments and capabilities within Southeast Asia.</p>

          <h2>Luxury Market Recovery Shows Mixed Signals Amid Four Key Headwinds</h2>

          <p>The recovery of the luxury goods market is facing a complex set of challenges, painting a mixed picture for high-end brands. Recent earnings reports indicate four key trends: weakness in Japan due to currency fluctuations, a surprising sales spike in the U.S. ahead of potential tariffs, looming price increases to offset those tariffs, and a divergence in product performance. While some brands like Hermès see strength in leather goods, others like LVMH are battling softness in jewelry and fashion. Investors are now watching to see how these headwinds will affect upcoming results from other major luxury houses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Donald Trump visits Scotland to open a new golf course, he is being met with organized protests and frustration from local residents who have long opposed his developments. Activists in Aberdeenshire, who fought the construction of his first resort on an ecologically sensitive site, remain disgusted by his actions. Residents near both his Aberdeenshire and Turnberry resorts are also upset about the high security costs and disruptions for what is a private visit. Protest groups plan to demonstrate, stating that public sentiment has turned against him and that he is not welcome in the country.</p>

          <p>China is strengthening its position as a key partner for Africa by expanding duty-free access for products from 53 African nations. This move contrasts starkly with recent US policies, which include levying higher tariffs on imports from some African countries, threatening to cut foreign aid, and imposing visa restrictions. Observers note that these differing approaches are likely to further endear Beijing to African leaders, who increasingly see China as a more reliable and beneficial partner. The long-held US belief that its humanitarian aid would guarantee goodwill on the continent is proving to be outdated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwanese voters participated in a large-scale recall election on Saturday aimed at ousting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). Supporters of the recall are angered by the KMT and its allies for blocking key legislation, including the defense budget, and passing controversial reforms seen as favoring Beijing. The outcome could potentially shift the power balance in the legislature, where the ruling Democratic Progressive Party currently lacks a majority. The KMT has condemned the recall as political retaliation, intensifying tensions on the self-ruled island over its relationship with China.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered numerous cases where dopamine agonist drugs, prescribed for Parkinson's disease and other conditions, have caused extreme and destructive side effects. One family was torn apart after a man taking Ropinirole developed obsessive and sexually coercive behaviors, including spying on his wife and later sexually assaulting care home staff. The report highlights that while risks of impulsive behavior are known, warnings on leaflets remain vague and doctors may not be adequately informing patients. The article details dozens of similar cases where the medication led to life-ruining behaviors.</p>

          <p>A strike by employees of Republic Services, a major private waste-management company, has left trash piling up in cities across the United States for over three weeks. The Teamsters union, representing the workers, argues that its members are underpaid and receive inferior benefits compared to other sanitation workers. The dispute, which began in the Boston area, has spread to several other states, impacting millions of residents. While the company and union trade accusations, and some local disputes have been resolved, many workers remain on strike, forcing municipalities to find alternative disposal methods.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed that the explosion that killed three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies last week was caused by the detonation of a grenade at a training facility. The deputies had recovered two grenades from a Santa Monica garage, believing them to be inert. In a troubling development, authorities also announced that the second grenade from the scene is now missing, and an extensive search is underway. The incident, the department's largest loss of life since 1857, has prompted an immediate policy change to treat all recovered explosive devices as live.</p>
