Trump characterized the sit-down as a "feel-out meeting" and expressed skepticism about Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's involvement in initial talks, suggesting a subsequent meeting could include all three leaders. The summit has raised concerns among European allies and in Ukraine that any deal might favor Russian interests, particularly regarding territorial claims.</p>

The move follows recent trade negotiations in Stockholm and reflects the administration's unpredictable approach to trade policy, which has created uncertainty for businesses.

          <p>President Trump announced the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and has placed the city's Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control to address what he termed a crime crisis. Invoking the D.C. Home Rule Act, the president declared a "liberation day" for the capital, a move expected to last 30 days. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the action "unsettling and unprecedented" but stated the city would comply, while noting that local data shows a recent decline in violent crime.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a warning to President Trump, stating he will push to redraw his state's congressional maps if Republican-led states like Texas proceed with their own partisan redistricting efforts. In a letter, Newsom accused the GOP of attempting to "rig the upcoming midterm elections" and argued that California cannot stand by while this "power grab" unfolds.

The energy drink giant is known for transforming sports teams, but former player Jamie Noon cautions that a return to the club's star-studded glory days may be slow. With the player recruitment cycle for next season largely complete, Red Bull's initial focus will likely be on stabilization and long-term strategic building rather than immediate, high-profile signings.</p>
