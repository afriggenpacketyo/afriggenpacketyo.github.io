          <p>After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, President Trump questioned why President Vladimir Putin would continue to attack Ukraine while the United States is trying to broker peace talks. Trump suggested Putin may need to be dealt with differently, hinting at more sanctions, signaling a potential shift in US policy. This interaction provides a glimmer of hope for Ukrainians, who are wary of a peace plan that would force Kyiv to abandon NATO aspirations and recognize Crimea as Russian, which the Trump administration had previously supported.</p>

          <p>Tees Valley mayor Lord Houchen suggested that the Conservative Party might need to form a coalition with Reform UK to prevent Labour from gaining power in the next general election. This proposal contrasts with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's stance, who ruled out a coalition with Nigel Farage's party at a national level, while Reform UK also dismissed any intention of forming coalitions with the Tories. The comments highlight the challenges the Tories face, with Reform UK potentially eroding their voter base, and reflect broader political maneuvering ahead of local elections.</p>

          <p>The Palestinian health ministry reports that the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 52,000 as Israel continues its offensive after ending its ceasefire with Hamas. The renewed offensive, initiated in March, has included daily strikes and the expansion of a buffer zone around Rafah, effectively sealing off the territory's two million residents from essential imports. Aid groups warn of imminent supply shortages and widespread malnutrition, with Palestinians relying on limited canned goods and facing soaring prices for scarce fresh produce. Negotiations for hostage release remain stalled, with Hamas demanding a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that President Trump's first 100 days in office have been marked by significant changes, but also a growing concern over his focus on tariffs. While he maintains strong support from his base, disapproval is rising among independents and some who voted for him in 2024, particularly regarding his handling of the economy and inflation. The poll highlights a partisan divide, with Republicans viewing the changes positively and Democrats expressing frustration, and also finds that most Americans believe Trump is making major changes to how the government and economy work.</p>

The author notes the discomfort surrounding the publication of Joan Didion's therapy journals and emphasizes the importance of having a safe space for personal reflection, free from public scrutiny. The author argues for the value of private diaries as a means of documenting life's experiences, but ultimately supports the idea of destroying them to protect the diarist's privacy and avoid exposing their vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan following a deadly militant attack on tourists in contested Kashmir, with troops exchanging fire along the Line of Control for a third consecutive day. Pakistan has called for a neutral investigation into the attack and rejected India's accusations of supporting cross-border terrorism. India has announced retaliatory measures, including suspending a water-sharing treaty and downgrading diplomatic ties, while also conducting a manhunt for the suspected attackers and launching naval drills.</p>

          <p>The US administration's announcement of "reciprocal tariffs" has sent global markets into turmoil and delivered a devastating blow to the global economy and the multilateral trading system. The IMF warned of a rising US recession threat and a “significant slowdown” in the global economy. The US administration claims that one reason for imposing the “reciprocal tariffs” is because it feels “ripped off” by China and other trading partners, citing its “large and persistent” trade goods deficits.
