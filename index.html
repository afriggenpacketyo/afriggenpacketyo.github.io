          <p>Netflix announced that its ad-supported tier has reached 94 million monthly active users, marking a significant increase of over 20 million since November. This growth reflects the company's strategy to boost profitability through advertising, following the introduction of the ad-supported plan in November 2022. The cheaper plan, priced at $7.99 per month, offers a substantial discount compared to the ad-free plan at $17.99 per month. Netflix claims its ad tier attracts a higher level of attention, especially among 18- to 34-year-olds, surpassing U.S. broadcast and cable networks.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Capital One, alleging that the bank misled customers by not informing them about higher interest rates available in a new savings product. The lawsuit claims Capital One marketed its "360 Savings" account as high-yield but failed to notify customers about the "360 Performance Savings" account, which offered substantially higher interest rates. As interest rates rose in 2022, Capital One allegedly froze the interest rate of its 360 Savings product, causing customers to miss out on millions of dollars in potential earnings. This action follows a similar suit by the CFPB, which was dropped earlier in the year.</p>

The judge refuted the government's claims, stating there was no evidence Suri made statements supporting Hamas and that his detention was caused by his speech. The ACLU, representing Suri, called his detention an attack on students and academics for their views on the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Joseph Nye, who recently passed away at 88, is remembered for coining the term "soft power," which refers to influence gained through aid, culture, news, and promotion of human rights. Nye's concept contrasted with traditional "hard power" based on military and economic strength. He served in the State Department and Pentagon under Presidents Carter and Clinton and was dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Nye's approach to foreign policy stood in stark contrast to Donald Trump's, as he criticized Trump's undermining of institutions crucial to soft power.</p>

Experts recommend taking the initiative rather than waiting for interest rates to drop significantly.

Exploring alternatives like a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan may also prove advantageous. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The director of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has been reinstated, along with several teams at the agency, reversing previous layoff notices. This reversal comes ahead of congressional hearings with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs. Reinstated staff include those in respiratory health, safety research, compensation and analysis support, and the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. Some NIOSH programs are expected to resume after being hobbled by the layoffs.</p>

          <p>The term "Nakba," meaning catastrophe, refers to the Palestinian loss of their homeland between 1947 and 1949, resulting in the displacement of around 700,000 Palestinians. Nakba Day, commemorated annually on May 15, marks the beginning of the Arab-Israeli war and serves as a day of protest against displacement. Most Palestinians ended up as stateless refugees in neighboring Arab countries, and the "right of return" for Palestinian refugees remains a contentious issue. Despite various attempts to resolve the conflict, the two-state solution faces increasing doubts, especially amid ongoing violence and displacement in Gaza.</p>

          <p>House GOP lawmakers have unveiled a tax section of their economic bill that includes measures targeting blue-collar and older constituencies. The provisions would eliminate taxes on tips and overtime, give new cuts to seniors, and make interest on certain auto loans deductible. These tax breaks would also apply to American-made recreational rides like all-terrain vehicles, campers, and trailers. The tip, overtime, senior, and auto loan breaks will cost $292 billion total, even though theyâ€™re all set to expire after 2028 in order to save money on paper.</p>
