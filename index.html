            <h2>UK Government Takes Control of British Steel to Prevent Closure</h2>

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, owned by Chinese firm Jingye, to prevent its closure and secure raw materials to keep blast furnaces running. The plant employs 2,700 people and is the last in the UK producing virgin steel, crucial for major construction projects. Jingye had intended to refuse to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, threatening primary steel making. The government invoked emergency legislation, retaining Jingye as owner but gaining control to order materials and direct the workforce, with nationalization a likely future option. The plant has been losing money due to challenging market conditions, tariffs, and costs associated with lower-carbon production.</p>

            <p>The government has suspended kitchen use in high-security prison separation centers following an attack by Manchester Arena bomber Hashem Abedi on three prison officers. Abedi threw hot oil and stabbed the officers with blades fashioned from cooking trays. Two male officers remain hospitalized with serious injuries, while a female officer has been discharged. The suspension aims to prevent similar incidents involving dangerous and extremist inmates.</p>

            <p>Pfizer has decided to discontinue the development of its experimental daily weight loss pill, danuglipron, after a patient experienced a liver injury during a trial. Although the patient did not exhibit liver-related symptoms, the company decided to halt development after reviewing clinical data and receiving input from regulators. The company remains committed to developing other weight loss drugs, despite this setback in the competitive GLP-1 market. The company said that the patient's liver enzymes "recovered rapidly" after they stopped taking the pill.</p>

            <p>This article explains what tariffs are and why President Trump is using them, noting that tariffs are taxes on goods bought from other countries. Trump argues that tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, but economists expect them to push up prices for consumers and cause volatility in global stock markets. The article details various tariff announcements and their potential impact on the US and other countries, including the UK. Overall, the impact of Trump's tariffs on the world economy is still unfolding, but most economists expect the effects to be negative.</p>

            <p>A recent survey indicates that over 60% of CEOs anticipate a recession within the next six months, driven by concerns over President Trump's tariff policies. The survey highlights a decline in CEOs' views on current business conditions and a growing expectation of rising costs. However, some CEOs foresee improved business conditions over the next year, and Trump's recent exemptions for smartphones and PCs from tariffs may provide some relief. The results underscore growing apprehension within corporate America regarding the future of the U.S. economy.</p>

Restrictions imposed by the Dutch government, under pressure from the U.S., limit ASML's ability to sell its most advanced equipment to Chinese buyers. Previously, massive purchases of lower-end equipment had driven Dutch shipments to China, but this trend is now reversing as ASML clears its backlog of orders.</p>
