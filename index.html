        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temu and Shein, Chinese-funded e-commerce platforms, are planning to raise prices for American consumers due to increased operational costs from new global trade rules and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. These tariffs, including a 145% levy on most Chinese goods and the cancellation of a tax exemption for items under $800, have impacted the business models of both companies. Both companies have encouraged customers to continue shopping in the coming days. Shein sells affordable clothing, cosmetics, and accessories, while Temu offers a wider range of products, including household goods and electronics.</p>

          <p>Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche has announced a $50 billion investment in the United States over the next five years, creating over 12,000 jobs.

The move comes amid concerns about potential tariffs on pharmaceutical goods from abroad, threatened by President Trump.

          <p>Qatari and Egyptian mediators have proposed a new ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas, envisioning a truce lasting five to seven years. The proposal includes the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a formal end to the war, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas has reportedly signaled a willingness to hand over governance of Gaza to a mutually agreed-upon Palestinian entity. Talks are scheduled to take place in Cairo with senior Hamas representatives to discuss the proposal, which follows the collapse of a previous ceasefire and continued Israeli military operations.</p>

          <p>The introduction of ATMs in cash-based societies like Tuvalu and the increasing prevalence of self-checkouts and AI chatbots are contributing to the erosion of human contact. While technology offers convenience and efficiency, it has insidiously replaced human interaction in areas where it is essential, leading to increased loneliness and unhappiness. Studies show that many people prefer human interaction in retail settings, and reliance on technology can negatively impact mental health, particularly among young people. Some businesses are beginning to recognize the importance of human contact and are introducing initiatives to address loneliness.</p>

          <p>The military regime in Burkina Faso has announced that its intelligence service thwarted a coup attempt planned by individuals in neighboring Ivory Coast. Interim President Ibrahim Traore, who came to power in a 2022 coup, has accused Ivory Coast of harboring his opponents. The government claims the plot aimed to sow chaos and involved an assault on the presidency, leading to the questioning of several officers and non-commissioned officers.

          <p>CATL, the world's largest supplier of EV batteries, has announced a new battery that it claims has set a new global record for superfast charging technology. The second-generation Shenxing battery can add 520 km of driving range from just five minutes of charging time. This would put CATL's fast charging ahead of BYD, which recently claimed its system could add about 400 km of range in 5 minutes. If proven feasible on a larger scale, the tech could help the EV industry alleviate consumer concerns about electric vehicle range and convenience.</p>
