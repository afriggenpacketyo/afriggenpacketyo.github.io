          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 22:23:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing activity experienced a worse-than-expected contraction in July, marking the fourth straight month of decline. The official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered at 49.3, falling short of the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. This downturn is attributed to a combination of factors including ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., a traditional off-season, and severe weather events like extreme heat and torrential rain. Sub-indexes for employment and new orders also showed contraction, signaling broader economic weakness despite leaders not indicating plans for major new stimulus. (not investment advice)</p>

In a public statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection on her public service career, she has decided her leadership will not be in elected office for now. This decision follows her 2024 presidential campaign and keeps the door open for a potential White House run in 2028. Sources close to Harris indicated that while she considered leading her home state, she believes she can have a greater impact on the national stage and plans to support Democratic candidates. </p>

          <p>A powerful explosion at the Horizon Biofuels plant in Fremont, Nebraska, has resulted in the deaths of three people: an adult male employee and two young girls. The two children were reportedly at the facility waiting for the employee to attend a doctor's appointment when the blast occurred. The explosion tore apart a large tower at the plant, which produces animal bedding and wood pellets, scattering debris and causing a fire that smoldered for nearly a day. The incident has shifted from a rescue to a recovery operation, leaving the local community in mourning over the tragic loss of life.</p>

          <p>The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) has established a $1.3 million legal defense fund to support Christians and churches in Europe facing legal challenges over their beliefs. The fund was created using money from court settlements BGEA won in the U.K. after its events were canceled, with an additional contribution from Samaritan’s Purse. Franklin Graham stated the initiative aims to help those who are "threatened or intimidated into silence" for expressing their faith. Cissie Graham Lynch, his daughter, emphasized that the effort is also meant to encourage believers in the U.S. to stand firm against what they see as growing hostility toward public expressions of faith.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling by more than half compared to the previous year and missing analyst expectations. The primary cause for the decline was a staggering 93.8% plunge in profits from its crucial chip division, which has faced inventory adjustments and increased competition. While the company's mobile division saw an uptick in sales from its Galaxy S25 and A series smartphones, it was not enough to offset the massive downturn in the semiconductor business. The company plans to focus on high-demand AI-driven products to strengthen its competitiveness in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic shift, key U.S. allies including Canada, the United Kingdom, and France have announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, creating a clear divergence from the United States' long-standing policy. This coordinated move is aimed at rekindling the two-state solution amid the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The announcements were made during a French-Saudi-led conference at the United Nations, which the Trump administration boycotted, labeling it an "insult." This growing chasm highlights the increasing international pressure for a long-term peace plan, as European and Arab nations attempt to fill a strategic vacuum left by the U.S.</p>

          <p>One of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded, with a magnitude of 8.8, struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean. The powerful temblor prompted immediate tsunami warnings and some evacuations in Hawaii, Japan, and along the U.S. West Coast. While the most significant waves, some over 10 feet, were observed near the epicenter in Russia, the impact on other regions was less severe than initially feared, with most warnings later downgraded to advisories. The event caused widespread alerts and precautionary measures, but fortunately, no major damage or grave injuries have been reported outside the immediate vicinity of the quake.</p>

This surprise move caused U.S. copper prices on the Comex exchange to drop significantly, narrowing the large price premium that had built up over the London benchmark in anticipation of sweeping restrictions.

The average U.S. tariff rate has surged to its highest level in nearly a century, leading to a tripling of monthly tariff revenue for the government. However, the policy has also had unintended consequences, such as a temporary widening of the U.S. trade deficit as companies stockpiled goods to avoid the new taxes. While some countries are shifting trade patterns to adapt, economists warn that the tariffs are beginning to translate into higher prices for American consumers on certain imported goods.

          <p>Gilbert Arenas, a former three-time NBA All-Star, has been arrested and charged with running an illegal, high-stakes poker operation from his Los Angeles-area home. Federal prosecutors allege that Arenas rented out his mansion for the games and directed co-defendants, including a suspected organized crime figure, to manage the operation. The indictment claims the ring hired women to provide companionship to players and employed armed security. Arenas, who pleaded not guilty and was released on bond, faces charges of operating an illegal gambling business and making false statements to investigators, carrying a potential sentence of up to 15 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the recent major earthquake off Russia's coast, this article provides a detailed explanation of the science behind tsunamis. A tsunami is typically generated by a strong underwater earthquake, usually magnitude 6.5 or higher, that causes a vertical shift of the seafloor. The resulting waves travel at speeds comparable to a jet airplane in the deep ocean but slow down and increase dramatically in height as they approach shallower coastal waters. Experts emphasize that a tsunami is a series of powerful waves, not a single event, and urge the public to heed all official warnings and evacuate to higher ground immediately.</p>

          <p>A research expedition to the deepest parts of the Pacific Ocean has discovered what scientists describe as "thriving communities" of strange and extreme life at depths of over 9,000 meters. Using a human-occupied submersible, a Chinese-led team observed and photographed vast fields of tube worms, beds of clams, and mats of bacteria. These lifeforms exist in total darkness and under immense pressure, fueled by chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life and suggest that these chemosynthetic ecosystems may be widespread in the planet's deepest, unexplored regions.</p>

These scientists point out that studies often rely on self-reporting and fail to distinguish between different types of screen use. The lack of clear guidance from major health organizations has left parents navigating a contentious issue, with some advocating for smartphone bans while others worry about creating a "forbidden fruit" effect.</p>

By working with a researcher who reproduces ancient tattoos, archaeologists concluded the decorations were likely stenciled before being applied with multi-pointed tools.

          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's coast did not cause a global catastrophe, and scientists have explained why. A key factor was the tsunami's directionality; much of its energy was projected into the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching populated coastlines. Additionally, the most heavily impacted areas near the epicenter were sparsely populated. While the event triggered extensive alerts, the combination of its location, the direction of energy, and effective warning systems meant that the world "dodged a bullet" from a potentially devastating event.</p>
