          <p>Following a lengthy phone call with President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced he will travel to Washington D.C. for a meeting on Monday. This development comes after the summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which aimed to address the ongoing war. The announcement was made amidst continued conflict, as Ukraine reported repelling numerous Russian drone attacks overnight across the country. Trump advised Zelenskyy to "make the deal," emphasizing Russia's power while deferring final negotiations and potential sanctions.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all its flights, affecting an estimated 130,000 passengers daily, as over 10,000 flight attendants began a 72-hour strike. The industrial action, organized by the union CUPE, centers on demands for higher salaries and payment for ground time, such as during boarding. The airline stated it had offered a significant compensation increase, which the union rejected as being below inflation and market value. The strike has led to the cancellation of around 500 flights per day, with the airline advising affected passengers not to go to the airport.</p>

They account for nearly 48% of all first-time permit holders and 61% of those who have renewed their five-year visas.

Despite Trump describing the talks as having made "great progress," no tangible breakthrough was announced, and a planned working lunch was canceled. Putin reiterated Russia's longstanding demands, including Ukraine's withdrawal from four partially occupied regions, indicating no shift in his position. Following the summit, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who confirmed he would travel to Washington for further discussions.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China are expressing growing concerns about the sustainability of Washington's expanding national debt, leading to calls for China to reduce its exposure to U.S. dollar assets. In a central bank-supervised publication, they labeled the expansion of U.S. Treasuries as "unsustainable," despite not yet reaching a default threshold. This sentiment aligns with recent data showing China has been trimming its holdings, which are currently at their lowest level since 2009. The researchers recommend a gradual adjustment, suggesting an increase in reserves of gold and other strategic materials instead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis piece posits that Russian President Vladimir Putin is the primary beneficiary of the Alaska summit, gaining a global spotlight and a propaganda victory without having to concede to a ceasefire. The article argues that Donald Trump is a clear loser, having offered a red carpet welcome to the Russian leader while receiving nothing tangible in return. For Ukrainians, the outcome is seen as a major setback, as the lack of a deal means the war continues unabated, sparking fury and frustration. The summit is interpreted as a signal of diminishing U.S. commitment, leaving Ukraine and its European allies increasingly isolated.</p>

The test confirmed that the powerful YF-100K engines could operate in sync under various power conditions, providing essential data for the superheavy launcher's development. The Long March-10 is designed to be powerful enough to send a crewed spacecraft and a lunar lander into a trans-lunar orbit. Two separate launches will be required for the mission, with the vehicles rendezvousing in lunar orbit before the landing attempt.</p>

It highlights Putin's reinforcement of Trump's claims about a "rigged" 2020 election, a tactic that appeared to resonate deeply with the U.S. President.

          <p>This article provides five main takeaways from the meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, emphasizing the lack of a concrete peace deal for Ukraine. The first point highlights the warm, red-carpet welcome for Putin, which served as a significant symbolic victory, bringing him back onto the world stage. Another takeaway is that no tangible progress on a ceasefire was announced, with Putin reiterating maximalist demands and Trump remaining vague about the discussions. The article also notes the unusual brevity of Trump's statement and the absence of any mention of the "severe consequences" he had previously threatened against Russia.</p>

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a redistricting proposal aimed at giving their party an advantage in up to five U.S. House seats, a direct response to similar Republican efforts in Texas. The plan would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval to reshape district lines ahead of the midterm elections, potentially solidifying Democratic control in the state's delegation. The proposed maps create oddly shaped districts to maximize partisan advantage, drawing criticism from Republicans who accuse Democrats of gerrymandering. The move sets up a significant political and legal battle over congressional maps and control of the U.S. House.</p>
