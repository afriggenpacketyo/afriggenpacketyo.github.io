        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Severe storms and flash flooding across the central United States have resulted in at least nine deaths, including a 9-year-old boy in Kentucky who was swept away while walking to his school bus stop. The National Weather Service is forecasting potentially historic rainfall and temperature swings, with some areas expected to receive 10-20 inches of rain. States of emergency have been declared in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and over 162,000 people are without power in Arkansas, Texas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. Forecasters warn that swollen rivers and high winds will continue to pose a danger even after the rain stops.</p>

          <p>Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones stated that the era of globalisation has ended following President Trump's new tariffs, which include a 10% import duty on the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has suggested state intervention to protect UK firms, and Jones emphasized the need to build relationships with allies and invest in the UK economy. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch disagreed that globalisation was over, pointing to strong trading relationships with other countries. The UK government is pursuing a trade deal with the US, but the Liberal Democrats are calling for a parliamentary vote on any deal struck with Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study reveals that over half of millennials are working multiple jobs, a phenomenon known as "polyworking," to supplement their income amid rising inflation and stagnant wages. Nearly a quarter of these workers hold three jobs, and a third have four or more income streams outside their full-time employment. While some view this trend as entrepreneurial, critics worry about the long-term effects on work-life balance and family time. The rise of polyworking reflects a changing workplace landscape where traditional employment models are no longer sufficient for many to maintain financial stability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a decision that has sparked controversy given widespread public anger toward the for-profit healthcare industry. Defense attorneys are likely to focus on mitigating factors, such as Mangione's lack of criminal history and potential mental health issues, during the trial's penalty phase. The case has taken on broader cultural significance, with some viewing Mangione as a symbol of resistance against a system perceived as exploitative. The decision to seek the death penalty adds further complexity to an already highly charged legal battle.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging over 2,200 points and the Nasdaq entering a bear market, driven by concerns over the economic fallout from new U.S. tariffs and a potential global trade war. President Trump's announcement of steep tariffs has led economists to downgrade their forecasts for U.S. economic growth, with the Federal Reserve warning of higher inflation and slower growth. The S&P 500 also saw its largest one-day drop since March 2020, wiping out trillions of dollars in investor wealth. Analysts suggest the U.S. could face a recession unless tariffs are eased.

          <p>Immigrants with pending cases, appeals, or parole are increasingly fearful of routine check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as the Trump administration broadens its mandate for arrests and deportations.

Lawyers are advising clients to prepare for potential detention, but cannot advise them to skip check-ins, which would violate immigration regulations.

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover is pausing all shipments to the US as it addresses new trading terms after the implementation of tariffs. A 25% levy on car imports has come into effect, impacting global supply chains. Nissan is considering shifting some US-bound vehicle production from Japan to the US. Stellantis will temporarily shut down its assembly plant in Windsor, Canada, due to the tariffs.

          <p>Federal student loan borrowers face uncertainty as the Biden administration's SAVE plan is blocked by legal challenges, and the Trump administration alters repayment terms. Borrowers can remain in an interest-free forbearance, but this does not count toward loan forgiveness. Other IDR plans are available, but automatic loan forgiveness is currently unavailable under ICR or PAYE. Borrowers should carefully explore their options and understand the terms of their repayment plan to navigate the changing landscape. (not investment advice)<br/><i></p>

          <p>Taiwan is increasingly concerned that China's large-scale joint combat drills could escalate into a real attack by the People's Liberation Army (PLA), leaving the island with little time to respond. The PLA's regular drills, which simulate amphibious landings and precision strikes, are eroding buffer zones and raising questions about Taiwan's military readiness. A former Taiwanese air force commander warned that warplanes could reach Taipei within minutes of crossing the median line in the Taiwan Strait.</p>

          <p>The author discusses financial independence in relationships, particularly when one partner earns significantly more than the other. It challenges the idea of strict 50/50 splits, advocating for a recognition of interdependence rather than a pursuit of absolute independence. Drawing on philosophical and feminist perspectives, the article suggests that true strength lies in acknowledging vulnerability and trusting in the goodwill of a partner, leading to a more profound and equitable connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the growing divide between the "comfort class" – those born into financial stability – and the majority of Americans who live paycheck to paycheck. This disconnect leads to a lack of understanding and empathy in policy-making, as well as resentment from those who feel their concerns are being ignored. The author argues that the rise of populism, including the election of Donald Trump, is a result of this class-based alienation.</p>
