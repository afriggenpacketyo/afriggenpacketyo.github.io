          <p>Amazon reported first-quarter earnings exceeding expectations, but provided cautious guidance for the second quarter, citing potential impacts from tariffs, trade policies, and recessionary fears. CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs, particularly on goods sourced from China, which could affect both Amazon's retail operations and third-party sellers. Despite these challenges, Jassy expressed optimism that Amazon could emerge stronger due to its diverse seller base and ability to offer low prices, drawing parallels to the company's performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The article notes that while Amazon's cloud division's revenue fell slightly short of estimates, advertising revenue was a bright spot, growing 19% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>The Chamber of Commerce has requested the Trump administration to provide tariff exclusions for small businesses importing goods, warning that tariffs could severely harm Main Street and potentially trigger a recession. President Suzanne Clark emphasized that small businesses lack the financial buffer to absorb tariff increases, unlike larger corporations such as Amazon, Temu and Shein. The Chamber's letter to the Treasury Secretary highlights that tariffs could force small businesses to raise prices, leading to declines in consumer spending and potential financial ruin. Senator Ed Markey has also called for tariff exemptions for small businesses, citing their vulnerability to price shocks and supply chain disruptions.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to ask the CDC to develop new guidance for treating measles, focusing on drugs and vitamins, despite his controversial remarks promoting unproven treatments and questioning measles vaccines. Kennedy has touted budesonide and clarithromycin as effective measles treatments, citing anecdotal evidence from two Texas doctors, but experts caution that these drugs are not antivirals and should only be used to manage severe complications under medical supervision. The CDC continues to recommend vaccination as the primary prevention method, while also warning against the overuse of vitamin A, which, although helpful in reducing severe illness risks, can be toxic in high doses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has removed Mike Waltz as national security advisor, nominating him as ambassador to the United Nations, and temporarily replaced him with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who will maintain both roles. Sources suggest Waltz's removal was due to a Signal chat controversy where sensitive military plans were discussed, and a perception that he did not properly vet National Security Council staff. While Trump praised Waltz's service, some officials believe the Senate might struggle to confirm him, potentially allowing Trump to remove him entirely. The BBC's report notes that Waltz had mistakenly added a journalist to a secure Signal chat where plans for a strike on Yemen's Houthis were discussed.</p>

CEO Tim Cook addressed the impact of tariffs on Apple's business, stating that the company saw "limited impact" in the March quarter due to supply chain optimization. Apple expects tariffs to add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter but noted difficulty in predicting beyond June due to tariff uncertainty. Cook stated that Apple is already sourcing a significant portion of iPhones from India and other products from Vietnam to mitigate tariff costs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Michael Waltz will be nominated as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim national security advisor while maintaining his current role. This marks the first Cabinet shuffle of Trump's second term, and sources indicate that Waltz's departure was prompted by a Signal chat incident involving a reporter and top Trump officials. The article notes that Waltz responded to Trump's announcement on X, expressing his honor to continue serving the president and the nation. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce learned of Rubio's appointment during a press briefing, expressing surprise but acknowledging Rubio's versatility.</p>

          <p>Small U.S. businesses are urgently seeking relief from President Trump's tariffs, warning that rising costs and disrupted supply chains are pushing many companies to the brink of collapse. At an event organized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, business owners and experts called for immediate action, including automatic exclusions for small importers and exemptions for products not readily available domestically. The Chamber sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other officials, emphasizing that over 40 million U.S. jobs depend on trade. President Trump imposed a cumulative 145% tariff on Chinese imports and a 10% universal tariff on goods from other countries.</p>

The charges stem from a mercury exposure incident at a car wash owned by Kulikoff, where an individual spilled mercury inside an SUV and then attempted to clean it with a vacuum cleaner. Authorities allege that Kulikoff conspired with another person to move the contaminated SUV outside of California City to avoid jurisdiction. If convicted, Kulikoff faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for conspiracy to transport hazardous waste.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported a steep sales drop at U.S. restaurants in its first-quarter earnings report, attributing the decline to economic uncertainty and diminished consumer sentiment, with tariffs playing a significant role. CEO Chris Kempczinski stated that "heightened anxiety" about the economy, driven largely by tariffs, is weighing on lower-income Americans. Traffic to U.S. restaurants fell more sharply than anticipated, and Kempczinski acknowledged that McDonald's is not immune to the volatility in the industry. The article notes that many companies are pulling back on growth due to uncertainty caused by evolving tariff rates, and consumers are delaying purchases due to concerns about inflation.</p>

The bill, AB 379, originally included a provision extending the same punishment for soliciting minors under 16 to those who solicited 16- and 17-year-olds. Democrats removed that provision due to concerns that enhanced punishments could be used to target children in LGBT or interracial relationships that their families disapprove of.</p>

The potential deal would lower the standards schools must meet to demonstrate compliance with state law and delay consequences for private schools that flout education law.
