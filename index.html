          <p>The article examines the ongoing political pressure on former President Donald Trump regarding his past association with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial. Public figures, survivors of Epstein's abuse, and bipartisan politicians are demanding the full release of unredacted "Epstein files" to ensure transparency and hold all involved parties accountable for their roles in the sex trafficking network. Despite Trump's attempts to distance himself, his past praise for Epstein and the recent posthumous memoir from survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre have intensified calls for justice, though the article notes many of his supporters remain loyal.</p>

          <p>A large-scale police manhunt is in progress for Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu had been sentenced to 12 months in prison for sexually assaulting a schoolgirl and was scheduled for deportation upon completion of his sentence. Justice Secretary David Lammy stated the 41-year-old is now "at large" in London, prompting criticism from political figures who described the error as "totally unacceptable." The incident has highlighted concerns about systemic failures within the UK prison system, with an investigation underway and one officer removed from discharge duties pending the outcome.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a new war" following the deployment of the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Caribbean. This move significantly increases U.S. military presence in the region, ostensibly as part of an anti-drug trafficking operation that has already included ten air strikes on vessels. However, with the U.S. not recognizing Maduro's legitimacy and President Trump previously suggesting potential "land action," there are widespread fears in Venezuela that the military buildup is a precursor to a regime change effort, an interpretation shared by some regional analysts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina recounts his decision to invest in the AI voice startup ElevenLabs in 2022 after just a 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski. At the time, voice AI was an overlooked market, but Reina was convinced by Staniszewski's technical expertise and deep understanding of the industry's core problems, such as the need for non-robotic-sounding voices. Founded in 2022, ElevenLabs specializes in advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning technology and has since achieved a valuation of over $3 billion. Reina's investment strategy focuses on identifying technically proficient founders in industries not yet considered popular or "sexy" by other venture capitalists.</p>

          <p>As he embarks on a five-day diplomatic tour of Asia, former President Donald Trump has indicated he is open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The trip includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, where he is scheduled to hold high-stakes trade negotiations with Chinese President Xi Jinping to de-escalate their ongoing trade war. While U.S. officials have downplayed the possibility of a meeting with Kim, Trump's comments have fueled speculation. The tour's agenda also includes signing a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia and meeting with Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, highlighting a period of intense diplomatic activity.</p>

          <p>Great Britain celebrated significant victories at the Track World Championships in Chile, with Josh Tarling and Josh Charlton both winning gold medals. Tarling secured the nation's first gold of the event in the men's points race, strategically gaining a lap on his competitors to finish with 750 points. Shortly after, 22-year-old Charlton dominated the individual pursuit, becoming the first British man to win the world title in that event since Bradley Wiggins in 2008. The wins, along with a bronze medal for Joe Truman in the 1km time trial, brought Great Britain's total medal count to seven after three days of competition.</p>

          <p>Following the Los Angeles Dodgers' decisive 11-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of the World Series, questions have arisen about whether a week-long layoff negatively impacted their performance. The break, their longest since February, came after they swept the National League Championship Series and may have disrupted their routine, making pitchers feel "too fresh" and affecting their command. Pitchers Blake Snell and Emmet Sheehan, who had extended rests, struggled significantly during the game's pivotal sixth inning. While the team officially dismisses rust as an excuse, historical data shows that teams with long breaks before the World Series have consistently underperformed.</p>

          <p>On the eve of parliamentary elections, Argentine President Javier Milei is confronting significant political challenges as public discontent grows over his radical austerity policies. While his "shock therapy" approach has successfully curbed hyperinflation and achieved a budget surplus, it has come at a high cost for citizens, leading to a severe recession, a 20% drop in real wages, and widespread business closures. Former allies have abandoned him, citing corruption and neglect of the middle class, and his popularity has fallen to 40%. The upcoming election is seen as a crucial test of his mandate, with polls indicating a tight race against the resurgent Peronist opposition.</p>

His teammates and captain describe him as a "cheat code" capable of creating opportunities from nothing, a reputation he earned with standout performances for both his club and the national team.

The new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, funded by major corporations and individuals, is designed to host large events.

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is expected to rapidly intensify into a major hurricane over the weekend, posing a significant threat to Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The National Hurricane Center has warned of "life-threatening and catastrophic" flash flooding and landslides, with some areas potentially receiving up to three feet of rain. A hurricane warning is currently in effect for Jamaica, with the storm's center projected to pass near or over the island early next week. While the mainland United States is not expected to face major impacts, the storm's powerful winds and heavy rainfall present a severe danger to the Caribbean nations in its path.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to South Korea for the APEC summit is being interpreted by experts as a symbolic and carefully planned step toward repairing strained bilateral relations. While immediate major breakthroughs are not anticipated, the visit marks a crucial opportunity for dialogue and resetting ties, which have been tense. This will be Xi's first visit since 2014, a time considered a high point in Beijing-Seoul relations that led to a free-trade agreement. The discussions are expected to be a key indicator of the future direction of diplomatic and economic cooperation between the two neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Pew Research Center highlights the dramatic growth of the Latino population in the United States, which has nearly doubled from 35.3 million in 2000 to 68 million today. Latinos now constitute one in five Americans and accounted for over half of the nation's total population growth in that period. The report also notes key demographic shifts: the population is young, with a median age of 31, and a large majority (79%) are U.S. citizens. People of Mexican origin remain the largest subgroup, while California and Texas are home to the largest Latino populations, where they are the largest ethnic group in each state.</p>

          <p>During a protest against a planned immigration enforcement surge, officers fired upon a U-Haul truck that was reversing toward a line of law enforcement personnel outside a U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, California. The driver was wounded and is being held for a mental health evaluation. The protest was organized in response to the Trump administration's plan to deploy Border Patrol agents to the Bay Area, an operation that was later reportedly canceled. The incident occurred after a day of demonstrations, during which authorities had earlier used flash bangs and smoke grenades to disperse crowds attempting to block the base entrance.</p>

          <p>Queen Mother Sirikit of Thailand has died at the age of 93, as announced by the Royal Household Bureau. She had been hospitalized with a blood infection and had been largely out of the public eye for several years due to poor health. As the wife of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who passed away in 2016, she was a central and revered figure in Thai society for nearly seven decades. Her birthday, August 12, is celebrated nationally as Mother's Day in her honor, recognizing her role as the "Mother of the Thai Nation." She is survived by her four children, including the current monarch, King Vajiralongkorn.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico have petitioned a U.S. appeals court to block a Trump administration order that would terminate their joint venture by January 1. The partnership allows the airlines to coordinate flights, pricing, and scheduling for U.S.-Mexico routes, but the Department of Transportation has ordered its dissolution, citing anti-competitive effects. The airlines argue the termination is "arbitrary and capricious," warning of severe operational disruptions, potential route cancellations, and the loss of up to $800 million in annual consumer benefits if the order proceeds.
