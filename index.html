          <h2>Tesla Launches Model Y in India at a High Price Point Amid Steep Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:47:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV at a starting price of nearly $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries. This premium pricing is a direct result of India's substantial import tariffs and luxury taxes, positioning the vehicle to compete with luxury brands like BMW rather than mass-market EVs. Analysts suggest this initial launch is a strategic move to "test the waters" and build a brand presence, rather than aiming for high sales volume immediately. The company's future pricing and manufacturing decisions in India will likely depend on potential changes to trade policies and the development of the local EV ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Veteran spinner Liam Dawson has been called up to the England cricket squad for the upcoming fourth Test against India, marking his potential return to Test cricket after an eight-year hiatus. The 35-year-old's inclusion comes after off-spinner Shoaib Bashir was ruled out for the remainder of the series due to a broken finger. Dawson's selection is a recognition of his exceptional domestic form, having been named the Professional Cricketers' Association player of the year for the last two seasons. His recall sees him chosen over fellow left-armer Jack Leach, who holds a central contract with England.</p>

          <h2>Upcoming Inflation Report to Test Trump Administration's Tariff Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:38:58 EDT</div>

          <p>A key inflation report is set for release, providing a crucial data point amid disagreements between the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve over the economic impact of tariffs. While President Trump has declared inflation "dead," economists anticipate a yearly rate of 2.7% for June, a notable increase from the previous month. The Federal Reserve has expressed concerns that tariffs will eventually push prices higher, a view contested by administration officials. This report will offer insight into whether the cooling inflation trend will continue or if tariff-related price hikes are beginning to take hold in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is rolling out a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars priced under £37,000. This initiative is part of a £650 million program aimed at helping the country meet its goal of banning new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030. While the government and some industry figures welcome the move to make EVs more affordable, critics argue it forces consumers toward a product they may not want. Concerns also persist about the adequacy of the UK's public charging infrastructure, which many see as a primary barrier to widespread EV adoption.</p>

The licensing reflects a broader trend of mainland Chinese financial institutions with international operations seeking to engage with the growing global crypto industry.

The decision comes after intense lobbying from tech leaders who argued that restrictions on sales to the world's largest tech market were hindering U.S. competitiveness. The prior ban was based on national security concerns that the chips could be used for military purposes. This policy shift is expected to significantly boost Nvidia's revenue and ease trade friction, though some analysts caution that Chinese firms will remain focused on domestic chip development due to policy unpredictability.</p>

The report's findings indicate that some Jewish employees and patients feel uneasy within the NHS and that some teachers inadvertently use antisemitic tropes.

          <p>A growing number of American families are choosing to have large families and give birth at home, driven by a deep distrust of the traditional medical system. This trend aligns with the pronatalist movement, which encourages higher birth rates, but also reflects skepticism towards hospital interventions and vaccines. Families like the Algers in Georgia point to the state's high maternal mortality rate as a reason for avoiding hospitals, despite data showing home births carry higher risks for infants. This movement highlights a cultural divide and a demand for more birthing options, as advocates call for better support and safety measures for mothers regardless of where they choose to deliver.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins are a rapidly growing segment of the cryptocurrency market, attracting interest from major companies and prompting new legislation in the U.S. Congress. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a fixed value by being backed by reserves of a stable asset, typically the U.S. dollar. This stability makes them a potential tool for instantaneous, low-fee global money transfers, revolutionizing payments for businesses and consumers. However, critics raise concerns about the safety of reserves, their potential use in illicit activities, and the systemic risks they could pose to the broader financial system if not properly regulated.

          <p>The upcoming EU-China summit in Beijing is facing diminished expectations after being shortened from two days to one, signaling China's limited willingness to address key trade frictions. The EU's primary complaint is its €400 billion trade deficit, which it attributes to China's restrictive market access and massive subsidies for domestic industries, leading to the "dumping" of products like electric vehicles. The EU has imposed tariffs and is demanding a level playing field, while also contending with China's export curbs on essential rare earth minerals. Despite US-China trade woes, analysts are skeptical that Beijing feels pressured to offer Europe significant concessions.</p>

          <p>After a slow start, England's Lionesses have secured a spot in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals with strong performances, drawing comparisons to their victorious 2022 campaign. An analysis shows that while they have scored fewer goals overall, the scoring has been more distributed among players this year. The team has directed more of its attack down the right flank to leverage Lauren James's talent. Defensively, they have conceded more goals than in the entire 2022 tournament, largely due to a tough opening match against France. However, tactical changes and effective use of substitutes have helped the team regain its form, demonstrating their ability to grow into a tournament.</p>

The case also involves accusations that after his arrest, Craig tried to hire a fellow inmate to kill the lead investigator.

          <p>Germany's Federal Constitutional Court has ruled that the German government did not violate international law by allowing the U.S. to use its Ramstein air base to relay signals for drone attacks in Yemen. The case was brought by two Yemeni men whose relatives were killed in a 2012 U.S. drone strike. While the court acknowledged Germany has an obligation to protect human rights even for foreigners abroad, it concluded it could not establish that the U.S. used unjustifiable criteria in the attack. Furthermore, the court determined the attack did not have a sufficient connection to German state authority to hold the government legally responsible.</p>

Analysts attribute the trend to capital rebalancing and increased interest in Hong Kong's tech sector amid breakthroughs in artificial intelligence.

This initiative is part of a broader strategy to "sharpen its legal tools" to protect national interests.
