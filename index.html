          <p>Asfandyar Mir's New York Times article discusses the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, triggered by a terrorist attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir. The article highlights a shift from past cycles of conflict followed by negotiation, to a more dangerous phase characterized by India's rise as a geopolitical power under Narendra Modi, and Pakistan's ongoing crises and unwillingness to back down on key issues. The United States' diminished role as a crisis manager further exacerbates the situation, increasing the risk of military escalation, potentially including nuclear threats, with severe global implications. The article urges immediate international intervention to de-escalate the conflict and restore equilibrium.</p>

          <p>This article from the South China Morning Post discusses a People's Liberation Army (PLA) study that raises concerns about the vulnerability of China's rapidly expanding nuclear power infrastructure in the event of a military conflict. With over 100 reactors, many located along the coast in sensitive geopolitical areas, the study warns that these plants could become prime targets, leading to catastrophic consequences if attacked. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, which challenged the immunity of civilian nuclear plants, has prompted Chinese military researchers to re-evaluate security risks and propose enhanced defense and emergency response strategies for these critical facilities.</p>

The meeting's stated purpose was to discuss New York City's priorities, including infrastructure, but Adams also thanked Trump for his past support during the corruption allegations. The released documents reveal that the FBI investigated Adams for potential witness tampering, though he was never charged.

          <p>This CBS News article reports that President Trump signaled a potential openness to lowering tariffs on China, suggesting an 80% tariff "seems right" ahead of trade talks in Switzerland.

          <p>This CBS News article reports that Rich Trumka Jr., a commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) fired by President Trump, plans to challenge his dismissal in court, claiming it is illegal. Trumka alleges his firing occurred after he and other commissioners voted against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency, fearing they would undermine product safety. Consumer Reports and Democratic senators have condemned the CPSC firings, arguing that the commissioners should be reinstated immediately. The White House maintains that the CPSC falls under the executive branch, giving the president the right to fire employees.</p>

          <p>This ABC News article reports that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a move that would curtail the constitutional right to challenge detention in court. Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller argued the U.S. faces a national security threat from undocumented migrants "invading" the country.

          <p>This Sky News article discusses the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the Port of Long Beach, the busiest port in the western hemisphere, where traffic is down by nearly a third. The decline is attributed to frozen trade between the U.S. and China, resulting in fewer ships, containers, and jobs. Lorry drivers are experiencing financial strain, and shortages and price hikes are occurring in the toy district of downtown LA, where many items are imported from China. The article notes that trade officials from the U.S. and China are scheduled to meet in Switzerland.</p>

China's factory output has taken a hit, and the US economy contracted due to tariff-related uncertainty, making a deal more appealing to both sides.</p>
