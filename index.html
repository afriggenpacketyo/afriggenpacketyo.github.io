          <p>US agriculture exporters are reporting a 'full-blown crisis' due to the global backlash against Trump's tariffs, particularly from decreased Chinese purchases of US farm products, resulting in canceled export orders and layoffs. Data indicates significant cancellations of pork orders from China, with exporters facing substantial financial losses due to cargo diversions and abandoned shipments. The Port of Oakland warns that tariff-induced downturns in cargo volume could jeopardize job stability and the region's economic health, as China represents a significant portion of the port's trade volume.</p>
