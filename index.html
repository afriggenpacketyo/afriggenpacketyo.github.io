          <p>Andriy Parubiy, a prominent Ukrainian politician and former speaker of the parliament, was shot and killed in the western city of Lviv. Parubiy was a key figure in the 2014 Euromaidan protests that led to the ousting of the pro-Russian president. Unverified footage shows a gunman, reportedly disguised as a food delivery courier, attacking him before fleeing, prompting a massive manhunt. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the killing as a "terrible murder," and other officials have mourned Parubiy as a patriot who made immense contributions to Ukraine's sovereignty.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's broad "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most trading partners are an illegal overreach of executive authority. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration used as justification, does not grant the president the power to impose such taxes. The tariffs will remain in place until mid-October to allow for an appeal to the Supreme Court. This ruling creates significant uncertainty for the U.S. economy and global trade relations while posing a major legal challenge to a cornerstone of Trump's economic policy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), has ordered a nationwide review of public housing to identify and remove residents who are in the country illegally. Public Housing Authorities have been given 30 days to conduct an audit to verify the citizenship or eligible immigration status of all tenants, with non-compliant programs risking their federal funding. HUD Secretary Scott Turner stated the move is to prioritize American citizens, as only one in four eligible families currently receives assistance. The directive has drawn praise from Republicans but skepticism from others who worry it will divert resources from serving eligible residents.</p>

Red Bull's Max Verstappen qualified third, while rookie Isack Hadjar delivered an impressive performance to secure fourth place for Racing Bulls.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a landmark study in Iowa identified agricultural pollution as a major contributor to the state's severe water quality problems and potential health risks, public officials have quietly removed the funding intended for publicizing the findings. The comprehensive report linked farming contaminants to issues like high cancer rates and polluted drinking water sources for over 600,000 people. Critics suggest this move is an attempt by the politically powerful farm industry and its allies to downplay the report's conclusions and impede necessary environmental reforms, leaving public health at risk.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could seriously jeopardize the central bank's independence and harm the U.S. economy. Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, stated that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy, leading to consequences seen in other countries, such as weaker stock markets, higher inflation, and a depreciating currency. She believes that while markets might initially react positively to politically motivated lower interest rates, the long-term damage to consumption and institutional integrity would be significant.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to $1 billion for the first time in over a year, following 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. This ranks as the sixth-largest jackpot in the game's history, with players facing odds of 1 in 292.2 million to match all six numbers. Winners can choose between a 30-year annuity or a lump-sum cash option of nearly half the advertised amount. All winnings are subject to a 24% federal tax withholding, with additional taxes likely due, and most states also levy their own income taxes on the prize.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, after severe drought caused water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir to drop to historic lows.

While the ongoing drought has had a devastating impact on Iraq's agriculture and resources, it has inadvertently created opportunities for archaeological excavation.

Nelson's images capture the cracks in this illusion, such as a polar bear in a decaying enclosure or captive elephants used as a backdrop for tourist selfies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary explores the wide-ranging and often politically charged reactions to Taylor Swift's engagement to Travis Kelce, which has become a focal point for various cultural theories. The article highlights how some conservative figures hope the marriage will "deradicalize" Swift into a traditional wife, while others, like Senator JD Vance, have used it to float conspiracy theories about the NFL. The author critiques these projections and the media frenzy, concluding with a call for Swift to use her immense influence to address urgent global issues like the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, a prominent activist firm, has acquired a significant stake in Rexford Industrial Realty, a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in Southern California industrial properties. The move signals that Elliott may push for substantial changes at the company, which has been criticized for poor corporate governance and a stock price that trades at a discount to its net asset value. Elliott's involvement could lead to a strategic review, better capital allocation, or even make Rexford an attractive acquisition target for larger players in the REIT industry.

          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to exert control over the Federal Reserve, including his attempt to fire Governor Lisa Cook, represent a significant threat to the institution's long-held political independence. Legal scholars and financial experts warn that politicizing the central bank could undermine the stability of the U.S. financial system and erode the credibility of the dollar. While the administration frames its actions as necessary reform, critics argue it could lead to the kind of hyperinflation and economic instability seen in countries where monetary policy is dictated by political leaders.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas has experienced a 12% year-over-year drop in visitors for July, marking the sixth straight month of declining tourism numbers. Despite this trend and social media complaints about rising costs, the city's top tourism official, Steve Hill, insists that Las Vegas remains a good value destination and has not priced out regular travelers. While visitor counts are down, Nevada's gaming revenue remains strong, suggesting those who do come are spending more. In response, many resorts are now offering promotions such as waived fees and free parking to attract more visitors.</p>

          <p>An Israeli official has stated that humanitarian aid to parts of northern Gaza will soon be slowed or halted as the military expands its offensive in the area. The plan includes stopping airdrops and reducing the number of aid trucks to facilitate the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents from Gaza City. This announcement has drawn sharp condemnation from international aid organizations, including the Red Cross, which warned that a safe mass evacuation is impossible under the current conditions and would severely worsen the catastrophic humanitarian crisis, where famine has already been declared.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two civilian workers in connection with the 2021 jet fuel spill at a Pearl Harbor storage facility that contaminated drinking water and sickened 6,000 people. The indictment alleges that John Floyd and Nelson Wu provided the Navy with false information, significantly underreporting the amount of fuel that had leaked six months before it entered the water supply. These are the first criminal charges to result from the incident, which a Navy investigation previously attributed to shoddy management and human error at the aging Red Hill facility.</p>

The threat is heightened by evidence that individuals with military drone training are active within these violent extremist movements, creating a significant domestic security challenge.</p>
