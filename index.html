Prevot condemned antisemitism and the glorification of terrorism by Hamas supporters, emphasizing the need for Israel to respect international law.

Monthly sales have reached $1.2 million as of July, a six-fold increase compared to the previous year, according to WPIC Marketing + Technologies. Social media influencers and the resurgence of tennis, partly due to Zheng Qinwen's Olympic gold medal, have contributed to the sport's rise. The PPA held its first "Hong Kong Open" competition, which was sold out with a waitlist, indicating strong local interest. This trend reflects a broader shift toward active lifestyles and recreational sports participation in China. The score is 80.</p>

This comes after a U.S. federal appeals court ruled against most of President Trump's global tariffs. Trump stated that India had offered to reduce tariffs on U.S. imports to zero, though he deemed the offer overdue, and the Nifty 50 was flat, while the BSE Sensex index ticked up 0.18% in early trade. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission fined a local unit of Societe Generale for failing to prevent suspicious orders in the electricity and wheat futures markets.

          <p>Chinese state media has suggested that the Victory Day parade in Beijing this week may showcase improved versions of its hypersonic missiles, the YJ-21 and DF-17. The air-launched variant of the YJ-21, originally a sea-based missile, is anticipated to be a highlight. Military commentator Wei Dongxu stated that it could be launched from bombers outside enemy air defense zones. The development of these missiles points to a family of land-, sea-, and air-launched variants. The score is 50.</p>

          <p>A photograph of a body seen in a secret mortuary in Libya in 2011 is being analyzed to determine if it is Musa al-Sadr, a religious leader who vanished in 1978. A computer scientist at Bradford University used an algorithm to compare the image with photos of Sadr, yielding a "high probability" match. The investigation involved a BBC team that was detained in Libya while searching for the mortuary. The leader's disappearance has spawned numerous conspiracy theories and changed the fate of the Middle East. The score is 40.</p>
