          <p>Nearly ten months after a Texas family's boat capsized off the coast of Homer, Alaska, a search team located human remains at the bottom of the bay. The U.S. Coast Guard had previously suspended their search in August 2024 without any sightings of the missing boaters, David and Mary Maynard, along with their two sons. Private companies assisted Alaska State Troopers in locating the vessel in 180 feet of water, identifying it as the missing boat with potential human remains onboard. Divers recovered three sets of remains from the sunken vessel, which were transported to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for identification and autopsy, bringing a somber resolution to the tragedy for the family and community. </p>

          <p>German defense company Renk, a tank parts manufacturer, is looking to hire talent from the struggling auto sector to meet rising demand due to increased military spending. The company's stock has surged over 300% this year, with its order book jumping 164%. Renk's CEO and COO, both with automotive industry experience, aim to leverage this talent to improve efficiency and quality, while a trade union warns against a one-sided industrial policy focused on rearmament. Analysts see this as an opportunity to address overcapacity in the auto industry and benefit the defense sector as it scales up production, with Germany's automotive industry increasingly seeking collaborations with adjacent sectors.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Court of International Trade stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration immediately lodged an appeal, with the White House given 10 days to halt the tariffs. The lawsuit was filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of small businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties. </p>

          <p>The article examines the phenomenon of Americans joining the Israeli military, highlighting the case of Edan Alexander, an American Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas. It points out that an estimated 23,380 American citizens currently serve in Israeli ranks, driven by a "fierce commitment to the Jewish state." The article describes the radicalization process through Zionist summer camps and a social apparatus that normalizes these choices. It contrasts this with the smaller number of Americans fighting alongside Ukrainians and argues that the radicalization of young Zionists receives insufficient attention from law enforcement, questioning America's establishment affinity for Israel.</p>

She emphasizes that the entire population of Gaza faces acute food insecurity, with over 71,000 children and 17,000 mothers at risk of acute malnutrition in the next 10 months without sufficient aid. Russell criticizes Israel's blockade of aid and a new aid delivery system that bypasses the United Nations, arguing that it threatens to worsen the crisis.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-over-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota has stated it will not pass on the tariff costs to U.S. consumers, analysts believe the company may face pressure to do so if the higher levy remains long-term. For the full business year through March, Toyota anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit to 3.1 trillion yen due to the tariffs and a stronger yen. </p>

While emphasizing that security matters and tariff negotiations are based on different standards, the negotiator acknowledges the possibility of including defense spending in the discussions. Japan seeks the removal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, and steel and aluminum imposed by the U.S. However, the Trump administration has resisted complete removal, leading Japan to consider lower duty rates to strike a trade deal. </p>

          <p>A US court has undermined President Trump's core economic policy by ruling his tariffs unlawful, leading to an appeal from the administration. The court found that the president does not have the authority to impose tariffs without congressional approval, challenging his declaration of a national economic emergency to justify the tariffs. The ruling applies to tariffs against China, Mexico, and Canada, designed to combat fentanyl coming into the United States. The decision has deepened the divide between the Trump administration and the judiciary, with White House officials reacting strongly against the ruling.</p>

          <p>Despite legal guarantees and pressure from civil society, racial segregation in schools continues to affect Roma children in Slovakia. More than 60% of Roma children attend schools where they are in the majority, often in overcrowded buildings with lower academic expectations. Roma pupils are also frequently placed in schools and classes for children with mental disabilities. The Slovak government, after initially denying discriminatory treatment, has introduced reforms, but these measures often reinforce segregation. The author argues that Slovakia must stop managing segregation and start ending it by promoting diverse classrooms and early support, and that the EU must respond to this systemic failure. </p>

After the university pushed back against the administration, Trump stated that Harvard was "hurting themselves" and "treating our country with great disrespect." This framing reflects Trump's tendency to make an example of those who oppose him, sending a message that dissent will not be tolerated. Harvard is seen as a test case for dealing with the White House, with officials advising to either work with the president or face the consequences. </p>

Recipients include former New York Representative Michael G. Grimm, rapper Kentrell Gaulden (YoungBoy Never Broke Again), and Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Gangster Disciples. The actions reflect Trump's pattern of using clemency to reward supporters and incentivize loyalty, diverging from the Justice Department's formal process.

CBS maintains that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties and has accused Sony of entering into unauthorized licensing deals.
