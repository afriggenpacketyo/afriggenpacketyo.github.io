          <h2>UK Economy Experiences Unexpected Contraction in May</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 02:48:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of contraction and defying analyst expectations of slight growth. The Office for National Statistics attributed the decline primarily to a drop in manufacturing, weak retail sales, and reduced output in the oil and gas sector. While the services sector showed some growth, the overall figure was described as disappointing by Chancellor Rachel Reeves. This downturn highlights ongoing economic pressures and presents a challenge to the government's key priority of fostering growth, especially after a stronger performance earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>The body of a teenage boy was discovered in Powell's Pool, a lake within Sutton Park in Birmingham, following a search operation. West Midlands Police confirmed the boy was reported missing in the water on Thursday evening, and his death is not being treated as suspicious. His family is receiving support from authorities during this tragic time. The incident has prompted renewed warnings from safety advocates about the dangers of open water, especially following a recent report of 18 accidental drowning deaths in the region in 2024. Sutton Park is one of Europe's largest urban parks.</p>

          <p>The United States has declared a new 35% tariff on Canadian imports effective August 1, escalating trade tensions as negotiations continue. President Trump indicated that the European Union and other trading partners would receive similar notices, suggesting a broader application of blanket tariffs. The move, which President Trump linked to Canada's efforts to control the flow of fentanyl, has prompted a response from Prime Minister Mark Carney, who affirmed his government will continue to defend its economic interests. The announcement has caused concern in the EU, which is preparing for potential escalation while already facing significant US tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic has canceled a scheduled practice session, raising questions about his fitness ahead of his Wimbledon semi-final match against world number one Jannik Sinner. The 38-year-old champion had an awkward fall during his quarter-final victory, while Sinner has also been dealing with an elbow injury sustained in a previous round. While Sinner stated he would be 100% fit, Djokovic has been less definitive about his condition. Given his age and a previous injury-related retirement at this year's Australian Open, the cancellation has fueled speculation about his ability to perform at his peak in the high-stakes match.</p>

          <p>The OPEC International Seminar convened at Vienna's Hofburg palace, bringing together energy ministers and top CEOs to discuss the state of the oil market, investment, and the green energy transition. The event, hosted in the city where OPEC is headquartered, featured high-level discussions led by figures like Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. However, the conference was met with protests outside the palace, with demonstrators calling for an oil embargo over the conflict in Gaza. The seminar proceeded with notable absences from Russia and Iran, though Iran's oil minister delivered remarks via video, stressing the need for peace to ensure industry stability.</p>

          <p>Actor Ewan McGregor's application to replace the roof of his £2 million historic mansion in Scotland has been rejected by Perth and Kinross Council. His architects argued the existing lead roof was "beyond repair" and that replacing it with a modern single-ply membrane was necessary to prevent water damage and deter theft of the valuable lead. However, the council ruled that the proposed materials and methods would not preserve the C-listed building's special architectural character. McGregor, who bought the 18th-century villa near his birthplace in 2023, had previously received approval for other renovations on the property.</p>

          <p>The past week saw a significant escalation in U.S. trade rhetoric, with the Trump administration sending letters to numerous countries outlining new tariff rates to take effect August 1 if deals are not reached. President Trump announced duties ranging from 25% to 50% for key partners like Japan and Brazil, and a 35% tariff on Canadian imports. The European Union was also told to expect a notification, creating widespread uncertainty despite a recent delay in implementation. While global stock markets have remained largely stable, analysts suggest traders are anticipating further negotiations or another delay before the tariffs fully materialize.

This success comes despite a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political rhetoric, which a survey found would deter 43% of Norwegian EV drivers from buying a Tesla. Norway's robust EV market, supported by strong government incentives, has allowed Tesla to maintain a dominant position there while facing slumps in other key markets like Germany.

          <p>Australian police have arrested and charged a 37-year-old man for allegedly sending racist messages to a professional basketball player on social media. While authorities did not name the player, media reports identified him as Montrezl Harrell, an American who plays for the Adelaide 36ers in the National Basketball League (NBL). Basketball Australia hailed the arrest as a "landmark moment," representing the first successful arrest for racially abusing an athlete via social media in the sport's history. The incident underscores a commitment from sports organizations and law enforcement to combat online hate speech and create a safer environment for athletes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin a significant reduction of its domestic workforce, cutting staff by approximately 15% through layoffs and voluntary departures. The move is part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration aimed at streamlining what officials call a "bloated bureaucracy" and focusing on core diplomatic priorities. The plan involves closing or merging nearly half of its U.S.-based offices and consolidating functions. Critics, including the American Foreign Service Association and Democratic lawmakers, argue the cuts could weaken American diplomatic efforts and demoralize the workforce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from the National Audit Office (NAO) has found that Britain's F-35 stealth jet program is being hampered by delays, infrastructure gaps, and personnel shortages, undermining the UK's warfighting capability. While acknowledging the F-35 is a superior aircraft, the watchdog noted a "disappointing return" on the £11 billion spent so far, with the fleet's mission-capable rate falling far short of targets. The NAO also estimated the full cost to expand the fleet will be significantly higher than Ministry of Defence forecasts. The MoD responded that the program remains within budget and that two full squadrons will be ready for deployment this year. (not investment advice)</p>

ICC Deputy Prosecutor Nazhat Shameem Khan described an "inescapable pattern of offending" and immense suffering.

Frost is accused of personally taking over $19 million from the scheme for luxuries and political contributions.

In response, a White House spokesperson reiterated President Trump's claim that the operation "totally obliterated" Iran's facilities.

While tough talk on tariffs and border policies has also had a negative effect, some nationalities, like those from Vietnam and the Philippines, still show strong interest, possibly due to large diaspora communities.

The judge pressed the government's lawyer for specific evidence to refute these claims, noting a lack of documentation for the arrests.
