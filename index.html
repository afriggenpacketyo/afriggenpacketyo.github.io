          <p>In the 2025 local elections, Reform UK experienced significant gains, securing control of seven councils previously held by the Conservatives, including Lincolnshire, Staffordshire, and Kent. The Liberal Democrats also saw success, taking control of Shropshire, Oxfordshire, and Cambridgeshire, while the Greens more than doubled their number of council seats. Reform UK won both new mayoralties in Greater Lincolnshire and Hull & East Yorkshire, marking a notable shift in the political landscape, while Labour retained its mayoralties in Doncaster, North Tyneside, and the West of England, and the Conservatives lost control of 12 councils but won the race for mayor in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough from Labour. This election cycle indicates a reshaping of local political power across England.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a blackout in Spain and Portugal, theories emerged suggesting that excessive solar power was the cause, but a fact check reveals that the cause has not been conclusively clarified. While solar energy provided around 60% of Spain's power at the time, experts argue that PV systems are designed to gradually reduce feed-in rather than abruptly shut down. Some experts suggest the blackout was a system failure highlighting challenges in restructuring the energy system, while others point to capped power grid connections to France and Portugal as a contributing factor. Despite debates, technical solutions exist to operate electricity grids with high proportions of renewable energy.</p>

          <p>An article in the New York Times explores Finland's consistent ranking as the happiest country in the World Happiness Report, examining what this metric truly measures. The report relies on the Cantril Ladder question, asking individuals to rate their life satisfaction on a scale from 0 to 10, and combines these answers with factors like health, income, and social cohesion. The author reflects on personal experiences in Finland, contrasting the country's winter gloom with its celebrated happiness initiatives, and visits saunas and libraries, observing the Finnish emphasis on community and trust. The article questions the validity and interpretation of happiness rankings, suggesting that contentment and social support play a significant role in Finland's high scores.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is pushing back against President Trump's renewed threat to revoke its tax-exempt status, asserting that there is no legal basis for such action. A Harvard spokesperson stated that revoking the tax exemption would endanger the university's educational mission, diminish financial aid for students, and hinder critical medical research programs. The university's response comes after Trump criticized Harvard for its stance on antisemitism and DEI policies, and the administration has already frozen billions in federal grants to the institution, prompting Harvard to sue the administration in response.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year includes $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, with reductions to the Department of Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Republican senators like Roger Wicker and Susan Collins have expressed concerns about the proposed freeze in defense funding and cuts to programs such as LIHEAP and TRIO, while Democrats like Sen.

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos intends to sell up to 25 million shares of the company over the next year, valued at approximately $4.8 billion, as part of a trading plan adopted on March 4. This disclosure follows Amazon's first-quarter earnings report, where profit and revenue exceeded expectations, but the company's operating income forecast fell short. Bezos has been using Amazon share sales to fund his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and his $10 billion climate and biodiversity fund, following his transition from CEO to executive chairman.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is doubling down on its efforts to break up Google's advertising technology empire, seeking to force the company to divest tools used by online publishers to sell ad space and the technology that connects them with advertisers. This move follows a ruling that Google has a monopoly over some portions of the ad system, and is the second request to force the company to sell parts of its business within a year. Google's lawyers argue that a breakup would not align with legal precedent and would imperil privacy and security protections.</p>

The excerpt focuses on the filming of key scenes, including the opening sequence in Roxbury and the climactic assassination, and the incorporation of symbolic elements to convey Malcolm's premonition of his death.

Conversely, Alphabet and Meta reported strong ad revenue, though warned of possible headwinds ahead, as consumer sentiment worsens and impacts various sectors including airlines, restaurants, and retailers.</p>
