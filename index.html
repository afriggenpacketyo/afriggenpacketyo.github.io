          <p>London's Notting Hill Carnival has commenced its annual festivities, bringing vibrant colors, music, and dance to the streets of west London for the children's parade. This significant cultural event, Europe's largest street party, began with J'ouvert at 6:00 BST, transforming the area with bright paint and powder. Despite earlier funding challenges that jeopardized its future, over a million people are anticipated to attend the weekend-long celebration. While police reported 140 arrests, including for assaulting an officer and possessing offensive weapons, attendees celebrated the carnival as a powerful display of multiculturalism and community unity, highlighting its importance for peace of mind and shared enjoyment.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken was reportedly asked by a lifeguard to leave Georgica Beach in East Hampton, New York, on Friday. The beach had been closed due to dangerous conditions and strong rip currents caused by Hurricane Erin, which prompted New York Governor Kathy Hochul to urge caution. Blinken and a friend were photographed relaxing on the sand before being approached by a lifeguard and a patrol vehicle, subsequently gathering their belongings and departing. This incident adds to past controversies regarding Blinken's leisure activities during significant global events, including the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is moving north-northeast. As of Sunday evening, it was located about 295 miles east of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. Forecasters predict Fernand will strengthen slightly through Monday before beginning to weaken on Tuesday, remaining over the open ocean and posing no immediate threat of landfall. This article notes the storm follows Hurricane Erin, which became a Category 5 hurricane earlier this season, causing dangerous conditions along the East Coast despite not making landfall.</p>

          <p>Wildfires are rapidly expanding across California's Napa County and central Oregon, leading to hundreds of evacuations and threatening thousands of homes. The Pickett Fire in Napa has grown to over 10 square miles with 11% containment, while Oregon's Flat Fire covers nearly 34 square miles with no containment, affecting approximately 10,000 people under evacuation notices. Firefighters are battling the blazes amid a severe heatwave and dry conditions, with air quality alerts issued across multiple counties. Scientists note that human-caused climate change contributes to more intense heatwaves and droughts, exacerbating destructive wildfire conditions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy National Guard troops to Baltimore, escalating a dispute with Maryland Governor Wes Moore, who had invited Trump for a "safety walk" in the city. Trump's remarks, made on social media, are part of his broader effort to send military personnel to Democratic-led cities to combat crime, a strategy that has drawn strong criticism from Democrats as an "abuse of power." The president claims the mission has brought "total safety" to Washington D.C., where troops are already deployed and now authorized to carry weapons, despite official crime figures showing a decline in violent offenses.</p>

          <p>Lt. General Jeffrey Kruse has been removed as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a move confirmed by a senior defense official. The ousting, for which no reason was given to Congress, has prompted criticism from Senator Mark Warner, who called it another instance of the Trump administration treating intelligence as a "loyalty test." This follows a DIA assessment that military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities set back Tehran's program by months, contradicting President Trump's claim of "total obliteration." DIA employees expressed surprise and concern over the politicization of their work, with other military officials also recently removed from their posts.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill in California aims to cut the cannabis excise tax from 19% back to 15% for six years, a move supported by the struggling legal weed industry but opposed by child-care advocates. The tax reduction would decrease annual state revenue by $180 million, including $81 million specifically allocated for subsidized child-care slots for low-income families. Child-care advocates warn this cut would exacerbate an already critical shortage of services, while the cannabis industry argues the current high taxes drive consumers to the illicit market, ultimately reducing overall tax revenue.

          <p>Millions across the Western United States are under heat watches and warnings as a dangerous heatwave persists, elevating wildfire risks due to dry conditions. Parts of California, Oregon, and Washington are experiencing "extreme heat" with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees, and minimal nighttime relief. This extreme heat poses significant health dangers, as the body cannot recover without cooling, increasing the risk of heat illness. The conditions are exacerbating ongoing wildfires, including the Pickett Fire in Napa County and the Flat Fire in central Oregon, making containment efforts difficult for firefighters.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Western European leaders of not wanting peace in Ukraine, praising President Donald Trump's efforts to end the war while Vice President JD Vance affirmed US commitment to brokering talks. Lavrov, speaking on NBC, denied Russia targeted civilian sites and suggested Trump respected Putin's defense of national interests. Vance, however, acknowledged Russia had made "significant concessions" but warned that ending the war would not happen overnight. This article highlights the deep divisions and complex diplomatic landscape surrounding the conflict, with Russia rejecting European security guarantees for Ukraine and the US continuing its attempts to bring parties to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>A man in southern Ohio successfully built a 19-square-foot tiny house, dubbed "the size of a closet," for $5,000, fulfilling a long-held obsession with small-space living. Constructed on an old utility trailer in just one month, the home features essentials like a compact AC/heating unit, a tilting bed, a mini-fridge, and an outdoor shower, all powered by solar panels. The builder, Levi Kelly, tested the house during a snowstorm and camped in it with his son, proving its functionality and cozy appeal. He encourages others to embrace creative small-space design, advising prioritizing comfort or minimalism based on individual goals.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to overhaul its asylum appeals system, aiming to reduce the number of migrants housed in hotels while awaiting decisions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced a new body with independent adjudicators to expedite appeals, which currently take over a year on average, with 51,000 cases pending. The Refugee Council, however, argues that reducing appeals primarily requires "getting decisions right first time," noting that about half of initial decisions are overturned. The announcement comes amid rising public frustration and protests over asylum hotels, with 32,000 asylum seekers still accommodated at taxpayer expense.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore criticized President Trump's rhetoric on crime as "purely performative" after Trump offered to send troops to Baltimore, following similar deployments in Washington D.C. Moore argued that Trump's approach, based on "1980s scare tactics," ignores effective local strategies that have led to a 22% decrease in homicides in Baltimore this year. The governor firmly stated he would not authorize the Maryland National Guard for such federal intervention, deeming it "unconstitutional" and "deeply disrespectful" to the Guard.

Companies like Engie North America are already cutting US investments due to regulatory uncertainty and rising costs from tariffs.

The article contends these systems violate First and Fourth Amendment rights by creating invisible surveillance networks and enabling warrantless data seizures.
