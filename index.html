          <p>Tech and private prison companies, including Palantir, Geo Group, and CoreCivic, have reported substantial revenue increases, which they attribute to contracts supporting the Trump administration's expanded immigration enforcement. Palantir noted a 53% growth in U.S. government revenue, while private prison firms are experiencing unprecedented demand for detention space. These financial gains come as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) receives increased funding to expand its detention network, creating more opportunities for these corporations.

          <p>Several U.S. states are offering sales tax holidays in 2025, providing temporary relief from state and sometimes local taxes on specific items like school supplies and disaster preparedness goods. While politically popular and helpful for some families managing tight budgets, tax experts argue the benefits are often overstated. Research suggests these holidays primarily shift the timing of purchases rather than stimulating new economic growth, and wealthier consumers may be better positioned to take advantage of the savings.</p>

          <p>The rapid growth of the artificial intelligence sector is generating wealth and minting new billionaires at a pace that may surpass previous tech booms. Startups like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Anysphere have achieved massive valuations through recent fundraising, creating immense paper fortunes for their founders and early employees. This wealth creation is heavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, fueling a resurgence in the local economy and real estate market, though much of the wealth remains illiquid in private companies.</p>

          <p>This article from Vox examines why people, and the media, tend to focus on negative news, a phenomenon rooted in an evolutionary trait known as negativity bias. Despite constant reports of crises, significant progress is often overlooked, such as a potential historic low in the U.S. murder rate and fewer global deaths from extreme weather. The author argues that acknowledging positive developments is not naive but essential for fostering realistic optimism, which can inspire action and build resilience against a challenging future.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a protest in Parliament Square supporting Palestine Action, a group recently banned under UK terrorism laws. The demonstration, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds of individuals intentionally violate the ban by holding signs of support, leading to one of the largest single-day mass arrests by the force in a decade. While the Home Secretary defended the ban, human rights groups like Amnesty International criticized the arrests as a disproportionate threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times presents a series of short stories by authors Steph Cha, Ivy Pochoda, and Jonathan Lethem, each offering a distinct vision of a future Los Angeles. The vignettes explore themes of social inequality, climate change, and memory in a transformed city. Cha's story depicts a world of extreme wealth disparity, Pochoda imagines a Skid Row community taking charge after the rich flee a climate-ravaged city, and Lethem portrays a flooded landscape where a "Minister of Commemoration" preserves memories of the dry past.</p>

          <p>The 1988 film "Miracle Mile," which depicts Los Angeles descending into chaos ahead of a rumored nuclear strike, has found a renewed cult following. The movie, written and directed by Steve De Jarnatt, is praised for its affectionate portrayal of its namesake L.A. neighborhood, featuring now-iconic locations like the former May Co. building and Johnnie's Coffee Shop. It begins as a romance between characters played by Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham before spiraling into a tense, real-time thriller about trying to escape impending doom.</p>

          <p>As confusion over recycling and composting persists, the reuse movement is gaining momentum as a potential solution to the overwhelming amount of single-use waste. The article highlights a successful pilot program in Petaluma, California, where participating stores offered reusable cups that customers could return to collection bins throughout the city. This community-wide system, which focused on civic pride over monetary deposits, achieved a return rate over 50%, demonstrating a viable model for reducing reliance on disposable items.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the "sponge city" concept, a nature-based approach to urban water management that uses absorbent landscapes to mitigate flooding and capture stormwater. Championed by landscape architect Kongjian Yu, the model has been implemented in cities like Bangkok and across China, turning concrete-heavy areas into green spaces with wetlands and porous surfaces. This strategy is gaining traction in places like Los Angeles, which discards billions of gallons of rainwater, as a way to become more resilient to climate change-induced droughts and floods.</p>

          <p>Facing the threat of diminishing water supplies from traditional sources like the Colorado River due to climate change, Southern California is planning for a more resilient water future. Water agencies are pursuing a diversified strategy that includes building a massive wastewater recycling facility, capturing more stormwater, and potentially desalination to create a "new and endless river." These costly investments are deemed necessary to avoid a "Day Zero" crisis, similar to what Cape Town, South Africa, narrowly averted, ensuring long-term sustainability and affordability.</p>

          <p>An analysis of federal data reveals that despite being a symbolic battleground, California saw fewer total immigration arrests in early 2025 than Texas and Florida. While arrests in California surged, its per-capita rate was lower than many other states, partly due to its "sanctuary" policies limiting cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE. This lack of cooperation forced federal agents to conduct more public-facing raids, which in turn sparked significant community resistance and legal challenges against their tactics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing asylum applications from some immigrants who entered the U.S. between 2019 and 2022, citing their failure to receive a mandatory "credible fear" interview at the border. Dozens have received letters terminating their cases, effectively forcing them to start the lengthy process over after years of waiting. Immigration lawyers argue this is a consequence of the government's own past inability to conduct enough interviews and fear it will leave their clients, who have been living and working legally, vulnerable to detention and deportation.</p>

          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a significant increase in tourism from neighboring Turkey, with visitors attracted by the relaxed atmosphere and relative affordability compared to Turkish resorts. This influx of tourists is fostering positive local interactions and economic benefits, seen as a bright spot in the often-tense relationship between Greece and Turkey. Despite ongoing political disputes between the two governments over maritime borders and airspace, the people-to-people connections forged through tourism offer a measure of goodwill.</p>
