            <p>Kenan Malik argues that Donald Trump's efforts to impose political control over universities like Harvard, by demanding viewpoint diversity through mandated hiring practices, are misguided and counterproductive. While acknowledging the lack of viewpoint diversity in universities can be a genuine concern, Malik contends that Trump's approach, which essentially calls for affirmative action for conservatives, undermines the principles of scholarly objectivity and freedom of expression. The author suggests that fostering a richer culture of debate requires encouraging the capacity to move between different points of view rather than institutionalizing political identities.</p>

Improved logistics and a steady supply have contributed to the surge in durian exports from Malaysia to China. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen naturally on the tree before being harvested, which is appealing to Chinese consumers.

            <p>NASA astronaut Don Pettit, the oldest serving U.S. astronaut, returned to Earth on his 70th birthday along with Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner. The Soyuz MS-26 space capsule landed in Kazakhstan after a 220-day mission on the International Space Station (ISS). Pettit has now spent a total of 590 days in space over four missions. While he is not the oldest person to fly in orbit, his return marks the end of a successful mission, and he will undergo physical rehabilitation after his return.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China's Xiamen Airlines has returned to Boeing's production hub in Seattle due to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. The jet's return is a consequence of increased tariffs imposed by both countries, making it economically challenging for Chinese airlines to take delivery of new Boeing aircraft. The trade war has disrupted the aerospace industry's duty-free status and created uncertainty for future aircraft deliveries. This is another problem for Boeing, which has been dealing with safety and production issues.</p>
