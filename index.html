          <p>An independent report has concluded that Northamptonshire Police in the UK should have arrested Anne Sacoolas, the American diplomat who caused the fatal car crash that killed 19-year-old Harry Dunn in 2019. The report criticizes the police's handling of the investigation, stating that a prompt and effective investigation was not considered. Sacoolas, who left the UK under diplomatic immunity, later pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and received a suspended sentence. The report also criticizes the former chief constable for making erroneous statements and mishandling evidence. </p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower their duty payments as the U.S. imposes tariffs on various goods. This involves modifying products' materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into different harmonized system codes with lower tariff rates. While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions for certain products allow companies to benefit from these strategic design choices. One motorhome manufacturer planned to work with experts to implement tariff mitigation strategies, including tariff engineering and deferrals. (not investment advice)</p>

Federal prosecutors have announced charges against Vance Boelter that can carry the death penalty, a rarity for Minnesota, which abolished capital punishment in 1911. The federal intervention in Boelter's case has caused tension with the county attorney, who intends to press forward in state court. Federal officials face the challenge of a jury pool from a state that has rejected the death penalty for over 100 years.</p>

          <p>Australia has lifted its ban on plasma donation for gay and bisexual men, becoming the first country to remove all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation. The new rules will begin taking effect next month and are estimated to expand the donation pool significantly. While most people in a monogamous sexual relationship will be eligible to donate blood, those who have had anal sex with new or multiple partners will need to wait three months to donate blood, though they are still eligible to donate plasma. The new approach to blood donations will be implemented sometime in 2026.</p>
