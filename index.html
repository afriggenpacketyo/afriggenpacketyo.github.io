          <p>The August jobs report revealed a significant slowdown in the U.S. labor market, with only 22,000 nonfarm jobs added, far below forecasts, and the unemployment rate rising to 4.3%. Economists express alarm, attributing the weakness partly to trade tariffs and the potential impact of AI on entry-level jobs. This data strongly suggests the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September, with some speculating on a larger 0.5 percentage point reduction to stimulate growth. Concerns about "stagflation"—high prices and weak growth—are also emerging. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Steven Bixby, a 58-year-old South Carolina death row inmate convicted of killing two police officers, is undergoing a competency evaluation to determine if he can be executed. His execution was halted earlier this year due to concerns about his mental state. Bixby claims judges are guided by Satan and believes blood on his clothes contains Jesus Christ's DNA, complicating his legal defense. Prosecutors argue his anti-government beliefs are not a sign of incompetence, while his lawyers contend prison isolation has exacerbated his delusions.</p>

This article highlights the story of Lee, who, after two layoffs from the publishing industry, found liberation in being jobless rather than enduring miserable work conditions. This shift reflects a broader societal reevaluation of work-life balance and material pursuits, contrasting with past generations' experiences during economic reforms. It suggests a growing disillusionment with traditional career paths and a search for personal fulfillment beyond corporate demands.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia is escalating its internet control by restricting WhatsApp and Telegram calls and aggressively promoting its new state-controlled "super-app," Max. This move coincides with growing mobile internet blackouts across Russian regions, officially justified by drone attack protection but seen by experts as a means of increased surveillance. Max, pre-installed on new devices, is designed to integrate various services, mirroring China's WeChat, and its privacy policy allows data sharing with government bodies. These measures raise significant concerns about digital freedoms and privacy for Russian citizens, who are accustomed to open internet access.</p>

Trump also expressed openness to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping attending, though as "observers."

Domestically, bipartisan opposition emerged against his administration's vaccination policies and a renewed focus on the Jeffrey Epstein case.
