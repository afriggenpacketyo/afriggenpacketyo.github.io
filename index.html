          <p>The family of Jean Charles de Menezes, a Brazilian electrician shot dead by London police in 2005 after being mistaken for a terrorist, hopes a new Disney+ drama will reveal the truth about his death. The 80-year-old mother of de Menezes says she wants to see other mothers not suffer in the way she has, and the family served as consultants for the show, which will portray his life and the circumstances surrounding his death. No officers were prosecuted, but the Metropolitan Police expressed deep regret and apologized, highlighting the unprecedented terrorist threat at the time. The drama aims to provide multiple perspectives on the tragic event.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is appealing the U.S. Department of Agriculture's decision to end funding for the Local Food Purchase Assistance (LFPA) Program. Newsom argues that this move will negatively impact both farmers and families relying on food banks, calling the decision irrational and malicious. The LFPA program, initiated in 2022, provided grants to states for purchasing food from local and socially disadvantaged farmers, and the sudden cancellation has left many farmers uncertain about their future. The cuts coincide with state-level reductions in food aid, exacerbating food insecurity amidst rising grocery prices.</p>

Despite this, he has been criticized for his past anti-vaccine activism, with some health officials saying he bears responsibility for the death.

          <p>The United Nations has warned that cuts to aid budgets are threatening to undermine years of progress in reducing maternal deaths and could lead to a rise in fatalities. A report by UN agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), showed a 40% decline in maternal deaths globally between 2000 and 2023, largely due to better access to essential health services. However, recent aid cuts by the U.S. government and other donor countries are rolling back vital services for maternal, newborn, and child health in many countries, reducing staff numbers and disrupting supply chains. The WHO emphasized that these cuts could have pandemic-like effects on health systems and a more structural, deep-seated impact.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Relaxes Rules for Car Firms Ahead of Petrol Vehicle Ban</h2>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing regulations for car firms ahead of the 2030 ban on petrol vehicles to protect and create jobs amid new US tariffs. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced that while the government remains committed to the 2030 deadline, it will provide more flexibility to manufacturers. Changes include relaxed mandates for phasing out petrol and diesel vehicle production, allowing smaller firms to continue making petrol cars beyond 2030, and extending the market availability of some hybrid vehicles until 2035. These measures aim to support the British car industry in the face of potentially seismic changes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has revoked all visas for South Sudanese passport holders due to South Sudan's refusal to accept its citizens who have been deported from the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the decision, citing the failure of South Sudan's transitional government to accept the return of its repatriated citizens. The U.S. will also block arriving citizens of South Sudan at U.S. ports of entry. The move comes amid growing fears that South Sudan may again descend into civil war, and it follows a history of clashes between the Trump administration and international governments over deportations.</p>

Cramer suggests nibbling at S&P 500 levels below 4,000, while being prepared for a potential European response that could drive the market lower. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3Ci&#x3E(not investment advice)&#x3C/i&#x3E</p>

Potential measures include relaxing requirements on electric car sales, implementing anti-dumping safeguards to prevent goods diverted from the US from flooding the UK market, and accelerating government investment in UK industry and infrastructure. The government is also exploring closer ties with other nations to mitigate the economic impact. The largest UK export of goods to the US in 2024 was cars and auto parts, which have been hit by a 25% tariff.</p>
