          <p>Several bills in the UK are increasing in April 2025, placing additional strain on household finances.  These include water bills, energy bills, council tax, stamp duty, broadband/phone costs, and car tax.  The increases are attributed to factors like rising wholesale costs, inflation, and infrastructure investment needs.
