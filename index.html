            <p>Artificial intelligence, specifically ambient listening technology, is transforming doctor-patient interactions by transcribing conversations and compiling detailed clinical notes in real-time, enabling doctors to focus more on direct patient engagement. Dr. Daniel Kortsch of Denver Health reports that using AI tools like Nabla has reduced physician 'pajama time' and improved work-life balance, addressing the projected shortage of physicians in the U.S. The technology emphasizes physician control and offers benefits like multilingual support, enhancing efficiency and patient outcomes across various healthcare settings. As AI eases workloads, patients benefit from more engaged and personalized care, marking a significant shift in healthcare delivery.</p>

            <p>Military planners have been called in to provide logistical support in Birmingham to address the mounting piles of rubbish resulting from a month-long strike by refuse workers, with Unite union members striking over pay disputes. Birmingham City Council has already sought assistance from neighboring authorities, and now the government is enlisting the Army to aid in tackling the escalating crisis, with the council declaring a major incident. The move will involve a small number of office-based planners providing logistical support for a short period, however soldiers will not be deployed to collect rubbish. The strike has led to thousands of tonnes of uncollected rubbish.</p>

            <p>An overnight fire at the Pennsylvania governor's official residence is under investigation as arson, according to the Pennsylvania State Police, with Governor Josh Shapiro and his family safely evacuated from the residence. The fire, reported around 2 a.m. ET, caused significant damage to part of the residence, with authorities offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. Investigators are exploring whether the alleged arson attack was motivated by the fact that Governor Shapiro is Jewish and the blaze was set on the first night of Passover. The Governor had posted a picture of his family's Passover Seder table on X hours before the fire.</p>

The report detailed a colonoscopy in July 2024 revealing diverticulosis and a benign polyp, with a follow-up recommended in 2027, and noted that Trump scored a perfect 30 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, repeating his 2018 performance. Trump is currently taking medication for cholesterol control, aspirin for cardiac health, and a cream for a skin condition, and is up to date on his vaccinations, with the report concluding that he is fully fit to execute his duties.</p>

            <p>Altay Bayindir's performance has raised questions about Andre Onana's position as Manchester United's first-choice goalkeeper, with former captain Roy Keane suggesting that manager Ruben Amorim's patience with Onana may be wearing thin. Onana has faced criticism following costly errors, leading to eight goals in all competitions since the start of last season, the most of any Premier League keeper. Paul Robinson suggests that taking Onana out of the firing line could benefit him, but it remains to be seen how Amorim will handle the goalkeeping situation moving forward.</p>

            <p>Jim Cramer discusses the impact of potential tariffs on Apple and Nvidia, suggesting that past performance is irrelevant in the current political climate, and that a "reset" is occurring in the market. While a recent exemption on smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs provided a temporary reprieve, comments from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicate this may be short-lived, pushing Cramer to consider reducing his position in Apple. He also expresses concern about Nvidia becoming a meme stock, divorced from its fundamentals, leading him to question its investability (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Former LSU receiver Kyren Lacy has died at the age of 24, with the university athletics department expressing sadness over his tragic passing, just days before a grand jury was set to hear evidence in his alleged involvement in a fatal car accident in December. Lacy, who led LSU in touchdowns receiving last season, had declared for the NFL draft but his stock plummeted after the car crash, with his lawyer stating he was crushed under the weight of an irresponsible process. Lacy was booked with negligent homicide, felony hit-and-run, and reckless operation of a vehicle after allegedly causing a crash that resulted in the death of Herman Hall.</p>

            <p>Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse was barred from entering Hong Kong, leading her to believe it was an attempt to silence her, with the MP for Bath being one of more than 40 parliamentarians of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac) which criticizes Beijing's handling of human rights. Hobhouse was detained at the airport, questioned, and deported without any reason given, prompting Foreign Secretary David Lammy to promise to urgently raise the issue with authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing. The incident occurred while Hobhouse was traveling to visit her son and newborn grandson, with the MP expressing concern that China may use this to intimidate her from speaking out for human rights.</p>

            <p>Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio expresses concerns about trade disruptions, mounting U.S. debt, and emerging world powers threatening the international economic and geopolitical structure, stating he's worried about something worse than a recession if the situation isn't handled well. Dalio highlights five forces driving history: the economy, internal political conflict, the international order, technology, and acts of nature, noting that Trump's tariffs, while having understandable goals, are being implemented in a disruptive way. He advocates for Congress to reduce the federal deficit to 3% of GDP and urges the U.S. to discourage conflict and inefficient policy on the global stage (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari discusses the potential economic impact of the trade war with China, noting that even a 10% tariff on soybeans could halt exports to China due to the competitive global market. Kashkari suggests investors may view America as less attractive for investment, leading to higher Treasury yields and a potential shift in global investment flows, with the Fed focusing on keeping inflation under control. He acknowledges that tariffs are inflationary and can negatively impact economic activity, with the Fed lacking the tools to fully counteract the effects of a trade war, describing the current situation as the biggest hit to confidence in his 10 years at the Fed (not investment advice).</p>

The report also noted Trump is up to date on all recommended vaccines, and that Trump has scarring on his right ear, the result of a gunshot wound he suffered when a would-be assassin fired at him during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last year. Trump scored a 30 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and his resting heart rate was 62 beats per minute.</p>

            <p>Scientists have discovered a remarkable fossilized larva dating back 520 million years with its brain and guts still intact, offering a unique window into the past and allowing experts to better understand evolutionary links between ancient and modern arthropods. The fossilized creature, one of the earliest ancestors of arthropods, which includes insects, crabs, and lobsters, showcases almost perfect preservation, revealing intricate structures like digestive glands and a primitive circulatory system. The find has revealed that scientists had previously underestimated the complexity of early arthropods and has allowed scientists to draw evolutionary connections between the critters of the ancient past and those scuttling around today.</p>

            <p>US stock markets were expected to recover on Monday after the US exempted imports of smartphones and laptops from its tariff regime late on Friday, with shares in Apple and chip maker Nvidia on course to soar. The temporary reprieve was widely seen as a climbdown after pressure from Republican leaders concerned that the soaring cost of smartphones would spark a voter backlash, however, it is not clear how long the exemption will last. Apple has spent decades building up a finely tuned supply chain in east Asia, including inside China, and will move some facilities back to the US over the next four years, which will cost it $500bn.</p>

Brown says that Trump had “weaponised” the interdependence of the global trading and financial systems.</p>
