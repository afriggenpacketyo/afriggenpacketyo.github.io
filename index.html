          <p>President Trump asserted in an interview that he has secured 200 tariff deals and has been in contact with Chinese President Xi Jinping, although he did not provide specifics on the countries involved or the terms of the agreements. Trump stated that these deals would be finalized within the next few weeks, indicating a swift resolution to ongoing trade negotiations. However, Chinese officials have disputed the White House's claims of active discussions, adding uncertainty to the situation. The White House has softened its stance on China, telling reporters that talks with Beijing were moving in the right direction.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's calls for a swift resolution in Ukraine, President Putin is intensifying Russia's military actions, including airstrikes on civilian areas. Putin openly admitted to bombing a restaurant, claiming it housed individuals deserving punishment, showing a willingness to test Trump's patience. While the Kremlin remains confident in ongoing talks with the U.S., Trump has publicly urged Putin to cease the attacks on Kyiv, indicating a potential point of contention in the negotiations.

          <p>Amazon sellers are raising prices on various products, including kitchen appliances, due to increased import costs resulting from President Trump's tariffs on goods from China. E-commerce software company SmartScout tracked 930 products on Amazon that have seen increased prices since April 9, with an average jump of 29%. While Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated the company would try to keep prices low, he acknowledged that third-party sellers may need to pass the cost of tariffs onto consumers.

          <p>Despite initially withdrawing the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, President Trump is now seeking to negotiate a new agreement, leveraging his transactional approach to foreign policy. Indirect negotiations between U.S. and Iranian officials are underway, mediated by Oman, focusing on technical details for a potential agreement. While obstacles remain, including hardliners in both countries and opposition from Israel, Trump's willingness to engage and his focus on economic benefits for American businesses could pave the way for a deal. A key factor will be whether the U.S. insists on complete dismantling of Iran's nuclear program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's renewed focus on immigration enforcement, marked by strict policies and clashes with federal judges, is bolstered by a shift in public sentiment influenced by concerns over Biden's immigration policies. Polls indicate increased support for stricter immigration measures, driven by voter frustration over migrant influxes and perceived policy failures. This shift has emboldened the White House to pursue aggressive enforcement tactics, including deportations and visa revocations, despite criticism from some quarters. However, some supporters express concern that Trump's policies may be going too far.</p>

          <p>Economists are warning of a potential return to stagflation, characterized by economic stagnation coupled with inflation, due to the economic policies of President Trump's second term. Trump's tariffs are likened to self-inflicted oil shocks, disrupting the economy and raising prices across various sectors. Concerns are growing that these policies will lead to disinvestment, diminished demand, and job losses, potentially destabilizing American politics. The grim reality is that stagflation is very hard to escape, as efforts to curb inflation can worsen stagnation, and vice versa.</p>

This move is intended to absorb excess supply resulting from reduced U.S. exports to China due to trade friction. Japan hopes that by increasing imports, it can secure exemptions from U.S. tariffs on automobiles, steel, and aluminum.
