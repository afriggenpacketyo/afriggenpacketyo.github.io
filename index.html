            <p>A growing number of scams involve fraudsters using fake banking apps to mimic legitimate mobile banking platforms. These apps display fake 'successful payment' messages after victims enter their bank details, leading to financial losses and a loss of trust in humanity. Victims like Anthony Rudd and John Reddock shared their experiences of being deceived in person, highlighting the brazen nature of these crimes. Experts warn that tech companies need to be more engaged in preventing fraud on online platforms, and offer advice on how to avoid becoming a victim of this emerging threat.</p>

The EU's experience with China, where Beijing used both incentives and retaliatory measures to influence member states' decisions on tariffs, has highlighted the bloc's vulnerability to superpower influence. Now, the EU is considering employing similar tactics against the US as trade relations between the two allies deteriorate, marking a significant shift in transatlantic dynamics.</p>

            <p>China is responding to increased U.S. tariffs by targeting the American services sector and implementing non-tariff measures. These measures include widening export controls on rare-earth minerals, initiating antitrust probes into American companies like DuPont and Google, and restricting Boeing's access to the Chinese market. This shift signals Beijing's intent to inflict pain on U.S. companies through various means, escalating the decoupling of the two economies. Wendy Cutler of the Asia Society Policy Institute notes that China is signaling it has many levers to pull in this retaliation game.</p>

            <p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem canceled $2.7 million in DHS grants to Harvard University, deeming the institution "unfit to be entrusted with taxpayer dollars." The university has been ordered to submit visa records by April 30, or risk losing its certification to enroll international students. Noem cited anti-American and pro-Hamas ideology on campus as a reason for the decision. This action follows President Trump's decision to freeze federal funding to Harvard and request the IRS to revoke its tax-exempt status.</p>

            <p>Major business groups in the UK are calling for urgent changes to the government's Employment Rights Bill, warning that the proposed new law could harm economic growth. The bill includes provisions for guaranteed hours and restrictions on zero-hour contracts. Business groups argue that the changes will discourage hiring and increase administrative costs. The government insists the bill will deliver the "biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation."</p>

            <p>An island-wide blackout hit Puerto Rico, leaving the largely Catholic residents of the U.S. territory in the dark ahead of the Easter weekend. All hospitals on the island are operating on generators, and officials are working to restore power as quickly as possible. The cause of the outage was a transmission line issue, with Luma Energy estimating that restoring most of the power will take at least 48-72 hours. This is the latest in a string of major outages on the island in recent years.</p>

The senator’s visit came as Democrats have seized on the deportation and the Trump administration’s refusal to take any steps to return him, in apparent defiance of the supreme court, to argue that the president is plunging the US into a constitutional crisis.</p>

            <p>Despite Elon Musk's initial efforts to address cuts to foreign aid, the Trump administration has effectively halted the delivery of emergency food to millions of starving children in countries like Bangladesh and Somalia. Contracts for lifesaving peanut paste production have been canceled, and shipping contracts have not been awarded, leaving food supplies stranded. Experts warn that without urgent intervention, many of these children are likely to die within months, highlighting the devastating consequences of the administration's policies.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. presented new studies on autism, rejecting the idea that improved diagnoses fully explain the rising rates. He directed the NIH to investigate environmental factors, from mold to obesity, as potential causes. While acknowledging increased awareness may play a role, Kennedy emphasized the need to find the environmental exposures behind the increase in autism diagnoses. Experts agree that the rates of diagnoses are increasing and that environmental factors could be at play.</p>

            <p>Japan's export growth in March missed expectations, rising by a modest 3.9% as tariffs begin to take their toll. The growth was lower than the previous month's jump, with exports increasing the most to the Middle East. The data reflects the early impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, particularly on auto imports. The trade data comes as Japan is engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S., with ongoing discussions about tariffs and trade fairness. (not investment advice)</p>
