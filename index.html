          <p>A Ukrainian security official stated that a drone attack, allegedly supervised by President Zelenskyy, destroyed over 40 Russian planes deep within Russia. The operation involved transporting drones in containers via trucks, targeting airfields including the Belaya air base, over 4,000 kilometers from Ukraine. This attack occurred as Zelenskyy announced a Ukrainian delegation would attend direct peace talks with Russia in Istanbul. Russia launched a large number of drones and missiles on Ukraine, resulting in casualties and prompting an investigation into potential negligence by Ukrainian officials, while Russia claimed control of a village in the Sumy region. Optimism in the region is very low due to the ongoing war and loss of life.</p>

          <p>More than 30 Palestinians were killed and many wounded in an Israeli attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip, according to Gaza health officials and witnesses. Witnesses reported fire from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while the Israeli army stated they were unaware of injuries caused by their fire within the aid distribution site and are reviewing the matter. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) claimed it delivered aid without incident, dismissing reports of deaths and chaos, but U.N. agencies have refused to work with the GHF due to humanitarian concerns. This incident occurred as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas falter, with both sides trading blame, and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens.</p>

The penny featured Lady Liberty in 1792, and later President Lincoln's face, designed by a Lithuanian-born Jewish immigrant, Victor David Brenner.

An appeals court reinstated President Trump’s tariffs after a previous court order blocked them.

President Trump also proposed cutting the proportion of international students at Harvard University, leading some to consider alternatives closer to home or in other Western nations.

          <p>The article explores the gendered dynamics of working from home, noting that men often disproportionately occupy dedicated workspaces while women are relegated to less suitable areas. Drawing on personal anecdotes and research, it highlights how structural pay inequalities and societal expectations contribute to this imbalance. The author references Virginia Woolf's "A Room of One's Own," arguing that despite progress, women still struggle to secure adequate space for their work within the domestic sphere.
