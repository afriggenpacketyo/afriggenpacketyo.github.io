          <p>This article details the undercover police operation to capture Bryan Patrick Miller, the suspect in the 1990s Phoenix "canal murders." A cold case detective posed as a security consultant and met Miller at a Chili's restaurant to surreptitiously obtain his DNA from a water glass. The DNA provided a direct match to evidence found on victims Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, leading to the arrest of Miller, who was locally known for his "Zombie Hunter" persona. This breakthrough brought a notorious cold case closer to resolution after more than two decades.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a ban on exporting certain AI chips to China, proposing a new "revenue-sharing" model for companies like Nvidia and AMD. Under the deal, these companies would be allowed to sell specific AI chips if they share 15% of the revenue with the U.S. government. This move has sparked debate among trade experts, who warn it sets a dangerous precedent of making national security-based export controls appear transactional and potentially for sale. The legality of what critics call an export tax is also being examined by the Commerce Department. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An exhibition at the National Museum of China in Beijing is showcasing the works of 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, emphasizing his "Russianness." The collection, provided by Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, presents the artist's life through a Russian cultural lens, from his studies in St. Petersburg to his later years. This presentation comes as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also claimed Repin, known there as Illia Riepin, as part of its national cultural heritage, highlighting the ongoing cultural and historical disputes between the two nations.</p>

The "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans" campaign was criticized by some for having alleged racial undertones, while others praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. Sweeney, who has not commented on the controversy, posted photos from a night out with friends. The article notes that public relations and reputation experts are divided on the long-term impact, with some suggesting the controversy could even boost her career by demonstrating her ability to generate significant buzz.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration agent discharged their firearm at a vehicle during a targeted enforcement operation in San Bernardino, sparking a local police investigation. According to a DHS spokesperson, Customs and Border Protection officers were injured when a suspect refused to exit his vehicle and drove at them. However, the driver contacted police claiming masked men shot at him, and video from a community group appears to show agents breaking the car's windows before shots are fired. The incident has led to accusations of abuse of power and highlights tensions over federal immigration enforcement in a state with sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>A longstanding method for setting speed limits on U.S. roads, known as the "85th percentile rule," is facing increased scrutiny amid rising traffic fatalities. This rule suggests that the speed limit should be set at the speed that 85% of drivers naturally travel at or below, effectively letting drivers determine the legal speed. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, while proponents say it minimizes speed variation. In response to safety concerns, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that other factors, like pedestrian risk, should also be considered, prompting some states to re-evaluate their approach.</p>

The technique creates what is described as an "ionic glassy tissue" that preserves the organ's original structure and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used for highlighting cells. By maintaining the tissue's integrity in a glassy solid state at low temperatures, the method enables highly accurate visualization of the brain's inner workings.

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier based on a novel "scissor wing" or oblique wing design, an idea once explored by NASA. Unlike conventional aircraft, this design features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, while at hypersonic speeds like Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the fuselage, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This innovative approach aims to solve the aerodynamic compromises between low-speed take-off and high-speed flight.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched peacefully to the White House to protest President Trump's recent actions in Washington, D.C., including the deployment of the National Guard and an attempted federal takeover of the city's police force. Protesters voiced concerns over what they see as a legal and ethical breach and an exaggeration of the city's crime issues. The protest followed a successful legal challenge by the D.C. Attorney General that blocked the appointment of a federally controlled "emergency police commissioner." Organizers have indicated that more demonstrations are planned in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary truce in trade tensions, Chinese merchants selling on international e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu remain concerned about policy uncertainties regarding U.S. tariffs. At a recent trade fair, sellers expressed anxiety over the potential for sudden policy shifts that could disrupt their business, as some experienced earlier in the year when souring relations forced a temporary halt to U.S. sales. While the large American market remains attractive for its high traffic and relatively low entry barrier, the unpredictable nature of bilateral trade relations poses a significant risk for these businesses.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that Russia's rejection of ceasefire proposals is complicating efforts to end the war, ahead of his visit to Washington D.C. His comments follow a major policy shift from U.S. President Donald Trump, who now advocates for moving directly to a permanent peace agreement rather than first securing a ceasefire. Trump reportedly relayed a Russian offer to Zelenskyy that would require Ukraine to withdraw from the Donbas region. This new diplomatic pressure from the U.S. places Zelenskyy in a difficult position as he prepares for his meeting at the White House.</p>

          <p>A White House official has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C. as part of President Trump's public safety initiative "may be armed." While the troops are not currently making arrests, their mission includes protecting federal assets and providing a visible presence to deter crime. This statement marks a shift from earlier guidance, which indicated that weapons would be available but stored in an armory. The deployment, which now includes troops from three additional states, is part of a broader federalization of the city's police force that has been met with protests from local residents.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, with the Southwest region showing the highest positivity rate at 12.5%, according to new CDC data. This spike is attributed to the highly contagious "Stratus" variant and coincides with students returning to school. The increase in infections has reignited debate over public health policy, particularly a recent CDC change, influenced by the HHS Secretary, that removed the recommendation for updated COVID shots for healthy children and pregnant women. Medical organizations have filed a lawsuit challenging this decision as baseless.</p>

          <h2>Hurricane Erin's Rapid Intensification Highlights Trend in a Warming Climate</h2>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has become one of the fastest-intensifying storms in Atlantic history, strengthening from a Category 1 to a near-Category 5 hurricane in just over 24 hours. This phenomenon of rapid intensification has become more common as rising ocean and atmospheric temperatures provide more fuel for storms. While Erin is expected to remain at sea, passing between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda, its rapid development serves as a stark example of how climate change is increasing the extremity of weather events. It is the 11th Category 5 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic since 2016.</p>

          <p>A former software CEO, Mike Conner, has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the abandoned property for £555,000 in 2017, he undertook the immense challenge of making it habitable, which included overcoming the lack of running water and electricity. The historic fortress is now a fully modernized, 40-bed party space with its own nightclub and is back on the market for £3 million. The project required workers to live on-site for years and materials to be brought in by helicopter.</p>
