          <p>China's retail sales experienced a significant surge in May, growing at the fastest pace since December 2023, largely driven by the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays, as well as the government's trade-in program for consumer goods. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' estimates of 5%, while industrial output growth slowed slightly to 5.8%. Fixed-asset investment also saw a slower expansion of 3.7%, and the urban survey-based unemployment rate eased to 5.0%, the lowest since November of the previous year. The rise in retail sales was a surprise, boosted by the consumer goods trade-in program, while falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, experienced a significant surge of over 15% following a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion by a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC). The offer, which includes Abu Dhabi Development Holding Co and Carlyle Group, proposes a cash price of $5.76 per Santos share, a 27.73% premium over the previous closing price. Santos' board intends to recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, which would give the consortium control of Australian liquefied natural gas operations and stakes in PNG LNG and Papua LNG. XRG's takeover bid comes as the investment firm has been on the hunt for deals in the natural gas, chemicals, and lower-carbon energy solutions space. (not investment advice)</p>

This crackdown follows media reports of professional athletes and celebrities using online casinos, with police estimating over 3 million people in Japan have gambled online.

The flooding caused extensive damage to roads, bridges, natural gas lines, and other infrastructure, with 2.5 to 4 inches of rain falling in parts of Wheeling and Ohio County in a short period. Rescue crews conducted swift water rescues, and authorities are assessing the damage while searching for the missing. The governor has declared a state of emergency in Ohio and Marion Counties, and the National Guard is providing assistance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to expand deportation efforts, targeting cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. Trump stated that these cities are "the core of the Democrat Power Center" and ordered ICE to "do all in their power" to achieve mass deportations. He aims to focus on the "REMIGRATION of Aliens" and prevent the admission of anyone who undermines the domestic tranquility of the United States.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have made significant progress in developing a new type of LED technology known as perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), which could revolutionize electronic devices. Researchers have found a way to extend the lifespan of PeLEDs to over 20 years while maintaining comparable brightness to commercial displays. This breakthrough addresses a major obstacle in the commercial adoption of PeLEDs, which have previously suffered from instability and short lifespans. Durable and efficient PeLEDs could be used to create low-cost, ultra-bright lighting and high-end display screens.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's claims about business investment, finding that his assertions of over $12 trillion in committed investments are not supported by clear data. While there has been a jump in business investment, it is too early in Trump's tenure to fully evaluate the impact of his policies. The analysis suggests that the actual new investment stemming from announcements is much lower than the figures cited by the administration. Some companies have credited Trump's policies for shaping their plans, but there is an incentive for companies to exaggerate their commitments. (not investment advice)</p>
