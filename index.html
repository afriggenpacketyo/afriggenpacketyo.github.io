        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign students, citing the university's alleged failure to address antisemitism and its ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of fostering an unsafe environment hostile to Jewish students and demanded records of foreign students involved in protests. Harvard has rejected these allegations, calling the government's action unlawful and threatening harm to the university's academic mission. The decision could affect nearly 6,800 international students at Harvard and has drawn criticism from China, which accuses the US of politicizing educational exchanges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece from The New York Times, Lydia Polgreen describes President Trump's meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa as a deliberate attempt at humiliation rather than a genuine effort to address bilateral issues. Trump focused on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide, showing a misleading video and disregarding the complex realities of South African politics. Polgreen highlights that Trump's actions undermine America's role as a reliable partner on the global stage, especially as the G20 summit approaches in South Africa. Ramaphosa maintained composure throughout the encounter, emphasizing South Africa's role in the changing world order.</p>

          <p>Apple has raised trade-in prices for iPhones in China to boost demand in a crucial market where it faces increasing competition from local rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei. The increased trade-in values, though modest, signal Apple's ongoing efforts to galvanize sales in the world's second-largest economy. This move comes after a reported 8% year-on-year drop in China shipments and a decline in market share during the first quarter. Apple is also navigating challenges related to its supply chain and potential tariffs on electronics manufactured in China, where around 90% of its iPhones are produced.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills in the UK will fall by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year for 21 million households. This decrease will reduce the typical annual bill by Â£129, but charities warn that many people still struggle to pay due to accumulated debt. The drop reflects a fall in international wholesale gas prices, though prices remain high compared to previous years. The announcement follows recent hikes in energy, water, and council tax bills, and there are concerns about the impact on vulnerable households, particularly those with children.</p>

The Philippines vessels landed personnel on Sandy Cay and approached a Chinese ship as it was carrying out regular law enforcement operations, resulting in the collision.

          <p>Record floodwaters in eastern Australia have resulted in four deaths and one missing person, with approximately 50,000 people isolated along the coast of New South Wales. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Premier Christopher Minns are inspecting devastated communities inundated by the highest floodwaters on record. Emergency services have rescued 678 people from floodwaters in recent days. Despite easing rain, authorities remain vigilant for potential rises in floodwaters due to ongoing catchment flows.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students could significantly impact the university's sports teams. Many of Harvard's varsity sports teams rely heavily on international athletes, with some teams having a majority of their players hailing from foreign countries. The move could force as many as 6,800 foreign students at the school outside of Boston to transfer or leave the country. Harvard has called the action unlawful and is working to provide guidance to students.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to explore holding a face-to-face meeting in June on the fringes of the Group of Seven summit in Canada, with both expressing hope that a preceding round of ministerial-level tariff negotiations will be 'productive'. Ishiba emphasized the need for more bilateral cooperation, including in the field of economic security. While a summit during the G7 is an option, Ishiba said he will not rule out the possibility of traveling to the United States to meet Trump, depending on how the situation unfolds. Japan continues to urge the United States to remove tariffs, due to concern about their impact on the Japanese economy.</p>

          <p>Gaby Hinsliff discusses how the 'DEI hire' taunt, fueled by Donald Trump's war on woke, is used to undermine successful individuals from non-traditional backgrounds. This playground insult feeds an age-old grievance, creating a climate where prejudice can be expressed with confidence and fostering self-doubt. The article highlights the need to address the online abuse and discrimination that disproportionately affects women and minorities. It emphasizes that Britain is not America, but efforts must be made to prevent similar prejudices from taking root.</p>

          <p>The Maya Ixil community in Guatemala is mobilizing against transnational corporations that have invaded their ancestral lands to install hydroelectric plants. This community, which suffered a massacre in 1982, now faces a 'fourth invasion' by companies disregarding the rights and will of indigenous peoples. The Palo Viejo hydroelectric plant, owned by Enel Green Power, uses water from five rivers, generating significant profits while providing minimal benefits to the local municipality. The community's fight is rooted in the lack of consultation before implementing the project, violating the International Labour Organization's Convention 169.</p>
