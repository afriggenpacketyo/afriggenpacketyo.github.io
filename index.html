            <p>Both Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for breaking a 30-hour "Easter truce" declared by the Russian president. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported over 46 Russian assaults on Ukraine's front line since Sunday morning, while Russia's defense ministry claimed to have repelled Ukrainian attacks and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. Zelensky dismissed Putin's truce declaration as a PR stunt, accusing the Kremlin of trying to create a false impression of a ceasefire. The Russian defense ministry maintained that its troops had strictly observed the ceasefire. Optimism score: 30</p>

            <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration proposes significant changes to the U.S. State Department, including closing embassies in Southern Africa and eliminating bureaus focused on democracy, human rights, and international organizations. The order aims to streamline operations, project American strength, and align the department with an "American First Strategic Doctrine." The plan involves consolidating regional bureaus into four "regional corps" and altering diplomat selection to prioritize alignment with the president's foreign policy vision.
