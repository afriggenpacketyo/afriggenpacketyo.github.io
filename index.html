          <p>China has condemned the United States for its attacks on Iranian nuclear sites, describing them as serious violations of international law.

China called on all parties, especially Israel, to cease fire as soon as possible, ensure the safety of civilians, and start dialogue. The ministry expressed China's willingness to work with the international community to uphold justice and restore peace and stability in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, global leaders and organizations have expressed a range of reactions. Israeli leaders lauded the U.S. action, while Iranian officials vowed responses and condemned the attacks as a violation of the UN Charter. Russian state media condemned the strikes, and the UN Secretary General urged de-escalation and diplomacy. Allies of Iran, such as Hamas and the Houthis, also condemned the strikes and pledged to join in retaliation, raising concerns about a wider regional conflict. Other countries, including China, the UK, and EU members, called for dialogue and negotiation to resolve the crisis. Optimism remains low given the escalatory nature of the conflict and the potential for further violence.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the US conducted a "successful" bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, claiming they were "obliterated," with Israel affirming "full co-ordination" in planning the strikes. Iranian officials confirmed the facilities were hit but denied major damage, stating the sites had been evacuated. The US reportedly used GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) to target the Fordo facility, a uranium enrichment plant hidden deep underground. Iran launched missiles at Tel Aviv and Haifa in retaliation, and international reactions have been mixed, with some calling for de-escalation and others supporting the US action.</p>

The US military had repositioned forces, including assets from the Indo-Pacific, for the conflict, but Washington has repeatedly pledged to prioritize strategic resources on China. Although the decision to strike Iran has expanded US military engagement in the Middle East, experts believe the US will maintain its primary focus on China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Oren Cass, founder of American Compass, discusses the economic theory behind Trumpism and the shift in conservative economic thinking. He argues that the Republican Party has been too focused on corporate interests and market fundamentalism, advocating for a reset that embraces American manufacturing and empowers workers. Cass believes that the right has been blind to these issues, and that a new economic populism is needed. He also addresses the differences between this approach and democratic socialism, emphasizing traditional values and nationalism.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey of the Liberal Democrats proposes offering new army recruits a Â£10,000 bonus to boost troop numbers amid global uncertainties. The plan aims to increase the number of trained soldiers from just under 71,000 to more than 73,000, with a similar bonus for former personnel returning to service. Davey also suggests distributing pamphlets to prepare British homes for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks. The Lib Dems intend to fund the bonus scheme through an increase in the Digital Services Tax, anticipating defense spending to rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.</p>
