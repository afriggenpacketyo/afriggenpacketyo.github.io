          <p>A Ukrainian commander, Mykhailo Drapaty, resigned after a Russian missile struck a training unit, resulting in the deaths of at least 12 Ukrainian troops and injuries to over 60 others; Kyiv reported a record number of missile and drone attacks. Drapaty expressed feeling "responsibility" for the incident, where most of the soldiers were in shelters during the attack. The resignation comes amidst heightened tensions and increased Russian aerial assaults on Ukrainian territory. This incident underscores the ongoing challenges faced by Ukrainian forces in defending against Russian attacks and the heavy toll it takes on personnel and morale.

          <p>President Trump's economic advisors are standing by his tariff policies despite legal challenges that could reach the Supreme Court; a federal court had previously ruled that Trump overstepped his authority in imposing the duties, but the administration secured a temporary pause on the ruling via appeal. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick asserted that "tariffs are not going away," and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed confidence that the Supreme Court would uphold the tariffs. Hassett mentioned the possibility of alternative measures to ensure fair trade if the tariffs are blocked, but did not provide specifics. The administration argues that overturning the tariffs would undermine negotiating leverage with other countries. (not investment advice)</p>
