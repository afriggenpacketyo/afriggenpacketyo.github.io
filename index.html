          <p>A 22-year-old man, Raymond Boodarian, has been charged with two counts of murder and residential burglary for the shooting deaths of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The couple was killed in their Encino home after allegedly interrupting a burglary on July 10. Boodarian was identified using security footage and facial recognition software, leading to his arrest days after the couple's bodies were found during a welfare check. His arraignment is postponed, and he remains jailed without bail as prosecutors consider seeking the death penalty.</p>

          <p>A top Trump administration official has accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of overseeing an "ostentatious" and potentially unlawful office renovation, escalating tensions over the central bank's independence. The Office of Management and Budget questioned the project's costs and alleged changes were made without proper approval. Powell defended the renovations, stating they are necessary safety and structural upgrades for buildings dating to the 1930s and that descriptions of luxury features are inaccurate. This conflict unfolds as President Trump continues to criticize Powell over interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump is facing mounting bipartisan pressure, including from his own supporters, to release the full Justice Department file on the Jeffrey Epstein case. The administration has so far resisted these calls, with Trump labeling interest in the case a "hoax" and dismissing supporters who want the files as "weaklings." The controversy intensified after the Attorney General misspoke about an Epstein client list, and suspicions grew over redacted footage from near Epstein's cell. The ongoing refusal to release the documents has created a political challenge for Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p>

          <p>The Steve Miller Band has canceled its entire 2025 North American tour, which was scheduled to begin in August, citing unacceptable risks from extreme weather. In a statement, the band pointed to a combination of severe heat, flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes, and wildfires as the reason for the cancellation, prioritizing the safety of their audience, band, and crew. The announcement came as a surprise, as the band was promoting the tour just a day earlier. While many fans expressed understanding, the vague justification left some speculating about other potential reasons for the decision.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has refuted false rumors circulating on social media that claim wildlife is fleeing Yellowstone National Park in large numbers. Viral videos, believed to be AI-generated and satirical, depict herds of bison, bears, and other animals migrating out of the park, fueling speculation about a potential supervolcano eruption. Wildlife experts confirm that animal movements are normal, with some seasonal migration for food, but there is no mass exodus occurring. The U.S. Geological Survey reports the volcano's alert level is normal, and officials are concerned the misinformation undermines public understanding of nature.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia, allowing it to move forward.

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after noticing mild swelling in his legs. A letter from his physician described the condition as "benign" and "common" for his age group, confirming he is in "excellent health." Chronic venous insufficiency is a circulatory issue where veins in the leg struggle to return blood to the heart, causing pooling and swelling. Treatment typically involves non-surgical methods like compression stockings and exercise to strengthen calf muscles, which aid in blood circulation.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that the administration acted unlawfully by unilaterally shutting down the congressionally funded program, which provided grants for projects to mitigate natural disaster risks like flooding. The states argue the cuts threaten projects already in development and leave communities more vulnerable.

This practice has become more frequent under the Trump administration, which has aggressively sought emergency relief from the Court to enact its policies while litigation is ongoing. Critics argue this approach undermines transparency and legal precedent, as significant decisions—such as allowing the dismantling of the Department of Education—are made without a clear rationale, raising questions about the Court's politicization and legitimacy.</p>

          <p>Bryan Braman, a former NFL linebacker who won Super Bowl LII with the Philadelphia Eagles, has died at the age of 38 after a battle with a rare and aggressive form of cancer.

          <p>Amazon has announced another round of layoffs, this time affecting some employees in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing division. The company stated the cuts are part of an ongoing effort to review organizational priorities and streamline its workforce, not primarily due to AI investments. While the exact number of affected employees was not disclosed, the training and certification unit is among the impacted groups. These layoffs continue CEO Andy Jassy's multi-year cost-cutting initiative, which has seen over 27,000 jobs eliminated since 2022 across various company divisions.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' plan to vote on a $9 billion spending cuts package demanded by President Trump has been complicated by internal tensions over the Jeffrey Epstein case. Democrats on the House Rules Committee are leveraging the controversy, forcing Republicans to take politically difficult votes on amendments that would compel the release of Epstein-related documents. This has stalled the progress of the rescissions bill, which faces a looming deadline. The situation highlights a growing divide within the GOP, as many of Trump's supporters are demanding full transparency on the Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has formally responded to the Trump administration's accusations regarding costly renovations at the central bank's headquarters. In a letter to the Office of Management and Budget, Powell detailed that the project involves essential structural repairs and hazardous material removal for buildings from the 1930s, not the creation of "ostentatious" luxuries as alleged. He emphasized that the project is subject to rigorous oversight and annual board approval.

          <p>Brazil's exports of rare earth minerals to China tripled in the first half of 2025, a surge that coincides with record-high Chinese imports of the strategic materials. A new report from the China-Brazil Business Council suggests these shifting trade patterns may be a ripple effect of the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, with global supply chains rerouting through emerging economies. While Brazil's overall exports to China declined, the dramatic increase in rare earth shipments indicates China's strategic effort to diversify its access to critical minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Darius Khondji, the celebrated cinematographer known for his visually distinctive work with directors like David Fincher, James Gray, and most recently, Ari Aster on the film "Eddington." Khondji describes his approach as chameleon-like, adapting completely to a director's vision and focusing on the feeling and emotion of a story rather than rigid aesthetics. His eclectic resume includes iconic films such as "Seven," "Amour," and "Uncut Gems." Colleagues praise him as a "poet" who understands the human soul and masters the technical tools to express it on screen.</p>

          <p>The White House has stated that President Trump would not recommend the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the Jeffrey Epstein case.

In its second quarter without releasing subscriber data, Netflix emphasized its improved operating margin.

This article explores the irony and risks of this approach, as it is being done under pressure from the Trump administration, which is simultaneously working to dismantle DEI programs nationwide.
