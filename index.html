        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan experienced unprecedented foreign investment inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, as investors sought refuge from perceived instability in U.S. markets due to President Trump's trade policies. The net inflows totaled 8.21 trillion yen, marking the largest monthly increase since 1996, with institutional investors driving the surge. This shift was prompted by concerns over U.S. economic prospects and asset performance, leading to diversification into safer havens like Japan. As the U.S. softens its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which could impact future investment flows into Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A pregnant woman in Georgia, declared brain dead after a medical emergency, has been kept on life support for three months to allow the fetus to develop, a decision reportedly driven by the state's strict abortion laws. The family is concerned that Georgia's law, which restricts abortion after cardiac activity is detected, prevents them from making decisions about the woman's medical care. Doctors have informed the family that the fetus has fluid on the brain and are worried about its health, but the family has not yet indicated whether they want life support removed. Bioethicists note that Georgia law doesn't explicitly require life support in such cases, sparking debate about fetal rights post-Roe v. Wade.</p>

Tice's comments come after his partner, journalist Isabel Oakeshott, lauded Dubai's booming economy and culture of respect. While acknowledging that Dubai is not "perfect," Tice argues that the UK's current values are failing, citing high crime rates and foreign criminals in jails as evidence.</p>

          <p>Romania faces a potential shift to the far-right as George Simion, a self-described Trumpist, leads in presidential polls, reflecting widespread anti-establishment sentiment rooted in decades of economic struggles. The article highlights that despite respectable growth numbers, Romania performs poorly on key social indicators, with a significant portion of the population at risk of poverty. The author criticizes mainstream parties for failing to address the broken economic model, which has fueled the far-right's rise. While Simion calls for cutting welfare benefits and downsizing the public sector, his economic agenda largely caters to the domestic business class, mirroring policies seen in Viktor Orbanâ€™s Hungary.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has passed a law enabling preemptive cyberdefense measures, allowing the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers during peacetime. This legislation mandates operators of key infrastructure sectors to report cyber breaches, aiming to counter increasing cyber threats. While the government will monitor IP addresses used in international communications, it is restricted from surveilling the content of domestic messages. The law also establishes an independent panel for oversight, addressing concerns about potential government overreach and protecting personal rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to falling exports affected by U.S. trade policies. Despite the overall contraction, domestic demand showed strength, growing by 0.6% and contributing positively to the GDP. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has warned of potential moderation in the country's economy due to global trade policies, while also indicating a possible continuation of policy rate hikes if inflation targets are met. Experts anticipate a reasonable trade deal with the U.S., which could mitigate the tariff impact.</p>

          <p>Europe has been cautioned that it must undergo rapid reforms or risk becoming a "shock absorber" in the face of global trade imbalances caused by tensions between the US and China. While recent talks have led to a temporary reduction in tariffs, economists argue that Europe needs deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies to avoid being forced to adjust to the choices of others. Without these changes, Europe may struggle to shape outcomes and assert itself as a significant global power.</p>

          <p>Australia's most-decorated living soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, has lost his appeal against a defamation judgement that found he committed war crimes. The original ruling stated that news articles alleging he murdered four unarmed Afghans were true, and the appeal court upheld this decision. The civil trial marked the first time a court assessed war crimes claims against Australian forces. Roberts-Smith maintains his innocence and plans to appeal to the High Court of Australia, though he has not been charged in a criminal court.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Trump administration for a social media post that officials claim amounted to a call for President Trump's assassination. The post, which Comey later removed, featured seashells forming the numbers "86 47," a phrase used by critics of the president. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem alleged that Comey had "called for the assassination" of Mr. Trump, prompting an investigation by the Secret Service.

          <p>Nissan is considering sharing its factories around the world with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as it shakes up its business. The struggling company, which is laying off 11,000 workers and closing seven factories, could bring Dongfeng "into the Nissan production eco-system globally." Nissan's own brands have struggled to make inroads in China, and the firm has also faced leadership changes and failed merger talks with Honda. The company recently reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen ($4.6bn; Â£3.4bn), with US President Donald Trump's tariffs putting further pressure on the struggling firm.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis of federal court data reveals that lawyers are increasingly seeking out jurisdictions with sympathetic judges to address divisive political issues. Conservatives suing the Biden administration often file cases in small Texas federal courts with single judges appointed by Republicans. Similarly, liberals challenging the Trump administration file cases in larger venues, predominantly in the 9th Circuit, and increasingly in Massachusetts. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country by issuing a nationwide injunction.</p>

Ventura acknowledged she loved Combs for over a decade and hoped to build a life with him, but said she began to see a different side of Combs that was prone to violence, jealousy and rage.
