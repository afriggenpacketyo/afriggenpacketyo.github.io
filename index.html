          <p>Retired General Frank McKenzie, former commander of CENTCOM, assessed the recent US operation against Iranian nuclear facilities, suggesting it inflicted significant, possibly irreversible damage. He anticipates a potential Iranian response, emphasizing the need to defend US forces and interests in the region. McKenzie notes Iran's decision-making may be hampered by the loss of senior leaders and a lack of clear succession plans. He also highlights potential vulnerabilities in Iraq and Syria, while acknowledging Iran's historical interest in attacking the US homeland, though their past attempts have been largely unsuccessful.</p>
