          <p>American fund managers are urging Congress to revise Section 899 of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," fearing it could trigger a rapid withdrawal of foreign investments from the U.S. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the provision, intended to penalize firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," inadvertently impacts most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The ICI argues that the bill could depress U.S. equity markets and harm both U.S. companies and investors, with foreign investors owning trillions in U.S. stocks, bonds, and credit. They propose clarifying the scope of Section 899 to avoid discouraging foreign investment in U.S. equity markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Disorder erupted in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a protest regarding an alleged sexual assault, with masked individuals throwing objects at police and setting houses ablaze. Jim Allister, a local MP, described the violence as "unwanted and unwarranted," noting that the demonstration's "context" involved demographic changes due to immigration. The unrest occurred hours after two teenage boys appeared in court, accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl. Hundreds participated in an earlier peaceful march before the violence escalated, causing property damage and requiring police intervention to restore order. </p>

          <p>China's recent restrictions on rare earth exports, initially impacting the automotive and robotics industries, are now raising concerns for Western defense giants. These restrictions, part of a trade dispute with the U.S., require firms to apply for licenses to export rare earths and magnets, crucial for defense technologies like radar, sonar, and laser guidance systems. Experts warn that the U.S., EU, and Australia must coordinate to boost rare earth production due to China's dominance in the supply chain. Without access to these minerals, the construction of critical military equipment like F-35 fighter jets could be severely affected.</p>

          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan lags behind many countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership roles. The report, reviewed by a task force led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, acknowledges that efforts to close gender gaps by 2030 remain insufficient. Japan ranked 118th out of 146 economies in the 2024 Global Gender Gap Index, prompting the government to step up efforts to advance gender equality. The latest basic policy on gender equality and women's empowerment focuses on local economies and small businesses to combat the female brain drain in rural areas.</p>

          <p>David Huerta, president of the California division of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), has been charged with interfering with law enforcement operations after being arrested during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. According to court documents, Huerta allegedly blocked a vehicular gate to a staging ground for ICE operations and resisted officers' attempts to move him. Newsom and other Democratic leaders have denounced the arrest, while SEIU officials held a protest in Washington, D.C., in support of Huerta's release. Huerta faces up to six years in federal prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam increased by 18.8%, exports to Thailand grew by 20.9%, and Indonesia saw a 16.8% increase in shipments from China. This expansion is partly due to Chinese manufacturers shipping more to Southeast Asian factories to produce finished goods for local sale or export, including to the U.S., in response to import tariffs imposed by the U.S. This diversification of exports underscores the increasing importance of Southeast Asian countries as trading partners.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines to Los Angeles. Newsom argues that the deployment violates federal law and state sovereignty, calling it a "red line" that the administration is crossing. Trump stated that the city would have been "completely obliterated" without the deployment of the Guard. Despite the presence of the Guard, local law enforcement continues to manage crowd control, with minimal interaction between the Guard and protesters.</p>

          <p>Following immigration raids and subsequent protests in Los Angeles, President Donald Trump deployed National Guard troops and Marines, drawing criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who called it an "unmistakable step toward authoritarianism." The rapid deployment of troops has sparked concerns about the administration's willingness to flex its power and test the limits of public tolerance. Experts warn that these actions could normalize the presence of troops on the streets of a major American city, eroding constitutional checks and balances. The situation has prompted legal challenges and raised questions about the resilience of US democracy.</p>

          <p>A recall on cases of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded to Class II by the FDA due to a serious health risk. The cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company, were mislabeled and contained the full amount of sugar found in regular Dr Pepper, around 39 grams, despite being labeled "zero sugar." This poses a risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, particularly those with diabetes, as consuming too much sugar can lead to hyperglycemia and potentially fatal complications. The recalled cans have the product code XXXXRS05165 and a "best by" date of February 16, 2026, and were distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting a loophole in Europe's drug classification system to smuggle ketamine, swapping it for salt or sugar during transit across multiple borders. In some countries, ketamine is regulated as a medicine, facing less scrutiny, while in others, it is classified as a narcotic. This allows smugglers to divert legitimate supplies into illicit markets, with some gangs making more money from ketamine than cocaine. The UK has seen an 85% increase in ketamine consumption between 2023 and 2024, linked to high-profile deaths and health issues, prompting calls for greater international cooperation to tackle the problem.</p>
