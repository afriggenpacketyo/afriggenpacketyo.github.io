        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of over 130 retired judges has filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing that her arrest undermines judicial immunity precedents. Dugan was arrested on federal allegations of obstructing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse. The judges argue that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to that given to members of the legislative and executive branches. They believe prosecuting Dugan would create a chilling effect on judges, stifling independent decision-making and threatening public trust in the judicial system. The judicial community feels that the prosecution threatens the independence of the judiciary.</p>

          <p>President Trump lauded Elon Musk for his contributions to the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a special government employee concluded. Trump stated that Musk's work has been unparalleled in modern history, praising his efforts to overhaul the federal government and cut costs. While DOGE's reported savings of $170 billion fell short of Musk's initial $1 trillion promise, Trump indicated that Musk would remain involved as a friend and advisor. Musk defended DOGE's work and expressed confidence in achieving the $1 trillion goal over time, emphasizing the importance of reducing wasteful spending in government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical trial indicates that an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab, can double the survival time for patients with advanced head and neck cancer. This marks a significant breakthrough for a cancer type that has seen little treatment advancement in two decades, as more than half of those diagnosed with advanced head and neck cancers die within five years. The drug is administered before and after surgery to prime the body's defenses against the cancer. The trial demonstrated that patients receiving pembrolizumab were cancer-free for an average of five years, compared to 2.5 years with standard care, indicating the potential for longer, disease-free lives for many patients. The positive results offer hope for improved outcomes for those battling this challenging disease.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during remarks at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania. Trump stated that the increased tariffs would further secure the steel industry, making it harder for foreign steel to compete in the U.S. market. He also addressed the controversial merger with Japan's Nippon, stating that Nippon has committed to keeping U.S. Steel's blast furnaces operating at full capacity for a minimum of a decade, with no layoffs or outsourcing. U.S. Steel workers will receive a $5,000 bonus, with headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh as Nippon invests $14 billion in the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Army has issued guidelines for expelling transgender troops, instructing personnel to address transgender troops according to their medical assignment at birth rather than their preferred pronoun. Soldiers will identify fellow service members suspected of having gender dysphoria based on criteria such as requests for grooming standard exemptions or overt conduct of gender identity differing from assigned sex at birth. Commanders are expected to initiate medical record reviews, and service members will be asked about their identity during routine medical check-ups. The Army's guidance begins with the suggestion that identifying with a gender different from one's sex assigned at birth is at odds with the values of truthfulness and discipline expected of service members. These policies run counter to transgender social norms and could negatively impact transgender service members' careers and security clearances.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners. Despite the temporary reinstatement of the tariffs by a federal appeals court, the administration is considering other tools to advance its trade policies. Options include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930. Each of these options has limitations and requirements that could impact the scope and speed of tariff implementation.</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, challenging his executive order to cut off its federal funding. PBS accuses the president of retaliating against the public broadcaster over perceived political slights in news coverage. The lawsuit argues that Trump's order violates the U.S. Constitution and the law governing public television, which forbid him from attempting to defund PBS or serving as the arbiter of its programming. PBS seeks to safeguard public television's editorial independence and protect the autonomy of its member stations.</p>

The iconic trees are not adapted to wildfire, and any fire damage can be devastating to the population.

          <p>A recent New York Times opinion piece explores the connection between therapy culture and the increasing rate of childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that the redefinition of harm and trauma has led to an impossible standard for parenting, contributing to a dread of parenthood. Adult children are more likely to cut off contact with parents, citing emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, or other factors like clashing values. This cultural shift has contributed to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting.</p>
