          <h2>Volvo Cars to Shift US Production Strategy in Response to Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 05:04:33 EDT</div>

          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars is adjusting its US market strategy due to tariffs, planning to produce its popular XC60 SUV at its South Carolina plant starting in 2026. This move aims to better utilize the American factory and mitigate the impact of tariffs on imported vehicles. Despite a significant drop in second-quarter operating profit and revenue compared to last year, the company's performance exceeded analyst expectations, causing its shares to rise. The company is also phasing out some sedans and wagons in the U.S. amid changing consumer demand and trade policies.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has signed Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool for a world record fee of £1 million, making it the most expensive transfer in women's football history. The 20-year-old, who has signed a four-year contract with the Champions League holders, expressed her excitement about joining the club and competing for major titles. This deal surpasses the previous record set by Chelsea's £900,000 signing of Naomi Girma. Smith, who made her international debut for Canada at just 15, is considered a major talent in the sport.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that artificial intelligence will have its most profound impact on scientific fields like drug discovery, even more so than on human-centric tasks. Speaking at a conference in Beijing, Huang explained that while AI for human language is simpler, understanding the complex language of biology, created by nature, presents a greater challenge and opportunity. He believes AI can help decipher the meaning of proteins, cells, and life itself, leading to the design of new drugs and longer lifespans for people. Huang emphasized that this area represents the most significant potential for AI-driven progress.</p>

          <p>Director Ari Aster's new film, "Eddington," is a period piece set in a fictional New Mexico town during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. The movie, described as a Western, depicts a standoff between a mask-enforcing mayor played by Pedro Pascal and a sheriff, played by Joaquin Phoenix, who advocates for personal choice. Aster, known for building tension in his films, explores how the pandemic's culture wars pushed people into paranoia and deepened societal divisions. He hopes the film serves as a critique of this polarization and encourages audiences to reflect on the path the country is on.</p>

          <p>Maryland has become the first state to utilize a fund established under the Affordable Care Act to help cover expenses for patients traveling to the state for abortion care. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Maryland has seen a surge in out-of-state patients, straining the resources of nonprofit abortion funds. The new law allows the state to tap into a multi-million dollar account, funded by fees from insurance companies, to provide up to $2.5 million annually in grants. Proponents say this innovative model could be replicated by other states to ensure access to care and clinic stability.</p>

          <p>Residents in Virginia, which hosts the world's highest concentration of data centers, are mounting successful opposition to new projects due to concerns over massive power and water consumption, and constant noise pollution.

While industry groups highlight the economic benefits, a growing "not-in-my-backyard" movement is gaining traction, with communities like Chesapeake successfully blocking proposed developments near residential areas.

The cockpit voice recording reportedly captures the first officer's surprise and panic as the captain moved the fuel switches to the cut-off position. This assessment follows a preliminary report from India's investigation bureau which found the switches had been turned off. All but one of the 242 people on board were killed in the crash, and investigators are now examining the captain's medical records amid claims he had mental health issues.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Turks and Caicos have officially identified a body discovered earlier this month as that of Brian Tarrence, an American tourist who went missing in late June. The identification was made using dental records. According to the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force, an autopsy revealed no signs of trauma, and foul play is not suspected at this time. Tarrence, from Manhattan, was on vacation with his wife and was last seen on surveillance footage walking away from his hotel. The final autopsy and toxicology reports are still pending.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has lashed out at his own supporters who criticized his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, calling them "weaklings" who have "bought into" a "hoax." The backlash from some supporters, including conservative influencers, came after the FBI and Justice Department stated there was no "incriminating client list" and that no more files would be released, contrary to earlier promises. Trump defended his administration's actions on Truth Social, claiming critics were being duped by Democrats and that he no longer wanted their support. He reiterated that all credible information had already been released.</p>

The framework includes a significant, fivefold increase in defense and space investment, with a proposed allocation of €131 billion for a new European Competitiveness Fund. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described it as a budget for today's realities, with about 35% also dedicated to climate and biodiversity projects. The proposal, which must gain unanimous approval from member states, also seeks new revenue streams to fund priorities like migration management and support for Ukraine. (not investment advice)</p>

The initiative will "resolutely crack down" on corruption such as accepting bribes or embezzling research money.

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI is facing opposition in Memphis, Tennessee, as the NAACP and environmental groups appeal a permit allowing the company to run natural gas-burning turbines for its supercomputer. The groups argue the Shelby County Health Department improperly issued the permit and ignored residents' complaints about emissions and worsening air pollution in nearby majority-Black communities. They contend the turbines, which emit pollutants like nitrogen oxides, were miscategorized to circumvent regulations. In response, xAI called the appeal a "baseless, politically driven" action and maintained its compliance with all laws.</p>

          <p>The recent disciplinary action by the UK Labour Party, which saw four MPs suspended and three others lose envoy roles for rebelling, is being viewed through conflicting lenses. Downing Street aims to project authority and deter future rebellions, insisting the move was a considered response to repeated opposition, not a single vote. However, some Labour MPs have described the actions as "petty" and "vindictive," arguing they could damage morale within the party. This move highlights a central tension for the new government as it balances the need for party discipline with the risk of appearing weak or overly punitive.</p>
