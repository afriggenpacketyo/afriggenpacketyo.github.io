          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato addressed trade imbalances and tariffs in their initial face-to-face discussions. They affirmed the G7 agreement on market-determined exchange rates and cautioned against excessive currency volatility. Japan is implementing emergency economic measures to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs, which includes corporate financing support and stimulating consumption.

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, suggests the U.S. may be overestimating its leverage in tariff negotiations with China. He stated that China has been preparing for this trade conflict since 2018 and does not feel the same urgency for a deal as the White House. Stein also noted that China views the U.S. tariff policy as part of a broader strategy to contain China's growth, making a quick resolution unlikely. This perspective highlights the complexities and potential miscalculations in the ongoing trade dispute. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>Hamdan Ballal, co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land," was attacked at home and arrested, highlighting the ongoing challenges faced by Palestinians in the West Bank. Ballal's experience underscores the disconnect between international recognition and the daily realities of violence and harassment in his village of Susiya. Despite the film's success in bringing attention to their struggle, it did not protect Ballal from the realities of the occupation. Ballal's arrest highlights the ongoing challenges and lack of protection for Palestinians, even after international recognition. Optimism score: 10</p>

          <p>The Post Office has spent over £600 million to continue using the flawed Horizon IT system, despite deciding to replace it a decade ago. The original 1999 deal with Fujitsu gave the Post Office limited ownership of the code, preventing them from building a replacement or inspecting the software. This reliance on Fujitsu's assurances led to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters for cash shortfalls reported by the system. Despite attempts to replace the system, the Post Office remains dependent on Horizon, with the contract potentially extending beyond 2026. Optimism score: 30</p>
