The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, 30, of Chicago, was apprehended after allegedly chanting "free, free Palestine" while in custody. The victims, identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were a couple about to be engaged, according to Israel's ambassador to the U.S. Authorities are investigating the shooting as a potential targeted attack motivated by antisemitism, with both local and federal law enforcement agencies involved. The incident has sparked condemnation from Israeli and U.S. leaders, who have emphasized that such acts of violence and hate will not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>A wildlife refuge in Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico, was forced to evacuate over 700 animals, including tigers, elephants, and lions, due to escalating cartel violence. The Ostok Sanctuary faced threats and intimidation from rival factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, leading to a breakdown of law and order in the region. Some animals went days without food, and two big cats died from stress, highlighting the extreme conditions. The sanctuary's director noted the unprecedented level of violence, with staff receiving threats to burn down the facility and kill the animals if payments were not made. This incident underscores the pervasive impact of cartel violence on civilians and even wildlife in Mexico.</p>

          <p>A Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite a judge's ruling prohibiting it, sparking internal conflict among officials in the Department of Homeland Security, Justice Department, and State Department. D.H.S. officials considered portraying Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 leader without evidence and sought to nullify the order preventing his deportation. A Justice Department lawyer, Erez Reuveni, who advocated for Abrego Garcia's return, was fired.

          <p>The UK government's plan to finalize a deal handing over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been temporarily blocked by a High Court injunction. Two Chagossian women brought the case, arguing against the Foreign Office's handling of the matter. The agreement would allow the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years, with British taxpayers expected to pay billions to Mauritius.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other experts are questioning the effectiveness of U.S. semiconductor export controls on China, arguing that they may be causing more harm to American businesses than to China's technological advancement. Huang noted that Nvidia's GPU market share in China has significantly decreased due to the restrictions. Experts suggest that the curbs incentivize China to become self-sufficient in semiconductor technology, accelerating domestic innovation and potentially closing the gap between Chinese and U.S. AI capabilities. The restrictions have also led to a $5.5 billion charge against Nvidia's revenue, prompting concerns about the long-term impact on U.S. competitiveness.</p>

Experts predict that taxes will likely need to rise in the autumn to meet the government's economic rules.

          <p>The reconstructed roof of a 14th-century Drum Tower in Fengyang County, China, partially collapsed, prompting an investigation into the quality of its modern renovations. Videos showed tiles falling off the roof, which was rebuilt in 1995 after the original was destroyed in the 19th century. Concerns have been raised about the recent renovation, costing nearly $420,000, and whether public funds were misused. CCTV reported that the entire recreated building was illegally constructed in the 1990s without proper approval, adding to the scrutiny of historical site renovations in China.</p>

          <p>Violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, could be released after serving just a third of their sentence under new recommendations aimed at easing prison overcrowding in the UK. The Independent Sentencing Review also suggests managing more offenders in the community and expanding a chemical castration pilot for sex offenders. The government is considering these measures alongside building new prisons, but the review warns against relying solely on construction to solve the crisis. These proposals have sparked controversy, with concerns raised about victim safety and the strain on the probation service.</p>

Kneecap denies the offence and calls it political policing.

          <p>China has urged the European Union to provide a “fair” playing field for businesses after Brussels proposed a handling fee on every small parcel that enters the bloc, most of which come from the country’s rapidly expanding e-commerce firms. The European Commission is proposing a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas. For parcels sent to a European warehouse to be stored, the fee would be only 50 cents per parcel. The fee would add around 3 billion euros of income to Brussels’ budget.</p>

From 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to approximately 15,000 deaths and $160 billion in costs related to exposure to fine particulate matter from wildfires. The study highlights the increasing frequency of wildfire smoke events and their impact on mortality, particularly in states like Oregon and California.
