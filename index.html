          <p>President Trump declared on social media that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire after escalating air assaults between the two countries. The agreement, according to Trump, involved two 12-hour ceasefire periods, starting with Iran, followed by Israel, with the war officially ending after 24 hours. However, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, later denied the existence of a ceasefire agreement but stated that if Israel halted strikes by a specific time, Iran would cease its response. The announcement followed U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, escalating the conflict that began when Israel launched strikes against Iran's nuclear program, citing intelligence of Iran's nuclear weapon advancements. The article notes that this all occurred after Iran fired missiles targeting a U.S. military base in Qatar, which were intercepted. </p>

There were no reported casualties at the base, as Qatar's air defenses intercepted the Iranian missiles. The U.S. strikes were in response to what the U.S. claimed was a significant advancement by Iran toward obtaining a nuclear weapon. Simultaneously, President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, after more than a week of aerial attacks following Israel's initial strike on Iran's nuclear program. </p>

          <p>This article explores the enduring mystery of D.B. Cooper, who hijacked a Northwest Orient flight in 1971, demanding $200,000 and four parachutes before jumping from the plane and vanishing. Despite extensive investigations, neither Cooper nor the ransom money has ever been definitively found, fueling numerous theories about his identity and fate. The article delves into the perspectives of Cooper enthusiasts, including authors and podcasters, who have become captivated by the unsolved case. The article also touches on the cultural impact of the Cooper legend, including a Manhattan bar dedicated to the hijacking, and the ethical considerations surrounding the glorification of a criminal act. </p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, named ‚ÄúMeteor-1,‚Äù which could accelerate AI and data centers. The chip achieves a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, comparable to Nvidia‚Äôs advanced GPUs. This development comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and U.S. export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips. Optical computing's advantages, such as high speed, broad bandwidth, and low power consumption, position it as a critical future direction. </p>

          <p>Oil prices declined after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, raising hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent fell nearly 3%, returning to levels below those before Israel attacked Iran. The market sell-off indicates investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, with some suggesting a "peace through strength strategy." President Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, enabling the prevention of any loss of life, and called for peace. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's dominance in rare earth production is significantly strengthened by supplies from Myanmar, which accounted for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. Myanmar's rare earth exports to China have significantly increased since 2018, peaking in 2023, and are particularly high in heavy rare earth elements. This reliance on Myanmar has opened China to supply chain risks, especially due to the ongoing civil war in Myanmar, where armed groups have seized key rare earth production sites. Disruptions in supply from Myanmar have caused price spikes in some heavy rare earths, highlighting the vulnerability of China's supply chain. </p>

Billionaire Elon Musk advocated for these states after a Delaware judge struck down his compensation package from Tesla, leading Tesla and SpaceX to relocate to Texas, and Neuralink to Nevada.

          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. The MPs are concerned about the plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments to save ¬£5 billion a year by 2030. The amendment cites concerns about pushing people into poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment on the job market and health. If the amendment is selected and supported by a majority of MPs, it could halt the bill's progress through Parliament. </p>

          <p>Florida has begun constructing a detention center, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' to temporarily house migrants on an air strip in the Everglades. The facility, funded in large part by FEMA, aims to support mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens. The location is intended to deter escapees due to the surrounding alligator and python-infested environment. Critics, including the mayor of Miami-Dade County, have raised concerns about the potential environmental impact on the Everglades ecosystem. </p>
