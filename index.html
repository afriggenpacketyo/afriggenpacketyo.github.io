          <h2>Bitcoin Plummets Amidst Global Market Turmoil Triggered by Trump's Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $77,000, as cryptocurrencies mirrored the instability in global markets following President Trump's implementation of restrictive global tariffs. The decline was part of a broader market downturn, with US equities suffering their worst losses since 2020, and the tariffs triggered fears of a global trade war and potential recession. Bitcoin's price movement triggered substantial liquidations as investors, anticipating further market declines, sold off cryptocurrency holdings, and despite this downturn, some analysts suggest Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against the risks associated with fiat currencies amidst increasing US isolationism.

          <p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, publicly addressed President Trump's newly announced tariff policy, predicting it would lead to inflationary pressures and hinder an already weakening U.S. economy. In his annual shareholder letter, Dimon highlighted the uncertainties and potential negative impacts of the tariffs on global capital flows, corporate profits, and international relations. He cautioned that these effects would compound over time and become difficult to reverse, and Dimon's comments marked the first public response from a major Wall Street bank CEO to Trump's tariff policies amid global market instability.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields experienced a significant drop as investors priced in expectations of more aggressive rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in response to potential economic fallout from President Trump's tariffs. The 2-year Treasury yield hit its lowest level since September 2022, reflecting growing fears of an economic slowdown triggered by the tariffs. Traders are now anticipating at least five rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2025, as Trump's tariffs have sparked concerns of a global trade war and retaliatory measures from major trading partners, and despite market reactions, Trump continues to downplay the tariffs' impact.

          <p>Despite a widespread market downturn triggered by President Trump's tariffs, defense stocks have shown relative strength, partially offsetting earlier losses. The surge in defense spending in Europe, spurred by pressure from Trump for allies to increase their own security investments, is contributing to the sector's stability. Analysts suggest that the tariff impact on European defense stocks is likely to be limited, presenting a potential investment opportunity, and with defense budgets poised to rise significantly, the defense sector is expected to experience sustained growth.

          <h2>Memoir Sparks Debate on Repressed Memories Amidst Growing Pseudoscience Concerns</h2>

          <p>Amy Griffin's memoir, "The Tell," has ignited a debate about the validity of repressed memories, a concept largely dismissed by scientific research. The memoir details Griffin's recovery of traumatic memories of sexual abuse through psychedelic MDMA therapy, raising questions about the reliability of such memories and the use of potentially dicey treatments. While the memoir has received praise and attention, it arrives at a time when pseudoscience and debunked medical techniques are making a resurgence, and the scientific community emphasizes the importance of relying on cognitive psychology and quantitative data rather than individual case studies. </p>

The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported that several Palestinians had been killed by Israel, and a Palestinian journalist was killed in an air strike, raising concerns about the safety of media personnel in the conflict zone. </p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a surge in measles cases, reaching the highest number in a single year since 2019, with the majority of infections stemming from an outbreak in West Texas. The outbreak has led to the deaths of two children, and cases have been reported in 21 states, prompting public health officials to emphasize the importance of vaccination. The CDC reports that vaccination rates have declined, and health experts point to this as a contributing factor to the increase in preventable diseases like measles. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has voiced support for the measles vaccine amid the outbreak. </p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry in the face of trade tariffs imposed by the US. While the ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars will still take effect in 2030, manufacturers will have greater flexibility on annual targets and face reduced fines. The changes aim to mitigate the impact of US tariffs on UK car exports, and the government has also confirmed a ban on the sale of hybrid vehicles from 2035, while smaller British firms will be allowed to sell petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline. </p>

The revocations occurred during a routine records review, and Harvard has referred the students to legal assistance.

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has announced that no criminal charges will be filed against a police officer whose van followed two teenagers before they died in an e-bike crash in Cardiff. The CPS cited insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, and the deaths of the teenagers sparked a riot in the city's Ely suburb. CCTV footage revealed that police were following the boys minutes before the crash, and the police force referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).

          <p>The artist behind a portrait of President Trump that he publicly criticized has defended her work, stating that his remarks have threatened her livelihood. Sarah Boardman painted the portrait for the Colorado state Capitol, and Trump claimed it was "purposefully distorted." The portrait was subsequently removed by state Republicans, and Boardman responded by asserting that Trump's comments have negatively impacted her business, which has been operating for over 41 years. Trump's criticism echoes past presidents who have disliked their portraits, and the situation raises questions about artistic expression and political influence. </p>

          <p>A coal-fired power plant in Ibbenburen, Germany, was successfully demolished in a controlled explosion, marking a step in Germany's transition away from fossil fuels. The demolition included the 100-meter-high boiler house and the 125-meter-high cooling tower, and the plant was shut down in 2021 as part of Germany's nationwide energy transition. The site will soon host a converter station for wind power from the North Sea, highlighting the shift towards renewable energy sources. The successful demolition symbolizes progress in Germany's efforts to reduce its reliance on coal. </p>

          <p>Beijing has rallied U.S. firms, including Tesla and GE Healthcare, urging them to attribute "tariff tensions" to Washington. Following retaliatory measures against the latest U.S. tariffs, Beijing implored the multinationals to “deliver voices of reason” and “address root causes.” This round-table chat was the latest high-profile assembly between authorities and business leaders, both domestic and international, as China looks to shore up economic growth and ease investor nerves. China’s vice-minister of commerce, Ling Ji, chaired the meeting, emphasizing that tariff tensions originate from Washington and encouraging U.S. businesses to advocate for stable global supply chains. </p>
