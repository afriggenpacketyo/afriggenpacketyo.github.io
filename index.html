          <p>Amazon is continuing its multi-year cost-cutting initiative by eliminating some jobs within its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing division. The company confirmed the layoffs, impacting teams such as training and certification, but did not disclose the total number of affected employees. These cuts are part of CEO Andy Jassy's broader strategy to streamline operations and are not primarily driven by AI investments, although Jassy has indicated AI could further reduce the corporate workforce in the future. Amazon stated it is still hiring for other roles within AWS despite the reductions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's rare earth exports to China tripled, highlighting a significant shift in global supply chains influenced by U.S.-China trade tensions. According to a report by the China-Brazil Business Council, this increase is seen as part of China's strategy to diversify its access to critical minerals. While Brazil's overall exports to China decreased, its imports from China rose, narrowing its trade surplus to its lowest point since 2019. Analysts suggest that as major economies erect trade barriers, emerging markets like Brazil are absorbing the impact and adjusting their trade relationships accordingly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bryan Braman, a former NFL linebacker who won Super Bowl LII with the Philadelphia Eagles, has died at the age of 38 following a battle with a rare and aggressive form of cancer. His passing was confirmed by his agent and mourned by his former teams, the Eagles and the Houston Texans, as well as teammates like JJ Watt and Lane Johnson. Braman, known for his prowess on special teams, was part of a concerning trend of increasing cancer diagnoses in people under 50.

          <p>The White House has stated that President Trump would not recommend the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the Jeffrey Epstein case. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the president's position, which comes amid criticism from some of his own supporters over the Justice Department's handling of the case files. Trump has dismissed the controversy as a "hoax" and criticized Republicans calling for more transparency. The statement follows a DOJ memo which concluded there was no evidence of an Epstein "client list" and that his death was a suicide, fueling frustration among some right-wing figures.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and state Democrats are threatening to redraw the state's congressional maps in a controversial move to counter a Republican plan to gain seats in Texas. This response comes as Texas Republicans, at Donald Trump's urging, aim to gerrymander their districts to add more GOP seats. California Democrats believe they could pick up five to seven seats, but the plan faces significant legal and procedural hurdles, as the state's district-drawing power was given to an independent commission by voters over a decade ago. The proposal has drawn criticism for potentially undermining the very democratic principles Democrats claim to be defending.</p>

In response to these positive trends and a weaker U.S. dollar, Netflix raised its full-year revenue forecast. However, the company's stock saw a slight dip in after-hours trading due to a warning that operating margins would be lower in the second half of the year because of higher content and marketing costs.

          <p>Columbia University's new initiatives to combat anti-Semitism on campus are mirroring the bureaucratic structure of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, an approach this article suggests is ironic and potentially ineffective. The university is appointing Title VI coordinators and adopting the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, measures similar to those used to address other forms of discrimination. This strategy is being implemented under pressure from the Trump administration, which is simultaneously working to dismantle DEI programs elsewhere. Critics argue that these new bureaucratic layers may not solve the problem and could repeat the perceived overreach and speech-policing issues associated with some DEI efforts.</p>

The vote proceeded along party lines, with all Democratic members walking out in protest and not casting votes. Bove's nomination is highly controversial due to his defense of Trump and allegations from a DOJ whistleblower that he encouraged government lawyers to disobey court orders, a claim he denies. Despite opposition from hundreds of former DOJ lawyers and retired judges, the nomination now moves to the full Senate for a final confirmation vote.</p>

After an inconsistent rookie season, Yamamoto delivered a crucial, five-scoreless-inning performance in a decisive Game 5 against the San Diego Padres, a moment he calls the most nervous of his career. That experience, combined with a better understanding of the league and a stronger offseason preparation, has made him the most dependable pitcher in the Dodgers' rotation.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has overturned the 2017 fraud conviction of former HSBC trader Mark Johnson, resulting in a full acquittal after a nine-year legal battle. Johnson was convicted and jailed for allegedly manipulating foreign exchange rates in a practice known as 'front-running' before a large client trade. His defense, supported by an industry association, successfully argued that his actions constituted 'pre-hedging,' a standard industry practice for managing a bank's risk, and were not illegal. The case was notable as it followed a congressional report criticizing the government for not prosecuting HSBC executives in other major scandals.</p>

          <h2>A Historical Look at Air Travel Reveals It Was Never Truly a Golden Age</h2>

          <p>This article challenges the popular nostalgia for a "golden age" of air travel, arguing that the experience has always been fraught with difficulties. While early aviation was a marvel, it was also dangerous and uncomfortable, with unpressurized cabins and deafening engines. The supposedly glamorous mid-century era was more expensive, more hazardous, and segregated. The piece suggests that as air travel became more accessible through deregulation, it inevitably became more crowded and mundane, a process accelerated by post-9/11 security measures and cost-cutting by airlines. Ultimately, the "million tiny indignities" of modern flying are part of the natural evolution of a miracle technology becoming an everyday utility.</p>

          <p>Uber is advancing its autonomous vehicle ambitions through a new six-year partnership with electric vehicle maker Lucid and self-driving startup Nuro. The deal involves deploying over 20,000 robotaxis, with Uber investing $300 million in Lucid, whose stock surged 36% on the news. Nuro will provide its Level 4 autonomous driving system for Lucid's vehicles, which will be purpose-built for the Uber platform. The companies plan to launch the driverless service in a major U.S. city next year, creating a new market for Lucid and scaling up Uber's autonomous ride-hailing offerings.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has recommended a prison sentence of just one day for Brett Hankison, the former Kentucky police officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. Hankison was the only officer convicted in connection with the incident, facing a maximum sentence of life in prison for using excessive force. Prosecutors argued that since he did not fire the fatal shots and will never work in law enforcement again, additional prison time would be "unjust." Attorneys for Taylor's family condemned the recommendation as an "insult" and a message of impunity for police misconduct.</p>

          <p>NBCUniversal is raising the subscription price for its Peacock streaming service, with most plans increasing by $3 per month starting in July. The ad-supported Peacock Premium tier will now cost $10.99 monthly, while the ad-free Premium Plus option will rise to $16.99. This move follows similar price hikes by competitors like Netflix and comes as media companies grapple with the high costs of programming and the transition away from traditional cable models. Despite billions invested, Peacock has struggled to compete with larger rivals, and the price increase aims to improve its financial standing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A math and philosophy professor from California State University Channel Islands, John Caravello, was arrested and charged with assaulting a federal officer during a protest against an ICE raid at a cannabis farm. The raid, which resulted in the death of one worker and the arrest of hundreds, was met with a crowd of demonstrators. Colleagues and witnesses claim Caravello was peacefully protesting and assisting another demonstrator in a wheelchair when he was arrested. They allege that federal agents used teargas and rubber bullets unnecessarily against the crowd. Caravello, an immigrant advocate, has been released on bond.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to introduce legislation that would lower the voting age for all UK elections from 18 to 16. The proposal is part of a broader package of democratic reforms by the new Labour government, which campaigned on the issue. If passed, the change would enfranchise approximately 1.6 million teenagers. While advocates argue that 16-year-olds who can work and pay taxes should have a say in government, critics question their maturity and political knowledge. The article notes that while a few countries and some U.S. cities have a lower voting age, such a move at the national level in the U.S. seems unlikely.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed the GENIUS Act, the first major cryptocurrency legislation in U.S. history, after a dramatic floor rebellion by a dozen right-wing Republicans nearly derailed it. The holdouts initially sank a procedural vote, demanding changes and a meeting with President Trump before ultimately agreeing to allow the bill to advance. The legislation, which regulates stablecoins, passed with significant bipartisan support and now heads to the president's desk. The tense, nearly 10-hour standoff highlighted deep divisions within the GOP and required a last-minute deal to secure passage, capping off a tumultuous "crypto week" in Congress.

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition, after he experienced mild swelling in his legs. A memo from the president's physician, read by the press secretary, stated that a comprehensive exam including ultrasounds ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The condition occurs when leg veins struggle to return blood to the heart and is common in people over 70. The White House also attributed recent bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use, concluding that the 79-year-old president remains in "excellent" overall health.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives have settled a multi-billion dollar lawsuit brought by shareholders concerning the company's handling of user privacy violations, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The shareholders had sought $8 billion in damages, alleging that executives' failures led to massive fines and legal costs for the company. The settlement was announced in a Delaware court just as the trial was beginning, preventing Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg from having to testify under oath. The exact financial terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but it resolves the long-running legal dispute that began in 2018.</p>
