          <p>Former President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska, for a high-stakes summit aimed at negotiating a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. Despite Trump describing the talks as having made "great progress," the meeting concluded without a formal agreement to halt the conflict. The summit, which lasted over two and a half hours, did not include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump stated he would call to provide an update on the discussions. Both leaders made brief statements to the press but did not take any questions from reporters, leaving the future of negotiations uncertain.</p>

          <p>A suspect has been arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of a 25-year-old tourist from New York in Puerto Rico. The victim, Kevin Mares, was visiting the island to attend a Bad Bunny concert and was an innocent bystander struck by a stray bullet during an argument at a nightspot in the La Perla community. The 37-year-old suspect, who has a prior criminal record, turned himself in to police and is being held on an $800,000 bond. The incident has once again raised concerns about tourist safety in the well-known but historically volatile area.</p>

New signing Hugo Ekitike made an immediate impact, scoring one goal and assisting another, showcasing his potential as a key offensive player for the team. Despite Liverpool's early lead, Bournemouth managed to equalize with a goal from Antoine Semenyo, creating a tense atmosphere. Late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah ultimately secured the victory for the reigning champions in a chaotic and emotional match.</p>

          <p>San José has announced the completion of California's first-ever accessory dwelling unit (ADU) condominium, which can be sold separately from the main house on the property. This development follows a city law passed last year to enable such sales, aiming to create a new, more affordable path to homeownership. Officials hope this ADU, located near the city's downtown, will serve as a model for other California cities struggling with housing affordability. Amid a statewide housing crisis, ADUs have become increasingly popular, accounting for a significant portion of new housing growth in California.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's opening Premier League match against Bournemouth was marked by emotional tributes to forward Diogo Jota, who tragically died in a car crash in July. With Jota's family in attendance, fans at Anfield displayed a mosaic with his initials and shirt number, sang his song, and held a minute of silence before the game. The players wore black armbands, and the club will feature a "Forever 20" emblem on their shirts for the season in his honor. Teammates Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah both dedicated their late goals to Jota, underscoring the profound impact of his loss on the club and its supporters.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed against the AI transcription service Otter.ai, accusing the company of secretly recording private conversations without the consent of all participants. The suit alleges that Otter's popular tool, which transcribes virtual meetings on platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams, fails to properly notify or seek permission from every attendee before recording. These recordings are then allegedly used to train its AI systems for financial gain, violating federal and state privacy laws. The legal action highlights growing privacy concerns as AI tools become more integrated into workplace environments.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the dusty, exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the lakebed is the primary cause of the region's severe air quality issues and high asthma rates. Researchers suggest that since pollution comes from numerous sources like agriculture and diesel exhaust, public health efforts might be more effective if focused on exposure control, such as improving indoor air filtration in homes and schools, rather than solely on dust suppression projects.</p>

The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., said the choice was a creative twist intended to honor Bryant's 'Mamba mentality' while fitting the mural's theme.

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is showing strong signs of revival after a prolonged quiet period caused by inflation and economic uncertainty. Recent successful debuts from companies like Figma, Circle, and Bullish, which saw their share prices soar on the first day of trading, have fueled optimism among investors and venture capitalists. This renewed confidence is expected to encourage more high-valued startups to go public in the latter half of the year. However, some analysts caution that the exuberant first-day gains may be unsustainable and recall the market overheating seen during the dot-com era. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok featuring works by exiled artists from authoritarian countries was censored after complaints from the Chinese government. The show's curator, a Burmese artist named Sai, alleges that Chinese embassy officials demanded the removal of works by Tibetan, Uyghur, and Hong Kong artists. Fearing for their safety, Sai and his wife fled Thailand and are seeking asylum in the UK. The Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre partially complied by covering artists' names and references to their homelands, reportedly due to pressure transmitted through Thai officials, raising concerns about transnational repression and artistic freedom.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting a new electric pickup truck with a strategy focused on affordability and customization. The company plans to sell a simple, barebones vehicle and allow owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, but the value proposition is now being tested as those incentives are set to expire. The key challenge for Slate will be to remain competitive against other vehicles under $30,000, like the Ford Maverick, which offer more standard features. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to scale back the federal takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Following a lawsuit filed by the city calling the move a "hostile takeover," the deal ensures that the local police chief, Pamela Smith, will remain in command, rather than a federally appointed administrator. However, the agreement still permits the Trump administration to utilize MPD officers for federal purposes during emergencies. This development came after a federal judge signaled she was prepared to issue a restraining order against the administration's original plan.</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's move to federalize Washington D.C.'s police force, key Democratic lawmakers have introduced a joint resolution to terminate the action. Citing the D.C. Home Rule Act, the resolution argues that the President has not demonstrated the "special conditions of an emergency" required to legally assume control of the Metropolitan Police Department. The lawmakers, including Representative Jamie Raskin and Senator Chris Van Hollen, describe the takeover as a "lawless" attack on the city's self-governance. This legislative effort represents a formal congressional challenge to the President's controversial executive order.</p>

The lawsuits argue that "Roblox" prioritizes profit over user safety and misrepresents its platform as a safe environment for kids. In response, "Roblox" stated it has implemented rigorous safeguards and is using AI to detect child endangerment, while also testing new age-verification methods to improve safety.</p>
