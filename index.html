          <p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte affirmed the U.S.'s commitment to NATO, emphasizing President Trump's support while highlighting the expectation for European and Canadian allies to increase defense spending. Rutte urged allies to focus on defense investment plans, industrial base development, and support for Ukraine, rather than worrying about the U.S.'s commitment. NATO members have pledged to spend 2% of their GDP on defense since 2014, with some exceeding this target while others struggle to meet it, leading to tensions over burden-sharing. The summit in The Hague will address these spending disparities and reaffirm the alliance's commitment to collective security amidst ongoing global conflicts. The importance of Trump's presence, despite his skepticism towards NATO, underscores the alliance's strength and ambition. </p>

          <p>House Democrats are convening to elect a new ranking member of the House Oversight Committee following the death of Rep. Gerry Connolly. Four Democrats, Reps. Stephen Lynch, Kweisi Mfume, Robert Garcia, and Jasmine Crockett, are vying for the position, which would potentially lead to the committee's chairmanship if Democrats regain control of the House in 2026. The selection process highlights ongoing tensions within the party regarding a potential generational shift in leadership roles. Connolly's death occurred shortly after he announced his decision not to seek reelection in 2026 due to his cancer returning, and his successor will play a key role in shaping the committee's agenda and priorities. The new ranking member will be instrumental in challenging the Republican trifecta in Washington.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated his displeasure with both Israel and Iran after reported exchanges marred the initial hours of a ceasefire he brokered. Trump claimed Israel launched a significant bombing campaign immediately after the deal was made, while also criticizing Iran for allegedly firing missiles towards Israel after the ceasefire came into effect. Despite the violations, Trump maintained his belief that Iran is still committed to peace. The president expressed frustration with the ongoing conflict between the two countries, suggesting they are acting without clear direction. The situation remains tense as both sides navigate the fragile ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Washington state are considering the possibility that Travis Decker, the father accused of murdering his three daughters, may no longer be alive. Decker is wanted for the deaths of his daughters, whose bodies were discovered near his abandoned vehicle in a remote campground. The Kittitas County Sheriffâ€™s Office stated that there is no certain evidence Decker remains alive or in the search area, despite an extensive search effort. A cadaver dog is being deployed to aid in the search, and resources are being redirected to potentially recover Decker's remains.

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court order preventing the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without providing them the opportunity to raise fears of torture, persecution, or death. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, with Sotomayor accusing the government of "flagrantly unlawful conduct" and undermining due process. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety and security, stating it can now remove illegal aliens to willing countries. The decision allows the administration to proceed with its efforts to deport migrants to countries like Costa Rica, Panama, and Rwanda, and comes amidst ongoing legal challenges and concerns over migrants' rights.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, secured a trainee accountant position after submitting 646 job applications over 18 months. Morgan's persistence paid off despite facing numerous rejections and feeling demotivated during her extensive job search. She believes that artificial intelligence (AI) used in applicant tracking systems (ATS) initially hindered her progress until she adjusted her CV to be more ATS-friendly. Recent data indicates that competition for graduate roles is at a record high, with an average of 140 applications per job in 2024, and even higher for finance roles. Morgan's experience underscores the challenges faced by recent graduates in a competitive job market.</p>

          <p>Marina Hyde argues that world leaders should cease trying to decipher President Trump's behavior, comparing it to futile attempts to understand inscrutable men. She suggests that Trump's actions are primarily driven by a desire for attention and control, rather than any complex strategy. Hyde criticizes the tendency to overanalyze Trump's motives, urging politicians and analysts to recognize that he is simply not invested in reciprocal relationships. The commentary draws parallels to self-help books that encourage women to interpret men's behavior, ultimately concluding that Trump's actions are straightforward and self-serving.</p>

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte urged European colleagues to focus on defense investments and supporting Ukraine, assuring them of the U.S.'s commitment to the alliance.

          <p>Following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites, North Korea condemned the actions and is closely observing the situation to assess its own defense strategies. Experts suggest that Pyongyang will likely accelerate its nuclear weapons capabilities and fortify storage areas in response to the U.S. strikes. North Korea's alliance with Russia and its advanced nuclear program differentiate its situation from Iran's. Kim Jong Un is expected to prioritize his personal safety and regime survival, potentially seeking increased support from Russia.

          <p>The Supreme Court's decision to allow the Trump administration to resume deportations to third countries without advance warning has been met with praise from a Trump administration official. Assistant Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin tweeted, "Fire up the deportation planes," calling the ruling a victory for American safety and security. The Supreme Court's three liberal justices dissented from the order, with Justice Sotomayor criticizing the decision as an abuse of the Court's equitable discretion. The ruling allows the administration to proceed with its efforts to deport certain immigrants more quickly.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that people often underestimate how willing others are to help, stemming from inaccurate assumptions about how the helper will feel. Studies have found that people who need help tend to predict others will be less likely to say yes than they actually are, and they overestimate the inconvenience to the helper. American culture's emphasis on self-reliance can make asking for help especially difficult, but seeking assistance can strengthen relationships and provide opportunities for loved ones to feel good. Important events, such as weddings, often remove some of the obstacles to giving and receiving help.</p>

Strategies for securing good CD rates include exploring online banks, which often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. Short-term CDs, ranging from six months to one year, currently provide higher interest rates than longer-term options due to the inverted yield curve. (not investment advice)</p>
