        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article features a conversation with sociologist Alice Evans about the global decline in fertility rates and the challenges people face in forming relationships. Evans argues that technology, particularly smartphones and online entertainment, contributes to a "coupling crisis" by outcompeting personal interactions. She suggests that the constant dopamine hits from apps distract people from building social skills and forming meaningful connections. The discussion also covers economic factors, gender dynamics, and potential solutions like regulating technology and promoting community engagement, ultimately emphasizing the need to address the underlying causes of declining birthrates and the rise of solitude.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields." The State Department is also revising visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. This move has sparked anxiety across US university campuses, which rely on international students for research and revenue, and could lead to retaliation from China. Additionally, the State Department will deny visas to foreign officials who engage in censorship of American citizens' speech, highlighting concerns over free speech on social media platforms. </p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced another setback with its third consecutive test flight ending in failure, despite achieving its greatest progress to date. The unmanned spacecraft began spinning out of control shortly after separating from its Super Heavy booster, leading to a "rapid unscheduled disassembly." While the company touts a "fail fast, learn fast" approach, repeated costly failures raise concerns about long-term reliability and safety, especially given the program's high costs and ambitions to send humans to Mars. The article explores whether SpaceX has been overly ambitious and what the implications are for NASA's Artemis program, which relies on Starship for lunar missions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's strategy of praising Vladimir Putin to foster peace in Ukraine is facing increasing skepticism as the conflict continues. Despite Trump's claims of a strong relationship with the Russian leader, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukrainian civilian targets. This has prompted even Trump to question whether he's being misled, while foreign policy experts and members of Congress urge him to adopt a tougher stance. The article examines whether Trump will impose new sanctions or continue to pursue negotiations, as pressure mounts for a more decisive approach to address Russia's aggression.</p>

          <p>A federal judge denied Shira Perlmutter's emergency request for reinstatement as head of the U.S. Copyright Office after she was fired by President Trump. Perlmutter argued that Trump lacked the authority to fire her, as the position falls under the Library of Congress, but the judge ruled she failed to demonstrate irreparable harm. The lawsuit is ongoing, with Perlmutter claiming only the Librarian of Congress can hire or fire the head of the Copyright Office. The case raises questions about presidential authority over legislative branch appointments and the influence of tech companies on copyright policy.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump should leverage his position to push Russia and Ukraine toward a cease-fire agreement. While acknowledging the disarray and unfairness of Trump's approach to the war, the board recognizes his valid points about the tragedy of continued carnage and the potential for economic development. The editorial stresses that an American withdrawal would embolden Putin, and Ukraine would not surrender, but instead Trump should increase pressure on both sides to negotiate, using the threat of further sanctions and support for Ukraine to achieve a settlement. Ultimately, the board advocates for a resolution that ends the gruesome war and allows Ukraine to thrive.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade blocked reciprocal tariffs unilaterally imposed by President Trump on scores of countries, deeming them unauthorized under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). This ruling deals a blow to Trump's economic agenda and efforts to negotiate trade deals. The court's decision was appealed, potentially leading to a Supreme Court review. The panel ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs and barred future modifications, while a White House spokesperson defended the tariffs as a response to foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment and a national emergency.</p>

          <p>America's trading partners reacted cautiously to a U.S. federal court blocking President Trump's across-the-board tariffs, as the Trump administration has already filed plans to appeal the decision. While stocks rose internationally, economists pointed out that Mr. Trump could turn to other legal routes to enact across-the-board tariffs. The court's decision does nothing to roll back sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum and on cars or to forestall future tariffs on pharmaceuticals, and that could leave the United States and trading partners in Europe and elsewhere negotiating intensively on those economically important sectors in coming weeks.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump are arranging to hold telephone talks later Thursday, Japanese government sources said. The move comes as Japan and the United States are arranging a fourth round of talks over Trump's tariffs in Washington on Friday, with Japan's top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, known as a close aide to Ishiba, expected to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the point man for the negotiations. In their previous telephone talks just a week ago, Ishiba and Trump agreed that they would explore a face-to-face meeting on the occasion of the Group of Seven leaders' summit to be held in mid-June in Canada.</p>

          <p>Scientists are on an urgent mission to save lives in southern Appalachia, where extreme flooding events are becoming increasingly common. Amid accelerating climate breakdown the urgency of the mission is clear. In response, geologists from the University of Kentucky secured a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and raced around collecting perishable data in hope of better understanding the worst flooding event to hit the region in a generation. The article explores the challenges faced by communities in the region and the potential impact of Trump administration policies on scientific research and weather forecasting.</p>
