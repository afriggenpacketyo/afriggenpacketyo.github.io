          <p>Former President Donald Trump visited the Federal Reserve headquarters, escalating his public campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump framed the visit as an inspection of a costly renovation project but used it to pressure Powell into lowering interest rates. The former president has repeatedly criticized Powell for keeping rates steady, arguing that cuts would significantly reduce the nation's massive debt interest payments. This unprecedented meeting highlights the ongoing tension between the executive branch and the traditionally independent central bank, with Trump having previously suggested he could fire Powell.

          <p>A 24-year-old Massachusetts man has been arrested for allegedly stealing over $113,000 worth of rare Pokémon cards and collectibles from a shop in a rapid smash-and-grab theft. The suspect was apprehended after he reportedly attempted to sell a rare booster box, valued at $30,000, that matched an item stolen during the burglary. A subsequent tip and police investigation led to his arrest and the recovery of a shoebox containing numerous other high-value, graded Pokémon cards. The collectible shop owner expressed gratitude to the police and the local community for their support in resolving the case.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla sold 75% of its Bitcoin holdings in mid-2022, a move that cost the company billions in potential profits. The sale occurred when the cryptocurrency market was at a low point, and Bitcoin has since rebounded to near-record highs. Had Tesla retained its full investment, its holdings would be worth approximately $5 billion today, instead of the current $1.24 billion. While the company's focus has shifted away from crypto, this financial misstep highlights a significant lost opportunity for cash reserves at a time when its core auto business faces market challenges.

          <p>The parents of a 22-year-old man in San Jose, California, are seeking justice after their son was fatally stabbed while intervening in an attack on his friend. The victim, Raymond Orozco, was with friends in a downtown entertainment district when he stepped in to protect one of the women in his group. Police believe the incident may have been recorded on cellphone video by bystanders and are urging anyone with information to come forward, as the suspect fled the scene and remains at large. Orozco's parents described him as a caring individual who worked in a group home and aspired to become a first responder.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former Canadian world junior ice hockey players of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge, Justice Maria Carroccia, ruled that the prosecution had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, citing inconsistencies and unreliability in the complainant's testimony. The central issue of the high-profile trial was whether the woman had consented to the sexual acts with the players. The defense argued the players believed she had consented, pointing to video evidence where she appeared to do so, though the judge noted this did not legally establish consent.</p>

Council leader Chris Whitbread expressed concern that the protests are being infiltrated by political extremists, turning Epping into a battleground for outside agendas. The council maintains that the hotel has always been an inappropriate location for vulnerable people due to a lack of necessary support facilities in the area.</p>

While the agreement may force the university to address long-standing issues of anti-Jewish bias, critics argue it sets a dangerous precedent for government intervention in academic affairs.

AI-detection tools indicate the cartoon image was likely generated by artificial intelligence or otherwise digitally manipulated.

Today, facial hair has become commonplace again, adopted by politicians seeking a more relatable image and young men embracing retro styles.

While the 900-pound animal has not shown aggression, the trail remains closed for public safety.

          <p>Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, announced Thursday that he will not run for a third term in 2026, setting up the first open gubernatorial race in the battleground state in 16 years. Evers, 73, stated that after five decades in public service, it was time to focus on his family. His tenure has been marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively to block conservative priorities. His departure opens a competitive race for both parties as Democrats also aim to gain control of the legislature under newly redrawn, more favorable electoral maps.</p>

          <p>In a memo to employees, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged that the company's recent job eliminations have been "weighing heavily" on him. The tech giant has laid off over 15,000 people in 2025, sparking disheartenment among some staff even as the company's stock price soars. Nadella described the situation as an "enigma of success" in a demanding industry, stating that progress isn't always linear. He also used the memo to outline a reimagined mission for the company in the age of AI, shifting from a software factory to an intelligence engine that empowers users to create their own tools.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has extended a temporary pause on a lower court ruling that threatens to weaken the Voting Rights Act. The ruling from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals argued that private individuals and groups cannot sue under Section 2 of the act, a departure from decades of legal precedent that would leave enforcement solely to the Justice Department. The case originated from a lawsuit by two tribal nations in North Dakota over a redistricting plan. Voting rights advocates fear that if the Supreme Court takes up a full review, its conservative majority could issue a decision further eroding the landmark civil rights law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that a core, intractable problem in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is that significant portions of both populations harbor maximalist goals of controlling all the land and having the other side disappear. While practicality and international pressure have historically constrained these ambitions, the article suggests the Trump administration's policies have reinforced them. The author contends that former President Trump's proposal to turn Gaza into a "Riviera" was interpreted by the Israeli far-right as a green light for ethnic cleansing, prolonging the conflict. For any lasting peace, the U.S. must disavow such ideas and re-establish the reality that neither side is going anywhere.</p>

          <p>Despite record-breaking visitor numbers, U.S. National Parks like Glacier are operating with significantly reduced permanent staff due to Trump administration budget cuts and a hiring freeze. While the public-facing experience may seem normal due to the presence of seasonal rangers, watchdog groups warn of a crisis behind the scenes. Key back-office positions remain unfilled, stalling everything from infrastructure projects to wildlife studies and future hiring. Experts worry that this hollowing out of the National Park Service will lead to a degraded visitor experience and irreparable harm to the parks if the trend is not reversed soon.</p>

          <p>On the eve of a five-day strike by resident doctors in England, UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting sent a letter expressing deep regret for the situation. He accused the British Medical Association (BMA) of not engaging in negotiations in good faith, stating the government could not afford a larger pay raise but was open to negotiating on working conditions. The BMA, which is seeking to restore pay to 2008 real-term levels, said the walkouts are a necessary last resort. The strike is expected to cause significant disruption, though NHS England aims to continue with most non-urgent care.</p>

          <p>England has taken a commanding position in the fourth Test against India, thanks to a five-wicket haul from Ben Stokes and a blistering opening batting partnership.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick asserted that CEOs of major U.S. auto companies are "cool with" the Trump administration's new trade deal with Japan. This is despite the fact that the deal could impose a lower tariff on cars imported from Japan than on cars U.S. companies build in Canada and Mexico. An automotive industry group had criticized the pact, arguing it disadvantages American workers and companies. Lutnick dismissed these complaints as being stirred up by "PR people" and stated that U.S. automakers can avoid the tariffs by moving their manufacturing facilities back to the United States.
