          <p>A group of twelve Democratic members of Congress has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging it is illegally limiting their access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. The complaint argues that the Department of Homeland Security is violating federal law and inhibiting their constitutional oversight responsibilities by requiring a week's notice for visits. This legal action follows several instances where lawmakers were denied entry to facilities amid the administration's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. The administration contends the new notice period is necessary to prevent interference with executive branch functions.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula prompted widespread tsunami alerts across the Pacific, including for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan. While the quake caused flooding in Russia with 16-foot waves, the impact elsewhere was less severe than initially feared, with most warnings later downgraded to advisories. Hawaii experienced minor flooding and waves up to five feet, leading to evacuations but no major damage. The event tested emergency response systems and highlighted the unpredictable nature of tsunamis, which can consist of multiple waves over several hours.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining a range of 4.25% to 4.5% due to an uncertain economic outlook and persistent inflation. The policy statement noted that while economic growth has moderated, the labor market remains solid. The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated the economy is in good shape but faces risks, suggesting the central bank will await more data before considering any future cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, surpassing forecasts and reversing a 0.5% contraction from the previous quarter. This growth was significantly influenced by a sharp decrease in imports following the implementation of new tariffs, which statistically boosts GDP. Economists caution that this headline figure may overstate the economy's underlying strength, as a key measure of private domestic demand showed its weakest growth since 2022. Despite the skewed data, the report suggests the economy is slowing but not heading into a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies have made a significant move before the MLB trade deadline, reportedly acquiring All-Star closer Jhoan Duran from the Minnesota Twins. To secure the hard-throwing reliever, the Phillies are sending top prospects, including right-hander Mick Abel and catcher Eduardo Tait, to Minnesota. Duran, known for his triple-digit fastball, is expected to bolster the Phillies' bullpen as they aim for a World Series run. The trade is also a long-term investment, as Duran remains under team control through the 2028 season, strengthening a key area for the contending team.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a trade agreement with South Korea, which will face a 15% tariff on its goods exported to the U.S., while American imports to South Korea will be tariff-free. The deal, announced ahead of a looming deadline for widespread tariff hikes, also includes a commitment from South Korea to facilitate $350 billion in U.S.-controlled investments. This agreement makes South Korea the latest major trading partner to strike a deal with the administration, following similar arrangements with Japan and the European Union as part of a broader, aggressive trade strategy.

          <p>Shares of Arm Holdings fell after the company reported first-quarter revenue that missed analyst expectations, primarily due to weaker-than-anticipated growth in smartphone royalties. In response, the chip architecture firm announced it is considering designing its own processors or chiplets to provide a better starting point for new customers like cloud service providers. This strategic shift could introduce new risks by turning current customers into competitors. The company's net income saw a significant 42% drop compared to the same period last year, reflecting the current challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded at magnitude 8.8, the recent temblor off Russia's coast caused surprisingly little damage outside its immediate vicinity. Scientists explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching populated coastlines. This directionality, combined with modern deep-ocean sensor networks that provide timely warnings, resulted in a best-case scenario for a potentially catastrophic event. The incident served as a successful test of tsunami preparedness and highlighted the importance of an earthquake's specific characteristics.</p>

          <p>Figma, the collaborative design software company, has priced its initial public offering at $33 per share, above its initial range, valuing the company at $19.3 billion. The successful IPO, which raised $1.2 billion, marks a significant milestone for the company, especially after its planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated in 2023 due to regulatory opposition. Figma's strong public market debut reflects investor confidence in its business model and a gradually reopening environment for technology IPOs. The company's revenue grew approximately 40% in the most recent quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Doron Damari, an Israeli citizen who was held hostage by Hamas, has sharply criticized the UK government's plan to recognize a Palestinian state. In a social media post, she argued the move risks rewarding terrorism and sends a dangerous message that violence earns legitimacy. Representatives for British families of hostages echoed this concern, stating the UK's policy could disincentivize Hamas from agreeing to a ceasefire and releasing the remaining captives. This personal and emotional response provides a stark counterpoint to the geopolitical considerations driving the policy shifts in the UK and other Western nations.</p>

          <p>A 20-minute technical failure at the UK's national air traffic control service (NATS) caused significant, cascading flight disruptions across the country. The "radar-related" issue led to the grounding of thousands of flights at major airports like Heathrow and Manchester, with over 150 flights cancelled and many others delayed or diverted. This is the second major outage for NATS in two years, prompting apologies from the firm and calls for an investigation from political leaders. The incident created a massive backlog, leaving thousands of passengers stranded and their travel plans in disarray.</p>

          <p>A debate is intensifying over the long-term consequences of recent U.S. energy legislation, which prioritizes fossil fuels and nuclear power. Supporters of the new policy argue it is a necessary step toward energy independence and securing supply chains against manipulation by Beijing, which dominates clean tech manufacturing. However, critics warn that this strategic pivot could cede American leadership in the global clean energy transition, allowing China to win the renewables race while undermining global climate goals.

          <p>At the urging of Donald Trump, Texas Republicans have unveiled a new congressional map that could give the party up to five additional seats in the U.S. House. The proposed mid-decade gerrymander radically redraws districts in major Democratic areas like Austin and Houston, a move Democrats have denounced as illegal voter suppression and a racially discriminatory power grab. If enacted, the map would likely turn Texas into one of the most gerrymandered states in the country and is expected to face immediate and fierce legal challenges from civil rights groups.</p>

These actions are an extraordinary attempt to influence Brazil's domestic politics and halt the criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right ally of Trump accused of planning a coup. The Brazilian government has so far responded with defiance to what it calls an unacceptable interference in its justice system.
