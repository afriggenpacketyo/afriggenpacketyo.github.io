          <p>Brigham Young University quarterback Jake Retzlaff has officially responded to a civil lawsuit, denying allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman in November 2023. The lawsuit, filed by a woman identified as Jane Doe, claims battery, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress stemming from an encounter at his apartment. In his legal response, Retzlaff asserts that the encounter was consensual and accuses the plaintiff of extortion, suggesting the allegations are timed to his status as an NFL Draft prospect. No criminal charges have been filed in connection with the accusations presented in this article.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are urgently working to pass a comprehensive budget bill, central to former President Donald Trump's agenda, ahead of a July 4th deadline. The 940-page legislation aims to extend Trump-era tax cuts by reallocating funds from welfare programs, a point of contention among some party members. Key provisions include raising the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap and altering funding requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Democrats have heavily criticized the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid, which the CBO estimates could leave millions uninsured. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A week after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, conflicting reports have emerged from the Trump administration regarding the extent of the damage. While President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed the sites were "obliterated," initial intelligence assessments, including one from the Defense Intelligence Agency, suggested the setback to Iran's program might only be temporary. Officials also offered shifting goals for the mission, later emphasizing that the strikes successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Questions remain about the fate of Iran's enriched uranium, with some officials acknowledging it may not have been destroyed.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of protesters, led by students, gathered in Belgrade to demand early parliamentary elections and issued an ultimatum to President Aleksandar Vucic. The demonstrations, which have been ongoing for months, were initially sparked by a fatal train station collapse blamed on government corruption and negligence. Protesters have threatened a campaign of civil disobedience if their demands for a snap election are not met before the scheduled 2027 vote. President Vucic has rejected the calls, blaming foreign influence for the unrest, while his supporters held a counter-rally nearby.</p>

          <p>In an interview, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi stated that U.S. and Israeli strikes have caused a "very serious level of damage" to Iran's nuclear facilities, though some capabilities remain. He emphasized the urgent need for diplomatic negotiations and for IAEA inspectors to regain access to assess the situation and verify Iran's remaining nuclear material and activities. Grossi noted that while Iran has passed a law to suspend cooperation, he hopes to negotiate a path forward, as international treaty obligations supersede domestic law. The location and status of nearly 900 pounds of highly enriched uranium remain unknown.</p>

Other cases include the detention of a Marine veteran's father and the wife of another Marine.

          <p>A massive crowd, estimated by organizers at up to 200,000 people, participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying legal threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event proceeded despite a new "child protection" law that restricts gatherings considered to be promoting homosexuality, with attendees risking fines and organizers facing potential prison time. The march was attended by numerous European officials and MEPs in a show of solidarity with Hungary's LGBTQ+ community. The defiance is seen as a significant challenge to Orban's nationalist government and its policies restricting civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Concerns over press freedom in Kenya are escalating after deadly anti-government protests on June 25 resulted in 19 deaths and hundreds of injuries from gunfire. The government's security forces responded harshly, and the Communications Authority of Kenya issued an emergency order, later revoked by judges, banning live coverage of the demonstrations. Journalist protection groups and human rights organizations have condemned the move as political censorship. The protests, largely driven by Generation Z, reflect deep dissatisfaction with the economic situation and President William Ruto's government, which has been accused of targeting journalists and activists.</p>

In response, some moderate Democrats have distanced themselves from Mamdani, while progressives have embraced him.

The post drew sharp responses, with some sarcastically highlighting the difficulty of affording a home and others pointing to systemic issues like vacant investment properties in cities like Miami.

          <p>Iran held large public funeral processions in Tehran for top military commanders and nuclear scientists killed during the recent 12-day war with Israel. Mourners gathered for the funerals of Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami and others, chanting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans. Israel claimed it killed numerous Iranian commanders and scientists while targeting nuclear facilities and military sites before a ceasefire was declared. The ceremonies mark the first public funerals for the high-ranking officials since the conflict, which also saw Iran fire hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel.</p>

          <p>An automotive report highlights several vehicle models whose trade-in values have become so low that selling them to a dealer may not be financially sensible for owners. The list includes the Jaguar I-PACE and Nissan Leaf, whose values are hurt by rapid EV depreciation and outdated technology, and the Maserati Levante, which suffers from high maintenance costs and poor reliability. The Chrysler 300 and Dodge Hornet are also noted for low demand and oversupply. Experts suggest that for these vehicles, owners might find better financial outcomes through private sales or tax-deductible donations. (not investment advice)</p>
