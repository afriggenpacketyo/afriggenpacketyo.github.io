          <p>A private survey indicates that China's manufacturing activity contracted in May at the fastest rate since September 2022, primarily due to declining new export orders, exacerbated by U.S. tariffs. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell below 50, signaling contraction for the first time since last year, and the job market remains grim with employment shrinking. Accumulation of finished goods inventory suggests weakening sales and shipment delays, creating economic headwinds and uncertainty in the external trade environment. (not investment advice) The current economic climate has resulted in a score that reflects the challenges faced by the manufacturing sector.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is intensifying its efforts to prevent transgender athletes from participating in school sports in California, warning districts they could face legal consequences if they don't bar transgender athletes from competition. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon insists that allowing transgender athletes to compete deprives girls of athletic opportunities based solely on their biological sex. The warning comes after a transgender athlete won multiple medals at the state high school track and field championships, despite opposition from the Trump administration. LGBTQ+ advocates criticize the move as targeting transgender kids for political gain, while conservative groups praise the directive as a victory for fairness in girls' sports.</p>

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the comment was a joke, emphasizing FEMA's focus on disaster response, despite the claims.
