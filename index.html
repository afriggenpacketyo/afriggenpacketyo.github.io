          <p>Apple's stock is no longer performing as a safe haven asset within the tech sector, a role it previously held, underperforming relative to its sector fund with its worst performance since 2002.

Investors are still betting on tech through broad market index funds, where tech stocks represent a significant portion. Despite volatility, experts suggest investors are becoming more accustomed to market fluctuations and are using traditional hedging strategies.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, which resulted in no reported casualties, raising hopes of de-escalation in the Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil and global benchmark Brent both fell by over 7%, reaching their lowest levels since Israel started bombing Iran on June 13. The market selloff indicates that investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, with some analysts suggesting a "peace through strength" strategy. The situation remains fluid, but the initial market reaction reflects a sense of reduced immediate risk. </p>

The mission relied on keeping Iran unaware of the attack, using decoy bombers and accounting for potential data leaks from smartphones.
