          <p>The Trump administration is offering undocumented immigrants $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to return to their home countries voluntarily. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that self-deportation is the safest, most cost-effective way for undocumented immigrants to leave the U.S., saving taxpayers 70% compared to arrest, detention, and removal. The program requires immigrants to use the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's "Home" app and confirms their arrival in their country of origin before issuing the stipend. Immigrants who sign up will also be deprioritized for detention and removal ahead of their departure, potentially keeping the door open for legal immigration in the future.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education is resuming collections on defaulted student loans, impacting millions of borrowers as delinquency rates reach a record high. A recent analysis by TransUnion indicates that roughly 20% of student loan borrowers are at risk of defaulting, surpassing the previous high of 15.4% in 2012. Borrowers in default could face wage garnishment and withholding of Social Security benefits and tax refunds, while also experiencing a decline in their credit scores. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that taxpayers should not be responsible for irresponsible student loan policies, and that the Biden administration misled borrowers regarding debt forgiveness.</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed imposing 100% tariffs on movies produced in foreign countries, citing concerns about the decline of Hollywood. The proposal has raised questions about its potential impact on the U.S. and global film industries, particularly regarding American film companies producing movies abroad. Many countries offer tax breaks to incentivize film production, and Trump's plan could disrupt these incentives. White House officials have stated that no final decisions have been made regarding the tariffs, and the administration is exploring all options. The UK government has expressed concern that the tariffs could negatively impact its film industry, which relies heavily on investment from US studios.</p>

Jana Heartwood, a borrower with over $40,000 in student loans, stated she was not notified about the resumption of payments and cannot afford to pay. Experts like Persis Yu cite job cuts and dismantling efforts at the Education Department as contributing to the loan system's disarray, leaving borrowers unable to get answers from servicers. The Department of Education under President Trump blames the Biden administration for the dire financial state of the student loan portfolio due to attempts to transfer student debt to taxpayers.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged global business leaders to disregard economic naysayers and increase investment in the United States, defending the Trump administration's economic agenda. Bessent argued that the administration's plans extend beyond trade policy, including tax cuts and deregulation, which would stimulate job creation and output. He encouraged investors to focus on these broader economic plans, despite concerns about tariffs destabilizing the global economy. Business leaders expressed worries about the impact of tariffs, with some delaying investment and preparing for economic headwinds.

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA, citing ongoing delays and cancellations at Newark Airport. Schumer attributed the issues to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, outdated technology, and depleting federal funds. He criticized the FAA's recent bonus offer to air traffic controllers, which excluded Washington, Philadelphia, and New York, despite their significant needs. Travelers are experiencing frustration due to the delays, and United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights a day at Newark. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is expected to release details of a plan to revamp the air traffic control system this week.</p>

Shayai Lucero, owner of Earth and Sky Floral Designs, has seen a sharp increase in flower prices due to tariffs and fears she may have to close her business.

          <p>Homeowners considering a HELOC this May should be aware of potential hurdles in the approval process.

Stable income and employment history are also crucial factors for approval. To improve chances of approval, homeowners can check their credit report, lower their DTI ratio, shop around for different lenders, and consider adding a co-applicant. Despite the challenges, many homeowners with substantial equity may find HELOCs a cost-effective borrowing option in the current high-rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics argue that the expanded military campaign would endanger the hostages and not fundamentally change the conflict's dynamics.

          <p>Alphabet's Google has launched a new film and TV production initiative called "100 Zeros" in partnership with Range Media Partners. The initiative aims to identify projects that Google can help fund or produce, with a focus on integrating Google's newer tech products and services. These include artificial intelligence products and tools like the Immersive View feature. Google views the project as a way to encourage the creative community to adopt its technology. 100 Zeros is listed as one of the producers for the 2024 horror film "Cuckoo" and has provided some marketing support for the film.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has released a report documenting a series of appalling incidents of anti-Semitism and the failure of university leadership to address the issue. The report, compiled by current insiders, details instances of harassment, silencing of Jewish students, and faculty support of anti-Israel protests. Harvard President Alan Garber has initiated reforms, including standardizing disciplinary procedures and canceling identity-driven graduation events. However, the report suggests that the roots of Harvard’s Jew-baiting problem go far deeper and require addressing identity-driven politics and research centers driven by political agendas. The Trump administration's approach to the issue is criticized for being radical and potentially undermining academic freedom.</p>

          <p>The expiration of a de minimis tariff exemption could lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers on goods from China. Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu, which relied on the loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the country duty-free, may have to raise prices. The end of the exemption, which applied to packages worth $800, means that many goods will no longer be as inexpensive. Trade experts anticipate that this could also cause delays in shipments as millions more packages will need to be inspected daily by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. President Trump eliminated the exemption due to concerns about fentanyl entering the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has approved plans for its forces to capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the territory for an unspecified amount of time, according to Israeli officials. The plans are meant to achieve the country's war aims of defeating Hamas and freeing hostages, and they would push hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into southern Gaza. Since a ceasefire collapsed in mid-March, Israel has unleashed fierce strikes on the territory, capturing swathes of territory and controlling roughly half of Gaza. Netanyahu says Gaza's population "will be moved, for its own protection," without offering details. The UN said it would not participate in a distribution plan as it was presented, saying it violates its core principles.</p>

          <p>Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu has resigned, and his Social Democrat party is withdrawing from the government following a win by right-wing nationalist George Simion in the first round of the presidential election. Simion, a eurosceptic who has pledged to prioritize Romania, secured 40.9% of the vote and is favored to win the runoff on May 18. Ciolacu stated that the coalition failed to meet its objective and lacks credibility, prompting his decision to propose the PSD's departure.

          <p>The trend of anti-Trump sentiment influencing global politics continues as the center-left Labor Party in Australia secured a come-from-behind victory, with the right-wing challenger losing his seat. This mirrors the Canadian elections, where the Liberals held onto power amid an anti-Trump backlash. The Labor Party gained support following President Donald Trump's clash with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his "Liberation Day" tariffs. Observers suggest that voters are mindful of Trump's policies, including tariffs and disrupted alliances, when making decisions. The Washington Post noted that Australians gifted their center-left prime minister a landslide victory amid anger and confusion over Trump's tariffs.</p>
