          <p>A weather system moving across the Florida Panhandle is gaining strength and has a 40% chance of developing into a tropical depression as it heads toward the northern Gulf Coast. Officials in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama are warning residents about the threat of heavy rainfall and significant flooding, regardless of whether the system intensifies into a named storm. In New Orleans, which could see up to 10 inches of rain, volunteers are distributing sandbags to help residents protect their properties from the anticipated floods.</p>

          <p>Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott has stated she stands by her 2023 comments that led to her suspension from the party, where she suggested that Jewish people, Irish people, and Travellers experience a different form of prejudice than racism based on skin color. In a recent BBC interview, she reiterated her belief that racism against Black individuals is distinct because skin color is immediately visible. Despite her previous apology and completion of an antisemitism awareness course, Abbott's remarks continue to generate controversy within her party and among community groups.</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula was canceled after being briefly issued following a powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake on Wednesday. The quake, which struck south of Sand Point, initially prompted a more severe tsunami warning, causing some coastal residents to evacuate to higher ground as a precaution. Officials later confirmed that the shallow depth of the earthquake meant that large, widespread waves were not expected, and the threat ultimately passed without causing significant damage or inundation, though multiple aftershocks were reported.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Army veteran is calling for a full investigation after he was detained for three days following a large-scale immigration raid at a cannabis farm in Ventura County where he worked as a security guard. George Retes, a 25-year-old U.S. citizen, said he was dragged from his car at gunpoint and held without cause, despite repeatedly informing agents of his citizenship. The incident highlights the chaotic nature of the raid and has raised serious questions about civil rights violations and the conduct of federal agents during enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly questioned President Trump's assertion that the federal investigation files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are a "hoax." After Trump dismissed questions about the case by calling believers "stupid" and "foolish," Musk responded on his social media platform, X, suggesting the president should release the files to prove his claim. The exchange highlights ongoing public skepticism and conspiracy theories surrounding the Epstein case and the government's refusal to release all related documents, putting the president at odds with some supporters.</p>

President Trump celebrated the decision as a win for taxpayers, calling the long-delayed train a "boondoggle," while California officials have vowed to explore all options to fight the action and keep the nation's only high-speed rail project moving forward.</p>

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of twelve plaintiffs, argues that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are weaponizing the immigration court system, turning it into a trap for people seeking legal protection. This practice, they claim, violates due process rights and discourages individuals from complying with their legal obligations to appear in court.</p>

          <p>A recent federal raid on a Nebraska meat processing plant, where over 70 workers were arrested, highlights the vulnerabilities of the government's E-Verify system. The company's owner stated he had used the system in good faith to confirm his employees' eligibility, but experts say E-Verify is easily fooled with stolen identities because it vets documents, not people. This flaw not only leaves employers who follow the rules exposed to raids but also contributes to identity theft, with one HSI agent calling the business itself a victim of a broken system.</p>
