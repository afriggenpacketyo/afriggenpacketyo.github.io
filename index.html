          <p>A Russian An-24 passenger plane with 49 people on board, including 43 passengers and six crew, has crashed in the country's Amur region. The aircraft vanished from radar while flying from Blagoveshchensk to Tynda. According to Russia's federal aviation agency, a search and rescue helicopter later discovered the plane's burning fuselage. Officials have deployed over 50 personnel to the scene, but there has been no immediate word on survivors.</p>

          <p>As NFL training camps begin, several star players are not participating due to ongoing contract negotiations. Notable names include Dallas Cowboys' Micah Parsons, Washington Commanders' Terry McLaurin, and Cincinnati Bengals' Trey Hendrickson, all of whom are seeking new, more lucrative deals before risking injury in practice. This strategy of holding out has historically had mixed results for players. The situation with the Bengals is further complicated by a contract dispute with their first-round draft pick, Shemar Stewart.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the UK to sign a significant free trade agreement with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal, which follows years of negotiations, will see India lower tariffs on British goods like cars and whisky, while the UK will increase imports of Indian textiles and gemstones. The British government projects the agreement will boost its economy by £4.8 billion annually and increase bilateral trade by £25.5 billion a year by 2040. The pact has been approved by the Indian cabinet and now awaits ratification by the UK parliament.</p>

          <p>The White House has responded to reports that President Trump was informed his name appears in Justice Department documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. While the Wall Street Journal reported on the briefing, a Trump spokesperson dismissed it as a "fake news story." The presence of a name in the files does not imply wrongdoing, but the administration faces pressure to be more transparent about the matter. This development occurs as a House subcommittee voted to subpoena the DOJ for its Epstein files, increasing scrutiny on the case.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed executive orders aimed at shaping the U.S. approach to artificial intelligence, including one to prevent the use of "woke AI" by the federal government. The order targets models perceived as sacrificing accuracy for ideological agendas like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), mandating that government-procured AI should be neutral and truth-seeking. Other orders aim to spur innovation by removing regulations and establish a program to promote the export of American AI technology. These actions are part of a broader "Winning the AI Race" plan to accelerate AI development and leadership.</p>

          <p>The lawyer for Lauren Pisciotta, a former assistant to Kanye West, claims his client is in hiding and fearful after filing a lawsuit against the rapper. The lawsuit accuses West of sexual harassment, stalking, and sexual assault, claims which West's team denies as "fantasy fiction." An amended claim alleges Pisciotta was also a victim of "swatting," where false emergency reports are made to prompt a police raid. The civil case highlights serious allegations against the public figure and is scheduled to return to court next month.</p>

While the trip is private, Trump is scheduled to hold talks with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday.

          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, former city traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for rigging the Libor interest rate quashed by a UK court. The ruling raises questions about the prosecution of individuals following the 2008 financial crisis and may open the door for at least seven other convicted traders to appeal. The case has prompted calls from senior politicians for a public inquiry into the scandal, particularly regarding the role of senior bank managers and the Serious Fraud Office's investigation methods, which relied heavily on the banks' own internal probes.

The amendment grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction.

Published in The Lancet Public Health, the research analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and linked the 7,000-step count to a reduced risk of cancer, dementia, and heart disease. The popular 10,000-step goal originated from a 1960s marketing campaign rather than scientific evidence. Researchers hope these findings will encourage more people to use step tracking as a practical way to improve their health.</p>
