          <h2>Senior Police Express Concerns Over Proposed Early Prisoner Release</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 04:35:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior police officials, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have voiced concerns about the government's plans to release some prisoners early to ease overcrowding. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argued the proposals could negatively impact public safety, citing concerns about electronic tagging costs and repeat offenders avoiding jail. Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley acknowledged the government's difficult problem but noted the proposed solutions would create extra work for the police. The government maintains that the announced proposals address many of the concerns raised, as repeat offenders can still face short sentences and terrorists will not be eligible for early release, as the government inherited prisons in crisis.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan recommends decriminalizing the possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use. The report, by the London Drugs Commission, suggests removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act. Lord Falconer, who chaired the commission, argues that the current law disproportionately affects ethnic communities due to stop and search practices. While Khan supports the recommendations, critics argue that decriminalization could send the wrong message about the harm associated with cannabis use, as any reduction in the legal consequences around cannabis would wrongly send the message that cannabis was less harmful.</p>

          <p>A German court in Hamm dismissed a climate case brought by a Peruvian farmer against energy giant RWE, who sought damages for potential flooding risks due to melting glaciers near his town. The court stated that no appeal is possible, ending a decade-long legal battle. Saul Luciano Lluiya argued that RWE, as a major polluter, should contribute to the cost of flood defenses for his town of Huaraz. While the court acknowledged the transboundary effects of climate change, it ultimately dismissed Lliuya's claims that his house was at risk, though Lliuya and his lawyers celebrated the outcome as a win, since the court confirmed that high-emitting companies could be held responsible for the impact of their emissions.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined £122.7m for breaches relating to its sewage operations and shareholder payouts, marking the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat. The regulator found that the shareholder payouts were "undeserved" given the company's poor performance for customers and the environment. Thames Water, grappling with a £20bn debt, secured an emergency £3bn in March to prevent collapse, and is currently in "cash lock up," preventing further dividend payments without Ofwat's approval. The fine will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers, and the money will ultimately go to the Treasury.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court to remove judge-ordered restrictions on deporting immigrants to third countries. Solicitor General John Sauer argues that a mandate issued by a Massachusetts judge has created a "diplomatic and logistical morass" and harms efforts to remove criminal aliens. The judge's order requires providing detainees with notice of their destination, time to raise safety concerns, and time to contest adverse findings. The administration insists it has been in compliance with international law regarding protections under the Convention Against Torture. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that non-citizens on U.S. soil must be afforded "due process of law."</p>

With neither side achieving major breakthroughs on the front lines, the arms race has become increasingly crucial.

Trzaskowski, representing the center-left ruling coalition, and Nawrocki, representing the national-conservative Law and Justice party, are engaging in intense campaigning. The prime minister himself warned that "common gangsters" were reaching for power, a reference to Nawrocki's past, and candidate Trzaskowski also cautioned against putting Poland in the hands of a "muscle man."</p>

Under the proposed law, refugees with limited protection status would face a two-year suspension of their ability to bring family members to Germany. This affects refugees allowed to stay because they face persecution, torture, or death in their home countries, including many from Syria. Dobrindt argues this will reduce migration 'pull factors,' while the Green Party criticizes the bill as tearing families apart and hindering integration.</p>

The move comes amid a record high in shoplifting in the UK, as figures from the Office for National Statistics show that shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Wales rose 20% last year to 516,971.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered US embassies to cease scheduling appointments for student visas while preparing to expand social media vetting of applicants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the pause would last "until further guidance is issued," with increased social media screening for student and foreign exchange visas. The move follows Trump's criticism of elite colleges, alleging left-wing bias and enabling antisemitism. The state department memo directed embassies to remove unfilled appointments but said those with existing appointments could proceed, though some of these actions have been blocked by the courts.</p>

This build-up occurs as Russia prepares for a summer offensive, and Kyiv awaits a memorandum from Moscow outlining conditions for ceasefire talks. Zelenskiy believes Russia aims to create a "buffer zone" along the border, approximately 10 km deep.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space but failed to complete its return to Earth during its ninth test flight. The upper-stage vehicle experienced a propellant leak, causing it to spin out of control and break up upon re-entry into the atmosphere. While the debris fell into the Indian Ocean, away from populated areas, the incident highlights the work needed before Starship can be frequently reused. The mission flew a booster that had been used for an earlier test flight in January, but that too was lost as three engines lit up to simulate a landing over the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

          <p>The head of the Metropolitan Police has warned that the government's pledges on crime will not be met without substantial extra funding for policing. In an article for the Times, Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley and five other senior police chiefs highlighted a decade of underinvestment and new pressures on police forces. Sir Mark argued that without significant investment, there would be no restoration of neighborhood policing and no halving of knife crime or violence against women and girls. The Home Office stated it is "backing the police to protect our communities and keep our streets safe."</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," escaped from a medium-security prison by impersonating a corrections officer. Hardin, who was serving lengthy sentences for murder and sexual assault, walked out through a gate opened by a prison officer. Authorities are searching the rugged Ozark Mountains for Hardin, while the sister of one of his victims expressed alarm.
