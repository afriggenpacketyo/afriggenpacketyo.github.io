        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating Libor and Euribor interest rates overturned by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. They were among several traders convicted for rigging key inter-bank lending rates but had long maintained they were scapegoats for what was common commercial practice. The ruling follows the quashing of all related US convictions, with the Serious Fraud Office confirming it will not seek a retrial, effectively vindicating the traders' long-standing claims of injustice.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a significant price increase for its European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), set to be implemented in 2026 for visa-exempt visitors. The fee is expected to rise from the original 7 euros to 20 euros, a move attributed to inflation and increased operational costs. This brings the cost in line with similar travel authorization systems in the U.S. and U.K. The ETIAS requirement will apply to travelers from 59 countries, including the U.S., U.K., and Canada, for short stays in 30 European nations.</p>

          <p>The son of an elderly British couple detained by the Taliban for five months fears they may die in prison due to rapidly deteriorating health. Peter and Barbie Reynolds, aged 80 and 76, were arrested in February for unknown reasons and have been held in harsh conditions, including a maximum-security prison. Their son reports his father is suffering from serious convulsions and his mother from anemia and malnutrition, while the UN has called their detention inhumane. Despite a Taliban official's earlier promise of a swift release, the family remains in anguish as they await diplomatic resolution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has announced a major trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on Japanese goods, a reduction from a previously threatened 25% on automobiles. The agreement reportedly involves Japan opening its markets to certain U.S. products, including agricultural goods and vehicles, and committing to a $550 billion investment in the American economy. While the Japanese Prime Minister welcomed the deal, some U.S. automakers have criticized it, arguing it disadvantages their North American operations, which still face higher tariffs on parts from Canada and Mexico.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a contentious bill placing the country's independent anti-corruption bodies, NABU and SAPO, under the control of the Prosecutor General's Office. The move has triggered significant protests in Kyiv and other cities, with critics, including Kyiv's mayor, arguing it undermines Ukraine's democratic progress and its path toward EU membership. While Zelenskyy defends the law as necessary to eliminate Russian influence and ensure justice, international partners and domestic activists have expressed alarm, viewing it as a major setback for anti-corruption reforms.</p>

The piece laments the loss of late-night shows as a cultural touchstone that confirms a shared reality and holds leaders accountable through humor.

          <p>As heat waves strain power grids, the energy-saving strategy of "precooling" homes is gaining attention, though its effectiveness remains a topic of debate. The method involves significantly lowering a home's temperature during off-peak hours to coast through hotter, more expensive periods. While some utility companies endorse the practice under specific conditions, others warn it could lead to excessive energy use and higher costs. Experts agree that for precooling to work, a home must be very energy-efficient, and suggest that simply maintaining a consistent temperature is often more effective than frequently turning an AC system on and off.</p>

This scheduling change, which aims to attract a younger and broader fanbase, follows a similar move by the men's Six Nations. The opening weekend will avoid a Saturday game to prevent a clash with the Women's Rugby World Cup final, with defending champions Bath starting their campaign on Friday against Harlequins.</p>

          <p>As China grapples with deflationary pressures, prominent economists are arguing that the country requires deep institutional reforms rather than just short-term stimulus measures to ensure long-term growth. Experts from Peking University and other institutions suggest that boosting total factor productivity through systemic changes, such as altering the incentive structure for local officials, is crucial for the upcoming 15th five-year plan. They contend that the current focus on GDP targets has contributed to industrial overcapacity and that sustainable development will require prioritizing consumption and addressing the urban-rural income gap.

A new book, "A Protest History of the United States," examines centuries of American resistance to understand which forms of protest have historically succeeded and what lessons can be applied today. This analysis brings together historical perspectives with contemporary observations from journalists covering recent movements. The discussion aims to define what constitutes a successful outcome for a protest in the modern era.</p>

          <p>A report from AI firm Anthropic highlights a significant disparity in power infrastructure development between China and the U.S., suggesting it could impact the race for AI dominance. China reportedly added 400 gigawatts of power capacity last year, ten times more than the U.S. This is particularly concerning as the American AI sector alone is projected to require at least 50 gigawatts of power by 2028. The findings, citing data from an Australian think tank, underscore how energy constraints in the U.S. could become a critical bottleneck, potentially hindering its ability to compete with China's rapidly expanding AI capabilities.</p>

The sloppy performance, which included a comical throwing error by a pitcher that allowed three runs to score, highlighted the team's ongoing struggles.

          <p>The relationship between the European Union and China is increasingly strained by disputes over trade, technology, and security, with the United States' policies adding another layer of complexity. As leaders prepare for a high-stakes summit in Beijing, analysts note that irreconcilable differences will likely limit cooperation, despite a mutual interest in countering some U.S. trade measures. The U.S.'s adversarial approach to both partners complicates the dynamic, as Brussels may face pressure to align with Washington on issues like supply chains, potentially further frustrating Beijing.
