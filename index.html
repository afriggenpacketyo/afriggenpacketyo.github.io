            <p>A Russian ballistic missile strike on the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy resulted in the deaths of at least 31 people, including two children, and injured 84 others on Palm Sunday. The attack, which utilized cluster munitions, targeted residential buildings and educational institutions in the city center. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a deliberate act of terror against civilians, calling for a strong international response and increased pressure on Russia to end the war. He emphasized that negotiations alone cannot stop such attacks and urged the world to treat Russia as a terrorist state. </p>

            <p>Chinese authorities are urging financial institutions to increase investment in the sports industry, particularly in spectator sports and facilities. New guidelines call for lenders and local governments to support business models that integrate sports with culture, tourism, and healthcare.

            <p>The UK government has taken emergency control of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant to prevent its Chinese owners, Jingye, from shutting down the blast furnaces. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds declined to guarantee the furnaces would remain open due to supply concerns, but emphasized the takeover was essential to maintaining steel production in the UK. The government is seeking a buyer for British Steel and will not sell to another Chinese company, with the plant being the last in the UK capable of producing virgin steel. The government is currently incurring losses of around Â£700,000 a day while looking for a buyer.</p>

            <p>The article discusses the emergence of "end times fascism," characterized by a blend of corporate secessionism and mass-market survivalism. It highlights the trend of wealthy elites creating high-tech private domains as escape pods from societal collapse, alongside the rise of fortressed nations focused on expelling unwanted populations and claiming resources. This ideology, influenced by Christian fundamentalist interpretations of the Rapture, lacks a hopeful vision for the future and instead embraces a monstrous, supremacist survivalism. The piece argues that this trend betrays our duties to one another and the planet, calling for a movement rooted in interdependence and belonging to counter these forces.</p>

            <p>Two new books offer a damning picture of Joe Biden's final year as president, detailing his declining fitness and the Democratic party's struggle to address it. The books reveal that Biden's aides planned for his withdrawal from the 2024 election and that his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump accelerated calls for him to quit. The books also highlight shortcomings in Kamala Harris's campaign and the flawed selection of her running mate, ultimately leading to Trump's return to power. These accounts point to a need for Democrats to address issues of age and leadership within the party.</p>

            <p>Autoworkers and small business owners in Michigan express mixed feelings about President Trump's tariff policies, with some fearing the potential for increased prices and economic damage. While some supporters believe the tariffs could help revive American industry, others worry about the impact on middle-income families and small businesses. Democrats in Michigan are calibrating their messaging, with some supporting tariffs as a tool to level the playing field with countries like China, but emphasizing the need for a well-planned approach.

            <p>President Trump paused higher trade tariffs for most countries, excluding China, after facing intense economic and political pressure. The decision marks a significant climbdown from his previous stance of unwavering commitment to tariffs as a means of restoring US manufacturing and addressing trade imbalances. The initial announcement of sweeping tariffs caused market instability, international condemnation, and uncertainty for businesses and consumers. While White House aides attempted to spin the retreat as a strategic masterstroke, the episode damaged America's standing as a reliable ally and raised concerns about Trump's economic leadership.</p>

            <p>Vietnam, which benefited from the first US-China trade war, now faces uncertainty due to President Trump's new tariffs, including a 46% tax on imports from Vietnam. While a temporary stay on the tariffs offers some relief, the potential for significant economic disruption remains. The article examines how Vietnamese businesses and policymakers are responding to the changing trade landscape, including efforts to diversify export markets and attract foreign investment. Vietnam's manufacturing industry, a key driver of economic growth, is particularly vulnerable to the new trade policies.</p>

            <p>The author explores which character from Homer's 'Iliad' best embodies Donald Trump, considering Menelaus, Achilles, and Agamemnon. While Achilles shares traits like petulance and narcissism, the author ultimately argues that Agamemnon, with his unchanging brutishness, self-serving behavior, and lack of empathy, is the closest parallel. Like Agamemnon, Trump leads his followers on a self-defeating crusade, causing unnecessary suffering and hardship.</p>

            <p>New tariff policies could significantly increase the price of cheap clothes from China, potentially disrupting the US fast fashion market. The end of the "de-minimis" rule, which allowed low-priced goods to enter the US duty-free, is expected to impact retailers like Shein and Temu. While some experts believe this could encourage consumers to consider secondhand options, others argue that the appeal of ultra-cheap goods will persist. The situation remains fluid, with ongoing policy shifts and potential consumer backlash adding to the uncertainty.</p>

            <p>California farmers are bracing for economic upheaval as President Trump's tariff policies threaten key export markets. Increased tariffs on goods from Canada and China, top buyers of California crops, have raised concerns about declining sales and market instability. Farmers are worried about the potential for long-lasting damage to trade relationships and are calling for government support to mitigate the losses. The article highlights the specific challenges facing almond and citrus growers, who are particularly vulnerable to the trade disruptions.</p>

            <p>The article examines the trajectory of Peter Navarro, a Harvard-educated economist who became a staunch supporter of Donald Trump and architect of his trade policies. It contrasts Navarro's background and earlier work, which included critiques of free trade with China, with his current role as a MAGA loyalist. The author suggests that Navarro's embrace of Trump represents a tragic downfall, driven by a desire for relevance and a misguided belief in his own ideas. Navarro's story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of sacrificing principles for access to power.</p>

            <p>This article argues that the Trump administration is waging a social revolution aimed at crushing the power and authority of the professional managerial class (PMC). Drawing on historical and theoretical perspectives, it contends that the administration is systematically undermining institutions associated with the PMC, including universities, law firms, and federal agencies. The author suggests that this campaign represents a form of class warfare, driven by a desire to purge the PMC and consolidate power.</p>

            <p>Sarah Palin's defamation case against The New York Times is set for a retrial after a judge's misstep during the initial suit opened the door for another hearing. The case stems from a 2017 Times editorial that Palin's attorneys argue falsely linked her to inciting a mass shooting in 2011. Despite the initial trial ending with a verdict against Palin, an appellate court ordered a retrial due to jurors learning of the judge's decision to dismiss the case before their deliberations were complete. The retrial's outcome could impact protections for the press and test the bounds of the First Amendment.</p>

            <p>Legal experts are debating the potential impact of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act on married women's voting rights, particularly those who have changed their last names. The bill requires proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration, which could pose challenges for women whose birth certificates no longer match their current names. While supporters argue the bill allows states to determine acceptable secondary documents, opponents fear it could disproportionately disenfranchise married women, especially those who may face difficulties obtaining marriage certificates or court decrees for name changes.</p>
