          <p>The United States and China are shifting their trade battleground from tariffs to control over global supply chains, potentially causing more significant disruptions.

          <p>The U.S. Navy intends to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a ship named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran, and may also change the names of other vessels honoring civil rights figures. This decision aligns with the Trump administration's goal of "re-establishing the warrior culture" in the armed forces, according to a Pentagon spokesman. The memo also suggests renaming the USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the USNS Harriet Tubman. The move comes during Pride Month and amid a broader effort to curb diversity and inclusion programs across federal departments. </p>

While current quarter and fiscal year guidance were mixed, profitability was better than expected. Analysts believe the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, as cybersecurity remains a critical expense for corporations. (not investment advice) </p>
