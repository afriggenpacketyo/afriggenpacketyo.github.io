          <p>The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, refuted the Trump administration's claims regarding a leaked Signal chat discussing a potential U.S. attack on Houthis in Yemen. He stated that the administration is using semantics to avoid accountability for its reckless handling of sensitive information in an unsecured platform.  The White House's shifting explanations for Goldberg's inclusion in the chat highlight the severity of the security breach.</p>
