          <p>According to UNICEF and Save the Children, the war in Gaza has resulted in an estimated 20,000 child fatalities, with thousands more injured or orphaned. The article highlights the immense physical and psychological trauma inflicted upon Gaza's youngest residents, sharing personal stories from children who have lost their parents and now bear adult responsibilities. These accounts are set against a backdrop of widespread displacement and acute malnutrition, as aid organizations describe a humanitarian crisis where children are disproportionately suffering from the ongoing conflict. The dire situation is compounded by the destruction of infrastructure and the constant threat of violence.</p>

          <p>In a social media post, former President Donald Trump stated that Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson "should be in jail" for their actions regarding federal immigration enforcement. The statement comes amid heightened tensions over "Operation Midway Blitz," an increased presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Chicago. Both Pritzker and Johnson responded, with Pritzker accusing Trump of authoritarianism and Johnson condemning the call for his arrest. The conflict is contextualized by local measures to limit cooperation with federal immigration agents and protests against their operations.</p>

          <p>A new tax law proposed by President Trump, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," introduces significant changes to the Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exemption that could benefit startup founders and early investors. The bill increases the capital gains tax exclusion cap from $10 million to $15 million and raises the qualifying gross assets limit for companies to $75 million. These adjustments are designed to make forming a C corporation more attractive for fast-growing ventures, potentially stimulating early-stage investment and providing more flexibility for founders planning an exit strategy.

          <p>James Comey, the former director of the FBI, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of making a false statement and obstructing a congressional proceeding. The indictment relates to his 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding an investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Appearing in court for the first time since the charges were filed, Comey requested a jury trial, which has been scheduled for early January.

          <p>The upcoming 2026 World Cup, co-hosted by the US, Mexico, and Canada, may present significant challenges for fans, according to a new analysis. Key concerns include stringent US immigration policies under the Trump administration, the potential for mass deportation raids in host cities, and record-high ticket prices that are nearly four times those of the 2022 Qatar tournament. Furthermore, the vast distances between venues will necessitate extensive air travel, contributing to high financial and environmental costs, raising questions about the overall fan experience for the global event.</p>

          <p>High-level mediators, including US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have joined indirect peace talks in Egypt aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The negotiations between Israel and Hamas, now in their third day, focus on President Trump's 20-point plan for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a hostage-prisoner exchange. While both sides have expressed a degree of cautious optimism, significant disagreements remain on key issues such as the timeline for Israeli withdrawal and the specifics of the exchange.

          <p>The price of gold has surged past a record $4,000 an ounce as investors seek safe-haven assets in response to growing economic and political instability.

A review of oncologic PET-CT scans revealed that patients taking these medications showed abnormal patterns of radiotracer uptake. This finding is significant because if a patient's medication history is not known, these patterns could be misinterpreted by doctors, potentially leading to incorrect cancer staging, unnecessary tests, or delays in proper treatment.

          <p>After a sustained two-year rally, cocoa prices have plunged to their lowest level since early 2024, with U.S. futures dropping significantly this week. The sharp decline has led investment banks like Citi and Societe Generale to warn that the commodity has become "extremely oversold." This condition makes the market vulnerable to "short covering," where investors rush to buy back the asset to close out their short positions, which could trigger a rapid price increase and reverse the recent downward trend.

          <p>American public opinion regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has undergone a notable transformation, particularly in the two years since the start of the Gaza war. Recent polls indicate a significant decline in favorable views of Israel and a corresponding rise in sympathy for the Palestinian cause. This shift is most pronounced among Democrats and younger voters, influencing political discourse and leading some analysts to believe it represents a permanent change that could have profound implications for future U.S. foreign policy and the influence of pro-Israel lobby groups.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece analyzes former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's collaboration with Donald Trump on a post-war plan for Gaza, arguing it represents a continuation of Blair's long-standing imperial and market-driven foreign policy. The author contends that the plan, which emphasizes public-private partnerships and international oversight, reduces complex politics to dealmaking and serves the private financial interests of Blair's network. The critique frames the proposal as a hallucinatory and potentially destructive vision that fuses public power with private profit under the guise of a peace initiative.</p>

          <p>France is experiencing a protracted political crisis, highlighted by the recent collapse of its government, as it confronts deeply unpopular budget measures. The core of the conflict is a debate over the nation's economic future and its cherished social model. Proponents of reforms, such as removing public holidays, argue they are necessary to boost productivity and compete with the US and China. However, critics fiercely oppose these measures, viewing them as an attack on the country's prized work-life balance and quality of life.</p>

          <p>A review of sportswriter Jane Leavy's new book, "Make Me Commissioner," delves into her proposals for improving the game of baseball for modern audiences while maintaining its core appeal. The book engages in a "spitballing" session with various figures from the sport to address its lagging pace and over-reliance on analytics. While Leavy warns that the sport must adapt to survive, the review concludes that the book is less a clinical prescription for rule changes and more a celebration of baseball's rich storytelling tradition and quirky character.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Animal Welfare Institute reveals a troubling trend in the enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) increasingly issuing inconsequential warnings instead of fines for violations. This shift in enforcement affects animals at commercial dog breeding facilities and research laboratories, where serious neglect has been documented. The report attributes this weaker accountability to several factors, including severe understaffing at the agency, the chilling effect of a recent Supreme Court decision on administrative penalties, and a more lenient regulatory approach.</p>

According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the share of ARM applications has increased as the interest rate gap between ARMs and traditional 30-year fixed-rate loans widens. While these loans offer lower initial rates, they are considered riskier because the rate can adjust higher after the initial fixed period, reflecting a trade-off many borrowers are now willing to make.

This allows individuals aged 70½ or older to transfer up to $108,000 directly from a pretax IRA to a charity in 2025. The key advantage is that the distributed amount is excluded from the donor's adjusted gross income, which is more beneficial than a standard deduction and can help avoid higher Medicare premiums.
