          <p>A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction halting the Trump administration's plans to cut jobs and reorganize major federal agencies under the DOGE initiative led by Elon Musk. The order pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch while the lawsuit proceeds. Judge Illston emphasized that Congress creates and funds federal agencies, and agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates through large-scale reorganizations without congressional partnership. The Trump administration has appealed the decision.</p>

The bill includes provisions such as raising the SALT cap and preserving a lower top tax rate, but also cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Faced with President Trump's demand for NATO allies to spend 5% of their national income on defense, European countries are exploring a new plan to broaden the definition of defense spending. The proposed plan includes a target of 3.5% of GDP for traditional military spending, plus another 1.5% for nontraditional "defense-related" spending, such as infrastructure improvements and cybersecurity. This approach aims to satisfy Trump's demands while addressing logistical and technological needs highlighted by the war in Ukraine. NATO spending is expected to be a key focus at the upcoming summit in The Hague.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have completed a large-scale prisoner exchange, each returning 390 prisoners, including soldiers and civilians. The swap is part of a "1000-for-1000" exchange agreement reached during Russian-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul, with expectations for continued exchanges. While the prisoner exchange marks a positive step, it has not led to a ceasefire, as both sides remain entrenched in their demands. US President Donald Trump commented on the exchange, suggesting it could lead to something bigger.</p>

          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offer flexibility but carry risks, as they use your home as collateral. Experts advise using HELOCs to take advantage of falling rates, consolidate credit card debt, and tackle home repairs, but not for vacations or pools. HELOCs can also be considered for college costs or buying a new house, but careful planning is essential. It is important to ensure payments fit your budget and understand the variable interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs hit both right-leaning and leftist governments in Latin America equally, suggesting that Trump is more motivated by big deals and quick wins than ideological alignment. This approach challenges the notion of a coordinated global right-wing revolution.</p>
