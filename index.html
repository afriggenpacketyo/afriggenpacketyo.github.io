          <h2>Tesla Short Sellers Reap Substantial Profits Amid Stock Decline</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla short sellers have amassed $11.5 billion in profits in 2025 due to the company's significant stock decline. Tesla's shares have plummeted by 44% this year, driven by concerns over tariffs, competition, and the robotaxi market. The company is struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet's Waymo. The stock's poor performance has made it a lucrative target for short sellers, who bet against the company's success, while CEO Elon Musk faces criticism and protests related to his involvement in President Trump's administration.

          <p>The Trump administration has fired several immigration judges, exacerbating existing backlogs in immigration courts. This action aligns with the administration's dual goals of government downsizing and increased deportations. Critics argue that these firings undermine due process for migrants and non-citizens, as the courts already face vacancies and increasing pressure to expedite case reviews. The firings may hinder the administration's own goals of increasing deportations, as the remaining judges struggle to manage the growing caseload.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump issued an executive order targeting a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, which allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices. The order seeks to modify rules differentiating between small-molecule drugs and biologics, potentially extending the period before small-molecule drugs are subject to negotiation. This change could lead to increased Medicare spending and higher drug prices, as it would give drug companies additional years to set their own prices. While the order contains proposals favored by the pharmaceutical industry, it also includes elements they oppose, such as opening a pathway for more drug imports from Canada.</p>

          <p>The deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia has sparked debate, with the Trump administration claiming he is a dangerous MS-13 gang member and a terrorist, while others portray him as an innocent father. The administration mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, defying a court order, and has presented questionable evidence to support their claims. The core issue revolves around whether the administration can bypass due process and if it has to remedy its mistake in sending Abrego Garcia to a foreign prison. The case raises fundamental questions about government power and individual rights, irrespective of guilt or innocence.</p>

          <p>Gold prices experienced a pullback after reaching a record high, driven by optimism that trade tensions between the U.S. and China may ease. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's remarks about potential de-escalation contributed to the stock market rally and a decline in gold prices. Despite the pullback, gold remains a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty, and central banks continue to add to their gold reserves. Analysts suggest further upside potential for gold, citing ongoing investment demand and a volatile macro backdrop.</p>

An HHS spokesperson said the laboratory had already been set to be decommissioned before the staff cuts and that though proficiency testing would be paused during the transition to a new laboratory, dairy product testing would continue.
