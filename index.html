          <p>European Union leaders are struggling to adapt to the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump's second term, marked by geopolitical and trade instability. The EU faces uncertainty regarding trade, particularly with potential tariffs on EU exports, and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Despite temporary reprieves and ongoing negotiations, the EU anticipates continued fallout from trade disputes between the U.S. and other global partners. The situation is described as "very intense" and "disruptive" by EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, highlighting the challenges in managing the relationship with the new administration.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party has won Canada's federal election, capitalizing on anti-Trump sentiment and concerns about economic survival. Carney, a political newcomer, successfully portrayed himself as a leader capable of navigating the crisis posed by Trump's trade threats and comments undermining Canadian sovereignty. The Conservatives made gains but fell short, while the left-wing New Democrats collapsed. Divisions within Canada remain, particularly in oil-rich provinces, posing a challenge for Carney's leadership as he aims to govern for all Canadians and renegotiate the relationship with the US.</p>

          <p>Despite broader disapproval of President Trump's handling of the economy and tariffs, his 2024 voters remain largely confident in his leadership, though some express concerns about rising prices and stock market volatility. Many believe Trump will strengthen the economy in the long term, while acknowledging the potential for a short-term recession. These voters appreciate his border crackdown but have mixed feelings on LGBTQ issues and abortion. They are willing to pay more for goods made in the U.S. and support bringing back production, showcasing a continued faith in Trump's economic vision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's first 100 days of his second term have been characterized by an unprecedented use of executive orders and declarations of national emergencies, raising concerns about overreach. Experts argue that Trump is pushing the limits of presidential power, driven by a legal theory that grants him near-unquestioned control over the federal government. This has led to a dramatic purge of independent agencies, targeting of political opponents, and challenges to established legal principles like birthright citizenship. While facing pushback from the courts, Trump's actions have sparked debate about a potential constitutional crisis and the erosion of checks and balances.</p>

          <p>Conservative opposition leader Pierre Poilievre has lost his seat in the Canadian parliament, a significant blow as his party failed to defeat Mark Carney's Liberal Party. Poilievre faced challenges from local advocates seeking electoral reform and struggled to distance himself from President Trump's policies. Despite the Conservative party seeing a rise in their share of the national vote, Poilievre's personal defeat underscores the impact of Trump's trade war and threats against Canada. He had held his seat since 2005 and rose to power in 2022 as leader of the Conservative Party.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is attempting to circumvent immigration courts in an effort to expedite deportations, raising concerns about due process. Actions include removing protections from deportation, cancelling legal representation grants for children, and relocating individuals to prisons outside U.S. jurisdiction. Experts warn that weakening due process rights for immigrants could lead to similar erosion for lawful permanent residents and U.S. citizens. The administration's policies are being justified by claims of overburdened courts, but critics argue that due process is a fundamental right regardless of immigration status.</p>

However, some voters believe that Trump is attempting to make America competitive again by addressing trade imbalances and bringing jobs back to the U.S. This view contrasts with the predominantly negative portrayal in the liberal media.</p>

The Supreme Court's ruling defines a woman by biological sex under equalities law, leading to interim guidance that trans women should not be permitted to use women's facilities.

          <p>Japan and the Philippines are set to begin discussions on key security pacts, including an intelligence-sharing agreement and a bilateral acquisition and cross-servicing agreement, to bolster their security cooperation amid China's increasing maritime activities. The leaders are also expected to confirm joint coast guard drills and exchange views on the global economy in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Both countries, close U.S. allies, are concerned about the negative impact of the higher U.S. levies on their exports and the potential escalation of the U.S.-China trade war.</p>

          <p>Young voters in Australia, now outnumbering baby boomers, are poised to express their climate concerns at the ballot box, feeling forgotten by major parties. They are demanding a Climate Duty of Care Bill to protect young people from climate change harm, advocating for a rapid transition to renewable energy and a phaseout of fossil fuels. Despite the incumbent government's clean energy efforts, it has faced criticism for approving new coal and gas projects. This has led to a potential shift toward minor parties and independent candidates focused on climate action.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party secured a victory in the federal election, driven by a backlash against President Trump's territorial threats and tariff policies. The election saw a sharp political turnaround, with voters granting the Liberals a fourth term in power under Mark Carney's leadership. The campaign was dominated by concerns over Trump's threats to annex Canada and his economic policies, leading Canadians to prioritize unity and self-determination. Carney emphasized the need to stand up to Trump and build broader partnerships to strengthen Canada's economy.</p>

While mammograms are currently exclusively performed by female staff, the SoR believes that opening the role to men could alleviate staffing issues and expand the pool of qualified professionals. Patients would still have the option to choose a female radiographer if preferred. The proposal has sparked debate, with some expressing concerns about patient comfort and privacy.</p>

This move aims to tackle obesity by reducing sugar consumption, particularly among children.

More comprehensive talks in the second half of the year could lead to a further reduction to 34%, but tariffs are unlikely to revert to pre-January 2025 levels. While potential negotiations may provide some relief, the economic cycle's overall direction is expected to remain downward due to the damage already inflicted.</p>
