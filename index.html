          <h2>China's Export Surge to Southeast Asia Offsets US Trade Decline Amid Tariff Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a notable surge in April, primarily driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations, which effectively compensated for a significant decrease in exports to the United States due to the implementation of prohibitive tariffs. The article highlights that while overall exports rose by 8.1%, shipments to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%. This shift indicates a strategic realignment in China's trade partnerships amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., with countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand seeing substantial increases in Chinese imports, while experts anticipate a gradual weakening of trade data in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The Shuangjiangkou hydropower project in southwest China, poised to become the world's tallest dam upon completion, commenced water storage on May 1, marking a significant step towards its operational readiness. This Â¥36 billion (US$4.9 billion) project, located in Sichuan province, has been under construction for nearly a decade and is designed to serve the dual purpose of power generation and flood control. The dam, situated upstream of the Dadu River, will stand at an impressive 315 meters (1,033 feet) high, surpassing the current record holder, the Jinping-I dam, also in Sichuan. The initial phase of water storage has elevated the water level to 2,344 meters, approximately 80 meters above the original river level.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 19th International Architecture Exhibition in Venice addresses the escalating challenges posed by climate change, particularly the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme heat events. The article emphasizes the urgent need for architects and urban planners to develop strategies to make cities more resilient to rising temperatures, as urban areas are particularly vulnerable due to their sealed surfaces and lack of green spaces. Curator Carlo Ratti advocates for a collaborative approach, integrating diverse forms of intelligence and knowledge to rethink the built environment. Examples of climate adaptation, such as Frankfurt's redesigned Paul-Arnsberg-Platz and Paris's transportation revolution, are highlighted, alongside calls for a global "construction revolution" to create more habitable and sustainable urban environments.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to impose sanctions on Russia's "shadow fleet," a network of oil tankers used to circumvent existing restrictions on oil and gas exports, according to this article. This action targets up to 100 vessels that have transported over Â£18 billion worth of cargo since the beginning of 2024. The UK government aims to disrupt President Vladimir Putin's financial resources by targeting this fleet, which it deems "decrepit and dangerous." The sanctioned tankers will be prohibited from accessing British ports and risk detention in UK waters, as part of broader efforts to support Ukraine and increase pressure on Moscow.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Randy Travis is using artificial intelligence to create new music, following a stroke in 2013 that left him with aphasia. With the help of AI and country musician James DuprÃ©, Travis has released two new songs, "Where That Came From" and "Horses in Heaven," and has extended his "More Life Tour" through fall 2025. His wife, Mary Travis, explains that the AI process involves using raw vocals from Randy's past recordings and overlaying them with a vocal line provided by DuprÃ©, which are then tweaked to match Randy's tone and inflections, noting that AI has been "wonderful" for her husband.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% drop following a first-quarter earnings miss. Despite a 28% year-over-year increase in revenue to $2.24 billion and a 162% surge in profit to $188 million, these figures fell short of analysts' expectations due to "production fluctuations" that lowered average selling prices. The company anticipates a sequential revenue decline of 4% to 6% in the current quarter, with gross margin also expected to decrease. However, SMIC's wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter, driven by geopolitical changes and government policies.</p>

          <p>Despite President Donald Trump's tariffs on imported aluminum, the U.S. aluminum sector is failing to revive due to soaring electricity prices. The article explains that while tariffs have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, they haven't spurred domestic production. Companies like Hydro cite the lack of competitively priced, long-term power as a major barrier, with U.S. smelters facing significantly higher energy costs compared to competitors in Canada and the Middle East. Rising demand for electricity from the tech sector further exacerbates the issue, making it difficult for aluminum producers to compete.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece discusses the United States' renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, driven by strategic and geopolitical considerations. The author highlights Greenland's geographic importance, particularly its proximity to Russia and its potential role in missile defense. With the Arctic warming and Russia expanding its presence in the region, the U.S. is seeking to assert its interests in Greenland, although this has caused tensions with Denmark and other NATO allies. The author suggests a "Compact of Free Association" model, similar to agreements with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, as a potential solution to balance U.S. interests with international concerns.</p>

This comes after clashes between pro-Palestinian protesters and campus security, resulting in numerous arrests.

          <p>Europe's wind energy industry is reassessing its approach to the U.S. market due to the Trump administration's policies, which are causing uncertainty and project delays. The article reports that the indefinite halt to construction of the Empire Wind farm off Long Island has shocked the industry. With the U.S. market in question, European wind developers are relying on Europe to compensate for any pullback in the United States, but challenges remain, including rising costs and regulatory hurdles. Some analysts think that, given the current administration's policies, industry executives assume no new offshore projects will start up under the Trump administration.</p>

According to the article, the administration plans to welcome the first group of Afrikaners at Washington Dulles International Airport. This move has drawn criticism from refugee advocates, who point out the disparity in treatment compared to other refugees facing war and persecution. The decision aligns with President Trump's claims of racial persecution against Afrikaners in South Africa and his broader efforts to reshape the U.S. refugee program.</p>

However, the 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports will remain in place, although the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate.
