          <p>This opinion piece argues that the world is facing a renewed and accelerated nuclear arms race, exacerbated by Russia's withdrawal from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty and the impending lapse of the New Start treaty. The author highlights escalating rhetoric between U.S. and Russian leaders and the buildup of nuclear-capable weapons in Europe, drawing parallels to the Cold War but suggesting the current situation is more dangerous. The article laments the public's apparent complacency and calls for a revival of anti-nuclear opposition to halt what is described as a "march towards extinction," noting that global spending on nuclear weapons has surged dramatically.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in a Baltimore neighborhood on Saturday night left six people injured, including a five-year-old girl who was struck in the hand.

          <p>This article explores the significant barriers female refugees face in entering the German workforce, where they experience a "threefold disadvantage" as women, immigrants, and refugees. Many arrive with children and lack childcare, or possess qualifications that are difficult to get recognized in Germany's highly regulated system. The report highlights several nonprofit and government-funded projects designed to help, such as "Work for Refugees," which provides counseling and job placement. It shares stories of women from Afghanistan and Syria, illustrating how mentorship and tailored support networks are crucial for achieving economic integration.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a planned meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, key European allies have issued a joint statement insisting that any peace negotiations must directly involve Ukraine. Leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and others emphasized that Ukraine's borders should not be altered by force and that Kyiv must have control over its own destiny. The statement reflects growing concern in Europe that Ukraine could be excluded from decisions critical to its sovereignty and security. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed these sentiments, stating that any agreements reached without his country's participation would be "dead decisions."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell demonstrated a return to his Cy Young award-winning form, striking out ten batters over five scoreless innings in a 9-1 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays. This strong performance, his second since returning from a four-month injury recovery, signals that the Dodgers' formidable starting rotation is becoming fully healthy. The offense provided ample support, with Shohei Ohtani hitting his 40th home run of the season and Max Muncy also contributing a two-run homer. The win highlights the team's strengthening pitching depth as they head towards the postseason.</p>

          <p>A new six-part documentary, "Zuo Zongtang Recovers Xinjiang," has been released in China, aiming to reinforce the state's official historical narrative regarding the region. Produced by Hunan province's broadcaster, the series focuses on a 19th-century Qing dynasty general who suppressed a separatist state in Xinjiang. The documentary is part of a broader effort by Beijing to counter Western perspectives and promote a unified "Chinese nation" identity, particularly concerning its borderlands. It portrays the historical separatist movement as a foreign-backed entity led by a jihadist, a narrative that aligns with contemporary state messaging.</p>

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, once a booming market, is now facing a significant slowdown due to a combination of economic pressures. Factors contributing to the downturn include post-pandemic inflation, shifting consumer habits, particularly among younger generations who are drinking less, and the looming threat of retaliatory tariffs from the EU and Canada. This has led to slowing sales for major brands like Bulleit and Wild Turkey and even bankruptcies for smaller distilleries. The article notes that the industry may have become a victim of its own success, as overproduction has led to an excess supply. (not investment advice)</p>
