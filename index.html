          <p>Deckers Brands, the parent company of Hoka and Ugg, saw its stock plummet over 12% following a downward revision of its sales forecast for fiscal year 2026. The company cited concerns that U.S. tariffs are negatively impacting consumer demand, leading to slower growth projections for its two most popular brands. This adjustment has raised investor concerns about the potential loss of momentum after years of strong performance, despite executives expressing confidence in the long-term strength of the brands. The company's full-year revenue guidance also fell short of Wall Street expectations, adding to the market's apprehension. (not investment advice)</p>

He was supposed to be transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation proceedings following his sentence. The Prison Service has initiated an urgent investigation into the erroneous release, and a prison officer has been suspended from discharge duties pending the outcome of the inquiry.</p>

          <p>A health startup named 'Spotitearly' is using the powerful sense of smell of beagles to develop a non-invasive cancer screening test. Patients breathe into a surgical mask for a few minutes and mail it to a lab, where a pack of trained beagles sniffs the sample for signs of breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer. The company reports a 94% accuracy rate in clinical trials and aims to increase early detection, which can significantly improve survival rates. The dogs' behavior is monitored and analyzed by artificial intelligence to enhance the system's accuracy over time.</p>

          <p>Actor Isabelle Tate, known for a recent role in "9-1-1: Nashville," passed away at the age of 23 due to complications from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). Her talent agency confirmed the cause of death, stating she had a rare form of the inherited neurological condition. CMT causes nerve damage that leads to weaker muscles and can affect mobility, sensation, and, in rare cases, breathing. While not typically fatal, the disease can lead to serious complications. Tate had previously shared her experience with a progressive neuromuscular disease diagnosed in her teens.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to demolish the White House East Wing for a new ballroom is drawing criticism for erasing a significant part of American history, particularly the legacy of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Roosevelt transformed the space into a hub for her activism, holding her first press conference there exclusively for female reporters and establishing the modern office of the first lady. Historians argue that the demolition disregards the wing's historical importance as a center for the substantive work of numerous first ladies. The space evolved from a place for social functions into a symbol of the first lady's expanding public role.</p>

When questioned about reports of Treasury discussions on raising tax rates, Reeves stated she would support working people by keeping taxes "as low as possible" but did not deny the possibility. This cautious language contrasts with a previous firm commitment not to raise income tax, National Insurance, or VAT. The government is facing a significant fiscal shortfall, and economists suggest tax increases may be necessary to balance the budget.</p>

Failure to take these newly required annual withdrawals could result in a significant IRS penalty of up to 25% of the amount that should have been withdrawn.

          <p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) increased by over 6% after a report revealed that its chips can be utilized by IBM for certain quantum computing algorithms. A forthcoming paper will detail how IBM successfully ran a quantum error-correction algorithm on AMD's field-programmable gate array chips. This development stems from a partnership announced by the two companies in August to advance quantum computing capabilities. The news has sparked renewed investor interest in the quantum computing sector, boosting the stocks of other related companies as major tech firms race to develop the technology.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended all trade negotiations with Canada, a move prompted by an ad campaign from the province of Ontario that used a 1987 speech by former President Ronald Reagan to criticize trade tariffs. President Trump called the ad "fraudulent" and an interference, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the suspension of talks. The breakdown occurs at a critical time, with an upcoming review of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement and a U.S. Supreme Court case challenging the president's authority to impose such tariffs. The dispute further strains the trade relationship between the two closely linked economies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice announced it will deploy monitors to polling sites in five California counties—Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside—during the upcoming vote on Proposition 50. The measure proposes redrawing the state's congressional districts, a move seen as crucial for Democrats' hopes of regaining control of the U.S. House. The monitoring, requested by state Republican officials citing reports of past irregularities, aims to ensure compliance with federal voting laws. While federal monitoring is a routine practice, it has faced increased scrutiny from both political parties in recent years.</p>

Lola's body was found in a storage box in her apartment building's courtyard. The case has been highlighted by right-wing politicians as Benkired, an Algerian immigrant, was under an order to leave France at the time of the crime.</p>

This move is part of a broader crackdown on press freedom in the country, where journalists are frequently detained and accused of promoting terrorism or false information. Media rights groups have condemned the suspension as an act of censorship and intimidation, highlighting a reversal of the media reforms initially promised by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.

          <p>A Ukrainian drone attack has forced the shutdown of a primary crude distillation unit at Russia's fourth-largest oil refinery, located in Ryazan. The targeted unit processes approximately 80,000 barrels per day, and its stoppage has significantly reduced the facility's output. This strike is part of Ukraine's ongoing strategy to target Russia's energy infrastructure, which fuels its war efforts and generates critical export revenue. While the direct impact on global supply is limited, such attacks increase the risk premium on oil prices and could pressure Russia's domestic fuel availability.</p>

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also came in cooler than anticipated, with a 0.2% monthly increase.
