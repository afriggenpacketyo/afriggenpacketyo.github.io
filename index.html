          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 00:10:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has announced that a key federal grant program for fentanyl overdose prevention will be funded in increments, rather than as a single annual payment. This decision comes after NPR reported on a roughly $140 million shortfall and growing concerns among CDC staffers about funding delays. While the administration insists the program is not threatened, public health officials express concern that the uncertainty and lack of a clear timeline could trigger layoffs and disrupt essential services. State health departments, like Vermont's, have already paused spending due to the ambiguity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a congressional push to fund equipment upgrades for the nation's air traffic control system, many controllers argue that it fails to address more pressing issues. They cite critical staffing shortages, grueling six-day workweeks, and stagnant pay as primary causes of plummeting morale. While the FAA and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have vowed to "supercharge" hiring, controllers remain skeptical that these efforts will provide near-term relief. The deep-seated problems, rooted in decades of understaffing, continue to strain the workforce responsible for the safety of U.S. air travel.</p>

          <p>China has officially launched the Sichuan, its first Type 076 amphibious assault ship, marking a significant advancement in its naval capabilities. The flat-top vessel is designed to serve as a fleet command center and is uniquely equipped to launch fixed-wing drones and fighter jets, enhancing sea-to-land assault operations. First spotted in 2023, the warship is currently undergoing equipment tests and sea trials. The People's Liberation Army is expected to formally commission the vessel by the end of 2026.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent layoff of over 1,300 domestic State Department staffers has caused significant confusion and disruption, according to multiple sources. The cuts, described as chaotic and poorly executed, unexpectedly gutted critical offices, including the entire Office of Casualty Assistance and staff working on passport fraud. Current and former officials warn that these reductions, which also hit the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, pose meaningful risks to U.S. national security and diplomatic readiness. The administration maintains the reorganization was necessary to create a more efficient and focused department.</p>

          <p>A massive reforestation project in China, known as the "green great wall," is being linked by scientists to a significant increase in hay fever cases. The project, designed to combat desertification, heavily utilizes plants from the Artemisia family. Researchers have now confirmed that pollen from these plants contains several allergenic substances that can trigger severe allergic reactions, including asthma. This unintended consequence highlights a conflict between a major environmental success and public health in northern China.</p>

          <p>A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging an unlawful, coordinated effort to arrest people at their own immigration court hearings. The lawsuit asserts that this practice turns the courts into a trap, violating due process rights and deterring immigrants from complying with their legal obligations. The plaintiffs, many of whom were seeking asylum, argue that the policy weaponizes the courts and inflicts irreparable harm on families seeking refuge in the U.S.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sharply criticized the Trump administration for deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles for immigration enforcement, calling it a waste of money designed to terrorize communities. His comments came after the Pentagon ordered the withdrawal of half the troops, a move Newsom attributed to the administration realizing the absurdity of the deployment. The governor accused the president of pursuing a "rule of cruelty" and further escalated the political conflict between California and the federal government.</p>

The bill establishes a new program that allows veterans who have fallen behind on their mortgages to move the missed payments to the back of their loan term.
