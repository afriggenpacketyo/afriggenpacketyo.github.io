          <p>The UK's largest road tunnel project, the Lower Thames Crossing, has been awarded £590m by the government as part of a £1bn package to improve transport infrastructure across England. The project, estimated to cost £10bn, aims to link Tilbury in Essex and Gravesend in Kent, with plans approved in March after a 16-year process. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the crossing would facilitate smoother passage of goods from Europe, with construction expected to begin in 2026 and completion by 2032. The government intends to seek private finance for the project, which National Highways hopes will reduce traffic at the Dartford Crossing by 20%.</p>

          <p>Five Southern California crime fiction authors share their latest novels and the writers who inspire them, offering a range of compelling reads for the summer. Julie Clark's "The Ghostwriter" explores family trauma and unsolved crimes in Ojai, inspired by Jodi Picoult and Tana French. Kristen L. Berry's debut, "We Don't Talk About Carol," delves into buried secrets and missing Black women, drawing inspiration from Brit Bennett. Ivy Pochoda's "Ecstasy" reimagines a Greek tragedy with themes of female empowerment, influenced by Denis Johnson. Jennifer Givhan's "Salt Bones" blends family history, environmental justice, and mystery, inspired by Toni Morrison. Paul Bradley Carr's "The Confessions" is a technothriller exploring the potential dangers of AI, reminiscent of Michael Crichton.</p>

          <p>The immigrant protests in Los Angeles are reverberating in Mexico, influencing politics ahead of a meeting between Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and President Trump. Sheinbaum is facing accusations of encouraging violent protests, fueled by news coverage sympathetic to immigrants and critical of U.S. actions. The use of Mexican flags at the protests and Sheinbaum's calls to "mobilize" against a U.S. tax on remittances have added to the controversy. Sheinbaum is attempting to balance defending immigrants' rights with avoiding heightened tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is weighing the unprecedented step of appointing a receiver to oversee Los Angeles city's homelessness programs, following allegations that the city has breached settlement agreements. The LA Alliance for Human Rights argues that the city has failed to provide promised housing solutions and remove encampments, while the city contends that it is meeting its obligations. Testimony focused on definitions within the settlement agreement and the city's data collection practices. The judge's decision could significantly impact the city's control over its homelessness response efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is actively employing prescribed burns to reduce wildfire risk by deliberately setting fire to wilderness areas to clear unwanted vegetation. This ancient practice, essential for managing fuel loads, is facing challenges due to federal agency budget cuts and regulatory hurdles. State officials worry that staffing reductions at federal agencies, including the U.S. Forest Service, will hinder efforts to conduct prescribed burns safely and effectively. The state is adding funds to its forest management budget to compensate for federal cuts, but experts emphasize the need for greater investment in this crucial fire prevention strategy.</p>

Experts caution against assisted stretching for existing injuries without medical clearance, and individuals with hypermobility syndromes should exercise caution.</p>

          <p>The aftermath of mass shootings often leads to a cycle of violence and suicide among survivors, highlighting the need for innovative tools to protect vulnerable individuals. "Donna's Law," or the "Voluntary Do-Not-Sell List," allows individuals to voluntarily suspend their ability to purchase a gun, providing a safeguard against impulsive acts of self-harm. This law, available in a limited number of states, offers a way for people to protect themselves during moments of crisis.

          <p>Experts predict that up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be exported to England daily after a landfill ban takes effect at the end of the year. The Scottish government is implementing the ban on biodegradable municipal waste, but acknowledges a lack of incinerator capacity to handle the extra demand. While the ban aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from landfills, the short-term impact will be increased emissions from transporting waste to England.

DOGE's focus is now on embedding its principles within agencies and implementing cost-cutting measures. Many DOGE staffers have transitioned to permanent government positions, and agencies are embracing DOGE-inspired initiatives. Despite criticisms and legal challenges, the Trump administration views DOGE's work as central to its vision of a more efficient federal bureaucracy.</p>

Farmers are seeking changes to visa programs to address labor shortages, while concerns rise about potential disruptions to the food supply chain. The administration's mixed messages and conflicting policies have created anxiety within the agricultural sector.</p>
