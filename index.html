          <p>The United States and Ukraine have officially signed an agreement to establish the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, granting the U.S. access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the agreement as a signal to Russia of the Trump Administration's commitment to a peaceful and prosperous Ukraine. The partnership aims to attract global investment, mobilize American talent, and improve Ukraine's investment climate to accelerate its economic recovery. The signing faced minor delays due to disagreements over the simultaneous signing of the mineral resources agreement and the investment fund document, highlighting the complexities of international collaborations.</p>

          <p>This article uses radio transmissions from American pilots during the Fall of Saigon in 1975 to illustrate the chaotic helicopter evacuation of Americans and Vietnamese. The transmissions reveal the challenges faced by pilots, including heavy loads, enemy fire, and dwindling fuel. One pilot, Gerry Berry, recalls his experience landing on the embassy roof and delivering a message to Ambassador Graham Martin to evacuate. The article also highlights the perspective of the Marines who guarded the embassy, who feared they would be left behind as North Vietnamese tanks approached. Berry flew the ambassador to one of the ships offshore, only to find that the war was not over and he had to return to get the Marines.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's shares experienced a significant jump after the company announced better-than-expected quarterly results, driven by the strong performance of its Azure cloud business and a surprisingly robust forecast. Revenue increased 13% year-over-year, with Azure revenue growing 33%, partially attributed to AI. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the company's plans to invest heavily in AI infrastructure, which requires significant overseas imports. The company sees 34% to 35% in Azure growth at constant currency. Management reiterated that capital expenditures will grow in the new fiscal year, though at a slower rate than the current 2025 fiscal year.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal party secured a victory in Canada's recent election, but the results highlight a divided nation, particularly along generational lines. While older voters supported the Liberals, younger voters, concerned about housing affordability and cost of living, flocked to the Conservatives. The Liberals gained 169 seats, three shy of a majority, and captured 43% of the popular vote while the Conservatives won 144 seats - 25 more than the previous 2021 election - and 41% of the popular vote. Carney now faces the challenge of bridging this divide and regaining the confidence of younger voters who feel let down by the current system.</p>

          <p>Meta's Reality Labs, the division responsible for virtual reality headsets and augmented reality glasses, reported an operating loss of $4.2 billion in the first quarter, despite sales of $412 million.

Reality Labs has accumulated losses of over $60 billion since late 2020. These losses underscore the significant financial commitment required to realize Zuckerberg's vision for the metaverse, even as the company continues to invest heavily in AI.</p>

First-quarter sales increased 16% year-over-year, with net income jumping 35%. However, the company cautioned about reduced ad spending from Asia e-commerce exporters and potential impacts from a recent European Commission decision. The increase in expected infrastructure hardware is the result of "suppliers who source from countries around the world." The company also warned that a recent decision by the European Commission could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and cause "a significant impact" to Meta's European business and revenue as soon as the third quarter.</p>

          <p>Florida is on the verge of banning fluoride from its public drinking water supplies, pending the governor's signature on a newly passed bill. The legislation, part of a broader farm bill, would prohibit municipalities from adding "water quality additives" to the water supply. Governor DeSantis has previously expressed concerns about water fluoridation, referring to it as "forced medication". This action follows recommendations from the state Surgeon General who described water fluoridation as "public health malpractice". The use of fluoride in water has been a long-standing public health practice aimed at preventing tooth decay.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority appeared inclined to allow the creation of the nation's first religious charter school funded directly by taxpayer dollars. The justices heard arguments in a case from Oklahoma, where the state Supreme Court blocked the Catholic Church from receiving a charter school contract. The debate centered on the First Amendment's religion clauses, with liberal justices expressing concern about using taxpayer funds to advance a specific ideology, while conservatives viewed charter schools as contractors for a public service. A ruling in favor of the school could have significant implications for charter schools nationwide.</p>

Smartmatic, however, contends that Fox News' conduct has cost the company jobs and billions in asset value. The case centers on Fox News' amplification of Trump's erroneous claims about rigged voting machines during the 2020 election.

Economists also dismiss the idea that a president has significant control over egg prices.

          <p>Jack Black's "Steve's Lava Chicken" from "A Minecraft Movie" has become the shortest song ever to chart on Billboard's Hot 100. The 34-second tune, featuring lyrics about crispy and spicy chicken, edged out previous record holders. The song's success may be related to the "chicken jockey" trend in theaters. There is also a minute-plus extended lava chicken dance remix floating around too, complete with vocals from Jason Momoa’s Garrett.</p>

          <p>Director Darren Aronofsky revealed that Bad Bunny's presence on the set of "Caught Stealing" caused chaos due to fans flocking to filming locations. Aronofsky described Bad Bunny as a down-to-earth and talented actor, but his popularity made it difficult to manage crowds and ensure a smooth filming process. Elaborate measures were taken to transport the musician to and from the set discreetly. Bad Bunny will also appear in "Happy Gilmore 2" this summer.</p>

          <p>In the first 100 days of Trump's term, Congress has largely acquiesced to his executive actions, enacting few laws and showing limited resistance. While some members express concern about potential retaliation for dissent, GOP leaders generally support the president's actions. Congressional scholars note a long-term trend of Congress ceding authority to the executive branch. Challenges lie ahead as lawmakers must approve spending bills and address the potential consequences of ignoring parliamentary procedures. The article discusses the implications of this dynamic for the balance of power within the government.</p>

The European Commission believes that Meta's consent-or-pay model does not allow users to freely consent to how their data is used. Analyst Eric Seufert suggests Meta may be trying to turn European users against the regulatory regime. Meta is also defending itself in a US antitrust case.</p>

The drug may have other effects, he said, including that it might reduce inflammation in the liver. The study, sponsored by Novo Nordisk, involved adults with moderate to advanced liver scarring.
