          <h2>Coca-Cola to Introduce Cane Sugar Version of Classic Soda in the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 08:49:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coca-Cola has announced it will launch a version of its classic soda sweetened with cane sugar in the United States this fall. This move addresses a long-standing consumer preference for "Mexican Coke," which uses cane sugar instead of the high-fructose corn syrup found in the American version since the 1980s. The announcement followed public comments by President Donald Trump advocating for the change, although research indicates cane sugar is not a healthier alternative to corn syrup. This new product is part of Coke's strategy to offer more choices, even as it promotes its Zero Sugar line.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has reshuffled her senior team, appointing former Foreign and Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary. This move places him in direct opposition to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The shake-up includes several other changes, such as Kevin Hollinrake becoming the new party chairman and Stuart Andrew moving to the health brief. The reshuffle is described as reflecting the next stage of the party's policy renewal as it struggles in the polls eight months into Badenoch's leadership.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 08:47:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK food prices have risen by 5.2% in the last month, putting the average household on track for a £275 annual increase in grocery spending. According to market research firm Worldpanel, this surge is forcing consumers to alter their shopping habits, such as buying cheaper own-brand products and preparing simpler meals. The price hikes, most notable in items like chocolate, butter, and fresh meat, contribute to the UK's overall inflation rate, which reached 3.6%. About one-fifth of households are reportedly struggling significantly with their grocery bills. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Influential media personality Tucker Carlson is creating a rift within the MAGA movement by persistently questioning the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. While President Trump has dismissed the issue, Carlson has criticized the government's refusal to provide more information, comparing it to the dismissiveness of the liberal establishment. Speaking at a Turning Point USA event, Carlson argued that the administration's response alienates its base, which is deeply invested in the controversy. This stance highlights a broader ideological split, with Carlson also critiquing the administration on foreign policy and economic issues affecting average Americans.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its decision to withdraw the United States from UNESCO, the UN's cultural and education agency, effective December 2026. The State Department cited the organization's promotion of "divisive social and cultural causes" and a "globalist, ideological agenda" as reasons for the departure. This marks the third time the U.S. has left the Paris-based agency, having previously withdrawn under Ronald Reagan in 1983 and again under Trump in 2017, before rejoining under Joe Biden in 2023. The move is part of a broader "America First" strategy to exit various international bodies.</p>

          <p>Recent corporate earnings reports reveal the substantial negative impact of President Trump's tariffs on European auto manufacturers.

Similarly, Sweden's Volvo Cars reported a steep decline in its second-quarter operating profit, prompting plans to shift some production to its U.S. plant. While some companies like Renault are less directly affected, the tariffs have broadly pressured the European automotive sector, which is heavily reliant on global supply chains.

Phillips offered to provide personal information about the UK's former defense secretary, Sir Grant Shapps, to individuals he believed were Russian agents but were actually undercover British intelligence officers. The court heard that Phillips, who his ex-wife said was "infatuated" with being a spy, applied for a job with UK Border Force as part of his plan.

          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance, current mortgage rates remain a significant factor, though there are strategies to secure a good rate. As of July 21, 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.75%, while a 15-year loan averages 5.95%. To obtain the best possible rates, experts advise strengthening one's credit profile, aiming for a score in the mid-to-high 700s, and shopping around to compare different lenders. While rates are higher than a few years ago, there is some optimism that they may stabilize if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates, affirming its full-year guidance despite a $1.1 billion impact from President Donald Trump's auto tariffs. CEO Mary Barra stated the company is adapting to new trade policies and working to "greatly reduce" its tariff exposure through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives. The automaker's adjusted earnings were $2.53 per share on revenue of $47.12 billion, though net income was down 35.4% from a year earlier. The company is also navigating uncertainty around the future of EV tax credits, which are set to expire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Public Health Experts Fear Trump Administration's CDC Funding Cuts Could Undermine Overdose Prevention</h2>

          <p>Health officials are warning that reported funding cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by the Trump administration could severely hamper efforts to combat the nation's overdose crisis. The Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) program, which funds crucial surveillance and prevention strategies, faces a potential reduction of up to $140 million. Experts emphasize that this funding is vital for tracking the drug supply, understanding the crisis, and implementing life-saving interventions. They argue that reducing this support would be a significant "step backwards," especially after overdose deaths began to decline for the first time in 2023.</p>

          <p>China's Jiangsu province is narrowing the economic gap with Guangdong, threatening its long-held status as the country's top provincial economy. In the first half of 2025, Jiangsu's GDP reached 97.44% of Guangdong's, the closest margin in years. Analysts attribute Jiangsu's resilience to its diversified industrial structure, lower dependence on real estate, and smaller reliance on exports compared to Guangdong. In contrast, Guangdong, a traditional export powerhouse, has seen its export growth slow dramatically, contributing to the narrowing gap between the two economic giants.</p>

The incident has renewed urgent calls to relocate military airbases away from densely populated urban areas.

In other news, Israeli ground troops have entered central Gaza for the first time in the 21-month war, ordering evacuations in an area that houses many aid organizations.

The lawsuit alleges that these establishments market imported, frozen shrimp as "local" and "wild-caught," which harms the livelihood of local shrimpers and misleads customers. An investigation cited in the complaint found that 90% of tested restaurants were selling imported shrimp under false pretenses. The shrimpers argue this "shrimp fraud" damages the state's valuable seafood brand and undermines a key component of its tourism industry.</p>

The government, which confirmed it is taking a 44.9% stake in the project, stated the new figure accounts for inflation and risk. The construction will be partly funded by a levy adding approximately £1 per month to household energy bills for at least a decade. While officials claim the plant will ultimately lower energy bills and create thousands of jobs, critics have condemned the soaring costs and the financial risk to taxpayers.
