          <h2>American Confidence in Finding New Employment Reaches Record Low</h2>

          <p>A recent survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that Americans' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to its lowest point since data collection began in 2013. This decline in optimism is coupled with increasing anxiety about potential job losses and a broader pessimistic view of the national economy. The data reflects a cooling labor market, where employers are retaining current staff but are hesitant to create new positions, shifting negotiating power back towards companies.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced his resignation after less than a year in office, following two significant election losses for his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). His departure triggers another leadership contest, the nation's third in four years, as the LDP grapples with declining public support amid a corruption scandal and economic pressures. The next leader will face the daunting tasks of uniting a weakened party, managing rising inflation, and navigating complex international relations.</p>

          <p>Following a controversial renovation that replaced its historic lawn with a concrete patio, the White House Rose Garden's outdoor area has been rebranded as "The Rose Garden Club at the White House." The new name and Mar-a-Lago-inspired decor, featuring yellow-and-white striped umbrellas, were revealed during a private dinner for President Trump's allies. The changes have drawn criticism for imposing a private, exclusive atmosphere on a space traditionally known as part of "The People's House."</p>

          <h2>Rivian Lays Off Approximately 200 Employees as EV Tax Credits Are Set to Expire</h2>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian has laid off around 200 employees, equivalent to about 1.5% of its staff, as the automotive industry braces for the end of federal EV tax credits. The company is preparing for a challenging market and plans to launch its more affordable R2 SUV model next year to compete in a less incentivized environment. This move reflects a broader trend, with other automakers also slowing production and reducing staff in anticipation of decreased consumer demand.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized updated COVID-19 vaccines for the fall season, targeting adults aged 65 and older and younger individuals with specific medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness. While health officials have stated that anyone can receive a vaccine after consulting with their doctor, the narrower formal approval may create access challenges. This is particularly true at pharmacies, which may be constrained from administering the shots "off-label" to people outside the approved categories.</p>

          <h2>Upcoming Jobs Report Revision May Show Weaker Labor Market Than Previously Reported</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 16:38:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release a preliminary benchmark revision that economists anticipate will show significantly weaker job growth than initially reported. The revision, covering the 12 months through March 2025, could reduce the number of jobs added by as many as 800,000, suggesting the labor market slowdown began earlier than thought. This potential major downward adjustment comes amid a recent stall in hiring and could heavily influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>
