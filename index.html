          <p>Republican efforts to pass President Trump's major domestic policy bill before the July 4th holiday are facing significant challenges in the Senate. The timeline appears increasingly uncertain as the president himself has sent mixed signals about the deadline's firmness. Key GOP provisions, including those on immigration and provider taxes, have been struck down by the Senate parliamentarian for violating budget reconciliation rules. This has forced lawmakers to rework the legislation, while House Republicans are also drawing red lines on issues like state and local tax deductions, further complicating the path to a final agreement between the two chambers.</p>

          <p>The families of the 67 people who died in a January collision between an American Airlines flight and an Army Black Hawk helicopter are urging Congress to increase funding for air traffic control reform. While a pending domestic policy bill allocates $12.5 billion to modernize the system, advocates and experts say this is only a fraction of the more than $30 billion needed for a complete overhaul. The victims' relatives are pushing for more immediate action, including an independent safety review of the crowded airspace near Washington, D.C., to prevent future tragedies and ensure the nation's skies are safer for everyone.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 to limit the authority of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block presidential policies, a decision celebrated by the Trump administration as a major victory. The case stemmed from legal challenges to President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, though the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, argued that lower courts generally lack the power to provide such broad relief. Critics, including Senate Democrats, condemned the decision as a dangerous move toward authoritarianism that weakens judicial checks on executive power.</p>

          <p>Recent studies indicate that artificial intelligence is disproportionately threatening the job prospects of new university graduates, whose entry-level roles often involve routine data analysis tasks that AI can now perform more efficiently. Unemployment among recent U.S. graduates has risen more sharply than for the general population, and a majority of executives believe AI will eliminate many first-time jobs. Nobel-winning economist Daron Acemoglu advises young people to counter this trend by developing highly specific skills and maintaining flexibility to adapt as technology evolves. The article suggests that educational institutions must urgently teach students to use AI as a sophisticated tool to remain competitive.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has emerged as the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, with its value surging 44% in its best month since November. The rally is attributed to its recent inclusion in the benchmark index, positive regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts suggest the stock may have further room to grow, citing the market's underestimation of its lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with the newly public and soaring company, Circle. Despite concerns about declining trading volumes, the overall sentiment is optimistic as institutional investors increasingly view crypto as an evolving utility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bison tragically died after stumbling and falling into the Grand Prismatic Spring at Yellowstone National Park, an event witnessed by tourists. According to onlookers, the animal appeared to misstep at the spring's edge and was unable to escape the nearly boiling water. A U.S. Geological Survey scientist explained that such incidents, while rare to witness, are not unheard of, as the ground near thermal features can be a thin, unstable crust. The event serves as a stark reminder for millions of annual visitors to adhere to park safety rules by staying on boardwalks and maintaining a safe distance from both wildlife and geothermal areas.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision has significantly curtailed the use of universal injunctions, which are court orders from a single judge that can block a government policy nationwide. These injunctions had been frequently used to halt Trump administration executive orders. The ruling states that such broad orders likely exceed the authority Congress has granted to federal courts. Legal experts predict this will fundamentally change how legal challenges against the executive branch are pursued, shifting the focus from seeking universal injunctions to other strategies like certifying large class-action lawsuits to achieve widespread relief against a federal policy.</p>

Newsom's lawyers stated they would dismiss the suit if the network retracts the claim and issues a formal on-air apology.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns that new tariffs would fuel inflation, U.S. consumer prices have remained relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to build inventory before the tariffs took effect, a practice known as "front-loading." Additionally, some businesses are temporarily absorbing the higher costs to avoid losing customers, while others are using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, experts caution that this situation is likely temporary, and consumers may begin to see higher prices in the latter half of the year if the tariffs remain in place.

          <h2>Analysis Shows Significant Medicaid Cuts Remain in GOP Bill Despite Some Provisions Being Blocked</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Although the Senate parliamentarian rejected certain Republican proposals to cut Medicaid, such as capping state provider taxes, other deeply impactful changes remain in the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act.' Policy experts warn that the bill still contains provisions that could significantly reduce access to coverage, including new work requirements of 80 hours per month and more frequent eligibility evaluations. The House version of the bill was estimated to reduce federal Medicaid spending by nearly $800 billion. Critics argue that the remaining cuts are "deeply harmful" and could lead to millions of people losing their health coverage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners looking to tap into their record-high equity, choosing between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) presents a key decision this summer. Currently, interest rates for both products are nearly identical, but that could change. A HELOC's variable rate could become cheaper if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as some predict, positioning borrowers to benefit from lower payments. Conversely, a fixed-rate home equity loan offers stability, locking in a predictable rate now and protecting against potential market volatility, making the choice dependent on a homeowner's risk tolerance and economic outlook.

          <p>A federal judge has officially delayed the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man mistakenly deported and later returned to the U.S. to face smuggling charges. The decision came after his lawyers requested he remain in custody, citing "directly contradictory statements" from the Justice Department about whether he would be immediately taken by ICE and deported upon release. His attorneys argued they could not trust the government's representations on the matter. This ruling keeps Abrego Garcia detained pending further court orders, adding another layer of uncertainty to his complex legal battle.</p>

          <p>British sportscar manufacturer Lotus is reportedly considering ending production at its historic UK headquarters and establishing a new plant in the United States. Such a move would place 1,300 jobs at risk in Hethel, Norfolk. While the company has not commented officially, sources indicate the review is prompted by market disruptions, particularly the 25% tariff imposed by the U.S. on imported cars. America is a crucial market for Lotus, and the tariffs threaten the viability of its UK-based production, forcing the Geely-owned brand to evaluate its global manufacturing strategy.</p>

          <p>The Formula 1 driver market is buzzing with speculation about a potential move for four-time champion Max Verstappen from Red Bull to Mercedes for the next season. The rumors were fueled by comments from current Mercedes driver George Russell, who is also out of contract and acknowledged that talks with drivers like Verstappen are ongoing. While a Red Bull spokesperson insists Verstappen's contract runs to 2028, factors like Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes' perceived strength with upcoming 2026 engine regulations make a switch plausible. The situation creates uncertainty for Russell and the future driver lineup at both top teams.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration to End Temporary Protected Status for Haitian Migrants in September</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants, effective in early September. The Department of Homeland Security argued that conditions in Haiti have improved sufficiently since the 2010 earthquake to allow for their safe return. Haitians with TPS who do not qualify for another legal status will become ineligible to work and subject to deportation. The administration is urging affected individuals to self-deport, a move that comes despite the State Department's own Level 4 travel advisory warning Americans not to visit Haiti due to widespread violence and instability.</p>

          <h2>Sean Combs's Attorney Delivers Closing Argument, Calling Racketeering Trial a 'Fake Trial'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the closing argument of Sean "Diddy" Combs's racketeering and sex trafficking trial, his lawyer portrayed the music mogul as a victim of an overzealous prosecution. Attorney Marc Agnifilo argued that the government had "badly exaggerated" evidence, attempting to twist a lifestyle of recreational drug use and consensual sexual activity into a criminal conspiracy. He called the prosecution a "fake trial" and ridiculed the racketeering charges as a "figment of the prosecution's imagination." The defense rested its case after a brief presentation, relying on its cross-examinations of the 34 government witnesses who testified over seven weeks.</p>
