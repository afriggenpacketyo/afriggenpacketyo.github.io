          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has officially formed in the Atlantic Ocean, marking the sixth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season, closely following Hurricane Erin. Located approximately 405 miles south-southeast of Bermuda, Fernand currently exhibits maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, classifying it as a tropical storm. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had previously forecast an above-normal hurricane season, anticipating 13 to 18 named storms, with five to nine potentially escalating into hurricanes. This recent development underscores the active and potentially challenging nature of the current Atlantic hurricane season, necessitating continued vigilance from forecasters and communities along the East Coast, especially given Erin's prior impact.</p>

Manager Mikel Arteta lauded Dowman's maturity, stability, and hunger, stating he has never witnessed such conviction in a player so young.

          <p>Israeli strikes and shootings in Gaza killed at least 33 people, including those sheltering in tents and seeking food aid, as a leading authority declared famine gripping Gaza City. This rare pronouncement by the IPC intensified global pleas for a halt to Israel's 22-month offensive, prompted by Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks. Israel denounced the famine declaration as false, while pressing ahead with preparations to seize Gaza City. Efforts for a ceasefire remain on hold, with the ongoing conflict exacerbating a dire humanitarian crisis, leading to widespread displacement and catastrophic hunger for nearly half a million people.</p>

This significant medical development, following an earlier surgery to remove a blood clot from his upper right arm, threatens his ability to start the 2026 season on time. Wheeler, aged 35, was having an exceptional season, boasting a 10-5 record with a 2.71 ERA in 24 starts, and leading the National League with 195 strikeouts. His prolonged absence represents a major setback for the Phillies, especially given his status as a top contender for the NL Cy Young Award and a two-time runner-up.</p>

          <p>Following Hurricane Erin's passage, which brought significant coastal flooding and created hazardous rip current conditions, some Jersey Shore beaches have begun to reopen for swimming. While most beaches are now accessible, many continue to enforce swimming restrictions, with the National Weather Service's Mount Holly office warning that dangerous rip currents are expected to persist into Sunday. Visitors planning a trip to the Shore are strongly advised to verify the specific swimming, surfing, or bathing allowances for each beach, guided by red (no swimming), yellow (caution), and green (calm) flags. Popular destinations like Belmar and Asbury Park still display red flags, while Manasquan and Sea Bright have reopened portions of their shorelines, albeit under yellow or double red flags, indicating varying levels of caution.</p>

Maxwell also dismissed allegations against Prince Andrew as "mind-blowingly not conceivable" and called a famous photo involving him and Giuffre "fake."</p>

          <p>Rookie tight end Terrance Ferguson, a second-round draft pick from Oregon, delivered an impressive debut for the Los Angeles Rams after sitting out the first two preseason games due to a hamstring injury. Ferguson, standing 6-foot-5 and 247 pounds, showcased his potential with a crucial 33-yard over-the-shoulder catch and a subsequent 15-yard gain, demonstrating his vertical speed and ability to stretch the field. Coach Sean McVay lauded Ferguson's "nice pace to his game" and his immediate impact on the field. This strong performance indicates that Ferguson is looking good to make the Rams' 53-man roster and is poised to be a significant factor in the team's tight end group, potentially becoming the heir apparent to veteran Tyler Higbee.</p>

This dual impact stems from stricter regulations in China, coupled with cheaper labor and weaker environmental enforcement in Southeast Asia.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Los Angeles and 30 other "sanctuary" cities and counties. This ruling expands on an earlier decision, asserting that the administration's efforts to cut funds based on policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration agencies are likely unconstitutional and violate the separation of powers doctrine. U.S. District Judge William Orrick characterized the executive order as a "coercive threat." The White House, however, expressed confidence in ultimately winning on appeal, maintaining that sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and compromise the safety and security of American citizens. This legal battle represents a significant chapter in the ongoing conflict between federal and local governments over immigration enforcement.</p>

After being returned to the US, he was detained and charged with human smuggling. He declined a plea deal that would have sent him to Costa Rica, leading to the administration's new request for his appearance at an immigration facility in Baltimore, signaling an intent to deport him to Uganda.

Described as a dizzyingly enjoyable cat-and-mouse chase, the review highlights the film's compelling exploration of anonymity, surveillance, and the inherent loneliness and vulnerabilities of such a clandestine gig.</p>

          <p>Thomas Frank, Tottenham's new manager, is being hailed as the club's best summer signing after leading Spurs to consecutive wins and clean sheets, including an impressive 2-0 victory over Manchester City. Frank, who replaced Ange Postecoglou, has rapidly won over supporters despite widespread discontent over the club's transfer window failings and chairman Daniel Levy. The article highlights his ability to maintain attacking freedom while instilling crucial defensive solidity, a significant improvement from the previous season's high-scoring but leaky defense. Players like Joao Palhinha, a new loan signing, have also thrived under Frank's guidance, being named player of the match against City. This article suggests a promising new era for the club under Frank's leadership, despite initial transfer market challenges.</p>

          <p>The Ukraine war is profoundly reshaping geopolitics in former Soviet states, visibly weakening Russia's influence as countries like Azerbaijan forge new alliances. Azerbaijan and Armenia, mediated by US President Donald Trump, recently signed a peace treaty, a move seen by some as a "terrible humiliation" for Russia. Other states, including Tajikistan, are also adopting a more assertive tone towards Moscow, observing Russia's diminished "superpower" image. This shift has created a "window of opportunity" for these nations to pursue multi-vector foreign policies, strengthening ties with countries like Turkey and China, which is quietly advancing its economic and security presence in the region.</p>

This program, which provides grants to colleges where at least a quarter of undergraduates are Hispanic, was created to address lower college attendance and graduation rates among Latino students. The lawsuit, brought by the state of Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action organization, argues the program provides an unconstitutional advantage based on race or ethnicity, citing the 2023 Supreme Court decision outlawing affirmative action. The Justice Department's decision to not defend the program signals a significant shift in federal policy regarding minority-serving institutions, despite a national association of HSIs moving to intervene as a defendant to protect the funding.

          <p>The UK is set to experience a 30C heatwave on bank holiday Monday, potentially making it one of the hottest summers on record, before Hurricane Erin's remnants bring unsettled weather.

The Met Office predicts rain and cooler conditions will follow from Tuesday. While beachgoers are warned of rough seas, the heat has already caused travel disruption, wildfires, and a significant water shortfall, impacting agriculture and leading to hosepipe bans, underscoring climate change's influence on extreme weather events.</p>

While both parties acknowledge the need for reforms due to rising costs and budget gaps, the SPD emphasizes imaginative solutions rather than just cuts for workers. Merz's comments are seen as an effort to appeal to his traditional base and address concerns about economic sustainability, highlighting the internal government tensions over the future of Germany's social safety net.
