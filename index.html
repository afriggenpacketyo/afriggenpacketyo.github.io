          <p>A suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was apprehended after allegedly using a "makeshift flamethrower" and throwing an incendiary device at a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado, resulting in eight hospitalizations. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted terror attack, citing ideologically motivated violence as a primary factor. Witnesses reported that Soliman yelled "Free Palestine" during the attack, which targeted a Run for Their Lives walk aimed at raising awareness about hostages in Gaza. The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, sustained burn injuries, and the attack has been widely condemned as an act of antisemitism, prompting increased security measures and the cancellation of upcoming events. The incident follows a series of recent violent acts against the Jewish community, intensifying concerns about rising antisemitism. The suspect is being held on a $10,000,000 bond and is facing a range of felony charges, including use of an incendiary device. Optimism regarding community healing and justice is cautiously moderate in light of the event's severity.</p>

          <p>Nottinghamshire Police have initiated a corporate manslaughter investigation into the maternity services at Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS trust, following numerous cases of neonatal deaths, stillbirths, and harm to mothers and babies. The investigation will examine whether the trust's maternity care was grossly negligent, focusing on two units overseen by NUH, which runs the Queen's Medical Centre and Nottingham City Hospital. The move comes amid an ongoing independent review led by midwife Donna Ockenden, examining approximately 2,500 cases. Families of the victims have expressed that the investigation is a step towards accountability, but some emphasize the need for individual responsibility. The trust has expressed deep sorrow and committed to improving its maternity services, but acknowledges there is more work to be done to address the serious failings.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing conservative historian, has narrowly won the Polish presidential runoff, defeating liberal-conservative Rafal Trzaskowski and delivering a significant setback to Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-European government. Nawrocki's victory is expected to result in continued obstruction of government reforms, particularly those aimed at restoring the rule of law, as he aligns with the policies of former President Andrzej Duda. Nawrocki's stance on foreign policy issues, such as Ukraine's NATO membership and relations with the EU, clashes with the current government's agenda, potentially narrowing its room for maneuver. The election outcome reflects deep divisions within Poland, raising concerns about further polarization and potential challenges to the government's ability to implement its policies effectively. Despite facing numerous scandals during his campaign, Nawrocki managed to unite the "patriotic camp" and secure the presidency.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano, erupted on the Italian island of Sicily, emitting a massive ash cloud and a "lava fountain." The volcano department noted "explosions of increasing intensity," with the explosive activity from the Southeast Crater evolving into a lava fountain. The eruption has not posed an immediate risk to the local population or air travel, as residents are accustomed to Etna's frequent activity. The volcano has erupted annually for the past several years, often covering nearby towns with volcanic dust, but without causing major disruptions. While this eruption is visually dramatic, it is within the range of Etna's typical behavior.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are set to meet in Istanbul for another round of U.S.-brokered peace talks aimed at ending Russia's invasion, but the talks occur after Ukraine launched a drone attack on Russia's strategic bomber fleet. Ukraine is calling for a full 30-day ceasefire for negotiations, but Russia is demanding annexation of Ukrainian regions and demilitarization. President Zelenskyy outlined Ukraine's goals, including a ceasefire, prisoner release, and the return of abducted children. Despite pressure from the Trump administration, previous talks have failed to reach a peace deal, and Zelenskyy has accused Putin of intentionally sabotaging the negotiations. The talks are shadowed by continued long-range drone and missile attacks, with both sides claiming to have shot down numerous drones overnight.</p>

          <p>Maintaining a healthy romantic relationship requires effort, but modern culture often encourages individuals to abandon relationships that demand too much work. Research suggests that couples who invest effort into their relationships are happier in the long run, engaging in activities together and maintaining open communication. However, it's crucial to avoid burnout by recognizing when the effort is disproportionate or detrimental to one's mental and physical health. Understanding personal needs and boundaries, as well as being able to verbalize them, is essential for a balanced partnership, and it's acceptable to end a relationship if those needs are not met.</p>

China's commerce department vowed to safeguard its rights and benefits if the U.S. continues actions that damage China's interests.

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to shorter journey times, fewer delays, and more flights for passengers. The planned changes, which could allow planes to climb quicker during take-off and descend more smoothly, represent the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s. While some changes outside London could be seen before 2030, alterations to airspace over London are not expected until the 2030s. Concerns have been raised about the potential for new flight paths over previously unaffected residential areas, and some stakeholders emphasize the need to prioritize environmental impacts and community well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Social Security Administration policy requiring nearly 2 million additional beneficiaries to visit agency offices to change direct deposit information is causing concern due to long travel times for seniors. Nearly one-quarter of seniors live more than an hour away from their local Social Security field office, and half need to drive at least 33 minutes without traffic. The policy change, aimed at curbing fraud, will lead to over 1 million hours of travel per year, disproportionately affecting seniors and disabled individuals who lack internet access or transportation. Advocates argue that the change is an overreaction, given the relatively small scale of direct deposit fraud, and staffing cuts at the SSA may exacerbate appointment wait times.</p>

          <p>Space agencies and commercial companies are increasingly interested in returning to the moon, driven by its abundant resources and potential as a base for future Mars missions. NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, while China and Russia aim to build a lunar base by 2035. The moon's resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and helium-3, could be used for self-sufficiency in lunar bases and as fuel for spacecraft. Scientific research on the moon will focus on understanding lunar environments, human health in space, and developing technologies for long-term lunar habitation, which could also benefit life on Earth.</p>

          <p>Sri Lankan customs authorities arrested a Thai woman for attempting to smuggle nearly 10 kilograms of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $1.72 million, concealed inside plush toys at Bandaranaike International Airport. This is the largest cocaine seizure ever detected at the airport, following three other hauls this month totaling nearly 60 kilograms of synthetic cannabis. The seizure underscores Sri Lanka's role as a potential transit hub for narcotics destined for other locations, with authorities having previously seized large quantities of heroin off the country's shores. All suspects could face life imprisonment if convicted, reflecting the severity of drug-related offenses in Sri Lanka.</p>

          <p>The GOP-led Senate is considering President Trump's multi-trillion-dollar budget plan, which includes tax cuts and changes to defense, energy, and immigration policy. The Senate Republicans can only afford to lose three votes to get the plan across the finish line, and some senators are already raising issues with it, NPR's Claudia Grisales tells Up First. The proposed plan carries the bulk of President Trump's domestic policy agenda. Also, numerous people participating in a walk and vigil for Israeli hostages being held by Hamas were attacked and burned at an event in Boulder, Colo., yesterday. Authorities say the man, identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled "free Palestine" before using a makeshift flame-thrower.</p>

          <p>A restaurant consultant, Salar Sheik, shared dining etiquette tips, emphasizing that "one-timing" a server (making multiple small requests instead of one comprehensive order) is considered rude. Sheik also advises explaining to the server if you are in a hurry and need to order quickly. He suggests making eye contact and waving to get a server's attention rather than snapping fingers. Sheik also notes that customers should be understanding if an order is incorrect, as errors can occur in the kitchen, and should approach the situation calmly. He also suggests being mindful of how long you stay at a table after finishing your meal, placing your first order shortly after being seated, and that servers should provide timely service.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While self-understanding is often encouraged, the pursuit of perfect self-knowledge is unattainable and can lead to confusion and stagnation. Humans have limitations in their ability to see themselves clearly due to unconscious biases and a limited awareness of their capacity for change. Introspection can be beneficial but also lead to rumination and negative thought spirals, and a belief in a fixed true self can hinder personal growth. Instead of seeking a perfectly accurate story about themselves, people should focus on building a flexible sense of self that allows for surprise and mystery, embracing change and resisting rigid categorization.</p>

          <p>Opposition to women’s rights has helped fuel authoritarian movements in various countries, including South Korea, where it has placed women’s issues at the center of the country’s presidential election. The rise of anti-feminist sentiment has been attributed to economic challenges, such as housing crises and job shortages, which some blame on women and feminists. This has led to a political landscape where candidates capitalize on men’s grievances, as seen in the 2022 election, which further fueled the country’s political crisis. The upcoming election presents an opportunity for a shift away from anti-feminist policies and a focus on addressing the underlying issues that contribute to social division.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The bond market is reacting negatively to the prospect of a reconciliation bill that could increase the deficit by trillions of dollars, leading to rising interest rates and potential economic consequences for the U.S. The bond market's concerns stem from the U.S.'s already substantial debt burden and the potential for the country to reach a point where it cannot repay what it owes. High interest rates could make it more expensive for the government to service its debt, constrain politicians' ability to pass tax cuts or deficit-financed spending, and increase costs for homeowners, businesses, and individuals. While the bond market cannot directly depose a president, its influence over interest rates could significantly impact the U.S. economy and shape the future of fiscal policy.

          <p>First-time buyers in the UK are increasingly borrowing through mortgages with an average term of 31 years, as the affordability of homes remains a challenge. A decade ago, the average mortgage term for first-time buyers was 28 years, but higher mortgage rates have pushed people to borrow for longer to keep monthly repayments manageable. Many young homeowners are choosing these long mortgage terms to make repayments more manageable, they may opt for shorter terms in the future if their salaries improve or they move house.

While a recent poll suggests voters prefer a populist message, the author contends that the political case for abundance reforms rests on their material benefits, not their rhetorical appeal. The author highlights the Democratic Party's governance failures, such as housing shortages and infrastructure delays, and argues that abundance reforms can improve the party's reputation for economic management.
