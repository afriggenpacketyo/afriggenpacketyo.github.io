          <p>This New York Times article examines how residents of Oakdale, California, have shifted from traditional media to online sources for news, leading to widespread distrust and misinformation. The decline of local newspapers and the rise of Facebook groups have transformed the town's media landscape, with residents increasingly turning to podcasters and influencers for political news. A militia incident in 2020, fueled by false rumors spread on Facebook, highlighted the dangers of this shift. While some residents seek truth in alternative sources, many feel less informed and struggle to distinguish fact from fiction, reflecting a broader trend in small communities across the country.</p>

          <p>A Doctors Without Borders (MSF) facility and a local market in South Sudan were bombed, resulting in at least seven deaths and 20 injuries, raising fears of a return to civil war. The medical charity reported that helicopter gunships bombed the pharmacy of the hospital it runs in Old Fangak, Jonglei state, destroying all medical supplies, followed by attacks on the town and a drone bombing of a local market. MSF condemned the attack as a clear violation of international humanitarian law, emphasizing that the hospital was clearly marked and its coordinates shared with all warring parties. The UN has warned that South Sudan is teetering on the brink of full-scale civil war due to escalating tensions between President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the often-overlooked negative aspects of antidepressant use, including sexual side effects, manic episodes, suicidal thoughts, and severe withdrawal symptoms. The author, a psychiatrist, notes that while antidepressants can be transformative for some, many patients experience a less advertised side of these medications. The article highlights the lack of high-quality research on safely tapering patients off antidepressants and the need for more attention to medication safety, particularly regarding long-term use and withdrawal effects.

          <p>Two commercial jetliners were forced to abort landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) due to an Army Black Hawk helicopter violating safety standards. The incident occurred three months after a deadly mid-air collision involving a Black Hawk near the airport. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the incident "unacceptable" and emphasized that safety must always come first. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident, which involved a Delta Air Lines flight and a Republic Airways flight.</p>

The Art Institute has confirmed the accuracy of the report and initiated an independent investigation into the incident. Rondeau's total compensation is more than $1 million.</p>

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially leading to higher prices for new and used vehicles, as well as increased repair and insurance costs. President Trump ordered these tariffs to promote domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign automobiles and parts. The tariffs do not apply to components from Canada or Mexico that meet the requirements of the North American trade agreement. While the administration hopes to incentivize domestic production, analysts predict consumers will bear the brunt of the increased costs.</p>
