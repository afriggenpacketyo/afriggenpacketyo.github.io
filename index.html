          <h2>China's New Law Targets Unfair Enforcement Against Private Sector</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 04:00:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has enacted a new private sector law aimed at curbing “profit-driven” enforcement actions that disproportionately affect non-state businesses. The 78-article law seeks to address concerns about cross-regional enforcement and strengthen accountability for officials. Analysts believe the law will empower businesses to defend their interests, including taking legal action against local governments. The Ministry of Justice hailed the law as historically significant, particularly as China navigates increasing economic pressures both domestically and internationally, hoping to reassure private entrepreneurs and foster a more stable business environment.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing concerns over the economic impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. While Japan's inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target for 36 months, the central bank acknowledges that trade tensions could moderate growth. Governor Kazo Ueda cautioned that significant changes to tariff policies would affect the BOJ's monetary policy outlook, and the central bank expects inflation to range between 2-2.5% in fiscal year 2025 and 1.5 to 2% in fiscal year 2026.</p>

          <p>Tesla has refuted reports that it is seeking a replacement for Elon Musk as CEO.

Tesla chair Robyn Denholm stated the report was “absolutely false” and that the board has confidence in Musk's leadership. Musk criticized the Wall Street Journal for publishing a deliberately false article, while last week he pledged to allocate more time to Tesla and reduce his government role.</p>

The article draws parallels to abusive relationships, where increased capitulation leads to escalating demands. It highlights that belligerence and leverage seem to be more effective strategies in dealing with Trump, while Britain's exceptionalism and belief in its ability to negotiate its way out of any situation may be misguided when dealing with Trump's capricious nature.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers' season ended with a disappointing first-round loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Despite acquiring Luka Dončić mid-season, the Lakers struggled to overcome the Timberwolves' defensive dominance. Rudy Gobert's strong performance and the Lakers' inability to capitalize on key moments contributed to their defeat. The loss marks the first time the Lakers have lost a first-round series as a No. 3 or higher seed, highlighting the team's struggles in the playoffs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced an agreement with Ukraine to share future revenues from its mineral reserves, creating a joint investment fund. The deal comes after months of negotiations, aiming to give President Trump a personal stake in Ukraine's fate and address concerns about U.S. aid. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the agreement signals commitment to a free and prosperous Ukraine.
