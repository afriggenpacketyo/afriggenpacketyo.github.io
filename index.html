        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended President Trump's approach to trade negotiations, describing it as 'strategic uncertainty' to gain leverage. He acknowledged that a comprehensive trade deal with China could take months, but an agreement in principle could be reached sooner if trading partners demonstrate 'good behavior'. Bessent dismissed concerns about investors losing confidence in the U.S. economy, attributing recent market fluctuations to statistical or market noise, and emphasized the long-term fundamentals for a strong economy. The Secretary also asserted that the high tariff level is unsustainable for China's business model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans in North Carolina have been attempting to overturn the results of a state Supreme Court election, challenging 65,000 votes. Although the effort has narrowed, legal experts from both parties suggest the case could set a precedent for overturning future elections. The challenges focus on technicalities and reinterpretations of voting laws after Election Day, raising concerns about the potential for future attempts to nullify votes based on minor procedural issues. This legal battle highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding election integrity and the willingness of parties to contest results based on technicalities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Zelensky has offered a glimmer of hope for Ukrainians, particularly after Trump questioned Russia's continued aggression. Trump suggested that Putin might not be interested in stopping the war and might need to be dealt with more firmly, possibly through additional sanctions. This shift in tone has been seen as a potential victory for Zelensky, who has been resisting pressure to accept a peace plan seen as favorable to Moscow. The hope is that Trump will not force Ukraine into a lopsided peace deal.</p>

          <p>President Trump has initiated a swift rollback of DEI programs across the federal government, starting with an executive order to eliminate all DEI offices and redirect those employees. He has also cancelled contracts focused on DEI initiatives, reportedly saving the government millions of dollars. These actions have prompted similar cancellations in the private sector, with major companies like Meta and McDonald's ending their DEI programs. The administration's moves signal a significant shift away from diversity-focused policies and a return to what it describes as merit-based hiring practices.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, leader of the Liberal Party, is facing increased scrutiny over his past dealings with China during the ongoing election. Carney's experience working with the Chinese establishment in his previous roles as a central banker and business executive has shifted from being an asset to a political liability. This scrutiny comes amid heightened concerns about China's influence and security threats, forcing Carney to distance himself from his past associations with the country. His past dealings with China are now a focal point in the national elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are facing a growing number of lawsuits from state officials, small businesses, and political groups. These lawsuits challenge the president's authority to impose tariffs without Congressional approval, arguing that he is overstepping his constitutional powers. The plaintiffs contend that the tariffs are essentially taxes that require Congressional consent, and that Trump's actions are disrupting trade and harming businesses. The outcome of these legal challenges could significantly impact the future of U.S. trade policy.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion at Iran's largest commercial port, Shahid Rajaee, resulted in at least 40 deaths and over 1,000 injuries, triggering widespread anger and accusations of incompetence against the authorities. Speculation suggests the blast was caused by improper handling of solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles, a claim denied by the Iranian military. The incident has raised concerns about potential food shortages due to the port's significance for imports, though authorities downplay the impact. An investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the explosion.</p>

          <p>A raid on an underground nightclub in Colorado Springs led to the detention of over 100 immigrants allegedly in the country illegally. The operation also uncovered drug trafficking, prostitution, and active-duty military members working at the illicit establishment. The DEA reported seizing guns and discovering members from various gangs, including Tren de Aragua and the Hells Angels. Federal officials stated that the active-duty service members were turned over to the US Army Criminal Investigation Division.</p>

Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer argues that the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination and creates confusion for employers and service providers.

          <p>The war in Gaza has resulted in more than 52,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the territory's health ministry, as Israel continues its offensive. The offensive has involved daily strikes and a tightened blockade, leading to severe shortages of food and medicine for the territory's 2 million residents. Aid groups warn of imminent supply depletion and widespread malnutrition. The Israeli government states the offensive is aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages, but Hamas insists on a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal in exchange.</p>

          <p>A therapist who has worked with over 100 couples identifies five common habits that can damage relationships. These habits include assuming your partner can read your mind, keeping score, engaging in passive-aggressive behavior, constantly backseat driving their life, and listening only to respond. By recognizing and addressing these annoying behaviors, couples can foster healthier communication and build stronger, more fulfilling partnerships. These habits often lead to resentment and dissatisfaction if left unaddressed.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian families separated by Russian occupation are struggling to maintain hope for reunification. Many have fled their homes in occupied territory, facing dangerous conditions and 'filtration' processes at Russian checkpoints. Those remaining under occupation face limited freedoms and constant fear. The situation is further complicated by President Trump's envoy suggesting that occupied territories want to be under Russian rule, which has stunned displaced families who long for their homes.</p>
