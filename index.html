          <p>Ether's value surged as the U.S. House passed the GENIUS Act, the first major crypto-focused legislation in the country, which now awaits the president's signature. The bill's passage, along with significant inflows into Ether-based ETFs, has shifted momentum in the cryptocurrency market, with ETH outperforming Bitcoin. Analysts suggest this could mark a potential trend reversal, establishing a new regulatory framework for stablecoins that future administrations will find difficult to overturn. The legislation's symbolism alone is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

The blast occurred in the parking lot of the Special Enforcement Bureau on Friday morning.

Federal, state, and local agencies are on the scene, and officials have expressed their condolences to the families of the deceased deputies.</p>

          <p>Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics fell sharply after the FDA indicated it is considering whether the company's gene therapy, Elevidys, should remain on the market. The agency is investigating two patient deaths linked to the treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and may ask the company to halt all shipments. Elevidys, which constitutes over half of Sarepta's revenue, has faced controversy since its approval due to uncertain evidence of its benefits. The heightened safety concerns, coupled with the drug's unclear efficacy, have put the company's future in jeopardy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A historical review of queerness demonstrates a wide spectrum of societal acceptance and persecution throughout history, long before the modern term existed. In antiquity, same-sex relationships were common, as seen with figures like Leonardo da Vinci and the Roman Emperor Hadrian, and even celebrated in some cultures like ancient Crete. However, the rise of Christianity led to centuries of stigmatization and severe punishment for non-binary gender expression and same-sex love, often justified by religious texts. The article highlights that diverse gender identities, such as a third gender, have been recognized in various cultures for millennia, challenging the modern binary model.</p>

          <p>The parents of Kaylee Goncalves, one of the four University of Idaho students murdered in 2022, have spoken out following the lifting of a gag order in the case. They expressed frustration that even after Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea, which spared him the death penalty, the motive for the killings remains unknown. The family's attorney plans to request discovery materials from prosecutors to learn more about the crime's details. The Goncalves family had opposed the plea deal, stating that life in prison is insufficient and that they still lack basic facts needed for their victim impact statement.</p>

Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the outcome, stating it affirms that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers.

While some supporters praised the move for transparency, critics like Rep. Daniel Goldman argued that grand jury transcripts are only a fraction of the evidence and that videos, photos, and witness interviews would be more revealing.

This development adds to a long public record of their association during the 1990s and early 2000s, which included socializing at parties and flights on Epstein's private jet.

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor, surrender his passport, and cease using social media. The decision came as authorities searched his home and party headquarters in connection with an investigation into an alleged plot to overturn the 2022 election results. The measures are reportedly intended to prevent Bolsonaro from fleeing the country amid legal pressure. The situation is complicated by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on Brazil to pressure authorities to drop the case, which Brazil's current president has called "unacceptable blackmail."</p>

          <p>The nation's 37 tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) are facing a potential crisis as the Trump administration's fiscal year 2026 budget proposes a nearly 90% reduction in federal operations funding. These institutions, which are heavily reliant on federal money, could be forced to close or severely reduce services, impacting thousands of Indigenous students. Leaders from the American Indian Higher Education Consortium are lobbying Congress to uphold the federal government's treaty obligations to fund Indigenous education. The proposed cuts are seen by advocates not just as a budgetary issue, but as a direct attack on tribal sovereignty and self-determination.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has confirmed its decision to destroy nearly $10 million worth of taxpayer-funded contraceptives, such as IUDs and implants, rather than distribute them to women in need overseas. The move, which will cost an additional $167,000, has been condemned by lawmakers as a waste of money and an abdication of U.S. leadership in global health. The department cited rules preventing aid to organizations involved with abortion services and issues with the products' shelf life as reasons for the destruction. This action is part of a broader dismantling of USAID's foreign assistance programs, which critics warn could have devastating health consequences globally.</p>

          <p>The traditional five-day royal "swan upping" survey on the River Thames has concluded with positive news, showing a recovery in the number of young swans. The count found 115 cygnets, a significant increase from last year's 86, suggesting a reversal of a recent decline caused by avian flu and human-related incidents. The annual event, which dates back to the 12th century, involves counting, weighing, and checking the health of young swans along a stretch of the river. While once about asserting royal ownership, the tradition now focuses on conservation and educating the public, particularly young people, about protecting the iconic birds.</p>

          <p>An atypical July weather system is bringing a chance of scattered showers and dry lightning to Southern California this weekend, raising concerns about potential wildfires. The National Weather Service warns that while some rain may fall over mountain areas, lightning can strike outside of the rain shafts, igniting dry fuel. The rare storm pattern is being fueled by a low-pressure system in northern Mexico rather than the typical summer monsoonal flow. Officials are advising residents to stay indoors if they hear thunder, as the storms could also produce localized flooding and strong winds in addition to the deadly lightning.</p>

          <p>According to a Financial Times report, President Donald Trump is now demanding a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% on all goods imported from the European Union. This represents an escalation in trade talks, which appear to have stalled with less than two weeks before an August 1 deadline. The EU had been hoping for a deal more aligned with the UK's, which maintained a lower baseline tariff with some exemptions. The report of the president's heightened demands caused a dip in the stock market, reflecting investor anxiety over the potential for a renewed, aggressive trade dispute with the major economic bloc.

          <p>The latest University of Michigan Survey of Consumers indicates that Americans' fears about future inflation have significantly decreased, with outlooks falling to their lowest levels since before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation forecast dropped to 4.4% in July from 5% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This suggests that while consumers still perceive some risk, they believe the tariff-induced price hikes will be temporary.

          <p>For retirees relying on fixed Social Security benefits, managing credit card debt can be particularly challenging as inflation rises. This article explores how individuals on Social Security can qualify for debt relief, noting that while their protected income status presents unique circumstances, options are available. Strategies like debt management plans, which consolidate payments and lower interest rates, are often a good fit as they don't require new credit checks. Other options include credit card hardship programs and, in some cases, debt settlement, though the latter can negatively impact credit scores. The key is finding a solution that aligns with a fixed-income reality. (not investment advice)</p>
