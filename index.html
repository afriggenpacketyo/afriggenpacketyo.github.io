            <p>The 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, launched nearly three years ago, is struggling with understaffing and underfunding despite a 40% increase in calls since its inception. Counselor Alejandra, drawing from personal experience with suicidal thoughts, emphasizes the courage it takes for individuals to reach out. CEO Lyn Morris highlights the need for more resources, therapists, and technology to effectively handle the increasing volume of calls, some involving immediate life-or-death situations. Federal cuts to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) could exacerbate the problem, leading to more hospitalizations and deaths.</p>

            <p>Pete Hegseth, US secretary of defense, asserted that the Panama Canal faces threats from China, prompting a strong response from the Chinese government, which accused the US of blackmail. Hegseth's comments alluded to Chinese-controlled ports at either end of the canal and Donald Trump's claims of Chinese influence. The Chinese embassy in Panama criticized the US for interfering in Panama's sovereign decisions, highlighting tensions over US influence and trade relations in the region. The US built the canal in the early 1900s and relinquished control to Panama in 1999.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants suspected of gang membership under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, but with judicial review. The court split 5-4, with Justice Barrett siding with the liberal justices in dissent. The decision comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary, as Mr. Trump's second-term policies have collided with the federal courts.

            <p>Stocks declined after the Trump administration announced a 104% tariff on China, reversing earlier gains fueled by hopes of tariff negotiations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all experienced losses amid anxieties about the economic impact of President Trump's wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs. Economists warn that the tariffs could drive up inflation, potentially stalling U.S. economic growth and increasing the risk of a recession.

The bill aims to codify existing efforts by Mayor Brandon Scott's administration to ensure menstrual products are available in public facilities across the city. Similar measures have been taken in California, where schools are required to stock menstrual products in various restrooms to support all students who menstruate.</p>

            <p>President Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson are urging House Republicans to back the Senate-passed budget resolution, which is crucial for extending Trump's tax cuts. However, nearly a dozen House Republicans oppose the resolution, citing insufficient spending cuts. The budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, allowing Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate. The Senate's plan relies on a budget scoring method that assumes continuing current policies incurs no cost, while some House Republicans argue the spending cuts aren't deep enough.</p>

Navarro claims Tesla is merely an assembler of foreign-made parts, while Musk insists Tesla has the most American-made cars. Government data supports Musk's claim, showing that 75% of the parts for Tesla's Model 3 Long Range are sourced from the U.S. or Canada. Analysts believe Tesla will be less affected by tariffs on car parts than its rivals due to its high level of vertical integration.</p>

The panel heard appeals in a complex class-action case where Carter invalidated leases of VA land to private entities and ordered the agency to build thousands of housing units for disabled veterans.

            <p>Elon Musk has escalated his attacks on Peter Navarro as Tesla shares continue to decline. Musk criticized Navarro's remarks about Tesla being more of a "car assembler" and called him a "moron." The feud reflects differing views on trade and tariffs within the Trump administration. Tesla's stock has fallen significantly, and Musk's wealth has decreased. Musk advocates for a zero-tariff situation between Europe and North America, contrasting with Trump's tariff policies.</p>

Hampton has been Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper this season and has been selected in three of England's four Women's Nations League matches. The decision between the two keepers is difficult, with Hampton being the younger of the two.</p>

            <p>A study from University College London (UCL) found that three-quarters of young footballers are suffering from gum disease. The study, which involved 160 academy players from various English football clubs, revealed that young male and female players are more likely to have major problems with tooth decay and poor oral hygiene than non-footballers of a similar age. Factors identified include poor hygiene habits, high consumption of sugary drinks, and stress. Researchers are calling for greater education and routine dental care for players.</p>

            <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC says that the stock market is struggling to keep up with President Donald Trump's shifting statements and policies. The market initially rallied on speculation of quick tariff negotiations before plunging into the red after the White House confirmed 104% tariffs on China would begin Wednesday. Cramer believes investors lack confidence due to the rapid pace of events driven by the White House. He points to Apple as an example of a company facing unrealistic demands due to Trump's tariff policies.</p>

            <p>This article examines President Trump's focus on his own due process rights while simultaneously attempting to strip them from others, particularly concerning the deportation of alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act. Despite his reliance on legal processes to delay and potentially avoid prosecution in various cases, Trump's administration seeks to limit due process for migrants, raising concerns about fairness and justice. The Supreme Court's involvement in these cases highlights the tension between individual rights and executive power, raising questions about the consistency of legal protections.</p>

            <p>After global tariffs knocked trillions off worldwide markets, President Trump sowed more diplomatic and trade confusion on Tuesday as he focused on China. A day of dizzying geopolitical swings ended with the White House announcing that additional 50 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports would go into effect on Wednesday. That muscle-flexing came as Trump’s lieutenants tried to frame the administration’s rapid shifts about its tariffs programme as consistent and likely to produce its stated goals of boosting US manufacturing, generating “trillions of dollars in revenue” and spurring US economic prosperity.</p>
