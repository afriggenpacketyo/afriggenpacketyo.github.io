          <p>The U.S. Senate has entered a prolonged session to debate and vote on a massive spending and tax package central to President Trump's second-term agenda. Titled "One Big, Beautiful Bill," the legislation passed the House and now faces a series of amendments in the Senate, with Republicans aiming for a July 4th signing deadline. The bill proposes increased spending on border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition, and is projected by the CBO to increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over a decade. Democrats are expected to use the extended voting process, known as a "vote-a-rama," to force votes on controversial issues ahead of midterm elections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Iranian deputy foreign minister has stated that the United States must guarantee it will not repeat acts of aggression before any new negotiations can occur. This follows a recent conflict where Israel and the U.S. conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, with Iran retaliating against Israel. The minister insisted on Iran's right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, rejecting claims of developing a nuclear weapon and calling the attacks the "law of the jungle." While a ceasefire with Israel is being observed, its durability is uncertain, and Iran remains cautious about future dialogue without clear assurances and confidence-building measures from the U.S.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UEFA has delayed its decision on whether Crystal Palace can compete in the next Europa League season, a spot the team earned by winning the FA Cup. The issue stems from multi-club ownership rules, as co-owner John Textor also holds a majority stake in French club Lyon, which also qualified. The situation is complicated by Lyon's recent demotion to Ligue 2 by French football authorities for financial reasons, a decision they are appealing. UEFA will wait for the outcome of Lyon's appeal, as a failed appeal would see them relinquish their Europa League spot, potentially clearing the path for Crystal Palace.</p>

          <p>A 32-year-old woman in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, has pleaded guilty to culpable and reckless conduct after permitting a girl under the age of 10 to drive a car. The incident, which occurred in the village of Crimond during bad weather, was captured in a video that circulated on social media. The footage showed the young girl driving barefoot in the dark, with the woman heard cheering in the background. The woman admitted to endangering the child and others, and the court has deferred her sentencing pending the completion of a criminal justice social work report.</p>

A major clean-up operation is now underway at the Worthy Farm site, with volunteers clearing discarded items and rubbish ahead of a planned fallow year in 2026. Organizers urged festival-goers to take all their belongings, though many items like tents and camping chairs were left behind. The festival, which faced an amber heat health alert, is set to return in 2027, with organizers planning improvements during the break.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through the Department of Homeland Security, has launched a new national database designed to help state and local officials verify the citizenship status of voters. This first-of-its-kind system combines data from the Social Security Administration and immigration databases to create a searchable tool for ensuring only eligible citizens are voting. The initiative, developed in partnership with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, has raised concerns among some officials regarding potential misuse of the consolidated personal information. The system's implementation marks a significant step in the administration's focus on election integrity and immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA-based flu vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response compared to an existing shot in a late-stage trial involving over 40,000 adults. The positive results are a significant step for the company, paving the way for regulatory submissions for both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-19 and flu shot later this year. The company's head of R&D stated that the combo shot aims to simplify vaccination, reduce healthcare system burdens, and improve patient uptake. This development positions Moderna as a potential frontrunner in the race to market a combination respiratory vaccine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research into dog cognition reveals that a dog's primary sense is smell, fundamentally shaping how they perceive the world in ways humans often overlook. Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, explains that for dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are units of information that create a rich, transient map of their environment. This olfactory-centric existence also influences their perception of time, as the fading intensity of a person's scent can signify how long they have been gone. Understanding this difference is key to appreciating the unique way dogs experience life, co-existing with humans despite a profound perceptual divide.</p>

          <p>Amid heightened tensions following the recent U.S.-Iran conflict, American security agencies have issued warnings about potential retaliatory attacks from Iranian-backed "sleeper cells" on U.S. soil. However, experts suggest that while Iran likely maintains clandestine cells for surveillance and targeted operations, a major terrorist attack on the U.S. homeland would be a measure of last resort, reserved for moments of existential threat. The article argues that the threat is sometimes overstated for political purposes, similar to past warnings. While the IRGC has a history of foreign operations, its recent actions suggest a desire to de-escalate direct conflict with the U.S., making a stateside attack less probable for now.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent analysis suggests that the global population will begin to decline much earlier than the United Nations' 2084 projection, with some researchers predicting the turning point could be as soon as 2055. This is due to rapidly falling fertility rates in middle-income countries, which are plummeting faster than standard models anticipated. Macroeconomist JesÃºs FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde found significant discrepancies between UN projections and actual birth statistics in regions like Latin America, with countries like Colombia and Chile seeing rates far below replacement level. The UN's models are criticized for being overly optimistic, often assuming birth rates will either flatten or rebound, contrary to current, more severe downward trends.</p>

The loss underscores the team's decline since Parker's departure in 2020, a period during which they have failed to make the playoffs. Parker, a two-time MVP who led the Sparks to a championship, left due to issues with the team's culture and management at the time. The contrast between the celebratory halftime ceremony and the team's current performance paints a picture of a once-great franchise now lacking direction and star power.</p>

          <p>A British High Court has ruled against human rights groups that sought to block the U.K. government from allowing the sale of military equipment to Israel. The groups, Al-Haq and the Global Legal Action Network, argued that supplying parts for F-35 fighter jets made the U.K. complicit in violations of international law in Gaza. However, the court determined the issue was a matter of national security, as the components are part of a vital international defense collaboration involving the U.S. and other partners. The judges stated that decisions on participation in such defense programs are for the executive branch, not the courts, to decide.</p>

          <p>The second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Barry, has dissipated into a tropical depression after making landfall on Mexico's eastern coast. The system, which briefly reached tropical storm status on Sunday, is expected to bring heavy rainfall to the states of San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas over the next few days. The National Hurricane Center had issued a tropical storm warning, forecasting three to six inches of rain in the region. Although the storm weakened upon hitting the coast, it brought tropical storm conditions that are expected to persist through Monday.</p>

          <p>The BBC has stated that it should have stopped the live broadcast of the band Bob Vylan's performance at Glastonbury, acknowledging it was a mistake not to do so. During the set, the singer led the crowd in chants of "death, death to the IDF," which drew widespread condemnation, including from Glastonbury organizers who called the comments appalling and antisemitic. The broadcast regulator Ofcom is investigating why the comments were aired, and the UK government has demanded an explanation from the BBC. The BBC has since affirmed its stance against incitement to violence and said the performance will not be available on its iPlayer service.</p>
