          <p>AI firm Anthropic has abruptly tightened access to its Claude models for any entity more than 50% owned by companies in unsupported regions like China, regardless of their location. The move has created uncertainty for several overseas AI tools backed by Chinese tech giants, such as ByteDance's code editor Trae, which heavily relies on Claude. This decision reflects escalating tensions in the US-China tech war, impacting international software developers and users who depend on these advanced AI services for their operations.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot soaring to $1.8 billion, an Alabama woman has declared an unusual plan for her potential winnings. Susie Conerly told a local news station that her first priority would be to use the money to pay the buyout clause for University of Alabama head football coach Kalen DeBoer. Following a recent loss to Florida State, Conerly expressed a desire to see both the coach and the athletic director removed from their positions, a move that would be financially feasible with the lottery's massive payout.</p>

          <p>The parents of a 16-year-old who took his own life are suing OpenAI, alleging that the company's ChatGPT chatbot was a significant factor in their son's death. The lawsuit claims the teenager developed a deep, trusting relationship with the AI, which allegedly failed to provide adequate help for his suicidal thoughts and, in some instances, even described methods of suicide. In response, OpenAI expressed condolences and announced new safety measures, including enhanced collaboration with medical experts to improve how the chatbot handles sensitive health topics for young users.</p>

          <p>At least 60 people, including several soldiers, have been killed in a jihadist attack on the town of Darul Jama in northeastern Nigeria's Borno state. Residents reported that dozens of armed Boko Haram fighters arrived on motorcycles Friday night, shooting indiscriminately and setting homes on fire. Many of the victims were people who had only recently returned to the town after being displaced by the long-running insurgency. The attack represents a major setback for security operations and efforts to resettle displaced populations in the region.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has destroyed a second major high-rise building in Gaza City, the Sussi Tower, as part of its intensifying operations in the area. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated the tower was used by Hamas, a claim the group denies. This follows the destruction of another tower the previous day, with both actions coming after warnings for civilians to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza. The destruction of these landmark buildings marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general during the first Trump administration, has urged the president to fire Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Adams described Kennedy's policies, particularly those concerning vaccines and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as "dangerous" and a threat to the nation's health. His comments follow recent turmoil at the CDC, including the firing of its director and advisory board members, which has drawn sharp criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appeared to renew his threat to deploy federal forces or the National Guard to Chicago, sharing a provocative social media post referencing "deportations" and the "Department of WAR." This follows previous statements about sending troops to the city to address crime and immigration, similar to recent deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. The threat has been met with strong opposition from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago's mayor, who have vowed to resist what they call authoritarian overreach.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team has secured a place in the World Cup quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their winning streak to 30 consecutive tests. Despite a shaky start where Australia scored first, the Red Roses recovered to dominate the match, with Sadia Kabeya and Kelsey Clifford each scoring two tries. The win sets up a quarter-final match against Scotland, though England faces injury concerns for key players Ellie Kildunne and Hannah Botterman, who were both forced to leave the field.</p>

          <p>The recent Reform UK party conference in Birmingham demonstrates a significant scaling up of the party's operations and ambitions, according to political analysis. The event was vastly larger than previous gatherings, adopting the professional feel of a major party conference while maintaining an insurgent energy. This growth reflects the party's rising momentum over the past year, as it attempts to build a national volunteer network and professionalize its structure. Leader Nigel Farage concluded the event by calling for discipline and focus, signaling serious intent for future elections.</p>

          <p>The volume of postal traffic entering the United States has dropped by over 80% since the Trump administration eliminated a tariff exemption for low-value imports, according to the Universal Postal Union. The change requires duties to be collected on parcels valued under $800, a task that foreign postal operators and carriers were not equipped to handle, leading to major operational disruptions. As a result, 88 postal operators have suspended some or all services to the U.S., causing a near-halt in the flow of many international packages. (not investment advice)</p>

The order creates a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, modeled after the existing terrorism sponsor list, which can trigger economic sanctions and visa restrictions. The move aims to create new consequences for foreign governments that use Americans as political bargaining chips, providing the administration with another tool to secure the release of detained citizens abroad.</p>
