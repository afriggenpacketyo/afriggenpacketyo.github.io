          <p>A deadly mass shooting unfolded outside the Artis Lounge nightclub in Chicago's River North, leaving four people dead and at least fourteen others wounded. According to Chicago police, occupants of a dark SUV opened fire on a crowd leaving an album release party for rapper Mello Buckzz. The victims, ranging in age from 21 to 32, were transported to multiple hospitals with injuries from good to critical condition. While no arrests have been made, authorities believe three shooters were involved and have initiated a summary closure of the nightclub as the investigation continues into this tragic act of violence.</p>

          <p>Following the split verdict in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, an anonymous juror has spoken out against speculation that the celebrity's status influenced the outcome. The juror found such suggestions "highly insulting," emphasizing that the decision was based solely on the evidence presented during the extensive deliberation process. Combs was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering but convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He was subsequently denied bail and now faces a potential maximum sentence of 10 years for each of the two guilty counts.</p>

          <p>In the second Test match at Edgbaston, India has taken a commanding lead over England, largely due to a monumental score of 269 by captain Shubman Gill. His performance anchored India's first innings total of 587, the highest score by an Indian captain anywhere in the world. In response, England's top-order batsmen struggled significantly, collapsing to 77-3 by the close of the second day's play. Facing a substantial deficit, England now requires an exceptional and unlikely turnaround to avoid defeat and prevent India from leveling the series in a dominant fashion.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded a holiday-shortened week with record-breaking performance, as both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at all-time highs. This bullish momentum was largely fueled by the technology sector, with chipmaker Nvidia's market value soaring past $3.9 trillion. The market's strength represents a significant rebound from a volatile second quarter, further bolstered by positive news such as major banks increasing their dividends following favorable stress test results. Despite a strong jobs report potentially delaying Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, overall market sentiment remains highly optimistic. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. decision to halt certain missile and ammunition deliveries, pending a review of stockpiles, has fueled concerns among critics about America's commitment to supporting Ukraine.

          <p>A new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that a massive tax cut package championed by President Trump will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest U.S. households, with the largest windfalls concentrated in specific states. The top 1% of earners in Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas are projected to see their annual tax bills fall by over $100,000. These states, which lack personal income taxes, allow high-income residents to gain the most from the bill's provisions, such as extending the 2017 tax cuts, while being less affected by its cap on state and local tax deductions.

This move follows a recent ruling by the court's conservative majority that upheld state bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors.

The majority of these infections are concentrated in a severe outbreak in West Texas, which has resulted in over 750 cases and the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health officials attribute the surge in this highly contagious disease to declining vaccination rates, with national kindergarten vaccination coverage falling below the 95% threshold required for community immunity.

          <p>A skydiving plane carrying fifteen people crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, injuring everyone on board. Emergency crews responded to a mass casualty incident, finding the wreckage in a wooded area with several passengers requiring extrication. Three individuals are reported to be in critical condition, while others sustained less severe injuries. The pilot had reported engine trouble and was attempting to return to the airport when the crash occurred.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill" warns that its provision to repeal clean-energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act could be economically self-defeating. With U.S. electricity demand rising rapidly, the move would make new wind and solar projects significantly more expensive, likely leading to fewer being built. This could result in a sharp increase in energy prices and a greater risk of blackouts, potentially creating the worst energy affordability crisis since the 1970s. The article argues that the decision undermines U.S. energy supply at a critical time, driven more by partisan politics than sound economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece contends that "Trumpism" is defined by Trump's own impulses, not by any coherent ideology from his supposed intellectual allies.

          <p>As families prepare for the 2025-26 academic year, a key decision is whether to use federal or private student loans. Federal undergraduate loans for the upcoming year will have a fixed rate of 6.39%, offering accessibility to all borrowers regardless of credit history and providing key protections like forgiveness programs. However, private lenders are currently advertising rates as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit or a qualified co-signer, potentially offering substantial savings.

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted a Los Angeles activist for allegedly handing out protective face shields to demonstrators during a protest against immigration raids. Alejandro Orellana, a 29-year-old Marine veteran, faces charges of conspiracy and aiding and abetting civil disorder. Prosecutors claim he was helping protesters withstand less-lethal munitions from police after an unlawful assembly was declared. His supporters argue he was simply distributing personal protective equipment, including water and hand sanitizer, and that the charges are a politically motivated attempt to suppress pro-immigrant activism by the U.S. Attorney's office.</p>
