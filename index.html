            <h2>Puerto Rico Faces Island-Wide Blackout Ahead of Easter</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-16 22:16:20 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Puerto Rico experienced a complete power outage on Wednesday, impacting all 1.4 million customers and disrupting preparations for the Easter weekend. The outage stemmed from a failure in the southern part of the island, with preliminary analysis indicating a protection system failure compounded by vegetation on a transmission line. Luma Energy, responsible for power transmission and distribution, estimates that restoring power could take 48-72 hours, also affecting water services for at least 78,000 customers. The blackout has sparked widespread frustration, with calls for the government to reconsider its contracts with Luma and Genera PR, amidst ongoing struggles to rebuild the island's power grid since Hurricane Maria in 2017.</p>

Van Hollen met with American Embassy officials, human rights groups, and the Vice President of El Salvador to advocate for Abrego Garcia's return. The senator emphasized that the government of El Salvador could not provide evidence that Abrego Garcia was involved in MS-13, contradicting President Trump's claims about gang violence.

Experts acknowledge rising diagnoses and potential environmental factors but emphasize the expanding definition of autism and genetic roots. Kennedy's stance has drawn criticism from autism organizations who emphasize focusing on support for autistic individuals and their families.</p>

            <p>A Maryland judge is demanding the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, a man mistakenly deported to an El Salvador mega-prison by the Trump administration. Despite the government acknowledging the deportation as an "administrative error", they allege Ábrego García has ties to the MS-13 gang, which the judge disputes. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele claims he lacks the power to return Ábrego García, escalating the legal and diplomatic complications surrounding the case. The judge is requesting daily updates from the government on efforts to bring him back to the US.</p>

            <p>A decade-long study reveals a shift in American religious practices, with fewer people attending church services or identifying with a specific religion. While religious affiliation and church attendance have declined significantly, belief in God has not decreased as sharply, and practices like meditation have increased. The study suggests people are moving away from religious institutions toward more personalized spirituality, often due to conflicts with political values, particularly on issues like same-sex marriage. Researchers argue this reflects a transformation in how people practice faith, rather than a decline in belief itself.</p>

            <p>South Korea's central bank maintained its policy rate at 2.75% as the nation navigates challenges posed by U.S. tariffs and prepares for a snap presidential election in June.

This move occurs following the removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol from office and amidst concerns about economic growth and inflation, with the central bank lowering its 2025 growth outlook.

            <p>Japan's export growth in March rose by 3.9%, falling short of expectations as tariffs began to impact trade.

Trade negotiations between Japan and the U.S. are ongoing, with Trump indicating "big progress" regarding tariffs and trade fairness.

            <p>An investigation by the BBC World Service and BBC Verify reveals how weapons from the U.S. reach gang-ravaged Haiti, bypassing a UN embargo. The investigation traced a shipment of assault rifles and pistols from Florida to Haiti, highlighting lax laws, absent checks, and suspected corruption used by traffickers. It details how "straw buyers" are used to purchase weapons, which are then transported in small quantities. The report emphasizes the impact of gang violence in Haiti, where thousands have been killed and displaced.</p>

            <p>Emily Ley, owner of Florida stationery business Simplified, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over tariffs, alleging the illegal use of emergency powers. Ley argues that the tariffs, totaling 145% on her planners made in China, threaten her business and the jobs of her employees. She claims the tariffs have cost her company nearly $1.2 million since Trump's first term and could force her to drastically raise prices or eliminate positions. The White House maintains that the president has broad authority to impose tariffs to address national emergencies.</p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying an order to return Venezuelan migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison. Boasberg said the government "deliberately flouted" his orders, potentially setting the stage for a showdown between the President and the judicial branch. The judge could recommend criminal charges and appoint a private attorney to prosecute the case if the Justice Department refuses.

            <p>China is encouraging retirees to spend their savings to boost domestic consumption and offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. Initiatives like the "silver train" aim to promote tourism in rural areas, providing opportunities for older citizens to travel and spend money. The initiative hopes to turn an economic problem into an economic solution by giving older people a fun avenue to spend more. With a growing ageing population and low birthrates, China's leaders are hoping to increase domestic consumption to make up for lost export revenue.</p>

            <p>A new CDC study indicates that 1 in 31 children, or more than 3%, have been identified with autism, prompting discussion about the condition's prevalence and potential causes. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited the figures as evidence of a growing "epidemic" of autism, a claim criticized by experts and advocacy groups. While improved screening and access to services may contribute to the rise in diagnoses, researchers also suspect other factors may play a role. Kennedy announced efforts to identify environmental toxins linked to autism, though his promise to find an answer by September has been met with skepticism.</p>

            <p>After actress Aimee Lou Wood criticized a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her with exaggerated prosthetic teeth as "mean and unfunny," comedians are discussing the line between funny and offensive impressions. Some argue that impressions should not "punch down" by making fun of someone's appearance, while others believe that exaggeration is necessary for comedy. Some comedians suggest that being impersonated is a marker of fame, but others have faced backlash for impressions that are deemed offensive. The debate highlights the challenges of balancing humor with sensitivity in impersonations.</p>

            <p>Scientists have detected promising new hints of life on the distant planet K2-18b, located 700 trillion miles away, using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Researchers have found the chemical signature of molecules, dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS), that on Earth are only produced by simple organisms. The lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, believes that with more data, it can be confirmed if life exists on K2-18b within two years. While these results are promising, more data is needed to confirm the presence of these gases and their origin.</p>
