        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that China has "agreed to open up" following a temporary agreement between the two countries to slash tariffs on each other's goods. The U.S. will reduce tariffs on China to 30% from 145%, while China will lower tariffs on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. This agreement, set to begin Wednesday, also includes China suspending non-tariff countermeasures imposed on the U.S. since April 2, and Trump indicated that tariffs on China would not go back to 145%, even if a longer-term deal cannot be reached once the 90-day pause expires.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas since October 7, 2023, has been released following negotiations between the U.S. and Hamas.

His release is viewed as a goodwill gesture towards the Trump administration and a potential opening for broader conflict talks. While the U.S. didn't secure all concessions, including the remains of dead American hostages, Alexander's release marks a significant development in ongoing ceasefire efforts, with supporters celebrating in Tel Aviv and New Jersey.</p>

          <p>DNC Vice Chairman Malcolm Kenyatta criticized President Trump as a "punk" and "would-be dictator" at a town hall in Pennsylvania. Kenyatta accused Trump's administration of altering content on government websites, likening it to modern-day book burning. He asserted that Trump is not the first bully Americans have faced and that figures like Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick lack the "guts" to stand up to him. A White House spokesperson responded, dismissing Kenyatta as a "no-name state representative" with radical views.</p>

This outcome challenges Trump's dominance theater and suggests that submission to his demands often leads to further abuse. The article argues that Trump's approach undermines productive relationships and creates losses for all parties involved, advocating that standing up to Trump, while not guaranteeing victory, is better than succumbing to his exploitative tactics.</p>
