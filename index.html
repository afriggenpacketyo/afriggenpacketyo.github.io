          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan, confirming that all planes are safely returning home. The attack involved a full payload of bombs dropped on the primary site, Fordow, which is believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program due to its underground location and heavy defenses. These strikes follow escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, with Iran previously pledging retaliation if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault. The president plans to address the nation regarding this historic moment for the United States, Israel, and the world. The strikes occurred after Trump considered the risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, deeming it necessary to disable it due to the short timeframe for weapons production. </p>

          <p>President Trump publicly contradicted his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who testified in March that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, stating that she was "wrong." The White House maintains that Iran possesses everything required to construct a nuclear weapon swiftly, needing only the supreme leader's authorization. This disagreement arose as Trump considered joining Israel in strikes against Iran, ultimately announcing U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities shortly after. Gabbard accused media outlets of misinterpreting her testimony, asserting that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within weeks if they chose to do so. This disagreement highlights conflicting views within the administration regarding the immediacy of the Iranian nuclear threat.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, was released from ICE detention in Louisiana following a federal judge's order and has returned to New Jersey. Khalil, a green card holder, had been in ICE custody for over 100 days, with the Trump administration seeking his deportation due to his role in campus protests against Israel. Upon arrival, Khalil, accompanied by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, accused the Trump administration of trying to dehumanize immigrants and suppress pro-Palestine voices. The judge ruled that Khalil is neither a threat nor a flight risk, criticizing the government's actions as an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech, though deportation efforts may continue for other reasons.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever star Sophie Cunningham criticized the WNBA and its referees for not adequately protecting teammate Caitlin Clark, citing a build-up of incidents where Clark has been roughed up by opposing players without fouls being called. Cunningham gained attention after committing a hard foul on a Connecticut Sun player who poked Clark in the eye, leading to a brawl and ejections. She emphasized her commitment to protecting her teammates, particularly Clark, who has faced physical play and controversial no-calls since entering the league. Former NBA player Joakim Noah had previously suggested the Fever acquire an "enforcer" to protect Clark, and Cunningham's actions have resonated with fans, leading to a surge in her social media following.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling prevents a policy change that could have stripped universities of millions of dollars in research funding, particularly impacting critical work in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Judge Talwani deemed the change, which capped indirect costs at 15%, as arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful. The University of California estimated that the change would have cost them nearly $100 million annually, with similar caps on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health previously blocked by judges.</p>

Ambassador Mike Huckabee urged other U.S. citizens needing assistance to register with the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. The U.S. has also issued a Level 4 travel advisory for Israel, advising against travel due to armed conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest, as several commercial airlines have suspended flights from Israel to the United States.</p>

Fordo, located deep beneath a mountain and protected by air defenses, is considered a key uranium enrichment site. The MOP is designed to attack deeply buried facilities and hardened bunkers, weighing nearly 30,000 pounds and capable of penetrating up to 200 feet underground before exploding. The B-2 Spirit, known for its stealth capabilities, is the only aircraft in the Air Force equipped to carry and deploy the MOP, making it a critical asset in potential strikes against Iran's heavily defended nuclear sites.</p>

          <p>The Fordo nuclear facility in Iran has long been a focus of international concern due to its underground location and suspected role in clandestine efforts to develop nuclear weapons capabilities. Despite Iran's denial of any intention to build nuclear weapons, Israel claims to have intelligence indicating a secret program for conducting experiments required for weapon construction. Fordo, buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain, is considered by experts as the most likely location for a hypothetical nuclear weapons "breakout" program. The IAEA has declared Iran non-compliant with its monitoring efforts, raising concerns about the lack of transparency regarding the work being conducted at the facility.</p>

          <p>Pop-punk band South Arcade is finding success by tapping into the growing interest in Y2K core, drawing inspiration from 90s and early 2000s culture. The band's sound, reminiscent of MTV and 90s slasher movie soundtracks, appeals to both older fans who remember the era and younger listeners discovering it for the first time. South Arcade gained traction on TikTok, where the Y2K hashtag is popular, and their music evokes a sense of escapism and nostalgia for a time when personal expression was more tangible and less reliant on social media. The band's success reflects a broader trend of artists and audiences embracing the sounds and styles of the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, giant statues of Michael Jackson were erected around the world to promote his album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. While some of these fibreglass titans have disappeared, others remain in unexpected locations. One statue stood for decades at a McDonald's in the Netherlands before being removed due to the Leaving Neverland documentary. Another resides in the courtyard of an abandoned nightclub in Austria, while a third can be found at a Swiss fairground. A repainted statue has even been spotted in a now-abandoned theme park in South Africa, showcasing the enduring legacy and varied fates of these iconic monuments.</p>

          <p>Social media is awash with advice on how to lower cortisol levels, a stress hormone linked to various health problems, but experts warn against relying on "quick fixes" that may not address the underlying causes of stress. A BBC article explores the potential dangers of these trends, noting that some social media hacks not only fail to address the real issues many people might be experiencing, but can also prevent those who need medical treatment from seeking help. Experts recommend seeking professional advice and addressing the root causes of stress through therapy, mindfulness, and lifestyle changes, rather than relying on unproven remedies.</p>

          <p>A hot air balloon accident in Praia Grande, southern Brazil, resulted in the deaths of at least eight people. There were 21 people on board the balloon when a fire reportedly started inside the basket, prompting the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. The pilot instructed passengers to jump, but some were unable to do so before the balloon began to rise again due to the reduced weight, eventually falling due to a loss of suspension. The victims included couples, a mother and daughter, an ophthalmologist, and a figure skater, while the surviving passengers were taken to nearby hospitals.</p>

The heat wave is expected to last through the first half of next week, with parts of the Northeast facing a "High Risk" of extreme heat.

The Lib Dems claim the plans will "urgently" boost to the number of trained soldiers from just under 71,000 to more than 73,000.  The government should also distribute pamphlets to make sure every British home is "war-ready" and able to deal with blackouts and chaos caused by the outbreak of conflict or cyber-attacks, Lib Dem Leader Sir Ed Davey said.
