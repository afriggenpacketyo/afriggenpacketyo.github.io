          <p>A major explosion struck the Rajaei port outside Bandar Abbas in southern Iran, killing four and injuring over 500 people.

While the cause remains undetermined, authorities have ruled out energy infrastructure as the source. The incident happened as Iran and the United States engaged in nuclear program negotiations in Oman, adding to regional tensions, and the explosion could have significant implications for trade given the port's importance.

          <p>A parenting coach warns against the common phrase "You're okay" when children experience emotional distress, arguing it can be detrimental to their emotional development.

By providing support rather than dismissal, parents can help children develop a healthy stress response and build trust. Optimism Score: 80</p>

          <p>Ukraine has drafted a counterproposal to a Trump administration peace plan, suggesting potential compromises while maintaining some key demands. The plan includes no restrictions on the Ukrainian military and a European security contingent backed by the U.S., but omits insistence on regaining all territory or joining NATO. President Trump and President Zelenskyy met in Vatican City to discuss the situation, signaling ongoing efforts to find a resolution. The plan is a possible attempt to find common ground.
