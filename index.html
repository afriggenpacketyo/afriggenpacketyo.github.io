          <p>Search and recovery operations in Kerr County, Texas, were temporarily halted due to a renewed threat of flash flooding. This complicates efforts to find the 161 people still missing from the catastrophic July 4th floods, which caused the Guadalupe River to overflow and resulted in at least 132 deaths statewide. Authorities issued new warnings and evacuations as heavy rain fell on already saturated ground, creating a dangerous situation for both residents and search crews. The ongoing crisis highlights the vulnerability of Texas's Hill Country to extreme weather events.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 23:09:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports saw a significant 5.8% year-over-year increase in June, surpassing market predictions and accelerating from May's growth. This surge is attributed to exporters rushing shipments during a 90-day tariff truce with the United States. Imports also unexpectedly rose by 1.1%, contrasting with forecasts of a decline and marking a sharp reversal from the previous month's contraction. The combined data resulted in a substantial trade surplus of nearly $114.8 billion for the month, indicating some short-term resilience in China's trade sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A rapidly expanding wildfire in the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire grew to 5,000 acres, fueled by strong winds, and also caused a chlorine gas leak from a damaged water treatment facility, forcing firefighter evacuations. Meanwhile, smoke from extensive wildfires in Canada has drifted south, causing poor air quality across the Upper Midwest, with health warnings issued in several states. These events highlight a dual environmental crisis of active fires in the Southwest and widespread air pollution in the Midwest.</p>

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a powerful symbol for women's rights in France, has been named a knight of the Legion of Honor, the country's highest civilian award. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony against her ex-husband, who drugged her and invited dozens of men to sexually assault her over a decade. Her case, which resulted in the conviction of her ex-husband and 50 accomplices, shocked the nation and sparked a national debate on sexual violence. Pelicot's advocacy was instrumental in the French Senate passing a bill to include lack of consent in the legal definition of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, a significant reversal from the 0.5% contraction in the first quarter, thereby avoiding a technical recession. The growth, which beat economists' forecasts, was largely driven by a strong 5.5% year-over-year expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of "significant uncertainty and downside risks" for the rest of the year, primarily due to unclear U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank has recently loosened monetary policy amid these global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A violent sequence of events in Lexington, Kentucky, left two churchgoers and the suspect dead. The incident began when a man shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop, then carjacked a vehicle and fled to the Richmond Road Baptist Church. Inside the church, he shot and killed two women, identified as Beverly Gum, 72, and Christina Combs, 32, and wounded two other men before being fatally shot by responding police officers. Authorities believe the shooter may have had a connection to the victims at the church, and an investigation into the motive is ongoing.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded the first half of the MLB season with a 5-2 extra-innings win against the San Francisco Giants, solidifying their position atop the National League West. The game reflected their season's uneven nature, featuring a stellar seven-inning scoreless performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, but also a blown save by closer Tanner Scott in the ninth. The offense, led by key hits from Freddie Freeman, rallied in the 11th inning to secure the victory. Despite some inconsistencies, the Dodgers enter the All-Star break with the best record in the NL.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing a "notably different" climate compared to just a few decades ago, with extreme weather events becoming the new normal, according to a new Met Office report. The country is breaking heat and rainfall records with increasing frequency, experiencing more very hot days and wetter winters. The report highlights that the 2015-2024 period was 1.24°C warmer than the 1961-1990 average, and sea levels are rising faster than the global average. This ongoing shift, driven by global warming, is impacting the natural world and increasing risks like flooding and drought across the nation.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, admired by some international conservatives for his "illiberal democracy" model, is facing significant political challenges at home. While his playbook of targeting liberal values and consolidating power has been successful for over a decade, a new challenger from the center-right, Peter Magyar, is gaining traction. Magyar is capitalizing on public discontent over corruption and the declining state of public services like hospitals and schools. As Orban's Fidesz party sees its polling lead shrink, the upcoming 2026 election is shaping up to be his toughest challenge in years.</p>

          <p>A severe, multi-year drought is intensifying a long-running water dispute between the United States and Mexico under an 81-year-old treaty. Mexico has fallen behind on its obligation to deliver water from the Rio Grande to Texas, which is also suffering from the drought. In response, the Trump administration has threatened to withhold a much larger allocation of water that the U.S. sends to Mexico from the Colorado River. Farmers on both sides of the border face existential threats, with Mexican farmers arguing there is no water to give and Texan farmers accusing them of hoarding the scarce resource.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to impose a 50% tariff on Brazil, despite the U.S. having a trade surplus with the country. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett argued the move is part of a broader global strategy to onshore production and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains for national security. When questioned how a criminal case against Brazil's former president constitutes a national security threat, Hassett pivoted to the administration's overall goal of tackling the U.S. trade deficit collectively. The defense comes amid criticism that the tariffs will harm U.S. firms. (not investment advice)</p>

The shortened set and fewer-than-expected special guests left many in the crowd feeling shortchanged, especially compared to his longer performances on the previous two nights. The abrupt ending and subsequent chaos at an accessible exit marred the conclusion of the high-profile festival.</p>
