          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 22:02:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey revealed that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in May, showing its fastest decline since September 2022. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell below 50, indicating contraction for the first time since last year. This reinforces calls for stronger stimulus measures to support growth in the tariff-impacted economy. The private survey aligns with official data indicating a contraction in manufacturing activity for the second consecutive month, highlighting the need for stabilization in the sector. Optimism surrounding China's economic recovery is waning as the manufacturing sector struggles to regain momentum.</p>

          <p>Andrew Yang Nien-dzu, former Taiwanese defense official, warned that the risk of a cross-strait military accident is increasing due to heightened pressure from Beijing and a lack of direct communication channels. Yang expressed concern over Beijing's increasing "grey zone operations," including more frequent activities by its coastguard forces near Taiwan. These operations are difficult to handle as they carry a military message without being actual military operations, placing immense pressure on Taiwan. Formal talks between Beijing and Taipei have been suspended since 2016, further exacerbating the risk of miscalculation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump criticized the Court of International Trade after it ruled against his global trade tariffs, attributing the decision to "Trump Derangement Syndrome." He also attacked Leonard Leo and the Federalist Society, blaming them for bad judicial nominations. The article argues that Trump demands servile loyalty from all branches, including the judiciary, and sees any ruling against him as illegitimate. The author contends that the courts are acting as a check on Trump's overreach of authority due to Congressional inaction, leading to the White House's denouncements of "unelected" and "rogue" judges.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively lobbying Senate Republicans to support the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a massive tax bill that encompasses much of the Republican legislative agenda. The White House is planning an "all-out advocacy effort," with administration officials pressuring senators and potentially traveling to states to garner support. Key sticking points include concerns about the bill's cost and potential Medicaid cuts, requiring a delicate political balancing act given the narrow Republican majority in both the House and Senate. The White House acknowledges limited room for maneuver, emphasizing the House's framework as the foundation for the legislation.</p>

          <p>One of the eaglets, Sunny, born to famed bald eagle parents Jackie and Shadow in Big Bear, California, has taken its first flight from the nest. The eaglet's flight occurred after days of practicing wing flapping and jumping on the outer rails of the nest. While Sunny has left the nest, Gizmo, the other eaglet, remains, with it being unclear when it will be ready to fly. Both eaglets are expected to remain in the habitat for one to three months after fledging before venturing out on their own.</p>
