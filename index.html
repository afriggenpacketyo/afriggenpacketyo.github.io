          <p>Venezuela's Attorney General has launched an investigation into allegations that over 250 Venezuelan migrants were tortured in an El Salvador prison. The migrants, who had been deported from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act as suspected gang members, were returned to Venezuela in a prisoner exchange. Detainees allege they suffered beatings, sexual abuse, and denial of medical care in the notorious CECOT prison. The Venezuelan government is now providing medical and legal support to the returned citizens while seeking accountability from Salvadoran officials.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 03:26:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines how Hollywood films are altered by censors in various countries to comply with local cultural and political norms. Examples include India shortening a kiss in "Superman," Russia removing homosexual content from "Rocketman," and China creating an alternate, more socially acceptable ending for "Minions: The Rise of Gru." The piece details how studios sometimes self-censor to gain access to lucrative markets like China, a practice that critics argue leads to troubling compromises on free expression. These modifications range from digital alterations to adding entirely new scenes for specific markets.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 03:23:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 240,000 pages of FBI surveillance records concerning the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The release proceeded despite opposition from King's family, who urged the public to approach the documents with empathy and historical context, calling the timing unfortunate. Civil rights figures like Reverend Al Sharpton have criticized the move, suggesting it is a distraction from other political issues. The King Center emphasized that the focus should remain on continuing the fight against injustice, which was central to MLK's life and work.</p>

          <p>The World Health Organization has strongly condemned recent Israeli attacks on its facilities in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, during a major ground offensive. The agency reported that a residence housing its staff and their families was struck, and its main warehouse was attacked and destroyed, crippling humanitarian efforts. According to the WHO, Israeli forces entered the premises, detained staff members, and forced women and children to evacuate on foot amid the conflict. This development severely compromises the WHO's ability to support Gaza's collapsing health system as the humanitarian crisis deepens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's government borrowing reached £20.7 billion in June, a figure significantly higher than anticipated and an increase of £6.6 billion from the previous year. The Office for National Statistics attributed the rise to increased spending on public services and a sharp jump in debt interest payments, which have nearly doubled due to inflation-linked debt. This was the second-highest June borrowing figure on record, fueling speculation about potential tax increases in the upcoming Autumn Budget. Economists suggest this data puts additional pressure on public finances amid weak economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is conducting a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, with former leadership rival Sir James Cleverly expected to return to a prominent front-bench role. The move is described by a party source as part of the next phase of policy renewal and an effort to underline party unity. This shake-up is larger than initially anticipated and is seen as an attempt to strengthen the opposition's challenge to the current Labour government. The Labour Party has dismissed the changes as shuffling "the same old faces that were responsible for 14 years of failure."</p>

          <p>Heavy monsoon rains have triggered deadly flash floods in northern Pakistan, killing at least three tourists and leaving fifteen others missing after their vehicles were swept away. The incident, caused by a cloudburst on Monday, also led to landslides that blocked a major highway and stranded over 200 other tourists. Army helicopters were deployed for evacuations. Since late June, abnormal monsoon rains, which experts link to climate change, have resulted in at least 225 deaths across the country. Authorities had previously issued warnings against travel to the region due to the high risk of such events.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins, but the win was overshadowed by a potentially significant injury to closer Tanner Scott. Scott left the game in the ninth inning with a forearm injury after feeling a "stinging sensation" and will undergo an MRI. The game featured a strong performance from Shohei Ohtani, who hit a two-run homer and pitched three solid innings. However, the potential loss of Scott, a key free-agent signing, is a major concern for the Dodgers' already injury-plagued pitching staff as they navigate the second half of the season.</p>

          <p>The new "Elvis Evolution" immersive experience in London has drawn sharp criticism from some attendees, who have labeled it "atrocious and misleading." Many fans, who paid up to £300 for tickets, were expecting a holographic concert as initially advertised, but instead found a show featuring upscaled archive footage and live actors. The creator, Layered Reality, stated they made a creative decision not to mimic Elvis's performances but acknowledged the initial confusion. While some attendees have demanded refunds, feeling they were scammed, the company maintains that many have praised the show as a unique theatrical experience.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court justice has threatened to imprison former President Jair Bolsonaro for violating a ban on using social media. The ban was imposed as part of an investigation into allegations that Bolsonaro planned a coup. The violation occurred when allies circulated a video of a speech he gave to journalists, which the judge argued was intended for social media distribution. This incident has sparked a debate in Brazil over the scope of such bans. Bolsonaro is also under scrutiny for allegedly seeking interference from former U.S. President Donald Trump in his legal matters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes how U.S. President Donald Trump has increasingly used tariffs as a flexible and unilateral foreign policy tool, often for objectives typically pursued through sanctions. Unlike sanctions, tariffs can be deployed quickly without congressional approval and generate revenue, aligning with Trump's "America First" agenda. He has threatened tariffs to pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration and has even proposed "secondary tariffs" on nations trading with adversaries. While this approach provides leverage, critics warn that the resulting uncertainty and "tariff tango" risk destabilizing global trade and could lead to serious economic slowdowns.

          <p>San Francisco is moving to ban homeless individuals from living in recreational vehicles by implementing strict new citywide parking limits. The policy, awaiting final approval, targets hundreds of RVs that serve as homes for people unable to afford rent. Mayor Daniel Lurie supports the measure as necessary for street cleanliness, while a permit program will offer a temporary exemption for some current RV residents who agree to work with the city to find traditional housing. Critics argue the plan is cruel, as there is insufficient housing available, and will displace vulnerable people from their only shelter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this opinion piece, writer Ana Schnabl reflects on the narrow expectations faced by authors from the Balkans in the Western literary market. She argues that U.S. and UK publishers often prioritize stories that explain the region's political context or focus on historical trauma, effectively requiring Balkan writers to self-exoticize. This unspoken condition, she contends, presumes the region is primarily a source of tragedy and overlooks a diverse range of universal human stories that don't fit a "problematic" or "traumatic" narrative. Schnabl calls for publishers to embrace the region's full literary diversity beyond reinforcing established perceptions.</p>
