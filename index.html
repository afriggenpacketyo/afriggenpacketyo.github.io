          <p>A tragic explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility resulted in the deaths of three veteran deputies. The victims, identified as Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn, were all members of the Special Enforcement Bureau's Arson Explosives Detail and had a combined 74 years of service. The incident is currently under investigation, with authorities exploring a possible connection to explosives seized a day earlier in Santa Monica. The department and community are mourning the loss of these dedicated officers.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in a 2-0 loss against the Milwaukee Brewers, signaling a positive step in his return from injury. Glasnow, who has struggled with injuries and consistency, pitched six innings and allowed only one run, demonstrating increased velocity and a more athletic, less mechanical approach. Although the Dodgers' offense was shut out, Glasnow's outing provides hope for the team's starting rotation as they aim for a World Series repeat. The focus for him moving forward is maintaining health and dependability.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China regarding strategies to counter economic coercion. The hearing comes after a period of strained relations between Australia and China during Morrison's tenure, which saw Beijing impose tariffs on Australian goods. Morrison's successor, Anthony Albanese, has recently visited China, signaling a warming of diplomatic ties. The panel will also hear from Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan and a vocal critic of China's economic practices.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Afghans whose personal data was leaked by the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) are not expected to receive compensation. The MoD stated it would "robustly defend" against legal action, citing an independent review that found it unlikely individuals would be targeted solely for being on the leaked spreadsheet. The breach exposed the details of over 19,000 people who had applied for relocation, raising fears of retribution from the Taliban. The government has spent £400 million on the relocation scheme but faces lawsuits from over 1,000 affected Afghans.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an ankle monitor and adhere to a nighttime curfew amid an investigation into an alleged coup plot. The judge also banned him from social media and from contacting his son and foreign diplomats, citing fears he might abscond or obstruct justice. The restrictions follow a police raid on his home and come as the Trump administration revoked visas for Brazilian judicial officials involved in the case. Bolsonaro, who denies the charges, could face decades in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom are under an amber weather warning for thunderstorms and torrential rain, with a risk of dangerous flash flooding over the weekend. The Met Office forecasts that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, leading to potential property damage, power cuts, and significant transport disruption. The severe downpours follow a recent heatwave, which has left the ground dry and less able to absorb water, exacerbating the flood risk. The warning covers London and a stretch of the south coast.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced the elimination of its primary scientific research division, the Office of Research and Development (ORD). The move is part of a broader agency reorganization and is expected to impact over 1,500 employees, including many leading scientists.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) condemned the local authorities for making "blind decisions out of touch with reality."

          <p>Scientists at China's Army Engineering University have proposed a new "X-railgun" design that could nearly double the power of the navy's existing electromagnetic weapon. The current naval railgun, a global first, is limited by the immense power required, which restricts projectile weight and effectiveness. The new design involves cross-stacking two railguns, theoretically allowing for heavier 30kg projectiles to be fired at Mach 7. The research paper highlights that this innovation is needed to overcome the current weapon's power limitations and advance its military application.</p>

          <p>In an interview, acting ICE director Todd Lyons confirmed that the agency will use government data from programs like Medicaid to locate and arrest immigrants, including those with criminal records. Lyons also stated that while he is not a "proponent" of agents wearing masks during arrests, he will continue to allow the practice due to concerns for officer safety amid a reported 800% increase in attacks. He attributed the rise in confrontations to an expansion of immigration arrests and more cities adopting "sanctuary" policies that limit cooperation with ICE.</p>

          <p>A senior South African police officer, Gen. Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, has alleged that organized crime has infiltrated the highest levels of government, specifically accusing the Police Minister of having ties to criminal gangs. In a televised address, Mkhwanazi claimed his boss shut down an elite unit investigating political murders after it uncovered a powerful drug cartel. Despite the minister's denial, Mkhwanazi has received widespread public support, with many seeing him as a no-nonsense officer fighting corruption in a country where trust in the police is at an all-time low.</p>

          <p>Shares of fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, surged over 10% in extended trading after it was announced that it will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally as index-tracking funds are required to purchase the company's shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite being down 14% for the year, Block's addition reflects the growing market capitalization of technology firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After days of criticizing the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, many prominent MAGA supporters are now rallying to the president's defense. The shift followed a Wall Street Journal article about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, which the president has denied and is now suing over. This, combined with the administration's subsequent move to seek the release of grand jury testimony, has redirected supporters' anger towards the media. The incident appears to have unified the base against a common adversary, cooling internal backlash for now.</p>

While the provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if travelers comply with their visa conditions, details on implementation are scarce.

          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to the White House physician. The condition, described as "benign and common" in older adults, occurs when leg veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool. While it can cause aching or heaviness, it is often manageable with lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise. The president's doctor stated that the condition is mild and that Trump remains in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, a controversial plan by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has announced its next phase: a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub.

The project's CEO, Jan Sramek, pitched the plan as restoring the "designed in California, made in California" model. However, the project continues to face skepticism from local community groups.</p>

The format faces challenges from streaming, declining advertising revenue, and competition from online creators.

          <p>Experts are predicting a significant increase in the wasp population in the UK this summer, likely due to the warm and dry spring weather. While many people dislike the insects, experts emphasize their crucial role in the ecosystem as apex predators and natural pest controllers. The common wasp appears to be thriving, bucking the trend of decline seen in many other global insect populations. To coexist peacefully, people are advised to avoid agitating the insects and can distract them with a sweet substance placed away from picnic areas.</p>
