        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the city of Chicago following Mayor Brandon Johnson's remarks about prioritizing the hiring of Black officials in his administration. The DOJ's probe, initiated after Johnson touted the diversity of his administration, centers on whether hiring decisions were made solely on the basis of race, potentially violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Johnson defended his approach by stating his administration aims to address historical underrepresentation and ensure equitable opportunities for Black residents, but critics argue his comments suggest discriminatory hiring practices. The investigation unfolds amidst a broader federal crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump's efforts to persuade House Republicans to support a major tax bill have stalled due to opposition from the 'SALT Caucus,' a group of representatives from blue states who argue the bill does not adequately address the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions. The 2017 tax bill capped the SALT deduction at $10,000, disproportionately affecting residents in states with high state and local taxes, leading to voter dissatisfaction. Despite Trump's direct appeal and proposed increases to the deduction cap, the SALT Caucus remains firm in their opposition, potentially jeopardizing the bill's passage before Memorial Day weekend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many borrowers burdened with high-interest credit card debt may find surprising features in debt relief programs. For instance, being behind on payments can sometimes help qualify for debt forgiveness, as it demonstrates an inability to pay. Smaller debt amounts, such as $5,000 or more, may also qualify for relief, and taking out a debt consolidation loan can be advantageous by streamlining debt payoff with lower interest rates. Exploring options like credit card debt forgiveness, debt management programs, and debt consolidation loans can significantly improve financial health by reducing outstanding debt and simplifying repayment strategies.

          <p>While debt forgiveness can offer a path to becoming debt-free, it generally hurts your credit score, though it may not ruin it entirely. Settling a debt is usually marked as "settled" rather than "paid in full," raising concerns for future lenders and potentially lowering your credit score. Although debt forgiveness stays on your credit report for seven years, its impact lessens over time with responsible financial behavior. Whether debt forgiveness is worth the credit damage depends on your financial situation and goals, and it can be a preferable alternative to bankruptcy for those on the verge of it.</p>

          <p>The Senate has advanced the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating some cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins, which are pegged to the value of other assets. This industry-backed measure establishes rules for stablecoin issuers, mandating that firms hold reserves of assets underlying the cryptocurrency to protect consumers. Supporters believe the act will formalize a key segment of the cryptocurrency industry, offering safeguards for consumers and growing the digital currency market. Critics, however, argue that the bill's regulations are weak and fail to adequately address conflict-of-interest concerns, exemplified by President Trump's dealings in stablecoins.</p>

          <p>During a Senate hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus as a presidential authority to deport individuals, leading to sharp criticism from Democratic senators. In reality, habeas corpus is a constitutional principle that protects individuals from unlawful imprisonment by allowing them to challenge their detention in court. Noem later stated her support for habeas corpus but also claimed the president has the authority to suspend it, a notion contradicted by constitutional principles. The incident highlights concerns about the administration's understanding of basic constitutional rights amid discussions about ending due process protections for undocumented migrants.</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail has been arrested and charged with assisting ten inmates in a brazen escape. Sterling Williams, the worker, is accused of shutting off water to the cell, allowing the inmates to remove a toilet and sink fixture from the wall. Williams claimed he was threatened by an inmate to turn off the water, but instead of reporting the threat, he complied, enabling the escape. Four of the escapees have been captured, and a manhunt is ongoing for the remaining six.</p>

Prosecutors argued that the evidence indicated a premeditated murder, as the blood spatter suggested Jason was struck while on the ground.

          <p>Seniors should evaluate how their retirement savings and plans have changed, especially given the recent market volatility, and consider if they should delay securing a long-term care insurance plan. They should also consider the possibility of needing to move into an assisted living facility. Long-term care insurance can help cover the costs of assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and in-home caretakers. By closely examining the costs of a plan versus future out-of-pocket expenses, seniors can determine if securing a plan now makes financial sense.</p>

          <p>Home electricity bills are expected to reach a 12-year high this summer, averaging $784, due to high temperatures and rising electricity prices. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) attributes the increase to the rising cost of electricity outpacing inflation, combined with the need for more cooling. Low-income families, who already spend a larger share of their income on energy, may struggle to afford keeping their homes cool, potentially leading to health risks. Experts recommend modernizing homes to improve energy efficiency and calling for state and federal assistance programs to be updated.</p>

          <p>The United States is facing its worst commercial honeybee crash on record, with an estimated 62 percent of colonies lost. The Trump administration's federal funding cuts have scrambled the USDA's ability to respond, potentially impacting beekeepers' ability to rebuild and adjust for new threats. The USDA has typically identified the causes of bee die-offs and provided financial aid to beekeepers, but this year's report is delayed, and funding is expected to be lower. Experts fear that without fully funded USDA labs, beekeepers won't know why their colonies are dying, threatening food production.</p>
