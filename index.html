          <p>China's military is training soldiers in an ancient mental calculation technique to serve as 'human abacuses' in combat situations where modern technology might fail. A recent state media broadcast showcased a drill where a soldier, using these mental math skills, accurately predicted the trajectories of multiple targets in seconds after a simulated radar failure. This training highlights a strategy to build resilience and operational continuity by ensuring personnel can perform critical tasks without relying solely on advanced digital or electronic systems. The promotion of such skills aligns with a broader national push to bolster military confidence and capability.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, has officially launched her campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2026, setting up a potential challenge against long-serving Republican moderate Susan Collins. Mills, who was reelected as governor by a significant margin, is seen by national Democrats as a strong contender in a critical race. However, her entry also sets the stage for a contentious primary, as progressive figures like Senator Bernie Sanders are backing a younger, first-time candidate. The race is expected to highlight internal party tensions over generational change and strategic direction following the Democrats' difficult 2024 election cycle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sharp political divide has emerged regarding the nature of Antifa, with some Democratic lawmakers and liberal commentators claiming it is a 'made up' concept or a disorganized ideology rather than a formal group. This narrative counters the Trump administration's stance, which has labeled Antifa a domestic terrorist organization and deployed the National Guard to address protests in Portland, Oregon. The White House points to numerous documented incidents of violence, property damage, and clashes with law enforcement as evidence of a tangible threat. This debate echoes similar arguments from 2020, highlighting the persistent and polarized disagreement over the group's structure and impact.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at increasing online safety for children, imposing new regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms. One landmark law requires AI chatbots to disclose their nature and periodically remind minor users to take breaks, while also implementing safeguards against harmful content. Other legislation mandates social media apps to display mental health warnings and increases penalties for the distribution of deepfake pornography. These laws position California at the forefront of tech regulation, forcing companies like Apple, Google, and Meta to adapt their business models to prioritize youth protection.</p>

          <p>A new drug named lenacapavir, administered as an injection just twice a year, has demonstrated nearly 100% effectiveness in preventing HIV infection in clinical trials, marking a major advancement in public health. Unlike daily PrEP pills, the long-acting injectable removes challenges related to adherence and stigma, offering a discreet and highly effective prevention method. The Trump administration plans to make the drug central to its global health strategy, aiming to roll it out in several low-income countries by 2026. However, its real-world impact will depend on overcoming political hurdles and ensuring equitable distribution beyond initial target groups.</p>

          <p>Economic historian Joel Mokyr has been co-awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in economics for his extensive research explaining the drivers of the Industrial Revolution and sustained economic growth. Mokyr's work highlights that Britain's success around 1800 stemmed from its ability to operationalize Enlightenment-era scientific breakthroughs into practical, economy-boosting inventions. He argues that a skilled class of entrepreneurs and artisans, combined with political institutions open to disruptive change, was the crucial ingredient that translated macro-inventions into widespread productivity gains. This historical perspective offers context for contemporary debates surrounding the economic impact of disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence.</p>

Coote had previously been sacked from his refereeing position over unrelated controversial comments made in 2020 about a former football manager.</p>

          <p>A high-profile UK prosecution against two men accused of spying for China has unexpectedly collapsed just weeks before the trial was scheduled to begin. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) stated the case was dropped because it could not obtain necessary government evidence officially designating China as a 'national security threat' at the time of the alleged offenses. This has sparked a political dispute, with the current Labour government and the previous Conservative government blaming each other for the failure. Downing Street insists the decision was solely made by the CPS without political interference, though critics question the handling of the evidence.</p>

More than 20 other prominent figures, including Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kara-Murza, are also being investigated. Khodorkovsky, who has lived in exile since 2013, dismissed the accusations as a politically motivated response to a recent European human rights initiative engaging with Russian democratic organizers.</p>

          <p>Recent academic research on 'democratic U-turns'—where a country slides toward authoritarianism before recovering—offers a complex outlook for nations like the United States. One study found that 90% of such reversals since 1900 resulted in restored or improved democracy. However, a second study focusing on recent cases found that nearly 90% of these recoveries were short-lived, with democratic scores declining again within five years. This suggests that while modern democracies are resilient against outright collapse, they may be entering a phase of 'democratic careening,' characterized by persistent instability and recurring threats from authoritarian movements that retain significant political support.</p>

Experts suggest that both sides agreed to the ceasefire due to immense international pressure but remain deeply divided on 'day after' governance and security arrangements.

          <p>OpenAI is aggressively moving to control its entire technology stack, from AI models to the underlying hardware, with a series of major deals that position it as a competitor to hyperscalers. The company announced a partnership with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerator chips and racks, optimized specifically for its own workloads. This is part of a broader infrastructure campaign called Stargate, which also includes massive deals with Nvidia and AMD for GPUs. These moves, combined with the acquisition of Jony Ive's hardware startup, signal OpenAI's ambition to build a complete, vertically integrated AI ecosystem.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Trump administration's 'Compact for Academic Excellence,' proposed to nine universities including USC, is a flawed and ideologically driven document. The authors criticize its demands, such as prohibiting tuition hikes and limiting foreign students, as a blueprint for financial distress rather than reform. They also contend that its warnings against using race in hiring and admissions are redundant, as these practices are already governed by settled law. The piece concludes that the compact, which appears to lift language from a conservative group's memo, is a 'dismally researched' attempt to legislate ideology and should be rejected.</p>

          <p>Kenvue, the parent company of Tylenol, is facing a strategic crisis after President Trump and his health secretary publicly linked the painkiller to autism, costing the company $10 billion in market value. This development complicates an ongoing strategic review, which could include a sale or breakup of the consumer health giant. Dealmakers now view the company as 'unsellable' due to the heightened litigation risk and potential for a prolonged sales decline in one of its biggest brands. The administration's statements have created a public relations and legal firestorm, severely limiting Kenvue's M&A options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A West Palm Beach psychiatrist is emphasizing the profound connection between female hormones, breast health, and mental well-being, particularly for women undergoing breast cancer treatment. Dr. Kristi Wragg explains that hormones like estrogen and progesterone directly influence brain neurotransmitters that control mood and anxiety. Treatments such as tamoxifen, which block estrogen to fight cancer, can induce a sudden, intense menopause, leading to side effects like cognitive fog, irritability, and depression. She urges women to understand these changes as biological reactions, not personal failings, and to advocate for their mental health with the same vigilance as their physical screenings.</p>

          <p>A nonpartisan watchdog group, led by former ethics officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations, is calling for a Justice Department investigation into the federal prosecutions of former FBI Director James Comey and New York AG Letitia James. In a letter to the inspector general, the group alleges the indictments were pursued by an interim U.S. Attorney to fulfill President Trump's 'personal vendetta' against his political adversaries. They argue the cases represent 'egregious examples of vindictive and meritless prosecution,' pointing to the timing of the charges shortly after the president publicly called for their prosecution.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a bill that would have required data centers to report their water usage, citing a reluctance to 'impose rigid reporting requirements' on the rapidly growing tech sector. The legislation was introduced to address concerns about the significant water footprint of these facilities, especially as the AI boom drives a construction surge in the arid state. While Newsom signed other water-related bills concerning conservation goals and theft, his veto on data center transparency was a victory for business groups. Proponents of the bill argued it was a reasonable step toward balancing technological innovation with sustainable resource management.</p>

A visitor captured the 'terrifying' moment, which left a large crack just inches from her face. Zoo officials stated that no one was injured and that such charging behaviors are common for adolescent male gorillas establishing dominance. The enclosure's glass has three layers for safety, and the exhibit was temporarily closed for repairs. A similar incident involving another gorilla occurred at the zoo in 2020.</p>

          <p>The rapid construction of data centers, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom, is creating significant environmental and economic risks across the United States. These massive facilities consume vast amounts of electricity and water, leading to local opposition over concerns about strained power grids, depleted water supplies, and rising utility costs. While proponents highlight economic benefits and the need for U.S. competitiveness in AI, communities are increasingly pushing back against the industry's environmental footprint. The challenge lies in balancing the demand for computing power with sustainable resource management and transparent corporate practices.</p>
