          <p>Representatives from Russia and Ukraine met in Istanbul to discuss a potential cease-fire, though expectations for a breakthrough were low.

          <p>Americans for Prosperity, a GOP-friendly organization, is launching a $4 million advertising campaign to bolster support for President Trump's tax agenda in the Senate. The campaign aims to influence Republican senators who have expressed concerns about the bill, which includes extensions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Medicaid work requirements, and a debt ceiling increase. The ads will feature testimonials highlighting the impact of the 2017 tax cuts and encouraging fiscal hawks to find spending offsets. Democrats are resisting the legislation, setting up a potential messaging battle for the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>WorldPride is being held in Washington, D.C. this year, leading to mixed emotions within the LGBTQ+ community due to concerns about the Trump administration's policies. Some community members fear for their safety and comfort, citing attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, especially those of trans people. Others plan to attend as a form of protest against the administration, with layered identities adding complexity to the decision. While the Trump administration has rolled back LGBTQ+ protections, D.C. itself remains largely Democratic, and organizers have implemented extensive safety protocols for the event.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize its airspace with the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS), aiming for quicker flights and fewer delays. The redesign, the largest since the 1950s, seeks to allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly, reducing climate change impacts and paving the way for new technologies like flying taxis. Aviation Minister Mike Kane stated that modernizing airspace is a simple way to reduce pollution from flying. The changes are expected to be fully operational by the end of the year, but some groups warn of potential new flight paths over previously unaffected areas.</p>

The government plans to meet its defense spending target of 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims for 3% before 2034.

          <p>President Trump is planning to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum this week, even as courts are questioning the legality of other levies. This move signals a continued reliance on tariffs as a policy tool, despite legal challenges and potential economic consequences. The decision could further escalate trade tensions and impact industries reliant on these materials. The ongoing legal battles add uncertainty to Trump's trade agenda.</p>

Critics raise concerns about attracting unsavory characters and the optics of welcoming wealthy immigrants while detaining others.
