            <p>A study indicates that over three million children died in 2022 due to infections resistant to antibiotics, with Africa and South East Asia most affected. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when microbes evolve to resist antibiotic drugs, posing a significant public health threat. The study highlights a tenfold increase in AMR-related infections in children in just three years, potentially worsened by the Covid pandemic. Increased use of "watch antibiotics" and "reserve antibiotics" raises concerns about dwindling treatment options. Optimism score: 20</p>
