          <p>PepsiCo's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed analyst predictions, driven by performance outside of North America. However, the company experienced a decline in sales volume for both its food and beverage divisions within the U.S. and Canada. To address this, PepsiCo is implementing cost-cutting measures, including closing manufacturing plants, and shifting its marketing strategy to focus on popular trends like protein-enhanced products. The company has maintained its financial outlook for the full year, anticipating stable earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia’s military claimed to have intercepted at least 126 Ukrainian drones across 11 regions and annexed Crimea, including several near Moscow. The large-scale barrage resulted in civilian casualties, with three deaths reported in the Belgorod region and several injuries in other areas. This attack marks a significant escalation in drone warfare from both sides in July, as Ukraine also reported defending against a Russian drone assault. The events unfold amid stalled ceasefire negotiations and an ultimatum from President Trump to Moscow.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite public and political pressure to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein's case, their disclosure is unlikely due to a long-standing Department of Justice policy against making closed investigative files public. This policy aims to protect individuals who were not charged with a crime. The situation is complicated by Attorney General Pam Bondi's previous, and now seemingly retracted, claims that a "client list" was on her desk, leading to accusations of inconsistency and dishonesty in her handling of the matter.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly rebuked his own supporters for believing what he calls a "radical left" hoax regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, a rare instance of turning on his base. This political friction comes as the Senate passed a Trump-backed bill to cut $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds. In other news, an investigation revealed that a major European missile manufacturer is selling components for bombs used in Israeli strikes that have killed civilians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A professional women's golf tournament in northern Japan canceled its opening day after a bear was spotted near the course. This marks the second such incident to disrupt a golf event in the country in recent months, highlighting a rise in human-bear encounters. Experts attribute the increase to factors like climate change impacting food sources and Japan's shrinking rural population, which allows bears to expand their habitat. In response, the government has authorized hunting bears in populated areas to mitigate the risk.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Justice appears to be shifting its focus away from prosecuting white-collar and corporate crimes, a move that benefits business interests and political allies. This is evidenced by a decline in federal prosecutions for such offenses, an executive order pausing enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and numerous pardons for financial fraudsters. Critics argue this creates a two-tiered justice system where financial crimes are overlooked unless they can be used to target political opponents, while allies receive leniency.</p>

          <p>Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, who was once seen by some as a pro-worker voice in the Trump administration, is now overseeing a significant rollback of labor regulations. Despite a past congressional vote supporting union rights, her department has moved to slash its own budget, rescind dozens of worker health and safety rules, and weaken protections against misclassifying employees as independent contractors. Critics argue these actions align with the Trump administration's broader anti-labor agenda and will undermine basic protections for workers across numerous industries.</p>

          <p>A California bill would require public school and college student ID cards to include the contact information for an LGBTQ-specific crisis hotline. The legislation is championed by the mother of a trans teen who took his own life and is supported by state leaders as a crucial safety net. This state-level action comes as the federal government has cut funding for LGBTQ+ counselors through the national 9-8-8 suicide prevention lifeline. Proponents believe providing a specialized, easily accessible resource can save the lives of queer youth facing mental health crises.</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. political efforts to combat trade imbalances, American cars continue to sell poorly in major Asian markets like South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Automotive experts and consumers suggest the core issue isn't unfair trade barriers but a fundamental product mismatch. American automakers tend to produce larger, more expensive, and less fuel-efficient vehicles that are ill-suited for Asia's congested cities, smaller parking spaces, and price-sensitive consumers. In contrast, domestic and European brands have been more successful by adapting their offerings to local tastes and conditions.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the legacy of Glenn Spencer, a once-prominent anti-immigration activist who promoted xenophobic ideas, such as the "Reconquista" conspiracy theory, in the 1990s and 2000s. The author argues that Spencer's fringe, racist rhetoric has become mainstreamed in the modern political landscape, particularly through figures like Stephen Miller. The article suggests that what was once dismissed as the work of an obsessive crackpot has now evolved into the basis for federal policy, demonstrating how extremist views can fester and gain influence when ignored.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senators from California are urging the Trump administration to reverse significant staffing cuts at the National Weather Service, warning of severe consequences for the state. They argue that understaffed offices, particularly in the Central Valley, jeopardize the state's agriculture industry and critical wildfire fighting operations, which rely on NWS forecasts and on-site meteorologists.

The author details the law's racist and xenophobic origins, noting it was created to police morality and has been used to target interracial couples and political opponents. The article contends that relying on such an overbroad and archaic statute to secure a conviction, especially when charges for more serious offenses failed, sets a dangerous precedent for selective and discriminatory prosecution by the federal government.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying the unique properties of the squirting cucumber, a toxic relative of the common cucumber known for its ballistic seed dispersal. When ripe, the fruit builds up internal pressure and, with the slightest touch, explodes to launch its seeds at speeds up to 30 miles per hour. Scientists discovered the fruit orients itself at a perfect ballistic angle for maximum distance. Furthermore, the seeds are coated in a powerful slime that acts as a super-strong adhesive, which could inspire new materials for soft robotics or drug delivery.</p>
