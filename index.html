          <p>A registered sex offender accused of attempting to kidnap an 11-year-old boy in Aurora, Colorado, will have the charges against him dropped. The 18th Judicial District Attorney’s Office is dismissing the case after a mental competency evaluation found the 33-year-old suspect, Solomon Galligan, unfit to stand trial. The incident, which was captured on video, has prompted outrage from parents and led to the replacement of the elementary school's principal for mishandling the situation's immediate aftermath.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, surpassing forecasts and accelerating from the previous quarter's growth. The expansion was primarily driven by a strong manufacturing sector, though the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious due to global trade uncertainties, particularly regarding U.S. tariff policies. Despite the positive growth figures, the country's central bank had previously loosened monetary policy, citing significant downside risks to the overall economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A proposal to rescind $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is being debated in the U.S. Senate, a move championed by President Trump. While critics of public media cite perceived bias, opponents of the cuts, including some Republican senators, warn of the devastating impact on local stations in rural areas. Many of these small stations rely heavily on federal grants for their survival and provide essential services, such as emergency weather alerts, in communities that are considered news deserts.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his "illiberal democracy" and admired by some global conservatives, is facing a significant political challenge from within his own former circle. Peter Magyar, a one-time Fidesz party insider, has emerged as a popular opposition figure, capitalizing on a government scandal and public frustration with the state of hospitals, schools, and the economy. While Orban has long maintained power by identifying voter fears, Magyar's center-right movement is gaining traction, creating a serious threat to Orban's 15-year rule.</p>

          <p>A decades-long drought in northern Mexico is intensifying a dispute with the United States over a 1944 water-sharing treaty. Mexico is in arrears on its obligation to send water from the Rio Grande to Texas, prompting threats of retaliation from the Trump administration. Mexican farmers in the drought-stricken state of Chihuahua argue they cannot give what they don't have, while Texan farmers accuse them of hoarding water, creating a tense standoff over a scarce and vital resource.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and PSG featured a pre-match and halftime spectacle more reminiscent of an American Super Bowl than a traditional soccer match. The event in New Jersey included a military flyover, a performance by Robbie Williams, and a high-tech halftime show with Coldplay's Chris Martin, all attended by US President Donald Trump. This blend of entertainment and sport highlights FIFA's effort to create a major global event, though the pageantry delayed the start of both halves of the game.</p>

          <p>The White House has defended a new 50% tariff on Brazil, arguing it is part of a broader strategy to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and bolster national security by onshoring production. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett acknowledged that the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil but claimed the tariff is necessary for an overall global strategy to prevent transshipping. The move was criticized for being linked to a criminal case against a political ally of President Trump rather than a clear economic or security threat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Drake's headlining performance on the final night of London's Wireless Festival ended abruptly after just 40 minutes, leaving many fans feeling shortchanged. The rapper appeared agitated and raced through a medley of hits before his set concluded, seemingly due to the venue's strict 21:30 curfew. Compared to his longer sets with numerous special guests on the previous two nights, the brief and rushed conclusion to his three-day residency disappointed many in the 50,000-strong crowd.</p>
