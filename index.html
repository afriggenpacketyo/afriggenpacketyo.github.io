          <p>Elon Musk has voiced concerns over the Federal Reserve's $2.5 billion building renovation, calling the cost "an eyebrow raiser." He questions whether the expenditure aligns with responsible use of funds, especially given the current economic climate. The Fed initiated the project in 2021 to address upgrades, building codes, technology, and energy efficiency, aiming to consolidate staff and reduce leasing costs. Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency, suggests the project should be scrutinized as part of broader efforts to eliminate government waste. The Fed is funded by interest on securities and bank fees, not taxpayer money, but excess funds are typically returned to the Treasury.</p>

          <p>National Security Advisor Michael Waltz is reportedly expected to depart from his position following increasing frustration from President Trump. This decision follows scrutiny over Waltz's accidental inclusion of a reporter in a Signal chat involving top Trump officials, where they discussed a U.S. military strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen. While the White House and Waltz have not issued official statements, sources suggest that Trump is likely to announce the changes soon. Trump had previously defended Waltz after the incident, but the mishap appears to have strained their relationship.</p>

          <p>Two illegal immigrants have been arrested in Garner, North Carolina, after allegedly breaking into a home, demanding $1 million, and kidnapping a mother and her 11-month-old daughter when the father refused to pay.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is discontinuing $1 billion in federal grants earmarked for school mental health services, citing concerns that the Biden administration's awarding of the grants violated federal civil rights law. This funding was part of the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, intended to address rising student mental health concerns following the Uvalde school shooting. School districts across the country, including Corbett, Oregon, have used these grants to hire mental health professionals, but now face potential layoffs and service reductions. The Department of Education claims the funds were used for race-based actions unrelated to mental health, while supporters argue the grants were crucial for providing evidence-based mental health support to students.</p>

          <p>Kinney County, Texas, has collected $1.7 million in bail from migrants who were deported before their court appearances, retaining the money despite the migrants' inability to attend court. This practice has become a significant revenue source for the county since Governor Abbott increased state immigration operations in 2021. The funds have been used to upgrade the sheriff's department and increase salaries for county officials. While county officials argue their actions deter illegal crossings, critics contend that forfeiting bail from deported migrants is unjust, especially since many are unaware of the legal implications or lack proper notification of court dates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan to overhaul the federal student loan system, proposing the Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan. The plan aims to reduce the number of repayment options to two: a fixed payment plan over 10 to 25 years, and an income-driven repayment plan called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP). Under RAP, monthly payments would be a percentage of a borrower's income, ranging from 1% to 10% depending on earnings. The proposal is intended to generate savings for President Trump's planned tax cuts, but the impact on individual borrowers would vary based on their income and debt levels.</p>

Graham initially denied involvement but later admitted to knowing who felled the tree, refusing to identify them.

          <p>Lawmakers are calling for a full investigation into the death of Marie Ange Blaise, a Haitian woman who died in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody after being transferred between multiple facilities. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick suggested Blaise did not receive adequate medical care, while ICE stated that detainees receive medical, dental, and mental health screening, and 24-hour emergency care. The death occurred amid the Trump administration's increased immigration enforcement, including arrests and deportations. News of Blaise's death has sparked protests and concerns about mistreatment in detention centers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automakers like Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant U.S. sales increases in April, driven by consumers purchasing new vehicles ahead of potential price hikes due to tariffs. Several automakers offered discounts or promised not to raise prices due to President Trump's auto tariffs, fueling this "tariff fear-buying." However, demand slowed in late April as inventories tightened and prices increased. Economists warn that higher costs and lower inventories could lead to lower sales in the future. Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles took effect in early April, with additional levies expected on auto parts.</p>

          <p>Oman's Foreign Minister announced that the latest round of US-Iranian nuclear talks, scheduled for this weekend, has been postponed to a later date "for logistical reasons." The talks are aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting some economic sanctions. The announcement came amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US, with accusations of "contradictory behavior and provocative statements" following new oil-related sanctions. A US source indicated that America had "never confirmed its participation" in the fourth round of talks but expects them to take place "in the near future."</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that the first 100 days of President Trump's second term have inflicted significant damage on American democracy. The editorial accuses Trump of attempting to establish a presidency unconstrained by Congress or the courts, potentially altering the fundamental nature of American government. The board calls for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's actions while acknowledging his legitimacy and the legality of some of his policies. The editorial highlights Trump's attacks on separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech, and government for the people.</p>

This decrease underscores the Trump administration's efforts to transform the division, focusing on priorities like voter fraud and discrimination against white people. Current and former employees emphasize that the departures make it impossible for the division to fulfill its mandated civil rights enforcement duties. New leadership has celebrated the reduction in attorneys, claiming the focus will shift from "woke ideology" to enforcing federal civil rights laws.</p>

          <p>Investors in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may be surprised by a higher tax bill on their profits, as the IRS considers gold and other precious metals to be "collectibles." Collectibles generally carry a 28% top federal tax rate on long-term capital gains, compared to the 20% maximum rate for stocks and real estate. Popular gold funds like SPDR Gold Shares and iShares Gold Trust are structured as trusts and are subject to the collectibles tax rate. This could impact investors who have profited from the recent surge in gold prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, and his department have made misleading statements about vaccines, claiming the MMR vaccine contains "aborted fetus debris." Health department officials also indicated they could alter vaccine testing and build new surveillance systems, alarming experts who view new placebo testing as potentially unethical. Kennedy exhorted parents to "do their own research," a phrase often associated with disinformation. One claim made was that the rubella vaccine, like many vaccines, is produced using sterile fetal cell lines derived from two elective terminations in the 1960s. These actions have raised concerns about undermining trust in vaccines and disrupting public health efforts.</p>
