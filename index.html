          <p>Newspapers report on the significant global market downturn caused by President Trump's newly announced tariffs.  The Guardian highlights trillions wiped off global stock markets, while the Daily Mail focuses on the impact on investments and pensions.  The Financial Times points out that US consumers will bear the brunt of higher prices, and the Daily Telegraph features Jeremy Hunt's suggestion that the UK model its trading system after Singapore's.

          <p>Two key organizers of the 2022 Canadian trucker protests against COVID-19 restrictions, Tamara Lich and Chris Barber, have been found guilty of mischief.

          <p>President Trump expressed confidence in his new tariff policy despite the significant market downturn. He characterized the situation as an operation with expected short-term pain but long-term gains.  He remained open to negotiations with other countries, suggesting a willingness to compromise if offered a favorable deal.  Administration officials, however, maintained that the tariffs were not negotiable and represented a national emergency.

          <p>The BBC analyzes the factors contributing to the downfall of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, focusing on his personality and political decisions.  His stubbornness and refusal to compromise alienated both friends and political allies.  His rapid shift to the right and reliance on far-right advisors further isolated him from moderate voters.  The article suggests that his prosecutorial approach to politics, while effective in his previous career, proved detrimental in the presidential role.</p>
