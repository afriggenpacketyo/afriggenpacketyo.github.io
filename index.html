          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, highlighting their initial bromance, which began with Musk's endorsement of Trump after an assassination attempt. Musk was later appointed to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and received praise from Trump, but tensions arose as Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill. The timeline culminates in a public feud with both billionaires trading insults and threats, including Trump threatening to terminate Musk's government subsidies and contracts, and Musk suggesting Trump appears in unreleased files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The article paints a picture of a once-close alliance that deteriorated due to policy disagreements and clashing egos.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing overcapacity is causing anxiety in global markets, as a flood of cheap imports could squeeze local industries, according to experts. Steep tariffs are deterring Chinese exports to the U.S., while domestic consumption remains a worry, leading to producer prices staying in deflationary territory for over two years. However, economists note that the influx of low-cost Chinese goods could provide some relief for inflation-hit economies, potentially easing pressure on central banks. This could pave the way for more rate cuts across Asia, as central banks further decouple from the Fed and deliver additional easing (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>North Korea claims to have successfully refloated a new destroyer that capsized during its launch last month, with plans to move it to a dry dock for repairs. The 5,000-ton warship, intended to be a symbol of North Korea's naval modernization, suffered a malfunction during the launch, causing damage to the hull. Leader Kim Jong Un deemed the incident a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workers’ Party. Analysts were surprised by the speed of the refloating process, which involved using aerostatic balloons attached to the ship’s hull.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman is significant due to his role in the party's rise, particularly in terms of finances, diversity, and organizational abilities. Yusuf, a wealthy businessman, contributed financially and helped temper criticisms of racism due to his minority ethnic background. He also played a key role in building the party's infrastructure, though his management style caused friction within the organization. The article emphasizes that Reform UK's success depends on hiring and retaining staff to transform it into an election-winning machine.</p>

Mann gained global recognition for novels like "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," but also wrote political essays and radio speeches denouncing the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust. He emigrated to the US in 1939, calling on Germans to resist Nazi policies through BBC broadcasts, and later returned to Switzerland, where he died in 1955.</p>

While highlighting growth concerns and tariff threats, the RBI also noted a downtrend in inflation, revising its outlook to 3.7% for the current financial year (not investment advice).</p>

This is Trump's latest attempt to prevent Harvard from enrolling a quarter of its students, who are foreign nationals. Harvard has attracted a growing number of the brightest minds from around the world, with international enrollment growing from 11% of the student body three decades ago to 26% today.</p>

The 2025 AI Jobs Barometer report analyzed over 800 million job ads and thousands of company financial reports, revealing that both jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations. The report disputes fears that AI will automate jobs and cut wages, instead highlighting AI's potential to boost productivity and create new opportunities. According to the study, the key challenge is preparing workers with the new skills needed for AI-driven jobs.</p>

Data from the Crown Prosecution Service reveals over 30,000 prosecutions failed between October 2020 and September 2024. The BBC's investigation found a rising number of cases recorded as an "E72" due to unavailable evidence. Former officers attribute the problem to under-resourcing and overwhelming workloads, while experts suggest the loss of the dedicated Forensic Science Service in 2012 has contributed to the issue.</p>
