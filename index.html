          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a logistics firm supplying major UK supermarkets like Tesco and Aldi, experienced a ransomware attack that encrypted their data and locked them out of computer systems, demanding payment for restoration. The attack disrupted order processing, potentially leading to food waste for clients, with Black Farmer founder Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones estimating thousands of pounds worth of meat products at risk. While smaller than recent attacks on Marks & Spencer and Co-op, the incident underscores cybersecurity challenges for smaller logistics companies, though transport activities remain unaffected. This article highlights the increasing vulnerability of supply chains to cyber threats and the potential consequences for food distribution and waste.</p>

          <p>Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, reflects on Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis and draws parallels to her father's Alzheimer's announcement in 1994, emphasizing the opportunity for leadership through vulnerability. Davis notes that while cancer is openly discussed today, the emotional impact often isn't, and Biden can show leadership by sharing his personal experience and fears. She argues that candor could restore trust with voters concerned about his fitness, allowing him to connect with Americans on a human level beyond politics, and soothe the fears that so many people wrestle with. The article suggests that such openness could be a profound expression of love for the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to terminate deportation protections for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans in the US with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). This ruling lifts a hold placed by a California judge and marks a win for Trump, who has repeatedly sought to enact immigration policy decisions through the Supreme Court. TPS was granted to Venezuelans in 2021 due to the humanitarian crisis in their country, but the Trump administration sought to end these protections in April 2025, earlier than initially planned. The decision has been criticized for its potential humanitarian and economic impact, with lawyers representing TPS holders calling it the largest single action stripping immigration status in modern US history.</p>

          <p>Carlos Lozada reviews Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's "Original Sin," a book examining the Democratic Party's awareness of Joe Biden's decline and their reasons for not speaking out. The book suggests that signs of Biden's diminishment were frequent and worsened around periods of family turmoil, particularly after the death of his son Beau. The article highlights instances of Biden's decline, such as forgetting names and struggling with speeches, and notes that aides simplified his texts and relied more on teleprompters. The review suggests that the Democratic Party prioritized defeating Trump over addressing concerns about Biden's fitness, potentially risking the nation's future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This Fox News opinion article argues that Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump share ideological similarities as outsiders challenging the political establishment, despite stylistic differences. Both men embraced conservative ideas, with Reagan aiming to dismantle the Soviet Union and eliminate departments like Education and Energy, similar to Trump's goals. Reagan's support for gay rights, based on individual freedom, predates mainstream acceptance, and both leaders enjoyed popularity among blue-collar voters. While trade may be a point of divergence, Reagan also used tariffs to protect industries, and the author asserts that Trump continues to embrace Reagan's core principles of tax cuts, federalism, a strong national defense, and a pro-life stance.</p>

          <p>Despite the potential of GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy to treat obesity, access remains limited due to cost concerns and varying state Medicaid policies. While some states, like South Carolina, have begun covering these drugs, stringent prerequisites and high costs restrict access to a small fraction of eligible beneficiaries. The Trump administration has declined to finalize a rule that would expand Medicare and Medicaid coverage for GLP-1s for weight loss, while the FDA is poised to remove cheaper, compounded versions from the market. This article highlights the ongoing debate over affordability and accessibility of weight loss medications, with states grappling with budget constraints and the federal government remaining resistant to broader coverage.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced the five-year loan prime rate (LPR), a key reference rate for mortgage loans, by 10 basis points in an effort to stabilize the struggling property market. The move follows previous interest rate cuts and aims to boost domestic demand and ensure economic stability amidst heightened external risks under Donald Trumpâ€™s second presidency. However, analysts suggest that the moderate cut may not be sufficient to revive the property sector, which has been a drag on the economy due to solvency issues among major real estate developers. The one-year loan prime rate, the reference rate for corporate loans, was also cut by 0.1 percentage points to 3.0 per cent.</p>

          <p>This NPR article discusses the difficulties in collecting tariffs imposed by President Trump, highlighting increased smuggling and transshipping as exporters seek to evade taxes. Trade experts note that higher tariffs, particularly on China, incentivize companies to skirt the law by routing products through third countries. The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) faces a lack of resources and understaffing to effectively screen imports and enforce new tariffs. The article also shares the experiences of business owners who have struggled to combat trade fraud, emphasizing the need for more funding and resources for prosecuting trade crime cases.</p>

          <p>A Texas showerhead salesman, Ramon van Meer, conducted an online experiment to gauge consumer interest in a 'Made in the USA' version of his product, offered at a higher price. Despite Trump administration efforts to encourage domestic manufacturing through tariffs, the results showed zero sales for the domestic option compared to 600 orders for the imported version. The article also highlights the struggles of other US-based showerhead manufacturers to compete with cheaper imports, even with tariffs in place. The experiment suggests that consumers are unwilling to pay significantly more for domestic products, casting doubt on the effectiveness of tariffs in sparking a manufacturing renaissance.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived a dormant primary thruster on Voyager 1 after it had been unused for two decades, averting a potential loss of communication with the spacecraft. The fix was crucial as the backup thrusters were showing signs of failure, and a ground-based antenna needed to be taken offline for upgrades. The team suspected an electronics glitch caused the initial failure and devised a test to reactivate the thruster without risking an explosion. This success ensures Voyager 1 can maintain its antenna alignment with Earth, extending its mission and allowing scientists to continue gathering data from interstellar space.</p>

          <p>Russia launched over 100 drones into Ukraine following a phone call between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, despite Trump's claims of imminent peace talks. Ukraine's air force reported shooting down 35 drones and neutralizing 58, while Russia claimed to have downed eight Ukrainian drones. Trump expressed confidence in a peace deal, stating Putin wants to end the conflict, but Putin's statement showed no sign of concessions, demanding Ukrainian capitulation. Zelenskyy affirmed Ukraine's readiness for a ceasefire and urged stronger sanctions if Russia continues its aggression, emphasizing the need for continued US involvement in negotiations.</p>

The call for better surveillance came after two mainland Chinese residents â€“ a 41-year-old man and his 17-year-old son, surnamed Song â€“ sailed to Taiwan illegally on Thursday by crossing the Taiwan Strait in a 3.3-metre (11-foot) inflatable boat. They landed on Guanyin Beach in Taoyuan, a zone regularly used by the military for live-fire exercises.</p>

Xi Jinping presented China as a reliable partner, contrasting Trump's tariff increases, aid cuts, and immigration restrictions. The article highlights Brazil's president echoing Xi's call for fair trade and criticizes Trump's focus on crime and immigration rather than cooperation opportunities. While China's economy is growing less rapidly, its actions allow it to project a more trustworthy image than the United States, even as concerns arise about China's model of governance.</p>
