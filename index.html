          <p>A significant fire broke out in a restaurant at the former BBC Television Centre in west London, prompting a large-scale response. Around 100 firefighters and 15 engines were dispatched to the nine-story building, which now contains flats, studios, and restaurants. Residents were evacuated as a precaution, and a local rest center was established for those displaced by the blaze. While the fire caused considerable disruption and smoke, authorities have reported no casualties, and the cause of the incident is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his ascension to adulthood brings renewed focus to Japan's male-only succession laws. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the country faces a potential succession crisis. This event has reignited debates about allowing female members, like Princess Aiko, to ascend the throne to ensure the monarchy's future.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, while facing criticism from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD has denounced the movement's "globalist uniformity," echoing historical attacks by the Nazi party, which shut down the school in 1933. Despite these political pressures, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its centennial program, which focuses on the evolution of modern materials and sustainable design. The events highlight the school's enduring legacy and its ongoing relevance in contemporary social and political discourse.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in Washington D.C. to address crime has ignited a sharp political conflict. Congressional Democrats have condemned the move as an overreach and an embarrassment on the world stage, especially since the city's mayor did not request the troops. Conversely, some Republicans argue the presence of the Guard has made the city safer and question Democratic opposition to enhanced security measures. The dispute has escalated to the courts, with D.C.'s Attorney General suing the administration to have the troops removed.</p>

          <h2>A Personal Reflection on Finding Community Through Buffalo Bills Fandom</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This personal essay recounts the author's journey to becoming a devoted Buffalo Bills fan after previously being indifferent to sports. The transformation began when the author's Buffalonian boyfriend and his family introduced them to the team's culture, which is deeply intertwined with the city's identity. The article explores how supporting the Bills, a team known for its underdog spirit and near-misses at victory, mirrors the resilience of Buffalo itself. Ultimately, the shared experience of fandom created a powerful sense of belonging and a new understanding of what "home" can mean.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Question Efficacy of China's New "Anti-Involution" Economic Strategy</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's recent push against "involution," or destructive, low-quality price competition, is unlikely to replicate the success of its 2015 supply-side reforms, according to Oxford Economics. While President Xi Jinping's criticism of cutthroat competition has raised investor hopes for a major economic shift, analysts are skeptical. The research firm suggests that the current economic environment makes it difficult for Beijing to implement necessary capacity cuts or significant consumption stimulus. This indicates that resolving China's supply-demand imbalances may be a much more challenging and prolonged process than in the past. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors has proposed a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The package would grant him up to 12% of the company's stock over a decade, contingent on meeting extremely aggressive growth targets, including increasing Tesla's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. The proposal, which requires shareholder approval, is seen as an incentive to retain Musk and ensure his focus remains on transforming Tesla into an AI and robotics leader. Critics, however, have raised concerns about corporate governance and the sheer scale of the proposed reward. (not investment advice)</p>

The author suggests this reflects a broader shift in the West, where rising protectionism and nativism are forcing non-Western countries like India to re-evaluate their alliances.

          <p>World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has advanced to the U.S. Open final after defeating Félix Auger-Aliassime in a four-set match. Despite a strong challenge from the Canadian in the second set and a brief injury scare requiring a medical timeout for a stomach issue, Sinner regained his composure to win 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. This victory makes him the youngest man in the Open era to reach all four Grand Slam finals in a single season. He will now face his great rival Carlos Alcaraz in a historic final, with both the championship and the world No. 1 ranking on the line.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the United States, is set to deliver a speech describing President Donald Trump as a maverick "risk taker" who correctly identified widespread public anxiety. In the address, the New Labour architect will draw parallels between the political mandates of Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, both elected on platforms of national renewal. The speech is viewed as a strategic move to steady the US-UK relationship under the unpredictable Trump presidency. Mandelson will also reframe Brexit as an opportunity that has "freed" Britain to pursue closer ties with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Yi Huiman, who formerly headed the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), is under investigation for "severe breaches of discipline," according to the Communist Party's anti-graft watchdog. Yi served as the chairman of China's top stock market regulator from 2019 until February 2024. The probe marks a significant development in the country's ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which has been increasingly targeting the financial sector. Yi is the second head of the CSRC to be investigated for graft in the last decade, signaling a continued crackdown on misconduct within China's financial oversight bodies.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko has intensified into a powerful Category 4 storm in the Pacific Ocean and is tracking westward toward Hawaii. While no coastal warnings are currently in effect, forecasters anticipate that swells from the storm will reach the islands by the weekend, creating life-threatening surf and rip currents. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, could bring more direct impacts like heavy rain and high winds to Hawaii starting early next week. In response to the threat, Hawaii's acting governor has declared a state of emergency to facilitate preparations.</p>

          <p>A Wall Street Journal report claimed that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to announce a possible link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism, a claim the HHS has called "speculation." This has reignited debate on the topic, for which scientific evidence remains inconclusive and conflicting. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated there is no clear proof of a direct relationship, emphasizing that acetaminophen is one of the few safe pain relief options for pregnant people. Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, also maintains that no causal link has been established based on current scientific evaluation.</p>

          <p>China is actively engaging in party-to-party diplomacy, recently demonstrated by President Xi Jinping's meetings with leaders from the world's other four ruling communist parties. This diplomatic channel, managed by the Communist Party's International Department, operates alongside traditional state-level foreign relations. While distinct from the Cold War-era promotion of a global communist movement, these interactions serve as a key part of Beijing's foreign policy strategy. The International Department has connections with over 600 political parties worldwide and has been increasingly used to expand China's diplomatic reach, including recent engagement in the Middle East.</p>

The South Korean government has dispatched diplomats and called for the rights of its citizens to be respected, while Hyundai stated that none of the arrested individuals were its direct employees.</p>
