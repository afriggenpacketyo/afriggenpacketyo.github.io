          <p>A small, circular piece of a bathroom door lock found under the body of nurse Alexandra Pennig proved to be the key evidence in her murder case. Initially reported as a suicide by her colleague Matthew Ecker, detectives grew suspicious of his account. The discovery of the lock piece suggested the door was forced open before Pennig was shot, contradicting Ecker's story that he broke in after hearing the gunshot. This crucial finding led to Ecker's conviction for second-degree murder and a 30-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>Residents in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills are being asked to cease all water usage, including flushing toilets, due to a major service outage affecting 9,200 households. The disruption began when a critical water control valve broke during a heatwave, leading to a boil water advisory. Officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, explained that continued water use is depleting pressure in the system and delaying repairs, which were further complicated when a temporary bypass pipe failed.</p>

This year's event marks the fifth major flood disaster to hit the region since 2012. The recent storms are considered unusual because they primarily impacted the northern part of the capital. This contrasts with previous severe floods in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the southern areas of the city, highlighting a shift in weather patterns.</p>

          <p>New Barcelona signing Marcus Rashford is preparing for his home debut, though it will take place at the club's training ground due to delays in the Nou Camp stadium's reconstruction. His arrival has been overshadowed by significant off-field issues, including a dispute with captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen over registration that temporarily threatened Rashford's eligibility for the La Liga season opener. Despite the chaos, Rashford has impressed in pre-season, scoring his first goal and earning praise for his performance.</p>

          <p>This opinion article expresses grave concern over the escalating nuclear arms race, highlighted by Russia's withdrawal from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. The author argues that this, combined with NATO's military buildup and taunts between US and Russian leaders, brings the world dangerously close to confrontation. The piece criticizes the lack of widespread public opposition compared to the anti-nuclear movements of the 1980s, warning that complacency and government secrecy are allowing the risk of extinction to grow.
