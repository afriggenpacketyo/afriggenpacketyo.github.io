          <p>The trial of David Pearce, accused of murdering Christy Giles and Hilda Marcela Cabrales-Arzola after drugging and sexually assaulting them, concluded with a guilty verdict.  Multiple Jane Does testified about similar experiences with Pearce, highlighting a pattern of predatory behavior.  The prosecution successfully linked Pearce to the deaths through forensic evidence and witness accounts, while the defense argued the victims' prior drug use contributed to their deaths; however, the jury found Pearce guilty of first-degree murder and multiple sexual assaults.</p>
