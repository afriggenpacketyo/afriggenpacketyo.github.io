        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by unilaterally imposing global tariffs, deeming them "contrary to law." The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited power to levy tariffs without congressional approval. The judges emphasized that Congress holds the constitutional authority to impose tariffs under most circumstances, and Trump's actions did not meet the criteria for an "unusual and extraordinary threat." The Trump administration can appeal the decision. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of insuring exposure to U.S. government debt has been steadily increasing, with spreads on credit default swaps (CDS) nearing a two-year high, signaling investor unease. This surge in demand for CDS contracts is viewed as a hedge against political risk related to the unresolved debt ceiling, rather than a belief in imminent insolvency. Investors are pricing in concerns about U.S. fiscal policy and political gridlock, as the Treasury Department approaches the statutory debt limit. While a tax cut package passed by the House could raise the debt ceiling, uncertainty remains until the Senate approves a bill. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the commutation, Hoover still faces a 200-year state sentence for a 1973 murder conviction.

Several beneficiaries of Trump's pardons had ties to him or conservative groups, with their pardon applications echoing Trump's claims of a weaponized Justice Department. This approach has created an incentive for pardon seekers to demonstrate loyalty to Trump and accuse the Biden Justice Department of political targeting.

          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) will invest over £1 billion to develop battlefield technology aimed at accelerating decision-making, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and software. This investment is part of a broader strategic defence review that prioritizes battlefield technology and a new Cyber Command. The review highlights lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, where AI and software are being used to expedite the identification and targeting of enemy threats. The UK military has faced over 90,000 cyber-attacks in the past two years, prompting the creation of a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command.</p>
