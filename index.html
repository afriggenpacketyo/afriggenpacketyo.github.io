          <p>South Korea's LG Energy Solution has secured a major contract worth $4.3 billion to supply batteries to an undisclosed major corporation, with the agreement running until July 2030. While the company has not named its partner due to business confidentiality, reports suggest the counterparty is Tesla, which recently confirmed a separate multi-billion dollar deal with Samsung. The filing notes that the deal's value and terms could change, and it does not specify if the batteries are for electric vehicles or energy storage systems. LG is currently expanding its U.S. production, including a new lithium iron phosphate battery plant in Arizona. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is set to issue an executive order that will allow local governments in the Los Angeles area to limit new housing development in high-risk wildfire zones. The order specifically targets Senate Bill 9, a 2021 law designed to increase housing density, by exempting fire-affected neighborhoods like Pacific Palisades from its provisions. This decision follows pressure from Los Angeles officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, who raised concerns that increased density could dangerously complicate future fire evacuations. The move aims to balance the state's housing needs with public safety in areas prone to natural disasters.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Signals Intent to Recognize Palestinian State to Influence Gaza Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 22:30:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire and a long-term peace process, a move Foreign Secretary David Lammy hopes will "affect the situation on the ground." The decision aims to pressure both sides, requiring Hamas to release hostages and disarm, while Israel must agree to a two-state solution and allow aid to flow. The policy shift has drawn mixed reactions, with some UK politicians calling for immediate, unconditional recognition and others criticizing the timing as political posturing. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the announcement, calling it a reward for terrorism.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific basis that classifies greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and allows their regulation under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action, claiming it would save Americans billions annually by repealing emissions standards for vehicles and other sources. Critics, including former EPA officials and scientists, argue the decision ignores overwhelming scientific evidence of climate change's harmful impacts and contradicts the agency's own reports on the economic benefits of regulation. The move is expected to face significant legal challenges from environmental groups.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials are drafting an ordinance to prohibit law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from concealing their identities while on duty in public. The proposal, which passed with a 4-0 vote, would require officers to visibly display identification and would ban face masks except for specific situations like undercover work. This move was prompted by recent federal immigration raids where agents wore masks and did not identify themselves, sparking public fear and eroding trust. While officials acknowledge potential legal challenges in enforcing the rule against federal agencies, they argue it is necessary to ensure accountability and transparency.</p>

Smith came through again in the ninth inning, hitting a go-ahead, two-out RBI double that scored the winning run from first base.

The plan would involve the state Legislature drawing new maps and asking voters to approve them, temporarily rescinding the commission's power.

The Japanese guidelines explicitly mention threats from countries like China and Russia, which are developing anti-satellite technologies.

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate fell to 2.1% year-over-year in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and just within the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) target range of 2-3%. The slowdown, driven by a fall in transport costs, was more significant than economists had anticipated. This weaker inflation data, combined with a softer global growth outlook and a rising domestic unemployment rate, strengthens the case for the RBA to implement another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. The RBA has already cut rates twice this year but held them steady at its last meeting to await more data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Sean "Diddy" Combs have filed a motion requesting his release on a $50 million bond while he awaits sentencing on prostitution-related charges. The defense argues that Combs is not a flight risk or a danger to the community, and they cite ongoing threats of violence he faces at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. In the filing, his lawyers frame his conduct as part of a consensual "swinger" lifestyle and note that defendants in similar cases are typically not detained pending sentencing. Combs was convicted of transporting sex workers across state lines but acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges.</p>

          <p>A major search-and-rescue mission is in progress for a U.S. sailor reported missing from the aircraft carrier USS George Washington in the Timor Sea, north of Australia. The sailor is believed to have gone overboard on Monday afternoon while the carrier strike group was participating in the multinational Talisman Sabre 2025 military exercises. The U.S. Navy is leading the operation with assistance from the Australian Defence Force and Australian Border Force, which have deployed aircraft and a patrol boat to aid in the search. The name and rank of the missing sailor have not yet been released by officials.</p>

          <p>Top officials from the United States and China have concluded two days of "constructive" talks by agreeing to continue working towards extending their 90-day tariff truce, which is set to expire in August. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that any final decision on an extension rests with President Donald Trump. The negotiations in Stockholm aimed to prevent a return to the escalating tit-for-tat tariffs that marked the trade relationship earlier in the year. While both sides discussed key issues like critical minerals and economic stability, the U.S. emphasized that no agreement is final until the president signs off. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Sexual Assault Charity to Launch Separate Service for Biological Women After Dispute</h2>

          <p>A sexual assault crisis charity in Brighton, UK, has announced it will launch a new support group exclusively for biological women, following a legal dispute with a survivor. The charity, Survivors' Network, was sued by a woman who felt uncomfortable in a support session that included a trans woman. To resolve the case, the charity will now run the new group alongside its existing, inclusive meetings that are open to trans and non-binary people. This decision comes after a UK Supreme Court ruling clarified that single-sex services can be reserved for people of the same biological sex, addressing a contentious issue in survivor support spaces.</p>

          <h2>Federal Prosecutors Move to Drop Charges in Controversial Los Angeles Cases</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have filed motions to dismiss charges in two high-profile cases, including a major fraud indictment against a donor to President Trump. The move came just hours after the administration extended the term of U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli. The dismissed cases involve Andrew Wiederhorn, former CEO of the company owning Fatburger, accused in a $47 million scheme, and a sheriff's deputy already convicted of excessive force. The decision has drawn criticism, with allegations that Essayli's appointment was tied to the potential dismissal of the Wiederhorn case, raising concerns about political influence within the U.S. attorney's office.</p>
