          <p>A Reddit post showing McDonald's prices from 1991 has sparked a discussion among millennials about the rising cost of fast food. While many fondly recalled cheaper prices and claimed the food quality was better, others argued that when adjusted for inflation, current prices are comparable. One user attempted to recreate a 1991 order using modern app deals, finding the inflation-adjusted cost to be very similar. McDonald's responded by emphasizing its commitment to value through various deals and its McValue offerings.</p>

          <p>Following heightened military conflict between the US, Israel, and Iran, American security agencies issued warnings about potential retaliatory attacks from Iranian-backed "sleeper cells" within the United States. However, experts suggest that while Iran likely maintains clandestine cells for intelligence and targeted operations, a large-scale domestic attack is improbable as it would invite overwhelming US retaliation. The article notes that the threat is sometimes overstated for political purposes but remains credible, particularly concerning potential sabotage or drone attacks in a moment of existential crisis for Iran.</p>

          <p>Fast-food chain Raising Cane's has surpassed KFC to become the third-largest chicken chain in the U.S. by annual sales, driven by a focused menu and aggressive expansion. The company, which specializes in chicken fingers, has more than doubled its sales since 2021 by maintaining a simple, consistent menu and operating most of its locations company-owned rather than franchised. This strategy has resulted in high efficiency and average unit volumes of $6.6 million. With plans to reach nearly 1,000 restaurants by 2025, founder Todd Graves aims for Raising Cane's to become a top 10 restaurant chain.</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing shot in a late-stage trial involving over 40,000 adults. The positive results are a crucial step for the company, paving the way for regulatory submissions for both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. The company plans to file for approval later this year, with expectations for both products to be available in 2025. This development positions Moderna as a frontrunner in the race to market a combination vaccine.</p>

          <p>Recent analysis suggests the global fertility crisis is far more severe than official United Nations projections indicate, with worldwide population decline potentially beginning as early as 2055, nearly 30 years ahead of schedule. Economist JesÃºs FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde found that the UN's models are overly optimistic, consistently underestimating the rapid fall in birth rates in middle-income countries like Colombia and Chile. The UN model assumes fertility rates will eventually rebound or stabilize, but current data from numerous countries shows a continued, steep decline. This accelerated trend poses significant economic risks, suggesting many nations will grow old before becoming wealthy.</p>

Examples of misuse include a university purchasing gym equipment under the guise of "advanced teaching equipment" and several provinces diverting funds to cover basic public spending like civil-service wages.

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has raised concerns about the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA), warning that its withdrawal penalties can cause people to receive less money than they initially invested. The Treasury Committee highlighted that the 25% government bonus is negated by a steep charge for early withdrawals, effectively penalizing savers by 6.25% of their own contributions. The report also criticized the product's complexity, its unsuitability for some retirement savers, and "nonsensical" rules that penalize claimants of certain government benefits.

While Russian-backed projects like revitalizing sugar mills have stalled, China has been delivering on key infrastructure initiatives, most notably financing and building dozens of solar parks to alleviate the island's crippling power shortages. This shift is visible across the country, with Chinese investment in ports, telecoms, and energy providing a critical lifeline.

          <p>In a critical commentary, Robert Reich argues that Palantir Technologies, co-founded by Peter Thiel, represents a dangerous intersection of AI, military power, and anti-democratic interests. The article highlights Palantir's recent selection by the Trump administration to create a super-database combining personal data from numerous federal agencies, including Homeland Security and the IRS. Reich expresses alarm that this powerful surveillance tool, in the hands of figures like Thiel and Elon Musk who have shown disdain for democratic institutions, could be used to target political enemies and consolidate power, turning the U.S. toward a tech-led authoritarian state.</p>

          <p>A group of over 200 disabled corporate workers at Amazon has accused the company of systemic discrimination, including denying accommodation requests through automated systems and suppressing their efforts to organize. In a letter to CEO Andy Jassy, the workers claim Amazon's policies on issues like return-to-office mandates violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). They allege the company has repeatedly removed their messages and a petition from an internal Slack channel, interfering with their right to collective action. Amazon denies the allegations, stating it respects employees' rights and does not use automated systems for accommodation decisions.</p>

The author recounts their own debilitating struggle with sleeplessness, challenging the often-smug and moralizing tone of public health messaging about sleep deprivation. The piece argues that for many, getting adequate sleep is not simply a matter of individual choice, as it's affected by economic pressures, work culture, and health conditions. It debunks common myths, reframes the debate around sleep medications, and examines therapies like CBT-I, ultimately questioning whether society is structured to allow for healthy sleep.</p>

          <p>Blue Shield of California, the state's third-largest health insurer, has established a new nonprofit parent corporation in Delaware, a move that is alarming consumer advocates. Critics, including a former Blue Shield executive, argue the restructuring was approved without public oversight and could allow the insurer to move billions in assets out of state with few restrictions. They fear this could weaken California's regulatory authority over the company's nonprofit obligations. Blue Shield maintains the change will reduce bureaucracy and that the state retains full regulatory power, while the Department of Managed Health Care asserts the transaction does not harm the plan's viability.</p>

Instead of "bathroom art" clichÃ©s, they recommend using a wide range of pieces, from personal travel photos and vintage paintings to children's artwork. Key advice includes embracing elegant or whimsical themes, minding potential moisture damage for valuable pieces, and using strategies like gallery walls or propping art on vanities to create a finished, stylish look.</p>

          <p>Scottish scrum-half Ben White has received a last-minute call-up to the British and Irish Lions tour in Australia as an injury replacement. The 27-year-old Toulon player was preparing for Scotland's summer tour in New Zealand when he got the news from Lions head coach Andy Farrell. White replaces Wales' Tomos Williams, who sustained a hamstring injury during a match. White described the call-up as an "incredible honour" that left him shaking, fulfilling a lifelong dream. He now joins seven other Scottish players in the prestigious touring squad.</p>

          <p>Reddit is fighting to protect its vast repository of user-generated conversations in the age of AI, viewing the data as a valuable asset. The company has sued AI startup Anthropic for allegedly scraping its content to train large language models without permission, an act Reddit calls an unfair business practice. Simultaneously, Reddit is leveraging its own data with its "Reddit Answers" AI tool, which provides summaries based solely on user discussions. This dual strategy aims to monetize its data through licensing deals while preventing unauthorized use, as the company navigates the threat of AI chatbots replacing traditional web searches.</p>

          <h2>Wimbledon Adopts Electronic Line Calling, Ending Era of Human Line Judges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 05:17:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in its 148-year history, the Wimbledon Championships will proceed without human line judges, fully adopting electronic line-calling technology across all courts. This move aligns Wimbledon with other major tournaments and marks the end of a long-standing tradition. While the technology promises greater accuracy, some players, officials, and fans express concern that it removes a human element and personality from the game. Former officials fear the change could also negatively impact the development pathway for future chair umpires, as line judging has traditionally been a crucial training ground.</p>
