          <p>A conscious parenting coach argues that the phrase "You're okay" is a dangerous and overused response to children's emotional distress. The phrase can invalidate their feelings, disconnect them from their emotional world, and teach them to suppress their emotions to gain acceptance. Instead, parents should acknowledge and validate their children's emotions, allowing them to process their feelings and build resilience. Dismissing emotions can rewire a child's stress response and make it harder to trust and regulate their feelings.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that China's tightening export controls on critical minerals could impact over 75% of the United States' weapons supply chain. Researchers identified 80,000 weapons parts made using minerals like antimony, gallium, germanium, tungsten, and tellurium, for which China dominates the global supply. The report underscores the US's dependence on China for essential components of its weapon systems, despite political rhetoric advocating for self-sufficiency. The increasing use of these minerals in US weapons raises concerns about the vulnerability of the military supply chain.</p>
