          <p>Ebrahim Rasool, South Africa's expelled envoy to the US, stated he has no regrets regarding his comments criticizing the Trump administration's policies.  His remarks, made during a webinar, highlighted a shift in US-South Africa relations, and his expulsion is seen as a rare and significant escalation of tensions between the two countries.  The dispute follows a land reform bill passed in South Africa and subsequent US aid cuts.</p>

          <h2>Redefinition of Antisemitism in US Law and Policy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-23 08:38:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the controversial redefinition of antisemitism in American law, arguing it's being used to silence criticism of Israel and advance a Christian nationalist agenda.  This redefinition, often based on the IHRA definition, conflates anti-Zionism with antisemitism, suppressing pro-Palestinian activism and limiting free speech. The author contends this harms both Jewish and Palestinian communities.</p>

          <p>Three 26-storey tower blocks in Glasgow, Scotland were demolished using controlled explosions to make way for new housing.  The demolition, part of a larger redevelopment project, concluded successfully, although some residents had previously campaigned against the plan, advocating for renovation instead of demolition. The project will replace 600 flats with 386 affordable homes.</p>

          <h2>ALS Outbreak in the French Alps Investigated</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An unusually high number of ALS cases in a small village in the French Alps prompted a decade-long investigation.  Researchers explored various environmental factors, ultimately focusing on the consumption of false morels, a type of mushroom containing a neurotoxin. While not definitively proven to cause ALS, the findings suggest a strong correlation and highlight the potential role of environmental triggers in the disease's development.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported over 50,000 deaths since the start of the war.  This equates to approximately 2.1% of the pre-war population.
