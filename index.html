          <p>Dongchoon Circus, South Korea's last remaining circus and the oldest in the country, is celebrating its 100th anniversary. Founded in 1925, Dongchoon once thrived during the golden age of South Korean circuses in the 1960s, offering exotic animal acts and various performances. However, with the rise of television, the internet, and animal rights concerns, the circus faced declining audiences and eventually became the only one of its kind left in the nation. Despite these challenges, Dongchoon continues to perform acrobatic shows at a seaside tourist area in Ansan and aims to establish a circus school to cultivate local talent, preserving a unique genre of Korean performing arts. The circus has become a popular attraction for locals and tourists alike, and its historical significance has even led to calls for its designation as an intangible cultural asset. </p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines worldwide are dominated by speculation surrounding potential US military action against Iran. Publications like the Metro are using dramatic terms such as "ArmageDon," highlighting Iran's warnings of severe repercussions if its nuclear sites are attacked. Other outlets, including the Guardian, note President Trump's ambiguous stance on joining Israel's campaign against Iran, leaving the world in suspense. The Financial Times points to the US's unique capability to destroy Iran's underground nuclear facilities, while also reporting on a US national security warning to the UK regarding Chinese involvement in wind turbine development. The global community watches as tensions escalate, awaiting the US's next move in this critical situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government will resume processing international student visas but will now require applicants to disclose their social media accounts for thorough vetting. This decision follows a temporary halt to interviews for "F," "M," and "J" visa applicants, primarily academic, vocational, and cultural exchange students. The State Department has indicated that the new procedures will involve a comprehensive review of applicants' online presence to identify any potential "hostile attitudes." These changes, prompted by concerns over alleged anti-Semitism during student protests related to Israeli military actions, may increase the workload for embassy and consular staff, potentially reducing the number of visa interviews conducted. The Trump administration has been particularly critical of universities like Harvard, freezing subsidies and suspending their eligibility to accept international students due to their handling of student demonstrations.</p>

          <p>During the installation of two new 88-foot flagpoles at the White House, President Trump jokingly inquired about the immigration status of the construction workers. The remarks, made during a press conference, followed a question about the administration's deportation efforts. Trump stated that his administration is removing "murderers, drug dealers, people that are mentally insane," before turning to the workers and asking if any were undocumented immigrants. While the workers chuckled and shook their heads, Trump added that "If there were, we'll find out," highlighting his administration's focus on immigration enforcement. The new flagpoles, which Trump described as a gift to the White House, stand on the North and South Lawns.</p>

          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated that Israel's recent attacks on Iran are aimed at eliminating its nuclear capabilities, not pursuing regime change. Speaking to CNBC, Herzog emphasized that while a change in regime could potentially bring peace to the region, the primary objective is to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. He accused Tehran of "cheating" and "rushing to the bomb," referencing the International Atomic Energy Agency's concerns about Iran's lack of cooperation. Herzog asserted that the strikes have had a genuine impact on Iran's nuclear program, adding that "one has to be tough sometimes in order to remove imminent threats," and mentioned ongoing back-channel talks and dialogue with world leaders to de-escalate the situation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are resorting to "tariff engineering," a legal practice involving altering product materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into lower-duty categories. Customs lawyers and supply chain experts explain that this strategy allows companies to benefit from exemptions carved out by the U.S. government. For example, some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum elements into final products to qualify for a lower 25% duty, while others remove such elements to avoid higher tariffs on steel and aluminum products. Companies like Columbia Sportswear and Converse have also successfully implemented strategic product tweaks to save on tariff costs. The practice, though legal, requires careful navigation to avoid misrepresenting product classifications.</p>

While the US government has expressed support for Israel's defense, it maintains that it is not directly participating in the military conflict.

          <p>A recent Zillow report suggests that certain interior paint colors can significantly boost a home's sale price. According to the study, the most desirable kitchen color is olive green, with buyers willing to pay up to $1,600 more for kitchens featuring this shade. In bedrooms, classic navy walls are preferred, potentially increasing a home's value by an estimated $1,815. Dark gray living rooms are also favored over lighter colors, potentially boosting an offer by about $2,600. Conversely, bright, playful colors like lemon yellow in the kitchen or scarlet red in the bedroom may decrease a home's sale price.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that United States Steel Corp. is becoming increasingly strategically important, given the likelihood of sustained higher U.S. tariffs on steel products. Hashimoto believes that Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel will benefit the U.S. economy, but he doubts that trade levies alone will revitalize the manufacturing sector. The company has finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly-owned subsidiary, following approval from President Trump. Nippon Steel has also entered into a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, committing to invest around $11 billion by 2028 and maintain U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh.

The Disability Insurance fund is expected to maintain full benefits through at least 2099. The Medicare Hospital Insurance trust fund is projected to pay full benefits until 2033, with 89% payable thereafter. The new Social Security trustees report accounts for the effects of the Social Security Fairness Act, which enhanced benefits for certain public pensioners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nineteen individuals have been charged in Los Angeles County with conspiring to murder rapper Swifty Blue, allegedly ordered by Mexican Mafia member Manuel “Snuffy” Quintero. The plot unfolded through TikTok messages and jail calls, involving prisoners and gang members. Quintero allegedly issued the order in 2022, leading to an attempt on Abrego's life in November 2023 while he was jailed on a gun possession charge. The rapper was beaten and "sliced" by inmates, though the attempt was unsuccessful. The motive for the order remains unclear, but prosecutors believe it stemmed from Abrego angering Quintero.</p>
