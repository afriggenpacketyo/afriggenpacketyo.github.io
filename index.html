          <p>Melissa Turner was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of her boyfriend, Matthew Trussler. While she claimed self-defense, audio from a neighbor's security camera captured sounds of an argument, including a woman's voice yelling incriminating phrases. Prosecutors also used footage from an in-home ADT camera, which they argued showed an angry Turner following a calm Trussler before the stabbing. Despite her testimony that she feared for her life, the jury found her guilty, and she was sentenced to 20.5 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old cannabis farmworker, Jaime Alanís Garcia, has died after falling from a greenhouse roof during a federal immigration raid in Ventura County. While his family states he was fleeing agents, the Department of Homeland Security claims he was not being pursued. The large-scale operation resulted in over 300 arrests and has intensified tensions, leading to protests and a federal judge's order temporarily halting certain raid tactics. The incident has also raised questions about potential child labor violations at the facility, which federal officials are now investigating.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have achieved a significant legal victory in their fight for a new sentence. A judge has ordered the state to address why new evidence, which supports their long-standing claims of abuse, was not allowed in their trial. This evidence includes a letter Erik allegedly wrote to a cousin detailing sexual abuse and an affidavit from a former boy band member claiming he was sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez. This development comes as the brothers await an August parole hearing after their sentences were recently changed from life without parole.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights the urgent need to consider the global ramifications of a potential Ukrainian collapse in its war against Russia. It argues that such an outcome would represent a monumental strategic failure for the West, with severe negative consequences for European security, the transatlantic alliance, and international law. The article criticizes the wavering support from allies, particularly the United States under Donald Trump, and suggests that Russia's Vladimir Putin is banking on outlasting Western resolve.

          <p>Malaysia is experiencing a notable shift in its political landscape, characterized by the rising influence of conservative Islamic parties. The opposition Perikatan Nasional coalition, which includes the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), has gained significant electoral ground, challenging the more liberal agenda of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's government. This "green wave" reflects growing support for conservative policies, particularly among younger Malay voters, and is seen as a long-term threat to the nation's multi-ethnic identity. Analysts suggest this trend is fueled by disillusionment with establishment parties and could lead to a more conservative society.</p>

          <p>This opinion article discusses the rapid growth of the global space economy and China's significant role within it, highlighting a key opportunity for Hong Kong. With the space market projected to reach US$1.8 trillion by 2035, private investment in China's aerospace industry is soaring, supported by state initiatives and technological advances. The article points to successful private Chinese companies like i-Space and LandSpace as examples of this trend. It suggests that Hong Kong, with its financial and legal expertise, is well-positioned to become a vital hub for financing and supporting this burgeoning sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a major reorganization by laying off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees, part of a broader plan to reduce its domestic workforce by about 15%. The cuts, which have been planned for months, are aimed at eliminating redundant offices and refocusing the department on core missions. However, critics, including Democratic senators and the American Foreign Service Association, argue the layoffs will weaken U.S. diplomacy and national security. The reductions have significantly impacted bureaus focused on human rights, refugee admissions, and Afghan relocation efforts.</p>

          <p>China is actively promoting the development of what it terms "future industries" as a core part of its strategy to create a new, technology-driven growth model. First introduced by President Xi Jinping, this concept refers to emerging sectors built on nascent technologies with immense future potential.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several companies, including the UK-based start-up Better Dairy, are developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to produce casein, the key protein in milk. The goal is to create a product that tastes and melts like traditional dairy cheese, overcoming the quality gap often found in plant-based alternatives. However, these new products face significant hurdles, including high initial costs, regulatory approval processes, and a recent decline in the vegan food market. Success will depend on improving taste, achieving price parity, and convincing consumers to embrace this new food technology.</p>

While the UK government is negotiating to reduce the tariffs, the industry is struggling with high energy costs. This article explores the deep-seated identity of these towns in steelmaking and the difficult debate over whether to revive the industry or pivot to new sectors. (not investment advice)</p>
