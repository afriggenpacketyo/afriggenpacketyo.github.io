          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates are strengthening their alliance in artificial intelligence, driven by ambitions to dominate the global AI landscape. The UAE, rich in energy resources, seeks to become a regional AI hub, while the U.S. aims to ensure American companies lead the AI race against China. Recent deals, including the Stargate Project, involve significant investments from OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia, granting the UAE access to advanced American technology and software. This partnership marks a shift from traditional oil and weapons-focused relations to one centered on compute power and AI ecosystems, with the UAE strategically aligning with the U.S. in the U.S.-China competition.</p>

          <p>David McBride, a former military lawyer who leaked classified documents revealing alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan, lost his appeal to reduce his prison sentence. The Australian Capital Territory Court of Appeal rejected McBride's argument that he acted in the public interest by leaking the documents. McBride's lawyers plan to challenge the decision in the High Court, arguing that exposing a crime should not be a crime. Rights groups have criticized the prosecution, noting that McBride is the only person imprisoned over the alleged war crimes committed by Australian special forces in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016.</p>

          <p>Getty Images is investing millions in its lawsuit against Stability AI, accusing the startup and other AI labs of stealing copyrighted material to train AI models for commercial use. Getty CEO Craig Peters argues that these firms are unfairly competing by using copyrighted images without permission or compensation. He contends that the AI industry's argument that paying for creative works would stifle innovation is a false narrative. Getty is suing Stability AI in both the U.K. and U.S., alleging the company copied 12 million images without authorization, while Stability AI contests the claims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's bond market is raising concerns about potential capital flight from the U.S. as long-dated yields approach record highs. Rising yields on Japanese government bonds could incentivize Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering a global financial market downturn. Analysts warn that a carry trade unwind could occur as higher yields strengthen the yen, impacting appetite for foreign investments, particularly in U.S. tech stocks. While some analysts believe the impact will be gradual, others foresee a more severe unwinding than witnessed last year, driven by eroding confidence in the U.S. dollar (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>European businesses' optimism about growth and profitability in China has plummeted to a record low, influenced by economic downturns and rising geopolitical tensions. A survey conducted before the escalation of the China-US trade war in April indicated bleak prospects, with only 29% of respondents optimistic about growth in the coming years. Market access and regulatory barriers remain significant concerns, with many not expecting improvements. Despite China's commitment to maintaining an open market, foreign businesses are increasingly pessimistic about their prospects in the region.</p>

          <p>China's aeronautics industry has achieved a significant breakthrough with a patented next-generation self-cooling turbine blade for jet engines. This innovation allows alloy turbine blades to withstand temperatures 15% higher than existing versions, enhancing engine thrust, fuel efficiency, and service life. The Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials, under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC), developed the technology. These high-temperature alloy turbine blades are crucial for modern jet engines, directly influencing performance and reliability, with the new method improving the thermal tolerance of the blades.</p>

          <p>European companies operating in China are finding it increasingly difficult to do business due to weak economic demand and opaque government regulations. A recent survey by the European Chamber of Commerce in China revealed that nearly three-quarters of companies reported worsening operating conditions. Despite curbing investments, some European businesses are increasing their reliance on Chinese components, complicating efforts to reduce dependence on China. This trend is exacerbated by retaliatory tariffs and a weakening Chinese currency, making Chinese components more attractive to European companies.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket successfully reached orbit during its ninth test flight, but experienced a propellant leak that led to a loss of attitude control. The spacecraft spun out of control and re-entered Earth's atmosphere at a non-ideal angle, causing it to mostly burn up, with remaining pieces falling into the Indian Ocean. Despite the "rapid unscheduled disassembly," SpaceX considers the mission a success due to the data collected, which will help improve Starship's reliability. This iterative approach to engineering involves evaluating data, making adjustments, and building upon previous successes and failures, moving closer to sending humans to Mars.</p>

Sir Sadiq Khan supports the report, stating that current rules "cannot be justified" and that the findings provide a compelling case for decriminalization.

United needs to boost its attacking options, and Cunha, with 27 goals in 65 Premier League appearances, is seen as someone who can make an instant impact.</p>

The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) attributes this success to the island's isolation, which protects the birds from predators and human impact. While puffins face threats like pollution, food shortages, and climate change globally, Skomer Island provides an abundance of food and a lack of predators, contributing to high breeding success.
