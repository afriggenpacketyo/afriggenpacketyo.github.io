        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve recently lowered its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point, a move typically expected to reduce borrowing costs. However, bond traders reacted by selling longer-dated bonds, causing their yields and, consequently, long-term rates like mortgages, to rise. This unexpected outcome suggests bond investors perceive the Fed's easing as a risk to inflation, which remains above target, rather than a signal for economic stability. The market's reaction highlights a divergence in views on monetary policy and its implications for the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has issued a stern warning to Chicago (CTA) and Boston (MBTA) transit systems, threatening federal funding cuts if they fail to address rising violence and safety concerns. Citing incidents like an elderly woman being shoved off a bus and a CTA veteran assaulted, Duffy criticized local leaders and their cashless bail policies. Both agencies have been given 14 days to submit reports detailing their plans to curb crime, reduce fare evasion, and improve cleanliness. This initiative extends previous warnings issued to other major U.S. transit systems.</p>

          <p>Over a decade after 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru was murdered in Kenya, allegedly by a British soldier, a Kenyan court has issued an arrest warrant for a UK national. This potential extradition would mark a historic first for a British soldier facing trial abroad for a civilian murder. The article details Wanjiru's life, the circumstances of her disappearance in 2012, and the subsequent discovery of her body in a septic tank near a hotel frequented by British troops. Her friends and family continue to demand justice, highlighting a long-standing struggle for accountability.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced Britain's intention to recognize a Palestinian state in September, coinciding with the UN General Assembly, contingent on specific conditions for Israel. This marks a significant shift in British foreign policy, driven by domestic pressure from Labour MPs and international developments. While some view it as a symbolic gesture, government sources believe it will impact the situation on the ground and promote a two-state solution. The decision has drawn criticism from Israel and some UK voices, who argue it rewards terrorism and creates diplomatic friction with the U.S.</p>

While the law targets federal agents operating within the state, its enforceability and impact on federal jurisdiction remain unclear, potentially leading to legal challenges.
