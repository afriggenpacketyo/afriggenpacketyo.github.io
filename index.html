          <p>The United Kingdom has announced that no official Israeli government delegation will be invited to the DSEI UK 2025 defense exhibition in London, citing Israel's escalating military operations in Gaza as "wrong." In response, Israel's defense ministry criticized the decision as discriminatory and politically motivated, withdrawing its plan to host a national pavilion. While government officials are barred, Israeli defense industry companies will still be permitted to attend the major international arms fair. This move reflects growing criticism from UK leaders regarding Israel's conduct in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the city's future remains precarious despite a $14.4 billion state-of-the-art levee system. The new infrastructure, one of the world's most sophisticated, has successfully protected the city from subsequent storms like Hurricane Ida. However, the dual threats of rising sea levels due to climate change and the city's rapid sinking are diminishing the levees' effectiveness faster than projected. Experts warn that without constant, costly maintenance and upgrades, which are threatened by potential funding cuts, New Orleans is vulnerable to future catastrophic flooding.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has declared there is "no way" the U.S. can invade his country, following Washington's deployment of warships to the Caribbean for what it terms an anti-drug trafficking operation. The U.S. has increased pressure on Maduro, whom it accuses of leading a cocaine trafficking cartel, and recently raised the bounty for his capture to $50 million. In response, Venezuela has mobilized its own warships and initiated a recruitment drive for its civilian militia to bolster national defenses. Maduro has accused the Trump administration of attempting to orchestrate regime change through its maximum pressure policy.</p>

In his place, the squad features first-time call-ups for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson and Tottenham full-back Djed Spence, signaling a shift in the team's selection strategy.</p>

          <p>A day of mourning was observed in Kyiv after a major Russian aerial attack killed at least 23 people, making it the second deadliest strike on the capital during the war. The attack, which destroyed a residential building and damaged the EU's diplomatic mission, has drawn widespread condemnation from international leaders. As recovery efforts continue, European Union defense ministers are meeting in Denmark to discuss further military support for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated the attack shows Moscow chose "ballistics instead of the negotiating table," reinforcing the need for tougher sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>China's largest state-owned banks, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), are experiencing significant pressure on their profitability due to a slowing economy, lower interest rates, and weak loan demand. In their first-half earnings reports, all major state lenders reported a decline in their net interest margins, a crucial indicator of profitability. While government support has helped them slightly reduce their ratios of non-performing loans, the persistent economic challenges continue to weigh on their financial performance. The trend highlights the broader difficulties facing China's financial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The families of Fletcher Merkel, 8, and Harper Moyski, 10, have spoken out after the two children were killed in a mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis. The shooter, a 23-year-old former student, opened fire during a church service, also injuring 18 others who are expected to survive. Fletcher's father remembered his son's love for family and sports, while Harper's parents described her as a bright and joyful girl, urging for action on gun violence. The shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and police say the motive involved a "deranged obsession with previous mass shooters."</p>

The SEC claims this delay allowed Musk to purchase shares at artificially low prices, saving him approximately $150 million. Musk's legal team argues the lawsuit is a waste of resources, stating there was no investor harm, no ongoing violation, and that any filing error was immediately corrected. They also accuse the SEC of selectively targeting Musk due to his criticism of government overreach.</p>

A key bright spot was its cloud computing division, which saw revenue grow 26% due to strong demand for AI-related products.

The report suggests affluent consumers are more prone to "speculative" buying and a practice known as "bracketing," where they order multiple variations of an item with the intent to return most of them.

          <p>The UK government has instructed its contractor, Mitie, to withdraw job advertisements for tutors to teach activities like balloon-craft and cake decorating at a Heathrow immigration removal center. The roles, which were criticized by Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp as inappropriate spending, were intended to provide creative workshops for migrants awaiting deportation. Home Office minister Seema Malhotra stated the roles were not considered necessary. However, the contractor and a charity argued that such activities are part of contractual obligations to support the mental wellbeing of detainees, especially given the lengthy detention periods many face.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has dismissed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office, ruling that she violated ethical standards in a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen. During the call, she was heard criticizing the Thai army and addressing Hun Sen informally as "uncle" amid border tensions, which the court said cast doubt on her commitment to national interests. Paetongtarn is the third member of the powerful Shinawatra political dynasty to be removed from the premiership. Her dismissal plunges the country into political uncertainty as parliament must now select a new leader for the fragile ruling coalition.</p>

          <p>Germany's unemployment level has risen above three million people for the first time since 2015, signaling the effects of a prolonged economic slump on the labor market. The Federal Employment Agency reported that the unemployment rate increased to 6.4% in August, a rise attributed to a typical summer lull in hiring and persistent economic weakness. While officials noted some fragile signs of stabilization and expect an autumn upturn, the figure underscores the challenges facing the German economy, which has struggled with high energy costs, weak industrial output, and pressure on exports from U.S. tariff policies.</p>

Ostapenko accused Townsend of having no education or class, which prompted accusations of racism that she has since denied. Osaka, after her own third-round victory, defended Townsend as smart and hardworking, suggesting Ostapenko's remarks were ill-timed and terrible, regardless of intent.

          <p>Federal prosecutors claim that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has become an inspiration for others to commit violence. In a court filing, the prosecution argued that Mangione poses an ongoing danger by seeking to normalize violence for political objectives, citing his cultivation of online supporters. As evidence of his influence, they referenced the recent deadly mass shooting at the NFL headquarters, where the gunman left a note with grievances similar in nature to Mangione's anti-insurance industry sentiments. The filing is part of the government's effort to seek the death penalty in the case.</p>

          <p>Denmark has significantly reduced its 2025 economic growth forecast from 3% to 1.4%, largely due to weaker performance expectations for its pharmaceutical giant, Novo Nordisk. The company, known for its popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, is facing increased competition and slowing U.S. exports, which had previously been a major driver of the nation's GDP. The economy ministry stated that pharmaceuticals are now expected to contribute far less to export growth this year. The downgrade also reflects the impact of U.S. tariffs and statistical revisions showing weaker-than-expected growth in previous years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent takeover of the Washington, D.C. police department is raising concerns about the potential for a more centralized, national police force with loyalty to the executive. This move, combined with an executive order to create new federal public safety units and a shift in the FBI's mission toward violent crime, suggests a trend toward consolidating law enforcement power. Critics fear these actions could erode the longstanding U.S. tradition of state and local policing, potentially creating new, MAGA-loyal units. Such a force could be deployed in future national crises, posing a significant challenge to the rule of law.</p>

Their attorney contends that releasing such images violates their privacy and feeds a "true crime" industry that profits from their tragedy.

          <p>Parasocial relationships describe the one-sided sense of intimacy that fans develop with public figures like celebrities, podcasters, or influencers, whom they feel they know personally despite the lack of reciprocity. This phenomenon, which has existed for centuries, is now amplified by social media and the direct access it provides, blurring the lines between public personas and private individuals. While these connections can be meaningful for fans, they can also lead to entitlement and toxic behavior, such as stalking or harassment. The article explains that fans are not relating to the actual person but to a constructed "star text" created by the celebrity, media, and the fans themselves.</p>

          <p>This opinion column challenges the narrative that federal student aid is the primary driver of soaring college tuition, arguing instead that decades of declining state funding for higher education are to blame. The article traces a long history of U.S. government investment in education as a public good, from Thomas Jefferson to the G.I. Bill, noting this trend reversed in the 1980s. Since then, the financial burden has shifted from the state to individual students and their families. The author concludes that restoring affordability requires reinvesting public funds in higher education, viewing it as essential to democracy and economic stability, not a luxury item.</p>

The author contends that while President Trump's actions, such as federalizing the D.C. police, are alarming, most voters are more concerned with their personal finances. Citing the 2024 election and a recent Democratic victory in an Iowa special election, the article suggests that framing Trump's policies in terms of their negative impact on household budgets is a more resonant and winning strategy.

White House officials defended the move, stating the government deserves a return on its investment in the domestic semiconductor industry.
