        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.K. Treasury has announced that the Autumn Budget will be delivered on November 26, placing Finance Minister Rachel Reeves under pressure to address significant fiscal challenges. The budget aims to tackle an economy struggling with high costs for working people, with Reeves committed to strict fiscal rules that require day-to-day spending to be funded by tax receipts. Economists predict that tax hikes will be necessary to meet these rules and maintain a fiscal buffer, as rising borrowing costs and spending commitments have limited the government's options. The key question remains whether these potential tax increases will target businesses or individual workers.</p>

          <p>As Chinese President Xi Jinping was joined by Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un for a major military parade, former U.S. President Donald Trump accused the trio of conspiring against America. In a social media post, Trump also questioned whether Xi would acknowledge the significant U.S. support provided to China during World War II. A Kremlin aide dismissed the conspiracy allegations, but the public appearance of the three leaders together has amplified Western concerns over their increasing collaboration, particularly in relation to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and the challenge they pose to the current global order.</p>

          <p>A portrait of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee has been returned to display in the library at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, reversing a 2022 Department of Defense directive to remove commemorations of the Confederacy. The move is part of a broader Trump administration effort to restore historical names and monuments, with an Army spokesperson stating, "we honor our history and learn from it - we don't erase it." Critics, including a retired brigadier general who served on the removal commission, argue that honoring Lee contradicts West Point's values because he committed treason to defend a slave-holding republic.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a strike on a vessel in the southern Caribbean, killing 11 individuals he identified as "narcoterrorists" from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The operation targeted the boat, which was allegedly transporting illegal narcotics to the United States while in international waters. This action represents an escalation of military and political pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government, which has recently faced increased U.S. military presence in the region. A Venezuelan official suggested a video of the strike shared by Trump was AI-generated, a claim that has not been substantiated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alphabet's stock increased by 6% after a U.S. District Judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in its antitrust case against Google. The company will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system, a decision viewed as a major victory by investors. While Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in internet search, the remedies permit it to continue paying companies like Apple to be the default search engine, though exclusive contracts are now barred.

          <p>China held its largest-ever military parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, showcasing advanced weaponry including hypersonic missiles and drones. President Xi Jinping was joined by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a gathering seen as a deliberate display of solidarity against the U.S.-dominated global order. The event highlighted deepening ties among the three nations, which some analysts have dubbed an "Axis of Upheaval." This strategic alignment challenges U.S. influence and underscores China's ambition to reshape international power dynamics with its growing military and geopolitical clout.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a severe shortage of skilled workers in critical national security sectors, including naval shipbuilding and advanced semiconductor manufacturing, which could undermine its competitive edge against China. Decades of devaluing trade jobs and a decline in the manufacturing workforce have left crucial positions unfilled, from shipfitters to semiconductor technicians. The Navy's shipyards alone need to hire 250,000 new workers over the next decade, while the chip industry faces a projected shortfall of 146,000 qualified candidates by 2030. Addressing this crisis requires a renewed focus on vocational training and competitive wages to rebuild the nation's industrial workforce.</p>

          <p>California's ambitious high-speed rail project is progressing in the Central Valley, but its future is in jeopardy as the Trump administration seeks to revoke $4 billion in federal grants. Critics have labeled the project a "train to nowhere" due to significant delays, budget overruns, and the fact that the initial segment does not connect to Los Angeles or San Francisco. The California High-Speed Rail Authority is suing to protect the funding and insists it has learned from past mistakes, laying out a new strategy to eventually connect the major urban centers.

          <p>The Trump administration, in partnership with conservative nonprofit PragerU, has launched 'The Founders Museum,' an exhibit featuring paintings and over 40 AI-generated videos of historical figures.

Critics argue the exhibit presents a narrow, sanitized version of American history that omits marginalized voices and potent critiques from the era. The project is part of a broader push to celebrate America's upcoming 250th anniversary with a focus on patriotism and American greatness.</p>

          <p>The filler word "um" serves multiple crucial functions in conversation, such as holding a speaker's turn, filling pauses while thinking, and softening one's tone. Its simple vowel sound makes it easy to produce, and similar filler words exist across many languages, reflecting neutral sounds in different dialects. While historically absent from formal writing, "um" is increasingly used in informal digital text to convey humor or confusion. Despite its utility, the word is often stigmatized in professional settings, where its use can be perceived as a sign of indecisiveness, though linguists view it as a natural and important part of spontaneous speech.</p>

          <p>During a meeting in Beijing, Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for providing troops who fought "heroically" in Ukraine. This acknowledgment confirms deepening military cooperation between the two nations, with South Korea estimating that North Korea has sent around 15,000 troops to support Russia's war effort. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy continues diplomatic efforts to build support, attending a summit with Nordic and Baltic states to prepare for "significant reinforcements." The developments highlight the entrenching alliances on both sides of the conflict as it continues with intense Russian aerial attacks on Ukraine.</p>

          <p>While Google avoided a forced breakup of its business in its landmark antitrust case, the court's remedies could still impact its dominance. The ruling allows Google to continue paying for default search engine placement but bars exclusive contracts, potentially giving partners more leverage. A key factor in the decision was the rise of generative AI, which the judge noted could present a new competitive threat to Google's search monopoly. The ruling reflects judicial caution in predicting the future of a rapidly changing market and the legal precedent set by the Microsoft case two decades ago, which makes structural remedies like breakups difficult to impose.</p>

Russia has already helped build four reactors in China and is constructing four more.

          <p>Real Madrid has demonstrated a remarkable ability to sign world-class football players on free transfers, a strategy that has secured top talent without massive fees. The recent acquisition of Trent Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool follows similar moves for stars like David Alaba, Antonio Rudiger, and Kylian Mbappe in previous years. The Spanish club's immense prestige and relentless pursuit of trophies create an allure that convinces elite players to run down their contracts at other major clubs. This approach allows Real Madrid to maintain a competitive advantage in a transfer market where other top leagues are defined by exorbitant spending.</p>

          <p>Thailand's government is in chaos after the ruling Pheu Thai party moved to dissolve parliament, seeking royal approval for a new election. The decision came after the country's largest opposition group, the People's Party, backed a rival candidate for prime minister following the constitutional court's dismissal of Paetongtarn Shinawatra. The opposition's support is conditioned on the new prime minister dissolving the House within four months, ensuring a fresh election. This maneuver aims to prevent the return of an old, unpopular coalition or a former coup leader, plunging the Southeast Asian nation into further political uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Cement production in the United Kingdom has dropped to its lowest point since the 1950s, a decline that a leading trade body warns could jeopardize the government's housing and infrastructure plans. The Mineral Products Association (MPA) attributes the fall to high energy costs, regulatory burdens, and increased competition from cheaper imports, which now account for nearly a third of the market. With the government planning to build 1.5 million new homes and invest heavily in infrastructure, the dwindling domestic supply of this essential construction material poses a significant risk to achieving these ambitious targets and could threaten jobs in the sector.</p>
