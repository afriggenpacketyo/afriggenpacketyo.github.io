          <p>Japan has strongly condemned North Korea's recent missile launches, viewing them as a grave threat to regional peace and stability. The Japanese government has stated that these actions are in direct violation of UN Security Council resolutions and pose a significant security risk. Japan is closely coordinating with its allies, including the United States and South Korea, to monitor the situation and ensure a strong response to any further provocations. The international community is urged to take concerted action to address North Korea's continued development of ballistic missiles, which undermines regional security and stability.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are emphasizing a recently enacted law designed to support the country's private economy, viewing it as a critical component for growth. The law aims to address challenges faced by private enterprises, including fair competition, market access, financial support, and legal protections. China's vice-minister of justice, Wang Zhenjiang, stated that the legislation is expected to stimulate internal momentum and creative vitality within the private sector, particularly as China focuses on domestic economic drivers amidst ongoing trade disputes with the United States. The law formally defines the legal status of the private economy and government support for the first time.</p>

          <p>Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators were taken into police custody after occupying part of the main library on Columbia University’s campus, rekindling a protest movement from the previous spring.

The university called the New York City police back to campus for the first time since a similar occupation last year. The protest comes as the Trump administration has been cracking down on Columbia over what it calls its failure to protect Jewish students from harassment, cutting more than $400 million in federal research funding to the school.</p>

          <p>This article suggests that the West is at a crucial turning point, where the rise, fall, and transformation of civilizations are often influenced by the choices of their leaders. The author posits that US President Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric are hastening the unraveling of the Western world order, echoing the mistakes of past rulers. The author argues that Trump's tariffs, attacks on NATO allies, denial of facts, embrace of nationalism, and undermining of democratic norms are accelerating a loss of faith in the Western project.</p>

On Wednesday, India launched attacks against Pakistan, leading to claims from Pakistan that it shot down several Indian aircraft, including top-line fighter jets. The exact number and variety of lost aircraft is not yet clear, but both sides have offered conflicting accounts. The New York Times was unable to independently verify these claims.</p>
