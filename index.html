          <p>Despite societal shifts towards more equitable parenting roles, many institutions and individuals still default to assuming mothers are the primary caregivers. This phenomenon is supported by research showing that schools and medical offices are more likely to contact mothers, even when fathers are listed as the primary contact. This can lead to added stress and disruptions for mothers, while also undermining fathers' roles in parenting. Outdated software systems and societal stereotypes contribute to this persistent bias, highlighting the need for systemic changes to support more equitable parenting practices.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, in Saudi Arabia, signaling a significant shift in U.S. policy toward the war-torn nation. Al-Sharaa, a former Islamist militant, now leads a government seeking to rebuild ties with the West. Trump expressed his support for al-Sharaa, urging him to normalize relations with Israel and address terrorism, while also announcing the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria to facilitate its economic recovery and reduce Iranian influence in the region.</p>

          <p>One climber survived a 400-foot fall in Washington's North Cascades mountains that killed his three companions. The survivor, Anton Tselykh, managed to hike to his car and call for help despite suffering internal bleeding and head trauma. The group was descending the Early Winters Spires when their anchor failed, leading to the tragic accident. The recovered equipment suggests the climbers may have been relying on an old, insecure piton.</p>

          <p>Three officials from the Trump administration have been identified as having close connections to antisemitic extremists. This information comes as the Trump administration has cited fighting antisemitism as a justification for deporting pro-Palestinian student protesters and implementing funding cuts to universities.

          <p>The Israeli military conducted a strike in Khan Younis, Gaza, targeting Muhammad Sinwar, a top Hamas leader. Sinwar, known for his hard-line stance and opposition to compromises with Israel, is believed to be a key military commander within the group. The operation follows Israel's strategy of eliminating Hamas's leadership hierarchy, aiming to weaken the organization's military capabilities and influence in the region.</p>
