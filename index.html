          <p>Liberal, pro-EU mayor Nicusor Dan won the Romanian presidency, defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion after a tense race marked by political turbulence. Simion initially claimed victory but conceded after midnight, following a campaign where he attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Ukraine, while Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine. Dan's victory represents a win for Romanians seeking change, emphasizing unity and dismissing Russian influence, particularly after a prior election was annulled due to Russian interference claims. Simion's support was notable among diaspora voters in Western Europe, reflecting unhappiness with mainstream parties and job opportunities within Romania. The article highlights the divisions and political complexities within Romania's current political landscape.</p>

          <p>The House Budget Committee advanced President Trump's domestic policy bill after conservatives initially stalled it over insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to minor modifications, with four conservative holdouts voting 'present,' allowing the bill to proceed. The legislation aims to extend tax cuts, increase military and border security spending, and cut Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. The bill faces opposition from conservatives seeking stricter Medicaid work requirements and an end to clean energy subsidies, as well as from Republicans from blue states concerned about the state and local tax deduction. The article underscores the challenges in uniting the Republican party behind a unified budget strategy.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer that has spread, raising questions about his health after leaving office.
