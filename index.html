          <p>An Armenian village, Kirants, has been bisected by a three-meter-tall concrete wall, erected as part of a border demarcation process with Azerbaijan based on Soviet maps. This division has led to significant land loss for farmers and a deterioration of the local economy, deeply affecting the 350 inhabitants. While the sight of the wall and Azerbaijani flags is depressing for many, some villagers, including the local school head, express cautious optimism that it might ensure peace, noting the absence of gunfire since its construction. This contrasts sharply with the frequent shelling during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, yet residents harbor doubts about the long-term stability despite ongoing peace talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships in Tokyo opened with athletes confronting "absolutely brutal" conditions, as temperatures soared to 30C with over 90% humidity, even after race start times were adjusted. Japan celebrated its first medal in the 35km race walk, a significant moment for the host nation eager to welcome crowds after the closed-door 2020 Olympics. While the championships mark a vibrant return for global sports in Tokyo, with nearly 500,000 tickets sold, serious concerns persist regarding athlete welfare as a heatwave is predicted to intensify, potentially pushing temperatures into the mid-30s. This challenging environment underscores the difficulties of competing in Japan's warmest summer on record, prompting further adjustments to event schedules.</p>

          <p>Corona Centennial delivered a historic 43-36 upset against No. 1-ranked Mater Dei, marking Mater Dei's first loss to a Southern Section team other than St. John Bosco in a decade. Centennial initially dominated, leading 28-0 after the first quarter, fueled by defensive end Jonathan McKinley's sacks and a crucial pick-six. Mater Dei, however, mounted a fierce 29-0 comeback in the third quarter to seize a 36-33 lead. Yet, Centennial rallied in the fourth, capitalizing on Mater Dei's repeated turnovers, including five fumbles and two interceptions. This thrilling victory, secured by a late touchdown and a decisive second interception, significantly alters the landscape of Southern California high school football, previously a two-team dominance.</p>

          <p>Two-time major champion John Daly regrettably entered the PGA Tour Champions record book by posting a score of 19 on the par-5 12th hole at the Sanford International. This unprecedented score broke his own personal worst by one shot, previously an 18 from the 1998 Bay Hill Invitational, and exceeded the tour's prior highest single-hole score by three strokes. Daly's calamitous performance on the hole involved hitting seven consecutive shots into a water hazard. Despite this monumental struggle, he managed to recover slightly by carding a par on his very next hole, ultimately concluding his round with an overall score of 88.</p>

This renewed popularity is largely credited to the mainstream success of country-pop artists and the pervasive influence of TikTok, where numerous new routines rapidly go viral. Instructors across the UK are observing a significant increase in younger participants, including teenagers and children, effectively dismantling the previous stereotype. The dance style's appeal is further enhanced by its adaptability to diverse music genres, its low-impact nature, and the strong sense of community it fosters, positioning it as an accessible and highly engaging form of exercise and social interaction for a wider audience.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Solnit argues that the recently released Jeffrey Epstein birthday album, which disturbingly hints at his predatory behavior, is a late remnant of a widespread cultural normalization of sexual exploitation of young girls. She recounts how the 1970s and 80s, through movies, music, and media, often depicted the sexual involvement of adult men with underage girls as acceptable, even glamorous, frequently blaming the victims. Solnit contends that the societal shift away from this permissive attitude, and the recognition of such acts as sexual assault and abuse, is a direct result of the feminist movement. Feminism insisted on women's rights, the necessity of active consent, and acknowledged the vast power imbalances that render consent impossible between adults and children.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series has achieved record-breaking pre-order sales in China, indicating robust consumer demand despite reported shipment delays for the iPhone Air model. Major online platforms such as JD.com experienced first-minute sales that exceeded the entire first-day pre-order volume of last year's iPhone 16 series, with the standard 256GB iPhone 17 emerging as the most popular variant. The overwhelming demand caused temporary difficulties accessing Apple's official website for many customers and led to all in-person pickup slots in Shanghai being fully booked within 20 minutes of launch. Consequently, customers in Guangzhou are now facing waiting periods extending to mid-October, underscoring the immense market enthusiasm and the iPhone 17's significant impact in China.</p>

          <p>Germany's state of Bavaria continues to welcome Chinese investment, as stated by state minister Aiwanger, even amidst broader European Union tensions and calls for enhanced economic resilience and self-sufficiency. Commemorating a 50-year history of engagement, Bavaria emphasizes that protectionism and isolationism are not the optimal strategies for fostering economic strength. This approach highlights a nuanced perspective within Germany, where individual states maintain pragmatic trade and investment relationships with major global economies like China, the USA, and Japan. Bavaria's sustained openness to Chinese companies signals a distinct regional economic policy, potentially diverging from some of the broader EU-level discussions regarding strategic de-risking and reducing dependencies.</p>

Despite EU tariffs, Chinese brands have nearly doubled their market share in Europe in the past year, leveraging their advantages in affordability, battery technology, and production scale. European legacy brands, while present, face criticism for slower EV development and reliance on older platforms, prompting a crucial competition for the future of the automotive industry.

          <p>US health authorities are on alert as Chagas disease, transmitted by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite via "kissing bugs," is increasingly detected in at least eight states and is nearing endemic classification. This reclassification would signify its status as a permanently present health risk, profoundly impacting monitoring, research, and treatment strategies across the country. The disease, often asymptomatic during its initial phase, can lead to severe chronic complications like myocarditis and permanent heart failure years later, posing a life-threatening risk, particularly for babies, children, or individuals with weakened immune systems. With no vaccine currently available and existing treatments carrying potential side effects, experts strongly recommend strict insect protection and routine blood donation screenings to effectively curb its alarming spread.</p>

          <p>The United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt have jointly called for a three-month humanitarian truce in Sudan, to be followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. This "Quad" initiative aims to end the deadly conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has caused tens of thousands of deaths and a severe humanitarian crisis. The statement emphasizes a Sudanese-led transition, rejecting any role for extremist groups, and comes as the US imposed sanctions on Sudan's Finance Minister and an Islamist militia, highlighting international efforts to stabilize the war-torn nation.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the high-profile retrial concerning the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, though she was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. This verdict followed a mistrial in her first trial and months of contentious legal battles where defense attorneys alleged an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The case, marked by disputed timelines, witness intimidation charges against a blogger, and internal police investigations, has captivated public attention. Read was sentenced to one year of probation, while key prosecution witnesses expressed deep disappointment, calling it a "devastating miscarriage of justice."</p>

          <p>A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fatally shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez in Franklin Park, Illinois, after authorities claim he attempted to drive his vehicle into agents, dragging one. The incident, part of "targeted law enforcement activity," occurred after Villegas-Gonzalez, an undocumented driver with a history of reckless driving, resisted arrest. Surveillance video shows the vehicle backing up and driving away after agents approached. The agent sustained "severe injuries" but stabilized, while Villegas-Gonzalez died. The shooting has sparked calls for a full investigation from Rep. Chuy Garcia and Governor JB Pritzker, with questions raised about the warrant and the release of all available footage.</p>

The physical parity at the weigh-in sets the stage for a compelling contest, as Crawford's adaptability and ring IQ are tested against Alvarez's natural power and experience at the super-middleweight class.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer initially defended Lord Mandelson's appointment as US ambassador, despite officials at No 10 and the Foreign Office reportedly being aware of supportive emails between Mandelson and paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Starmer himself was not privy to the email contents at the time of his defense. The emails, which surfaced publicly later, revealed Mandelson's supportive stance towards Epstein before his imprisonment, leading to Mandelson's subsequent dismissal. This incident has intensified pressure on Starmer regarding his handling of the appointment and raised questions about the vetting process, with some Labour MPs warning of a "dangerous atmosphere" within the party.</p>

          <p>The Belarusian opposition, led by Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, alleges that dozens of political prisoners released this week as part of a US-brokered deal were forcibly deported to Lithuania. While acknowledging happiness for their freedom, Tsikhanouskaya criticized the move as "not real freedom," especially since many were nearing the end of their sentences and now lack passports to return home. The agreement, which includes lifting sanctions on Belarus' national airline, was brokered by US special envoy John Coale and saw some prisoners thank Donald Trump. However, the opposition calls on Western governments to demand that President Lukashenko allow political prisoners to remain in Belarus.</p>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers have passed a Republican-backed plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, aiming to create an additional GOP-leaning House seat. The plan, which splits the Kansas City area to make a Democratic district more conservative, follows similar efforts in California and Texas, supported by President Trump to bolster the GOP's slim House majority. Opponents, including the ACLU, have filed a legal challenge, arguing the map is unconstitutional, rushed, and racially gerrymandered. Critics highlight the risks of using outdated data and the potential for legal battles, emphasizing that the move is a partisan attempt to rig midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A Harvard study has found a significant link between experiences of stalking or obtaining restraining orders and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in women. Analyzing 20 years of data from 66,270 American nurses, researchers found a 41% increased risk for women who experienced stalking and a 70% higher risk for those who obtained a restraining order, even after accounting for other health factors. This research, led by Dr. Karestan Koenen, suggests that violence commonly experienced by women profoundly impacts cardiovascular health, advocating for doctors to incorporate questions about stalking and restraining orders into future heart health screenings to improve women's overall well-being.</p>
