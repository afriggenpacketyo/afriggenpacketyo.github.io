          <p>A recent survey reveals that a vast majority of Germans, approximately 77%, are unhappy with the performance of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government. The dissatisfaction stems from public infighting over the budget, proposed welfare cuts, and social policy reforms, mirroring the discord that led to the collapse of the previous coalition. This public discontent coincides with the far-right AfD party gaining ground, reaching a new high of 25% in voter support, closely trailing Merz's CDU/CSU bloc. The political climate remains tense as the government faces the need for significant budget savings in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Paul Doyle, a 53-year-old former Royal Marine Commando, has pleaded not guilty to 31 charges, including causing grievous bodily harm with intent and dangerous driving. He is accused of deliberately driving a car into crowds of Liverpool FC fans who were celebrating the team's Premier League victory parade on May 26. The incident, which prosecutors described as using a car "as a weapon," resulted in injuries to over 130 people, including eight children. Doyle entered his plea at Liverpool Crown Court via a videolink from prison, setting the stage for a future trial.</p>

          <p>Following days of public disagreement, leaders of Germany's ruling coalition have presented a united front, agreeing on a path forward for welfare system reforms and the challenging 2027 budget. Chancellor Friedrich Merz and SPD ministers, including Bärbel Bas who had previously criticized the Chancellor's rhetoric, stated they are "on the same course" to preserve but reform the welfare state. This announcement aims to project stability and avoid the prolonged, contentious budget negotiations that have plagued past governments. The article also notes that carmaker Porsche is set to be delisted from Germany's DAX index.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is becoming progressively isolated within the European Union due to its reluctance to support sanctions against Israel over the conflict in Gaza. Despite growing public and domestic political pressure, including from within the junior coalition partner SPD, Chancellor Merz's government has maintained its position of offering "criticism without consequences," citing historical responsibility. Observers note that a growing majority of EU states favor sanctions, raising questions about what legal or international developments might finally compel Berlin to change its long-standing policy. The German government fears potential complicity in international law violations if it continues its current level of support.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares fell over 5% after the enterprise software company released a quarterly forecast that disappointed Wall Street investors, even as it beat current earnings and revenue estimates. CEO Marc Benioff defended the guidance as "appropriately conservative" and highlighted the success of the company's new artificial intelligence products and major government contracts.

          <p>A recent series of high-level meetings hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping highlights key themes of China's current foreign policy strategy. In discussions with various world leaders, Xi has consistently emphasized the importance of upholding multilateralism and supporting the international order centered around the United Nations. This diplomatic push is seen as a way for Beijing to position itself as a champion of a multipolar world and strengthen economic cooperation with its partners. These remarks often contain veiled criticisms of the United States, which Beijing accuses of unilateralism and disrupting the global order.</p>

          <p>The recent dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer by President Trump has raised alarms among economists about the potential politicization of crucial economic data. The firing occurred after the agency released a jobs report with lower-than-expected figures and significant downward revisions, which the president publicly labeled as "rigged." Critics are particularly concerned by the nomination of E.J. Antoni, a vocal critic of the bureau, as McEntarfer's replacement. This unprecedented move threatens to undermine public trust in the nonpartisan agency responsible for key indicators like the unemployment rate and inflation.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a former lieutenant governor of Louisiana argues that the Trump administration is dismantling the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), risking a repeat of the catastrophic failures seen during Hurricane Katrina. The author points to significant staff cuts, the reassignment of personnel during hurricane season, and the cancellation of a major infrastructure resilience program as evidence of the agency being gutted. The article contends that stating "states can do it" is a form of federal abandonment, as state and local governments cannot handle major disasters without a strong federal partner. This weakening of disaster preparedness capabilities comes as the country enters the peak of hurricane season.</p>

          <p>British luxury fashion house Burberry is slated to re-enter the U.K.'s benchmark FTSE 100 index later this month, a year after it was relegated. The promotion, confirmed by index provider FTSE Russell, reflects a period of renewed momentum for the brand under a comprehensive overhaul strategy led by CEO Joshua Schulman. Burberry's return to the prestigious index marks a significant turnaround after a 15-year run in the large-cap benchmark ended in September 2024. The move is part of a regular quarterly reshuffling of the London Stock Exchange's main indices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Texas state Senate has passed a novel bill that empowers private citizens to sue anyone who manufactures, prescribes, or distributes abortion pills mailed into the state. The legislation, which is expected to be signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott, allows for damages of up to $100,000 for successful plaintiffs. This measure is the first of its kind in the U.S. and represents a new legal strategy by abortion opponents to combat the use of medication abortion, which accounts for the majority of abortions nationwide. The bill is certain to trigger significant legal challenges over its constitutionality and one state's ability to enforce its laws on providers in other states.</p>

          <p>Patient safety campaigners and MPs are demanding an immediate suspension of rectopexy bowel mesh surgery following the removal of its pioneering surgeon, Tony Dixon, from the medical register. Dixon was struck off for serious misconduct, including performing unnecessary operations and fabricating patient records, which has cast doubt on the credibility of the research underpinning the procedure. Campaigners report that patients have suffered horrific, life-changing complications from the mesh implants. The controversy echoes previous pelvic mesh scandals, and the UK's healthcare regulator has now launched a review of the procedure.</p>

          <p>China has announced new anti-dumping tariffs on several American fiber-optic companies, a move that took effect immediately. The duties, ranging from 33.3% to 78.2%, were imposed after China's Ministry of Commerce concluded that U.S. exporters were altering trade patterns to circumvent existing tariffs. This action was announced just hours after the U.S. Treasury sanctioned a Chinese chemical firm over its alleged involvement in the fentanyl trade. The tit-for-tat measures signal that despite a temporary trade truce, economic tensions between Washington and Beijing remain high and could escalate at any time.</p>

          <p>Tiah-Mai Ayton, a 19-year-old boxer from Bristol, has set an ambitious goal to become the youngest-ever undisputed champion in the four-belt era of boxing. With an extensive combat sports background and only three losses in over 300 fights, Ayton is a highly touted prospect who recently turned professional after a decorated amateur career. She has signed with a major promoter and aims to become undisputed champion in four different weight classes, a feat no boxer has yet achieved. Ayton's journey began at age six when her father enrolled her and her sister in kickboxing to stop them from fighting with each other.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner may be liable for a penalty in addition to an estimated £40,000 in underpaid stamp duty on a property she purchased, according to tax specialists. The issue centers on whether her purchase of a flat in Hove constituted a second home, which is determined by a complex tax rule involving a trust set up for her son. Rayner has blamed incorrect legal advice, but experts note that simply relying on an adviser may not be a sufficient defense against a "carelessness" penalty from tax authorities. The controversy has led to an inquiry by the standards watchdog and raised political questions about her judgment.</p>

          <p>In an interview, President Trump stated he remains dedicated to achieving a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, though he acknowledged that the two sides are "not ready yet." He expressed confidence that a deal will eventually be reached, saying "we are going to get it done," despite the ongoing conflict and recent deadly attacks by Russia. Mr. Trump noted that this negotiation has proven more difficult than other international conflicts where he claims to have facilitated peace. His comments come as European allies meet to discuss security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, with American involvement seen as a critical but uncertain component.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France is facing growing concerns over its fiscal health and political stability, leading some economists to label it "the new Italy," a country once known for its economic volatility. Persistent political infighting, struggles to pass a 2026 budget with significant cuts, and a high budget deficit have put France in a precarious position. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou faces a critical confidence vote that could collapse his minority government, which would be the fifth prime ministerial change in under two years. In contrast, Italy under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has entered a period of relative stability, reversing the traditional roles of the two major European economies.</p>

The expansion follows a successful pilot at 143 sites where nearly 5,000 calls to the helpline resulted in 241 potentially life-saving interventions. The initiative was created after a campaign by the parents of 13-year-old Martha Mills, who died from sepsis after her family's concerns about her deteriorating condition were not heeded. The program empowers families and staff to escalate concerns and is being hailed as a crucial step toward a more collaborative doctor-patient relationship.</p>

          <p>European nations are facing a difficult dilemma as they meet in Paris to formulate security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, with the level of U.S. commitment remaining a major unresolved issue. The "coalition of the willing," led by France and the U.K., insists that any European reassurance force would require American backing, but President Trump's recent actions and statements have created ambiguity. Experts suggest Europe is in a bind, unable to conduct detailed operational planning without knowing the extent of U.S. support or the nature of a potential ceasefire. This uncertainty leaves European leaders with tough choices and highlights the fragility of any future security arrangement for Kyiv.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan is making incoherent ideological attacks against Beijing, citing recent criticism of a large military parade. A Taiwanese official accused Beijing of squandering money on the event while neglecting domestic issues, and claimed the parade was a threat. The author of the article questions this logic, arguing that from a strategic perspective, Taiwan should prefer Beijing to spend money on a parade rather than on actual military drills or weapons. The piece frames the DPP's criticism as a sign of political weakness following recent domestic political setbacks.</p>
