          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has added three U.S. firms to its "Unreliable Entity List," effectively banning them from trade and investment in the country due to their arms sales to Taiwan. The companies affected include Saronic Technologies, Aerkomm, and Oceaneering International. Additionally, three other American companies—Huntingon Ingalls Industries, Planate Management, and Global Dimensions—were placed on an export control list, restricting their access to Chinese dual-use items. This move escalates trade tensions between Beijing and Washington over the sensitive issue of Taiwan's sovereignty.</p>

The company has agreed to disclose 24 hours in advance if it plans to use a tiered pricing system for events. Furthermore, Ticketmaster will offer more detailed price information to customers waiting in online queues. These changes aim to increase transparency and prevent consumers from being surprised by fluctuating ticket costs.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has revealed that some Labour MPs have privately encouraged him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the party's leadership. In an interview, Burnham did not rule out a future leadership bid, though he is not currently a Member of Parliament and would need to win a by-election to do so. His comments come ahead of the Labour Party conference amid some internal dissatisfaction with the government's performance and the rise of Reform UK in polls. Burnham also outlined several policy ideas, including tax changes and increased public borrowing for housing.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing protests against mass tourism, the Spanish island of Mallorca is projected to hit a new visitor record this year, potentially exceeding 19 million tourists. However, this surge in visitors has not translated into universal economic prosperity, with many local businesses reporting a significant drop in sales. Some industry leaders blame the anti-tourism demonstrations for deterring visitors, particularly from Germany, while others point to rising prices and economic challenges in tourists' home countries. The regional government has so far hesitated to implement measures to limit tourism, highlighting the island's economic dependence on the industry.</p>

This act is a direct reference to Trump's unsubstantiated claims that Biden was not in control of his administration's decisions during his term.

          <p>The UK government is exploring options to provide financial aid to suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) following a major cyber-attack that has halted the carmaker's production. The attack forced JLR to shut down its IT networks, with factory operations suspended until at least October, costing the company an estimated £50 million per week. There are growing fears that smaller suppliers, who depend heavily on JLR, could face bankruptcy without assistance. One proposed solution involves the government purchasing component parts to maintain cash flow for these firms until JLR can resume production.</p>

          <p>The BBC, along with news agencies AFP, AP, and Reuters, has launched a campaign calling for Israel to permit foreign journalists independent entry into the Gaza Strip. In a short film, the organizations argue that international reporters must be allowed to share the burden of reporting on the conflict with local Palestinian journalists. Foreign media have been banned from entering Gaza without a military escort since the war began in 2023, a restriction Israel's High Court has justified on security grounds. The campaign highlights the risks faced by local journalists and the importance of independent reporting from the conflict zone.</p>

          <p>A verdict is expected in the campaign financing trial of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is accused of illegally accepting funds from the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Prosecutors allege that Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign received millions in cash, a charge he and 11 co-defendants, including former top aides, deny. The case has been marked by twists, including the key accuser, Ziad Takieddine, recanting and then reaffirming his testimony before his recent death. This trial is the latest in a series of legal challenges for Sarkozy, who has previously been convicted in two other corruption cases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Australian horror film "Together" has faced criticism in China after it was discovered that a same-sex couple in the movie had been digitally altered to appear as a heterosexual couple. Viewers who attended advance screenings noticed the change, along with the removal of other references to the gay relationship and the obscuring of nudity. The film's global distributor, Neon, condemned the unauthorized edit and demanded its Chinese distributor cease distribution. The incident has sparked backlash online, with many criticizing the alteration as a distortion of the original work and a sign of China's increasing censorship of LGBTQ+ content.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are on the verge of clinching the National League West title after a 5-4 extra-innings victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The win was secured through unconventional means, with starting pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw delivering crucial scoreless innings from the bullpen. After the team's traditional relievers gave up a three-run lead in the eighth inning, Kershaw pitched a perfect ninth to send the game to extras. Tommy Edman's RBI single in the 11th inning provided the winning run, showcasing the team's resilience and adaptability as they head toward the postseason.</p>

The banking leaders warned that targeting the financial sector could stifle investment, competition, and growth, potentially undermining London's status as a global financial hub. They stressed the need for a consistent approach to regulation and taxation to ensure the UK remains competitive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar, has intensified discussions among Arab and Islamic nations about forming a collective security pact, sometimes dubbed an "Islamic NATO." The attack, which targeted Hamas members, has shaken assumptions in Gulf states about the reliability of U.S. security guarantees. In response, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) activated a mutual defense clause, and Saudi Arabia entered a defense agreement with Pakistan. While a formal NATO-style alliance is considered unrealistic, analysts suggest a "6+2" format involving the six GCC states plus Turkey and Egypt may emerge to enhance regional security.</p>

The strikes, which the Trump administration justifies as necessary to stop fentanyl trafficking, have reportedly killed 17 people. Petro called for criminal proceedings against U.S. officials if investigations confirm Colombian nationals were among the deceased, escalating diplomatic tensions.</p>

A memo sent to agency heads outlined a plan to issue "reduction in force" (RIF) notices to employees in programs not aligned with the president's priorities, a significant departure from the temporary furloughs of past shutdowns. This aggressive budget-cutting strategy comes amid a funding dispute with Senate Democrats, who have called the move an "attempt at intimidation."

The potential indictment follows the recent resignation of the interim U.S. Attorney for the district, who reportedly opposed bringing charges, and his replacement by a lawyer who has previously represented President Trump.
