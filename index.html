          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, a major producer of high-fructose corn syrup, fell sharply following a social media post by Donald Trump. Trump claimed he had secured an agreement with Coca-Cola for the company to use real cane sugar in its U.S. products. While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, the announcement caused a significant drop in ADM's stock and related companies, prompting a warning from the Corn Refiners Association about potential job losses and negative impacts on American farmers.

          <p>For 70 years, Disney has successfully leveraged its vast portfolio of intellectual property as the foundation for its theme parks, a strategy that continues to drive significant profits. The company's experiences division, which includes parks and resorts, generates more operating income than its content-centric entertainment division where the IP originates. Following major acquisitions like Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, Disney plans to invest $60 billion over the next decade to further fuel park expansions with beloved characters and stories, reinforcing this synergistic business model.

          <p>The U.S. Senate approved a $9 billion spending rescissions package requested by the Trump administration, passing it in a narrow 51-48 vote. The legislation primarily targets foreign aid programs, including USAID, and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. Two Republican senators, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, joined Democrats in opposition, citing concerns over the lack of detail and the relinquishing of congressional budget oversight. The bill, slightly modified from the House version, now returns to the House for final approval before a deadline.</p>

          <p>Consumer advocates are expressing concern that changes under the Trump administration could leave student loan borrowers with unmanageable monthly payments. Following the repeal of the Biden-era SAVE plan, which offered more generous terms, borrowers are being transitioned to other income-driven plans that may result in significantly higher bills. Experts warn that for many, these changes will eliminate affordable repayment options, thereby increasing the risk of widespread loan defaults and creating significant financial stress for millions of Americans.</p>

These estimates are based on the bill's changes to healthcare access and the termination of enhanced subsidies for insurance.

          <p>This article posits that Superman, once a quintessential superhero, has become one of the least relevant figures in modern popular culture. It traces this decline back to a moment in the 1978 film where the hero struggles to find a phone booth, a visual joke that foreshadowed his difficulty in adapting to a changing world. Unlike other heroes who have been successfully reimagined, Superman's core characteristics have made it challenging for him to remain compelling in an era with more complex and morally ambiguous characters.

          <p>New U.S. trade deals with Vietnam and Indonesia are causing concern across Southeast Asia due to tariffs specifically targeting "transshipped" goods originating from China. The policy is designed to prevent Chinese companies from evading high U.S. tariffs by re-routing products through neighboring countries. The economic impact on nations like Vietnam will depend heavily on how broadly the U.S. defines transshipment, as many locally manufactured goods rely on Chinese components.

          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars is altering its U.S. product strategy in response to trade tariffs, announcing plans to produce its best-selling XC60 SUV at its South Carolina plant starting in late 2026. The company, owned by China's Geely, has been heavily impacted by U.S. tariffs on vehicles from both Europe and China. By localizing production of a high-volume model, Volvo aims to mitigate tariff costs and better utilize its American manufacturing facility, even as it pulls some less popular sedan models from the U.S. market.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision has failed to achieve the anti-abortion movement's goals, as abortion numbers have actually risen since the ruling. It points to data showing an increase in clinician-provided abortions, a surge in demand for abortion pills, and a rise in voluntary sterilizations among young adults. The piece contends that state-level bans have led to an alarming increase in preventable maternal deaths and the criminal prosecution of pregnant people for miscarriages, suggesting the consequences have been more punishment and death rather than fewer abortions.</p>

          <p>A report from a state-run Chinese newspaper has raised concerns about a potential oversupply of artificial intelligence computing centers across the country. The article warns that a boom in construction, fueled by the global AI race, has led to "blind investment," resulting in many newly built centers sitting idle. This waste of resources and market imbalance could negatively impact the high-quality development of China's domestic computing industry. The warning comes as the market anticipates the return of some of Nvidia's advanced chips to the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an in-depth interview, Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown dissects the complexities of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, distinguishing between credible facts and rampant conspiracy theories. She addresses the recent DOJ announcement that there is no "Epstein client list," explaining the term likely originated from a comprehensive personal phone directory, not a list of individuals involved in crimes. Brown emphasizes that while many theories are unfounded, the core of the case is a real and devastating conspiracy of powerful individuals who enabled Epstein's decades-long abuse of hundreds of young girls and women, a failure of the justice system.</p>

          <p>An interview with beauty critic Jessica DeFino explores the growing trend of children and tweens using sophisticated skincare products, a market that is expanding rapidly. DeFino argues that this phenomenon is driven by the collapse of age-appropriate media and the beauty industry's constant need to find new customers. She warns of both physical risks, such as skin damage from harsh ingredients, and psychological harms, as young people internalize exacting beauty standards at a vulnerable age. The piece suggests that addressing this trend requires adults to examine their own participation in a beauty culture built on insecurity.</p>
