          <p>President Trump publicly dressed down South African President Cyril Ramaphosa based on a fringe conspiracy theory about white South Africans being targeted. Trump claimed that white people were "being executed" and questioned Ramaphosa's efforts to protect them, despite police statistics showing no evidence of such targeting. The confrontation highlights Trump's views on race and his tendency to elevate claims of white grievance. This article analyzes the implications of Trump's remarks and his broader stance on race.</p>
