          <p>Venezuela's foreign ministry has accused the United States of a "direct provocation" after a U.S. warship, the USS Jason Dunham, allegedly seized a Venezuelan tuna fishing boat for eight hours. The incident, involving 18 armed agents boarding the vessel with nine fishermen, occurred in what Venezuela claims as its exclusive economic zone. Caracas condemned the action as an illegal use of excessive military force, suggesting it is an attempt to justify escalating conflict in the region. The U.S. has recently increased military patrols in the Caribbean to target drug cartels, heightening tensions with President Maduro's government.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, House Speaker Mike Johnson stated the event could be a "turning point" for the nation, urging leaders to de-escalate political rhetoric. In a television appearance, Johnson condemned the use of inflammatory language like "Nazis and fascists," arguing it can spur deranged individuals to action. He described the mood on Capitol Hill as a mix of anger, sadness, and fear, while emphasizing that Kirk would have wanted his supporters to move forward with love, not despair. Johnson also mentioned congressional efforts to honor Kirk's memory and evaluate security for lawmakers.</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a España cycling race was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in central Madrid. Demonstrators knocked down barriers and occupied the road at several key points, making it impossible for the race to proceed safely despite the deployment of over 1,000 police officers. As a result of the cancellation, Danish cyclist Jonas Vingegaard, who was leading the general classification, was declared the overall winner of the prestigious tour. The protest action brought an unexpected and abrupt end to the three-week-long international cycling event.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of its founder Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA (TPUSA) has experienced a significant surge in interest, receiving over 32,000 inquiries to start new campus chapters within 48 hours. A spokesperson for the conservative youth organization noted this represents a massive increase, as TPUSA currently has around 900 official college chapters. The group believes this outpouring of support will rapidly accelerate Kirk's vision of expanding the organization's presence in high schools and colleges across America. Kirk's widow, Erika, has vowed that the movement her husband built will not die but will instead become stronger.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of seven leading women's organizations has warned the UK government against diluting its flagship Employment Rights Bill, arguing that doing so would threaten a "once-in-a-generation" opportunity to close the gender pay gap. In a letter to the new business secretary, the groups expressed concern over amendments from the House of Lords that could weaken protections, such as those for zero-hours contract workers. The organizations emphasized that women, who are disproportionately represented in low-paid and insecure work, stand to benefit most from the bill's proposed reforms, which include enhanced rights to flexible working and statutory sick pay.</p>

          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has officially ended talks with Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the potential sale of its general merchandise retailer, Argos.

Despite the deal's collapse, the company reaffirmed its expectation to deliver a retail underlying operating profit of approximately £1 billion for the 2025-2026 financial year, signaling confidence in its ongoing business strategy.</p>

This pattern of securing points in the dying moments of matches has become a new phenomenon for the club, creating a psychological advantage over opponents.

          <p>In municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) are projected to win, but the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has made significant gains. Early estimates show the AfD securing around 16.5% of the vote, more than tripling its support from the 2020 election. In contrast, the Green Party suffered heavy losses, seeing its vote share drop from 20% to about 11.7%. The results are seen as a key test for the national government and indicate a continuing shift toward the right in German politics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is creating concern for traditional banks and credit card companies. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, are diverting transactions that would have otherwise gone through credit cards, a major revenue driver for banks. Financial institutions are also wary because BNPL usage is often not reported to credit bureaus, creating a "giant black hole" in their understanding of a consumer's overall debt and credit risk. An estimated 86.5 million Americans used BNPL loans in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

The attack, which targeted Hamas leadership, has angered key U.S. allies in the Arab world, particularly Qatar. Rubio has conveyed President Trump's displeasure with the strike but emphasized that it will not fundamentally change the strong U.S.-Israel relationship. The visit also occurs as Israel faces mounting international criticism over its military operations in Gaza and the expansion of settlements in the West Bank.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham commented on the recent wave of political violence in the U.S., including the assassination of Charlie Kirk, stating that the nation is in a "dangerous place." He argued that such violence historically erupts when there are existential debates about national identity and who is included in "We the people." Meacham urged political leaders to make a case for a more perfect union and for citizens to engage in debate peaceably, warning that losing this capacity breaks faith with the American covenant of living in contention without being at each other's throats.</p>

The club, founded by a resident who lost her apartment in the fire, rotates weekly among different eateries, providing them with a vital economic boost. Beyond financial support, the initiative has fostered a strong sense of community among neighbors, many of whom were strangers before the shared tragedy. The club offers a space for residents to connect, share experiences, and collectively heal while helping to preserve their local economy.</p>

          <p>An Iowa county official has publicly refused to comply with the governor's directive to fly flags at half-staff in honor of assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Jon Green, the Democratic chair of the Johnson County Board of Supervisors, condemned the killing but stated he would not grant county honors to a man he said worked to denigrate marginalized people and degrade political discourse. Governor Kim Reynolds, a Republican, called the decision "disgraceful." The act of defiance highlights the deep political divisions surrounding Kirk's legacy and the broader national conversation about political violence and rhetoric.</p>
