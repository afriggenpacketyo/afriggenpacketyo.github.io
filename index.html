          <p>ScotRail has permanently removed peak rail fares, allowing passengers to save money during weekday rush hours. This initiative aims to encourage commuters to switch from cars to trains, reducing carbon emissions. A ticket from Edinburgh to Glasgow will now be almost 50% cheaper, and routes without peak time prices will remain unchanged. The initial pilot scheme in 2023 had limited success, but First Minister John Swinney reinstated the policy after improvements in Scotland's finances. This decision is expected to benefit commuters, climate activists, and the business community, providing more affordable and flexible travel options for passengers in Scotland. Optimism score will be based on the author's reflection assuming the relative aforementioned seriousness.</p>

          <p>A new book reveals that Queen Camilla was the victim of an attempted sexual assault as a teenager, fighting off her attacker on a train to Paddington Station. The incident, recounted in Power and the Palace, was shared with Boris Johnson in 2008 when he was mayor of London. The Queen's experience has not been publicly shared before, as she preferred to focus on supporting other victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. She is a patron of SafeLives and has spoken extensively about the courage of survivors and the importance of removing shame and blame.

          <p>Scientists have discovered brine shrimp, also known as Artemia, in the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang, China. These salt-tolerant shrimp were found in a wildlife water source in Aral, suggesting the city has natural conditions for cultivating such organisms. Researchers from Tarim University are conducting laboratory studies to determine if the shrimp is a new species. Further research could lead to the development of commercial aquaculture in the region, utilizing the shrimp as aquaculture feed, as well as for medicinal and cosmetic purposes.

Freeman, known for espousing conspiracy theories, fled into bushland after police arrived at his property to execute a search warrant related to a sex crimes investigation. Police have appealed for information and warned that harboring or assisting Freeman is a serious crime. Heavily armed police, helicopters, and armored vehicles have been searching for Freeman for nearly a week, raising questions about how authorities handle the threat of conspiracy theorists.

          <p>A US judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan children, responding to reports of children being put on planes to Guatemala. District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued the order after immigrant advocacy groups sought an emergency injunction. The children, who arrived in the US alone, are in government custody while their immigration claims are assessed. The judge's order will be in place for 14 days.
