          <h2>Nvidia Receives US Approval for Advanced AI Chip Sales to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:14:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Technology giant Nvidia has received approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips, used for artificial intelligence, to China. This decision reverses a previous policy that restricted such sales over national security concerns. CEO Jensen Huang announced the development, stating that the U.S. government has assured licenses will be granted, a move seen as beneficial for Nvidia's revenue and the global semiconductor supply chain. However, analysts caution that Chinese firms will likely continue pursuing domestic chip development due to the potential for future U.S. policy shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intense rainfall and severe storms have caused significant flash flooding across parts of the northeastern United States, particularly affecting New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The downpours led to submerged roadways, stranded vehicles, and disruptions to public transit, including New York City's subway system. New Jersey's governor declared a state of emergency, and officials in several regions conducted water rescues, though no major injuries were reported. The event highlights the increasing vulnerability of urban infrastructure to extreme weather events.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Launches Model Y in India with High Price Point</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:11:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV at a starting price of approximately $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries. The steep price is attributed to India's high tariffs on imported electric vehicles and luxury taxes, positioning the car in the premium segment against brands like BMW. Analysts suggest this initial launch is a strategy to "test the waters" rather than achieve mass-market sales. The company's future pricing and manufacturing decisions in India may depend on potential changes to EV policies and trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report commissioned by the Board of Deputies of British Jews has found systemic failures to address anti-Jewish discrimination across major UK institutions, including the NHS, education, and policing. Co-authored by Lord John Mann, the government's antisemitism adviser, the review highlights a significant increase in antisemitic incidents since the October 7 Hamas attack. The report offers ten key recommendations, focusing on improved education and training to ensure Jewish people receive the same protections as other vulnerable groups. It stresses the need to recognize Judaism as both an ethnicity and a religion for proper understanding and action.</p>

The report suggests that some of the sharpest rate hikes, potentially over 40%, could occur in Republican-led states like Kentucky and Missouri that lack their own renewable energy mandates.

Febos explains that the experience allowed her to discover a deeper sense of self and find sensuality in other aspects of life, such as nature and art.

          <p>The BRICS bloc of emerging economies is striving to evolve from a diplomatic forum into a significant geopolitical force capable of challenging Western-led global dominance. At its recent summit, the expanded group condemned coercive economic tactics and unilateralism, signaling a push for a multipolar world order. However, the article argues that internal contradictions and diverging interests among its members, such as India's strategic balancing and South Africa's domestic issues, continue to undermine its coherence. The central question remains whether BRICS can become a true alternative to the G7 or if it will remain a fractured entity.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has issued a directive aimed at strengthening the country's legal framework to better counter foreign sanctions and interference. The policy paper calls for improving the application of international law and establishing a sophisticated system for engaging with foreign legal challenges. This move is part of Beijing's broader strategy to protect its national interests and respond more effectively to trade and technology sanctions, such as those imposed by the United States. The goal is to create a robust judicial toolkit for defending Chinese companies and challenging what it views as unfair foreign measures.</p>

          <p>Social media platform Reddit is introducing age verification for its UK users to comply with the country's new Online Safety Act, which requires robust age checks for sites showing adult material. Starting this week, users attempting to access certain mature content will need to verify their age through a third-party firm using a selfie or government ID. Reddit stated it will not access the photo and will only retain the user's verification status. The move comes as regulator Ofcom expects other platforms to adopt similar measures or face significant fines and potential business disruption measures.</p>

          <p>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as "forever chemicals" because they do not break down in the environment, pose a significant global health problem.

A recent court case in Italy highlighted the scale of contamination, with thousands affected by pollution from a local chemical plant.

          <p>China's voluntary health insurance program for urban and rural residents saw another significant decline in enrollment, with 15.8 million fewer people participating in 2024 compared to the previous year.

The declining participation puts additional pressure on the national healthcare system, which is already facing economic challenges and issues of public trust.

Medvedev's comments on social media reflect a defiant stance from Moscow in the face of renewed U.S. pressure.

The 25% tariff has created an "instant shock" for the European auto industry, forcing them to stockpile vehicles while hoping for a trade agreement between the EU and the US.
