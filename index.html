          <p>Tesla's new car registrations in Europe plummeted by 40% in July, marking its seventh consecutive month of decline, even as the overall European battery electric vehicle market expanded. This downturn is largely attributed to intense competition, reputational challenges linked to Elon Musk's public statements, and the absence of a major refresh to Tesla's vehicle lineup. In stark contrast, Chinese rival BYD recorded a significant 225% increase in registrations, aggressively capturing market share with new models and competitive pricing across Europe. The article highlights that this shift is impacting other legacy automakers as well, signaling a substantial transformation in the continent's automotive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, this article examines the profound and lasting psychological impact on children who lived through the disaster, many of whom are now adults. Survivors recount harrowing experiences of fleeing floodwaters and the subsequent displacement, which disrupted communities and led to long-term mental health issues. Experts highlight how children process trauma differently, and the documentary "Katrina Babies" sheds light on these untold stories, aiding in collective healing and discussions about hurricane preparedness. The report also touches on the ongoing vulnerability of Louisiana's eroding coastline to climate change, urging accountability from those in power.</p>

          <p>Japan's defense minister hailed "unprecedented" security cooperation with Britain as the Royal Navy's Prince of Wales aircraft carrier made its first-ever port call to Tokyo, leading a 12-nation strike group. This landmark visit underscores Japan's strategic efforts to broaden its security alliances beyond the United States and highlights Britain's commitment to expanding its role in the economically vital Indo-Pacific region. Central to this partnership is the Global Combat Air Programme, a collaborative initiative with Italy to develop a next-generation fighter jet, with the initial international contract anticipated by year-end. Both nations emphasize the interconnectedness of Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis, which tragically killed two children aged eight and ten and injured 17 others during a morning Mass, is now being investigated by the FBI as an act of domestic terrorism and an anti-Catholic hate crime. The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Authorities have not yet released a definitive motive, but the police chief condemned the "sheer cruelty and cowardice" of firing into a church filled with children. Pope Leo XIV and President Trump expressed condolences, with the latter ordering flags flown at half-mast.</p>

          <p>The Welsh government has proposed changes to its controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodation, which currently require properties to be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower non-domestic rates. The new proposal suggests averaging the 182-day letting target over several years and allowing up to 14 charity days to count. While the government claims to have listened to feedback, groups like Cymdeithas yr Iaith criticized the focus on tax rules over the housing crisis, and the Professional Association of Self-Caterers called the changes a "token gesture" insufficient to address the sector's challenges.</p>

While acknowledging the honor of a royal invitation, he felt compelled to speak out. The decision drew sharp criticism from Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel, who deemed it an act of "deep disrespect" to the King and "pathetic gesture politics."</p>

This article explores how increased access to celebrities' private lives through social media fosters an illusion of intimacy, making fans feel deeply invested. While such relationships can offer a sense of connection and community, particularly during times like the pandemic, experts caution that they cannot replace reciprocal, real-life interactions. Sociologists note that humans are wired to form social bonds, even with public figures, but these digital connections lack the "nutritional content" of genuine friendships.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom warned that Donald Trump is gravely serious about seeking a third presidential term, disregarding constitutional limits and democratic norms. Newsom, a potential presidential contender, cited Trump's comments during a private Oval Office meeting and his controversial plans for a lavish White House ballroom as evidence of his intent to cling to power. The governor urged Americans to "wake up" and take Trump's threats seriously, emphasizing that the rule of law is at stake. He called for Democrats to adopt a more combative stance, advocating for a "fight fire with fire" approach to politics.</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry spokesman, Guo Jiakun, issued a stern warning against external interference in the relationship between China and South Korea, asserting that their bilateral ties are rooted in mutual interests and are not directed at any third party. This statement comes in the wake of South Korean President Lee Jae-myung's recent assessment that Seoul must rebalance its relationship with Beijing, a necessity driven by escalating US-China competition. Lee had previously articulated that, given evolving global supply chains, South Korea can no longer sustain a strategy of relying on the US for security while simultaneously cooperating with China on economic matters, and cannot act contrary to America's fundamental policy.</p>

          <p>Wuliangye Yibin, China's second-largest liquor distiller, reported its slowest revenue and net profit growth in a decade, impacted by an intensified anti-corruption campaign and a slowing economy. First-half revenue rose 4.2% to 52.8 billion yuan, while net profit increased 2.3% to 19.5 billion yuan, marking the weakest growth since 2015. This trend mirrors that of its peers, including Kweichow Moutai and Jiugui Liquor, which also saw significant slowdowns or plunges in earnings. The article notes that policy factors have led to a sharp reduction in baijiu consumption, affecting sales of mainstream products in China. (not investment advice)</p>

Police raided the property, finding relevant German documents but not the artwork itself.

          <p>Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has received a substantial fine of almost £31,500 ($42,500) for his unsportsmanlike behavior during an extraordinary first-round exit from the Grand Slam tournament. Medvedev's on-court meltdown, which reportedly included obliterating his racket against a chair, was sparked by a photographer walking onto the court during his defeat by France's Benjamin Bonzi. The United States Tennis Association imposed the penalty, docking him $30,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and an additional $12,500 for racket abuse. This significant fine means the Russian player will forfeit approximately 40% of his first-round prize money, an outcome he had anticipated.</p>

This marks the third senior aide departure from his office in less than a year, following a chief of staff and director of communications.

The Principal Private Secretary is a highly prized civil service position, responsible for controlling information flow, shaping the Prime Minister's diary, and acting as a key gatekeeper.

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's film "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, stars Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player whose life unravels after a car accident and a fateful cat-sitting gig plunge him into a violent crime caper in 1998 Lower East Side Manhattan. The movie portrays a gritty, pre-millennial New York, filled with diverse criminal elements and a hard-nosed NYPD detective. The review praises Aronofsky's affectionate yet grimy depiction of the city and Butler's portrayal of a self-loathing alcoholic grappling with squandered potential. The film is described as a "bruising bacchanal" that delves into themes of identity and the burden of talent.</p>
