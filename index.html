        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for the fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant 25% jump in late trading. Company leadership attributes this success to recent marketing campaigns featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and athlete Travis Kelce, which have reportedly boosted customer engagement and sales. The company's performance in the second quarter surpassed expectations, and it anticipates strong sales to continue into the fall season. One advertisement featuring Sweeney, which sparked public debate, was even noted by President Donald Trump, who voiced his support for the actress on social media.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court following a federal appeals court ruling that deemed most of his global "reciprocal tariffs" illegal. The lower court had determined that President Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the levies, stating that tariffs are a core power of Congress. The administration argues the ruling creates legal uncertainty that undermines the president's ability to conduct diplomacy and protect national security. The Supreme Court is now expected to take up the case, with a potential decision in the summer of 2026.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has voided the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants to Harvard University, calling the action an "ideologically-motivated assault." The ruling found the administration illegally retaliated against the university for refusing to implement reforms that would violate First Amendment rights. The freeze, ostensibly related to concerns about antisemitism, was deemed pretextual by the judge, who noted it halted critical research on topics like tuberculosis and Lou Gehrig's disease. The White House has stated its intention to appeal the decision, maintaining that Harvard failed to protect its students.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has condemned reports that the White House is considering offering administration jobs to his opponents, Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa. The alleged strategy, reported by The New York Times, would aim to clear the field for a direct contest between Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent. Mamdani described the potential interference as an "affront to our democracy," asserting that New Yorkers should choose their own leaders without influence from the president.

          <p>The United Kingdom's defence secretary, John Healey, has affirmed that allied nations are prepared to support Ukraine both before any potential peace deal and in securing its aftermath. Speaking in Kyiv, he stated that allies would help ensure the safety of Ukraine's skies, seas, and land once peace is achieved. This commitment comes as a group of allied nations, the "Coalition of the Willing," plans to meet in Paris to discuss security guarantees, which could include deploying European troops to deter future aggression. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained a defiant stance, outlining maximalist demands for ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans continue to hold a negative view of the U.S. economy, with ratings dipping slightly over the past month. The most commonly chosen words to describe the economy were "uncertain" and "struggling," with only a third of respondents selecting positive terms like "rebounding" or "expanding." Persistently high prices are a primary driver of this sentiment, as two-thirds of Americans report that prices are still rising and expect them to continue to do so. Overall, a majority believe the economy is worsening, reflecting ongoing pessimism among the public.</p>

His comments came as a bipartisan effort in the House, led by Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, gathers support for a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing all related government files. One survivor of Epstein's abuse called the president's "hoax" remark deeply painful and invited him to meet with victims.

          <p>China's recent military parade, showcasing advanced weaponry, served as a powerful message to the world about its growing global influence. This event, coupled with warming relations between China, Russia, and India, illustrates the geopolitical realignments being accelerated by President Trump's "America First" tariff policies. While the administration views tariffs as a tool to protect U.S. industry, this analysis suggests the strategy is creating new international partnerships that challenge the U.S.-led order. Furthermore, the entire trade agenda faces domestic legal threats, with a recent appellate court ruling against the tariffs now heading to the Supreme Court.</p>

This shift is exemplified by a recent lethal airstrike in the Caribbean that targeted a boat carrying alleged "narco-terrorists," an action authorized under a new directive against drug smugglers. The administration has designated a Venezuelan gang as a foreign terrorist organization to provide a legal basis for such military actions.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang affiliation. The court found that the current situation does not meet the law's criteria of an "invasion or predatory incursion," which is required to invoke its wartime powers. The administration had argued that mass illegal migration encouraged by another country constituted an incursion, but the court rejected this interpretation. This ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy of using the obscure law for rapid deportations without standard immigration proceedings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC), a federation of UK trade unions, is calling on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to explore a range of wealth taxes in the upcoming budget. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak argued for a more progressive tax system to boost investment in public services, suggesting taxes on windfall profits from banks, online gaming, and gambling companies. He also proposed equalizing capital gains tax with income tax and implementing a direct wealth tax, similar to models used in other European countries. The Treasury responded by stating the government believes it has already achieved the right balance in taxing the wealthy.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates has delivered a stern warning to Israel, stating that any move to annex the occupied West Bank would be a "red line" and would undermine the 2020 Abraham Accords that normalized relations. A senior Emirati official emphasized that such an action would be the "death knell" for the two-state solution. The warning came shortly after Israel's far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, unveiled a proposal for annexing approximately 82% of the West Bank. The UAE was a key signatory of the Abraham Accords, which were contingent on Israel suspending its previous annexation plans.</p>

          <p>Despite Salesforce's stock falling after it issued soft third-quarter revenue guidance, this analysis suggests reasons for optimism. The article notes that second-quarter results were strong across most metrics, including sales in its main product clouds and better-than-expected operating margins. It highlights the rapid adoption of the new AI-powered Agentforce platform, which has already closed over 6,000 paid deals and is contributing to a fast-growing revenue stream. While acknowledging the market's skepticism about its growth trajectory, the analysis concludes that the company's potential for AI-driven reacceleration and ongoing cost discipline warrant holding the stock.

          <p>An agreement has been negotiated to resolve a lawsuit from the Department of Justice that would have prevented approximately 98,000 North Carolina voters from casting ballots. The DOJ, under the Trump administration, had sued the state to remove voters who registered without providing a driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. After intervention from the Democratic National Committee, a settlement was reached that allows these voters to provide the missing information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, thus curing the issue without disenfranchising them.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has selected seven new members for the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a key panel of vaccine experts. This move follows his decision in June to fire all 17 existing members of the panel and replace them with his own handpicked advisers. An internal CDC document reviewed by Reuters confirmed the appointments, which include a semi-retired transplant surgeon, an emergency medicine specialist, and a pediatric neurologist. The changes to this influential committee reflect a significant overhaul of public health leadership under the current administration.</p>

          <p>An Afghan family, including a father and his two children, is being held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention, caught in a bureaucratic limbo between the U.S. and Canada. The family is eligible for asylum in Canada, where other relatives are legal refugees, but they must file their claim at a land border. However, U.S. officials will only release them if they can enter Canada by air, for which they lack the necessary visa. This situation leaves them facing potential deportation from the U.S. while being unable to access the Canadian asylum process, highlighting the human consequences of shifting immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 268,000 Venezuelan migrants, whose legal protections are now set to lapse within 60 days. This decision affects a group of Venezuelans who have been in the U.S. since a TPS program was created for them in 2021. The Department of Homeland Security argued that maintaining the program acts as a magnet for illegal immigration and undermines border security efforts. Officials are urging those who lose their status to self-deport, making them eligible for potential arrest and removal if they remain in the country without other legal means.</p>

          <p>The public affairs network C-SPAN has reached agreements to be carried on major streaming platforms YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, significantly expanding its audience. The move comes after C-SPAN made a public plea for wider distribution to counter financial deficits caused by the decline of traditional cable and satellite television subscriptions. The nonprofit organization, which provides unfiltered coverage of U.S. government proceedings, had seen its revenue fall sharply as the number of pay-TV homes has shrunk. These new deals will provide a crucial new revenue stream and ensure its programming remains accessible to millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>This article details a pattern of actions by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that have fundamentally altered the CDC, culminating in what the author calls a "victory lap." It recounts how Kennedy promoted unproven remedies during a recent measles outbreak, which lasted for months and became the nation's worst since 1992, contrary to his claims of a swift resolution. Since then, he has fired and replaced the entire CDC vaccine advisory committee with contrarians and activists, and several senior leaders have resigned in protest. The article argues that these moves have effectively sidelined mainstream science at the nation's leading public health agency.</p>
