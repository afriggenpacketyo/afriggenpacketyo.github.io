          <p>The article discusses the Red Bull F1 car's performance issues, particularly its lack of drivability.  While Max Verstappen's skill masks the car's flaws, the team faces challenges if they lose their star driver.  The car's design prioritizes aerodynamic performance over drivability, a departure from Adrian Newey's usual philosophy. The question remains whether Red Bull can address these issues before the 2026 season.</p>
