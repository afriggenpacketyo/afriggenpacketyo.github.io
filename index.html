          <p>The UK government plans to invest Â£1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to bolster its defense capabilities and deter adversaries, with the announcement made as part of the government's strategic defense review. This initiative aims to address deficiencies highlighted by the war in Ukraine and create an "always on" munitions production capacity. The investment is projected to support up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs, with ministers emphasizing that a strong economy and national defense are interconnected. Critics, however, express concerns about the timing and readiness of these factories, questioning whether procurement has been adequately prioritized, while the UK has significantly increased production of artillery shells. Optimism surrounds the potential for economic growth and job creation, but the effectiveness of the investment in strengthening defense capabilities remains to be seen.

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has launched a multi-pronged attack on Harvard University, including threats to redirect research funding and review government contracts, citing concerns about antisemitism and a lack of viewpoint diversity. These actions have sparked concern across American higher education, with some viewing them as an attempt to reshape universities in a more conservative image. While Harvard is fighting back through the courts, the long-term impact could depend on whether other universities accommodate the administration's demands or resist them. The situation highlights a broader cultural and political battle over the role of universities in shaping American society.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices in its upcoming spending review, as it finalizes plans for various sectors, including health, defense, and education. The level of NHS funding will significantly impact potential cuts to unprotected areas, with increased health spending potentially leading to real-terms cuts in other departments. The government's commitment to increasing defense spending further complicates the situation, necessitating even larger cuts elsewhere. Chancellor Rachel Reeves's stance against borrowing more money or raising taxes intensifies speculation about spending cuts, as the IFS suggests that the government has "front-loaded" spending in the early years of the parliament term.</p>

Retailers violating the ban face fines, with the goal of significantly impacting youth vaping rates, though health experts say further regulation is needed. While vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, concerns remain about its long-term risks, as disposable vapes have been cited as an important factor in the rise of youth vaping.</p>

          <p>John Miller, a British man, has been indicted along with Chinese national Cui Guanghai for allegedly attempting to smuggle US military technology to China and organizing the stalking and harassment of a critic of Beijing. The charges include interstate stalking, conspiracy, smuggling, and violations of the Arms Export Control Act, with authorities alleging the pair installed a tracking device on the victim's car and destroyed artistic statues. The US is coordinating with Serbian officials regarding the extradition of the two men, who are currently in Serbia, while the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is providing consular assistance to Miller.</p>

          <p>A Singapore-based quantum researcher has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be hacked due to tiny delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could provide eavesdroppers with opportunities to exploit the system, compromising the security of quantum key distribution, which is designed to be theoretically unhackable. The researcher, Alexander Miller, analyzed data from communication between a ground station and Micius, finding time delays that indicated the distribution of quantum keys was insecure, which could have significant implications for China's expanding quantum communication network.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the US-backed Gaza ceasefire proposal with a counterproposal, seeking amendments to the plan, while reiterating demands for a permanent truce and complete Israeli withdrawal. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff called Hamas' response "totally unacceptable," but Hamas insists on a "permanent ceasefire" and "complete withdrawal" of Israeli forces. The group has offered to release 10 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of 18 dead hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Caught between internal pressure and military limitations, Hamas seeks to balance its demands with the realities on the ground, with Israel appearing unwilling to negotiate further.</p>
