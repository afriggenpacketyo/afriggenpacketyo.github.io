          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is debating President Trump's major domestic policy bill, but its passage is uncertain due to deep divisions within the Republican party. With a very slim majority, Speaker Mike Johnson faces opposition from fiscal conservatives concerned about the bill's projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit over a decade. The legislation includes significant tax cuts, new border security funding, and cuts to health and nutrition programs, but some moderate Republicans also oppose the scale of the healthcare reductions. The White House is actively pressuring lawmakers to pass the bill before the July 4th holiday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key provision within President Trump's latest domestic policy bill aims to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry by increasing tax credits for domestic manufacturing from 25% to 35%. This measure is designed to incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to expand their advanced production facilities within the United States, building upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The goal is to onshore more of the critical chip supply chain from Asia and strengthen national economic security. This reflects a continued strategic push from Washington to support domestic tech players and limit China's influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a split verdict, a New York federal jury acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most severe charges, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. However, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, which each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The courtroom saw an emotional reaction from Combs and his family, who cheered at the verdict. Prosecutors have stated their intent to seek a lengthy sentence, while the defense immediately argued for Combs to be released from custody pending his sentencing hearing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam that imposes a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese goods imported into the United States. In exchange, the U.S. will gain tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets. The agreement also includes a higher 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at preventing nations like China from circumventing trade barriers. The deal could raise costs for U.S. apparel companies and other businesses that rely on Vietnamese manufacturing, altering the dynamics of international trade with the key Southeast Asian nation.

          <p>The Pentagon has paused shipments of certain air defense systems and ammunition to Ukraine, citing concerns over dangerously low U.S. munitions stockpiles. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from security experts, who warn that it undermines Ukraine's defense capabilities at a critical time and could encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin to escalate the conflict. The withheld supplies, including missile interceptors and 155mm shells, were already staged in Poland for delivery. Ukrainian officials have expressed alarm, stating that any delay in support only emboldens the aggressor rather than promoting peace.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has canceled the visa of American artist Kanye West, now known as Ye, following the release of his song "Heil Hitler." Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke stated that while West's previous antisemitic comments had not affected his visa, the new song promoting Nazism crossed a line. Burke emphasized that Australia does not need to import bigotry, especially amid a recent rise in antisemitic incidents. The decision was made under the country's Migration Act, which includes character requirements for non-citizens, and it bars West from entering the country despite his family ties there.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its challenge to the independence of federal agencies by asking the Supreme Court to allow the president to fire three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). A lower federal court had previously blocked the terminations, ruling them unlawful because commissioners can only be removed for specific cause, not at will. The administration argues that such restrictions unconstitutionally limit the president's Article II executive powers. This case is the latest in a series of legal battles testing the president's authority to remove officials from independent regulatory bodies.</p>

The trend is not limited to disaster-prone areas like California and Florida; states like Iowa and Minnesota are also facing double-digit increases. Experts attribute the rising costs to an increase in severe weather events, such as wildfires, floods, and storms, as well as rising home values and replacement costs.

          <p>This article provides an analysis of the verdict in Sean Combs' federal trial, explaining the legal nuances of the charges. He was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy, a complex charge that requires proving a coordinated criminal enterprise, which prosecutors failed to do to the jury's satisfaction. However, his convictions for transportation for prostitution carry a maximum sentence of 10 years per count. While his legal team views the acquittal on the most serious charge as a major victory, Combs still faces the possibility of a significant prison sentence at a future hearing.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it is laying off about 9,000 employees, which constitutes less than 4% of its global workforce. This is the latest in a series of job cuts at the company aimed at streamlining operations and increasing efficiency. A key goal of the reorganization is to reduce the number of management layers between individual contributors and top executives. The move comes as Microsoft continues to report strong profits and revenue, suggesting the layoffs are part of a broader strategic restructuring rather than a response to poor financial performance.

This downturn is attributed to a combination of factors, including intensifying competition from Chinese EV manufacturers and political backlash against CEO Elon Musk.

This decision significantly curtails the international community's ability to monitor Iran's nuclear program, which has been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels.

While the idea has popular support, it faces significant logistical and financial hurdles, as similar experiments in small rural towns have had mixed success.

Wang emphasized that a united China-Europe front could prevent the formation of confrontational global blocs.</p>

          <p>Maxwell Hairston, a first-round draft pick for the Buffalo Bills, is being sued by a woman who alleges he sexually assaulted her in a university dorm room in 2021 when he was a student at Kentucky. The civil lawsuit accuses the 21-year-old cornerback of forcing himself upon her after she rejected his advances. The Bills' general manager stated that the team was aware of the Title IX investigation conducted by the university before drafting Hairston and that their research found no information to substantiate the accusation. The woman is seeking a jury trial and compensatory damages.</p>

          <p>In a surprising sign of potential economic weakness, private sector employment in the U.S. fell by 33,000 jobs in June, according to a report from payroll firm ADP. This marks the first decrease since March 2023 and badly missed economists' expectations of a 100,000-job gain. The report indicates that while layoffs remain low, a hesitancy to hire and replace departing workers led to the net job loss. The decline was concentrated in the service sector, particularly in professional services and healthcare, while goods-producing roles saw a modest expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Del Monte Foods, the 139-year-old company known for its canned fruits and vegetables, has filed for bankruptcy protection. The move is part of a planned sale of the company's assets as it struggles with shifting consumer tastes. Del Monte has faced declining sales for its core products as consumers increasingly opt for healthier, fresher alternatives or cheaper store brands. The company, which also owns brands like Contadina and College Inn, secured financing to continue normal operations during the court-supervised sale process, aiming to create a stronger financial foundation for the future.
