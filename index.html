        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to freeze nearly $2 billion in federal grants to Harvard University was a violation of the school's First Amendment rights and federal law. The judge found that the administration used allegations of antisemitism as a pretext for an ideologically motivated action against the university, jeopardizing significant research. The ruling blocks officials from enforcing the funding freeze, though the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, criticizing the judge's verdict as biased. Harvard's president praised the ruling as a defense of academic freedom.</p>

          <p>China is advancing in the field of artificial intelligence with the development of "agentic frameworks," which are platforms for building autonomous AI agents capable of performing complex tasks. Tech giant Tencent recently open-sourced its Youtu-Agent framework, following similar moves by ByteDance and Alibaba earlier in the year. This progress positions Chinese companies to compete with U.S. counterparts like OpenAI in the race to create sophisticated AI agents that can plan and execute a series of subtasks for users. The development is a key part of the ongoing technological competition between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump characterized the controversy surrounding deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as an irrelevant "Democrat hoax," despite a growing bipartisan effort in Congress to force the release of all related government files. His comments came as a discharge petition led by Rep. Thomas Massie gained signatures to compel a vote, a move opposed by House Speaker Mike Johnson who favors an ongoing committee investigation. Epstein survivors present on Capitol Hill criticized the president's remarks, stating that the issue is not political and involves real human trauma. The push for transparency continues to create friction between lawmakers and the White House.</p>

          <p>Senator Mark Warner stated that a scheduled oversight visit to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency was abruptly canceled by the administration following online attacks from far-right activist Laura Loomer. Warner, the vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, described the move as unprecedented and dangerous, suggesting the administration is taking direction from a conspiracy theorist. Loomer had criticized the agency for hosting an "ANTI-TRUMP" senator and celebrated the cancellation. The incident highlights the activist's influence within the administration and raises serious concerns about the politicization of national security and congressional oversight.</p>

          <p>A caught-on-camera exchange between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, where they discussed the potential for organ transplants to extend life to 150 years, has been questioned by a top U.S. medical specialist. Dr. James Markmann, president of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, stated there is no scientific evidence to support such claims of achieving immortality or extreme longevity through transplants. He emphasized that the focus of transplantation should be on ethical concerns like equity and access for patients currently in need.

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani condemned reports that the White House considered offering administration jobs to rivals Mayor Eric Adams and Curtis Sliwa as an "affront to our democracy." The alleged plan, reported by The New York Times, was aimed at clearing the field to create a direct contest between Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent. Mamdani asserted that the news reveals Donald Trump's preference for Cuomo and is an attempt to subvert the will of New York voters. Both the Adams and Sliwa campaigns denied being contacted by the White House about potential positions.</p>

The competitive environment makes it difficult to raise new capital, increasing the pressure to reduce losses and scale up production to survive. For example, Nio aims to double its recent sales to 50,000 vehicles per month by the fourth quarter to stay on track. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade, showcasing advanced weaponry, served as a powerful message to the world about its growing global influence, directly challenging the U.S.-led international order. This display of strength is analyzed in the context of President Trump's "America First" trade policies, which have inadvertently pushed nations like Russia and India closer to China. The article suggests that Trump's use of tariffs has scrambled traditional geopolitical alignments, creating new economic partnerships that could undermine U.S. interests. Furthermore, recent court rulings against the legality of his tariffs suggest his high-risk trade strategy could face significant challenges both at home and abroad.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly deploying the U.S. military for missions traditionally handled by civilian law enforcement, challenging a long-standing principle dating back to the American Revolution.

This shift is also seen domestically, with National Guard deployments in major cities to address crime.

The administration had used the obscure wartime statute to remove hundreds of individuals accused of being gang members. The court's decision marks a significant legal setback for the strategy, granting a preliminary injunction for the migrants who sued.

          <h2>Salesforce Investor Analysis Weighs Soft Guidance Against Long-Term AI Potential</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Salesforce reporting better-than-expected second-quarter results, its stock declined due to a soft third-quarter revenue forecast and an unchanged full-year outlook. This analysis explores why investors might hold the stock, citing strong performance in key metrics like remaining performance obligation and continued double-digit growth in its AI and Data Cloud revenue. The company's AI-powered Agentforce platform has secured over 12,500 deals, showing strong adoption. However, the results were not enough to silence bears who believe the company's traditional business model is being disrupted, leading to a lowered price target for the stock.

          <p>The Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups successfully negotiated an agreement to prevent approximately 98,000 North Carolina voters from being removed from the rolls. The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration's Department of Justice, which had demanded the state deny ballots to voters who registered without providing a driver's license or partial Social Security number. Under the new agreement, these voters will be allowed to provide the necessary information while casting a provisional ballot, curing the issue at the polling place. The outcome is seen as a victory for voting rights advocates against the DOJ's recent focus on voter fraud.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has selected seven new members for the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a key panel of vaccine experts. This move follows his decision in June to fire all 17 previous members and replace them with his own handpicked advisers. The new appointees include a semi-retired transplant surgeon, an emergency medicine specialist, and a pediatric neurologist, among others. The changes to this influential committee are part of a broader overhaul of public health agencies under the current administration, which has been met with both support and significant criticism from the scientific community.</p>

          <p>An Afghan family, including a father and his two younger children, has been held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention for months, caught in a bureaucratic standoff between the U.S. and Canada. Although they are eligible for asylum in Canada, where immediate relatives are refugees, they can only file their claim at a land border. However, U.S. officials will only release them for air travel, for which they lack the necessary visas, leaving them stuck. Their case highlights the challenges faced by asylum seekers navigating rapidly changing immigration policies, with the family facing potential deportation while their relatives in Canada desperately seek their release.</p>

          <p>Parents and health charities in the UK are raising alarms about a lack of dedicated services for childhood constipation, a condition that led to over 44,000 hospital admissions for children in England last year. One mother described how her son's severe, untreated constipation was not taken seriously until he reached a crisis point, with his condition causing constant pain and weight loss. Experts say the problem is widespread but often dismissed by healthcare professionals, leading to a postcode lottery of care where families in some areas have no access to specialist bladder and bowel services. The issue is exacerbated by factors like delayed potty training and cultural reluctance to discuss the topic.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that Americans continue to hold negative views of the U.S. economy, with ratings dipping slightly over the past month. The most commonly chosen words to describe the economy were "uncertain" and "struggling," with far more respondents labeling it "unfair" than "fair." Persistent concerns about rising prices are a primary driver of this sentiment, as two-thirds of Americans say prices are still increasing and expect them to continue to do so. While personal financial ratings vary by income, the overall economic outlook remains pessimistic, with a majority believing the economy is getting worse.</p>

These new deals will provide millions of subscribers with C-SPAN's unfiltered, gavel-to-gavel coverage of Congress and other government proceedings.

          <p>An analysis piece argues that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has effectively prevailed in his conflict with the CDC, reshaping the agency to align with his views. Since taking office, he has fired the agency's vaccine advisory committee, pushed out senior leaders, and promoted unproven treatments during a measles outbreak, which he later misleadingly described as a success. By installing contrarians and anti-vaccine activists in key positions, Kennedy is seen as dismantling the CDC's traditional scientific authority. His actions have left fewer senior scientists at the agency to counter what critics describe as dangerous anti-vaccine impulses.</p>
