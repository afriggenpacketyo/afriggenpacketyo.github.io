        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that Anna's Hummingbirds have adapted to backyard feeders, resulting in changes to the size and shape of their beaks. The birds' beaks have become longer and more slender to efficiently extract nectar from feeders, and male beaks have grown pointier for fighting off rivals. This adaptation has also allowed the hummingbirds to expand their range northward. Researchers tracked hummingbird feeder mentions in California newspapers and compared it to census data to find the correlation. The study highlights how human actions can rapidly influence the evolution of species. </p>

The robbers, disguised as police, tied up Kardashian in her hotel room before making off with the jewels. Kardashian testified that she feared for her life during the ordeal and expressed gratitude to French authorities for pursuing justice. The thieves were dubbed the "grandpa robbers" due to their ages. Kardashian stated she has forgiven the ringleader of the crime.</p>

This move comes weeks after Mike Waltz's departure as national security advisor.

A White House official stated the changes are an attempt to target Washington’s so-called "Deep State." The NSC advises the president on national security, military, and foreign affairs matters.

Asrarguis emphasizes Milgrim's dedication to peace-building and interfaith dialogue, recounting their meeting on an interfaith trip to Morocco. The author stresses that Milgrim's legacy should not be co-opted for political gain but remembered for her commitment to shared humanity and the pursuit of peace between Jews and Muslims.

The attack occurred on a crowded platform, causing chaos as the attacker randomly stabbed travelers. The station is Germany's busiest and considered one of its most dangerous, leading to weapons-free zone regulations.

          <p>New Jersey is holding its gubernatorial elections this year, with hotly contested primaries set for next month. Experts are saying the high-stakes race could be a harbinger for the mood of the country ahead of 2026's critical midterm elections. The Democratic primary features six figures hoping to succeed incumbent and term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and to keep the governorship blue. Republicans are hoping to flip New Jersey's governorship red -- and point to the closer-than-expected margin between Trump and Harris in 2024 as evidence that it's in reach. At stake in the race are also issues in New Jersey such as immigration enforcement and sanctuary cities, and the cost of housing and general affordability.</p>

          <p>A brush fire outside Yosemite National Park in California has forced the shut down of a major highway and the evacuation of a resort town near the Nevada border, officials said. The Inn fire ignited on Thursday afternoon and had burned more than 700 acres near Mono Lake, Calif., in Inyo National Forest by Friday afternoon, according to Cal Fire, the state’s fire fighting agency. Highway 395 was closed mainly because of safety reasons. Helicopters were pulling water from Mono Lake and Lundy Lake on Thursday and Friday and dropping it on the flames.</p>

          <p>President Trump said Friday that U.S. Steel will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh as part of what he called a "planned partnership" between the iconic American steelmaker and Japan-based Nippon Steel, which has sought to buy it. Nippon Steel's nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden. Shares of U.S. Steel jumped 21% on the news, and continued rising in aftermarket trading. The president also said he'll hold a "BIG Rally" at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh on Friday, May 30.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by failing to protect Jewish students, marking the latest action in its targeting of the university. The administration alleges Columbia breached Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination by recipients of federal funds. This move follows the suspension of over $400 million in research funding to Columbia. The administration previously accused Columbia of "ongoing inaction" in the face of harassment of Jewish students, prompting changes to campus protest and security policies.</p>

The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would slash Medicaid spending by roughly $700 billion and SNAP by about $300 billion. These cuts are intended to offset tax perks primarily benefiting the wealthy. The reconciliation bill would add roughly $3 trillion to the nation's debt including interest over the next decade, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated.

The move comes just weeks after the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, took over from Mike Waltz as national security adviser.

One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to streamline rules and approve applications within 18 months.

The Trump administration also set a goal of quadrupling the nation’s nuclear power capacity by 2050.

          <p>A US judge on Friday overturned Donald Trump’s executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a big law firm that employed a lawyer who investigated him. Trump’s executive order, called Addressing Risks from Jenner & Block, suspended security clearances for the firm’s lawyers and restricted their access to government buildings, officials and federal contracting work. Trump accused the law firm of engaging in activities that “undermine justice and the interests of the United States”, claiming that it participated in politically driven legal actions. US district judge John D Bates ruled on Friday that Trump’s directive violated core rights under the US constitution, mirroring a 2 May ruling that struck down a similar executive order against law firm Perkins Coie.</p>
