          <p>Space manufacturing startup Varda has successfully raised $187 million in a Series C funding round to expand its operations. The company specializes in producing pharmaceuticals in microgravity, where drug crystallization can be more effective than on Earth. This new capital will be used to increase the frequency of missions and develop a biologics lab for testing potential drug molecules. Varda recently achieved a milestone by receiving FAA approval for the return of a capsule that manufactured the drug Ritonavir in space.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has successfully signed Ghanaian midfielder Mohammed Kudus from West Ham in a deal valued at £55 million. The 24-year-old has agreed to a six-year contract, keeping him with Spurs until 2031. Kudus, who had an £85 million release clause, was a key player for West Ham, scoring 14 goals across all competitions in his first season. He cited the opportunity to play in the Champions League and work with new head coach Thomas Frank as primary reasons for the move.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, were scheduled to begin developing a centralized flood monitoring system in mid-July, just days after catastrophic flooding killed over 120 people. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically on July 4, causing one of the deadliest flash floods in the state's history. For years, the area, known as "flash flood alley," had been trying to finance a public warning network. The planned system was intended as a decision-support tool for emergency managers, not a public alert system, but its delayed implementation highlights the region's vulnerability.</p>

The application covers operations with and without human safety drivers, with a decision expected by the end of July. This expansion effort follows Tesla's recent pilot program launch in Austin, Texas, as the company aims to scale its autonomous vehicle technology.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and recent Columbia University graduate student, has filed a $20 million claim against the Trump administration. The filing alleges false imprisonment and malicious prosecution related to his arrest and detention over his role in campus protests against the war in Gaza.

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic explores the potential shift in Japan's long-held identity as a proponent of nuclear disarmament, a position rooted in the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The article suggests that a growing nuclear arms race in Asia, with buildups in China and North Korea, is creating new security pressures. Ironically, the prospect of South Korea developing its own nuclear weapons could be the tipping point that pushes Japan to reconsider its non-nuclear stance. This reflects a complex geopolitical reality where historical antagonisms and modern security threats are challenging established national policies.</p>

          <p>The Brazilian government is formulating a response to President Trump's surprise decision to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian exports, effective August 1. Trump's letter cited "unfair trade barriers" and the alleged political "persecution" of former president Jair Bolsonaro as justification. Officials in Brazil are considering retaliatory actions such as suspending U.S. patents or taxing American profits, though they are wary of moves that could harm their own industries. Analysts suggest the tariff dispute could push Brazil to strengthen its economic and political ties with China.</p>

          <p>Svetlana Dali, who was convicted of stowing away on a Delta flight from New York to Paris, has been sentenced to time served and one year of supervised release. Dali, a Russian citizen and U.S. permanent resident, told the court she illegally boarded the plane to escape the U.S. because she believed the military had poisoned her. Having already been jailed for seven months, her sentence was considered complete. The judge imposed supervised release to ensure Dali receives mental health treatment, stressing the danger of such actions and the need for deterrence.</p>
