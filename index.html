          <p>Representative Young Kim, a Republican from a competitive California district, has indicated she will oppose the major Republican tax and spending bill if changes made by the Senate regarding Medicaid are not reversed. The bill's Senate version includes provisions that would force states to lower their provider tax rates, a measure that concerns a group of 20 to 30 moderate House Republicans. Their opposition could jeopardize the bill's passage in the narrowly divided House, creating a significant challenge for party leadership who are under pressure from former President Trump to pass the legislation.

          <p>Recent anti-government protests in Kenya have resulted in at least 19 deaths and 500 injuries, as police reportedly used live ammunition against demonstrators. The government's attempt to ban live media coverage of the protests has intensified concerns over press freedom, with journalists and activists reporting targeted violence and arrests. The demonstrations, largely driven by Generation Z, protest economic hardship and a perceived erosion of democratic rights under President William Ruto's government, which has labeled the events an "attempted coup."</p>

          <p>A sprawling, 940-page Republican legislative package moving through Congress aims to make former President Trump's first-term tax cuts permanent while introducing new breaks for overtime pay and tips. To partially fund these measures and new spending on border security and defense, the bill proposes significant cuts to government programs like Medicaid and food stamps, along with a rollback of green energy incentives. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the House version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Africa's coalition government is experiencing a severe strain after the Democratic Alliance (DA), the second-largest party, withdrew from a "National Dialogue" initiative. The move came after President Cyril Ramaphosa fired a DA deputy minister, prompting the DA to accuse the president of double standards on corruption. While the DA will remain in the government for now, the public dispute threatens the stability of the coalition formed just over a year ago and its ability to address the nation's pressing challenges.</p>
