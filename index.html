          <p>This article explores the prolific artistic relationship between painter Alex Katz and his wife, Ada, who has served as the subject for over 300 of his portraits. It details Katz's development of a unique realist style amidst the dominance of abstract expressionism, which initially drew significant criticism. The piece examines the dynamic between artist and muse, highlighting Katz's focus on style, fashion, and the interplay of light rather than overt emotional expression. A major New York exhibition celebrates this 50-year union of art and life, showcasing the enduring power of their partnership.</p>

          <p>This true-crime report details the case of millionaire Dino Guglielmelli, who attempted to hire a hitman to murder his estranged wife, model Monica Olsen, during a contentious divorce. The plot was foiled when the man he hired, Rick Fuhrmann, went to the police instead of carrying out the gruesome plan, which was to include kidnapping and sexual assault. Fuhrmann then cooperated with investigators, wearing a wire to record Guglielmelli confirming his intentions and agreeing to an $80,000 fee. The article explores the couple's tumultuous relationship, Guglielmelli's controlling nature, and the sting operation that led to his arrest and eventual conviction.</p>

          <p>This commentary reflects on the case of Alix Tichelman, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes. The author questions the distribution of blame, suggesting that Hayes was an active participant who created the situation by soliciting Tichelman and asking her to administer the drugs. The piece contrasts the police's portrayal of Tichelman as 'glacial' with the complexities of the situation, including her panic and failure to call 911. It ultimately frames the issue as an ethical dilemma, leaving the reader to ponder the true nature of accountability in a consensual but fatal encounter.</p>

          <p>This article investigates the 2013 death of Google executive Forrest Hayes from a heroin overdose aboard his yacht, the 'Escape'. The case centered on Alix Tichelman, a woman he met through a 'sugar daddy' website, who was captured on the yacht's security cameras injecting Hayes before he lost consciousness. The video showed her making some attempts to revive him before gathering her belongings, wiping down surfaces, and leaving without calling for help. Police later arrested Tichelman in a sting operation, and the report delves into her troubled past, including a prior incident where her boyfriend also died of an overdose.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This excerpt from Arundhati Roy's forthcoming memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," reflects on her complex and tumultuous relationship with her recently deceased mother. Roy describes the profound pain of experiencing the familiar landscape of Kerala without her mother's formidable presence, which she likens to a force of nature. She recounts their sixty-year-long conversations about her mother's inevitable death and frequently rewritten wills, a history that lulled her into a false sense of her mother's permanence.

          <h2>Trump Administration's Actions Weaken National Labor Relations Board</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 07:00:28 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions, including the firing of key officials like General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo and Chair Gwynne Wilcox, have significantly weakened the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). These moves have left the agency without a quorum for much of the administration, rendering it unable to issue decisions and enforce labor laws effectively. Critics, including Abruzzo, warn that this erosion of the NLRB's power threatens to return workers' rights to pre-1935 levels, empowering corporations and leaving employees with little recourse against unfair labor practices. Recent court rulings allowing challenges to the NLRB's constitutionality to proceed are expected to further paralyze the agency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This philosophical essay explores the moral dilemma of experiencing personal happiness while being aware of widespread global suffering. The author references ancient religious and philosophical traditions that view humanity as a single body, where one member's pain is felt by all. However, it argues this interconnectedness also means we should share in others' joys, a concept known as 'mudita' or sympathetic joy. The piece suggests that focusing solely on global pain leads to cynicism, while ignoring it is naive. It concludes that embracing both horror and delight is a form of resistance and self-care, allowing for a more complete and resilient human experience.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services, has announced plans to 'fix' the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a move experts warn could destabilize the vaccine market. Critics argue that his proposal to end the liability shield for vaccine manufacturers could lead to a mass exit from the market, similar to the crisis in the 1980s that prompted the VICP's creation. Such a change would make it harder for the public to access vaccines and for individuals with rare side effects to receive compensation. The article highlights concerns that these actions undermine public trust in science and could jeopardize national vaccination efforts.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has clarified that consumers can still qualify for the soon-to-expire $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit even if they take possession of the car after the September 30 deadline. According to new IRS guidance, a taxpayer is eligible if they enter into a 'written binding contract' and make a payment, such as a deposit or trade-in, on or before the deadline. This rule applies to new, used, and leased EVs, providing a crucial loophole for those whose vehicles may not be delivered in time. The clarification offers hope for consumers aiming to utilize the federal incentive before it is eliminated.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's high-profile crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., is facing significant legal setbacks as federal prosecutors struggle to secure indictments. In the past month, grand juries have refused to indict in at least five separate cases involving alleged assaults on federal officers, an unusually high rate of rejection. Judges have also expressed frustration with the surge of hastily prepared cases, with one magistrate judge criticizing the government for an 'inexcusable' delay and another for filing a weak gun charge that was quickly dismissed. These judicial rebukes suggest that the administration's aggressive law-and-order push is being challenged by the city's legal system and its citizens.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the increasing use of the National Guard for domestic roles like policing, immigration enforcement, and even substitute teaching distorts its core mission and erodes public trust. The author, a former Guard member, contends that these deployments blur the line between civilian and military authority, creating an image of occupiers rather than neighbors helping in a crisis. This trend not only avoids long-term investment in civilian institutions but also degrades the Guard's readiness for its essential military and disaster-response duties. The author calls on governors to resist such deployments to preserve the Guard's legitimacy as a community-based force of last resort.</p>

          <p>The second Trump administration is actively dismantling the public health achievements of its first term by undermining the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines developed under Operation Warp Speed. Led by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time vaccine skeptic, the administration is canceling grants for new mRNA vaccine research, which also has potential applications for cancer and HIV. Furthermore, his administration has replaced the CDC's immunization advisory committee with vaccine skeptics and removed recommendations for children and pregnant women, which will likely end insurance coverage for these groups. This policy reversal signals a significant shift that could severely restrict public access to COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

Recent surveys show India accounts for over 40% of such incidents worldwide, with common danger zones being heights like cliffs and waterfalls, as well as encounters with wildlife. Researchers note that men are involved in three out of four fatal incidents, and tragically, bystanders who attempt rescues often become victims themselves. Psychologists attribute the trend to the pursuit of online validation overriding personal judgment, as people seek social media fame, sometimes putting themselves and others in mortal danger.</p>

The price for tencha, the tea leaves used for matcha, jumped 170% at a recent auction, forcing retailers to ration supplies.

          <p>Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is set to join the 'Global Sumud Flotilla,' an international aid convoy sailing to Gaza to protest the Israeli blockade. The mission aims to be the largest solidarity effort of its kind, with hundreds of activists from 44 countries participating. This action comes as a global hunger monitor has officially declared a famine in parts of the besieged Palestinian enclave. The flotilla's departure coincides with escalating regional tensions, including a recent Israeli strike on Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon. Israel maintains its naval blockade is a necessary security measure, while critics decry it as a form of collective punishment.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece condemns the Trump administration's decision to restore Confederate memorials, including a controversial statue at Arlington National Cemetery and a portrait of Robert E. Lee at West Point. The author, an Army veteran, argues that honoring leaders who fought against the United States is a betrayal of the military's values and trivializes the sacrifices made to preserve the Union. Drawing a parallel to his own grandfather who fought for Mussolini, he asserts that one can respect ancestors' military service without glorifying their unjust causes. The article posits that these actions are not about honoring history but about making common cause with apologists for a treasonous rebellion.</p>

          <p>A U.S. naval buildup in the Caribbean, aimed at countering narcotics trafficking, has intensified fear and uncertainty in Venezuela, where citizens are already grappling with a prolonged economic and political crisis. While the Trump administration has sent mixed signals, including recent diplomatic engagement, the military presence and harsh rhetoric against President Nicolás Maduro fuel speculation of intervention. For many Venezuelans, the situation is another chapter in a long saga of instability, prompting a mix of weary resignation and faint hope for change. The government in Caracas has responded with defiance, organizing militia sign-ups and denouncing the U.S. actions as imperialist aggression.</p>

          <p>Although the Democratic Party is currently facing historically low public approval ratings, with many voters deeming its leaders 'weak,' some strategists see reasons for optimism. A growing lead in generic congressional ballot polls and an energetic field of potential presidential candidates are cited as positive signs. Analysts suggest the party's recovery plan involves focusing on 'kitchen table' economic issues, organizing for midterm victories, and leveraging President Trump's own increasing unpopularity. The internal debate over policy and messaging, from economic patriotism to cultural issues, is seen by some as a necessary step to redefine the party and reconnect with a broader electorate.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece revisits a 1995 speech by Toni Morrison to argue that the rise of fascism in America is not a new phenomenon but is deeply rooted in the nation's history of racism. The author contends that Morrison's genealogical approach, tracing fascism's 'succubus twin' of racism, offers a more profound understanding than simple analogies to historical European regimes. The article posits that Black history is a continuous story of resisting this inherent fascism through belief, diverse forms of protest, and faith. It concludes that by learning from this legacy, the nation can find the tools to defend democracy against its current autocratic threats.</p>

          <p>Brentford striker Yoane Wissa has publicly criticized the club and demanded a transfer to Newcastle United before the deadline. In a social media statement, Wissa accused Brentford of going back on written promises that he could leave if a 'reasonable offer' was made, claiming the club is now 'unduly standing in his way.' Newcastle has reportedly had two offers rejected, with Brentford allegedly increasing their asking price from £40m to around £65m. The DR Congo international, who has not been training with the first team, expressed his frustration and urged the club's owners to honor their agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following one of the UK's hottest summers on record, the use of home air conditioning is on the rise, prompting a debate over its benefits and drawbacks. While air-con improves comfort and productivity, experts raise concerns about its environmental impact due to potent greenhouse gases (HFCs) used as refrigerants and increased electricity consumption. Financially, running costs can be significant, though more efficient models and technologies like air-to-air heat pumps offer potential savings. Health-wise, while poorly maintained units can spread germs, well-kept systems can actually improve air quality, presenting a complex choice for Britons adapting to a warming climate.</p>

          <p>Observers and political scientists are increasingly sounding the alarm that the United States is becoming a 'competitive authoritarian system' under President Donald Trump. They point to a pattern of actions aimed at consolidating power, such as demanding personal loyalty from cabinet members, criminalizing political opposition, and targeting critics with federal investigations. The article notes the systematic efforts to control government bureaucracy, the legal system, and civil society, drawing parallels to autocratic rollouts in other countries. Activists who have fled persecution abroad express a grim recognition of these trends, warning that the constant threat of state power is a hallmark of authoritarian rule.</p>

          <p>In a significant blow to the U.S. renewable energy sector, the Trump administration has canceled $679 million in federal funding designated for port projects to support the offshore wind industry. The twelve affected projects, from California to Virginia, were intended to create manufacturing and logistics hubs for the massive turbines used in offshore wind farms. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy labeled the projects 'wasteful,' stating the funds would be redirected to other 'critical port upgrades.' This move is the latest in President Trump's campaign against wind power, which critics argue will kill thousands of jobs and hinder the country's transition to clean energy.</p>
