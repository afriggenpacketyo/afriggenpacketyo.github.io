          <p>Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te announced plans to expedite the construction of a multi-layered air defense system known as 'T-Dome' to counter increasing threats from China. The initiative is part of a broader strategy to bolster the island's self-defense capabilities, which includes a significant increase in defense spending to over 3% of GDP next year and 5% by 2030. Lai also called on Beijing to renounce coercion and affirmed Taiwan's commitment to 'maintain peace through strength,' emphasizing the development of domestic defense industries to create a robust line of defense against potential aggression.</p>

          <p>Former French finance minister Eric Lombard has asserted that free trade is 'over,' attributing its demise to the protectionist practices of the United States and China. Speaking at a summit in Paris, Lombard warned that Europe risks disappearing between Chinese dumping and American tariffs if it does not adopt a more 'nationalistic' and protective trade policy. He urged the European Union to recognize the 'brutal' new global trade environment and take a tougher stance against what he described as unfair practices that deviate from World Trade Organization rules.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peru's Congress has unanimously voted to remove President Dina Boluarte from office, citing her administration's inability to manage a severe crime wave gripping the nation. The impeachment followed a shooting at a concert in Lima that intensified public anger over rampant crime, including a significant rise in homicides and extortion. Boluarte, who had extremely low approval ratings and faced multiple scandals, was replaced by the president of Congress, José Jerí, who will serve as interim president until the scheduled elections in April. This marks another chapter in Peru's ongoing political instability, with Boluarte being the sixth president in under a decade.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have reportedly agreed to the first phase of a comprehensive peace plan, initiating a ceasefire after two years of conflict. This initial stage involves the release of all 20 remaining living hostages held by Hamas in exchange for approximately 1,950 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israeli jails. Concurrently, the Israeli military will withdraw to an agreed-upon line, retaining control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip, while hundreds of humanitarian aid trucks will begin entering the territory daily. A multinational force overseen by the US will monitor the ceasefire, paving the way for further negotiations on Gaza's future governance.</p>

          <p>This opinion article credits President Trump with a remarkable achievement in brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a feat described as something no other recent president could have accomplished. The author highlights the complexity of the situation and Trump's unique, forceful personality as key to the breakthrough, comparing it to his first-term Abraham Accords. However, the article argues that Trump 'stepped on his own story' by simultaneously pursuing what is framed as a campaign of retribution, specifically the indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James. This duality is presented as a core feature of the Trump presidency: global peacemaking juxtaposed with personal political battles.</p>

          <p>A growing trend of skepticism in China towards Western-centric historical accounts has recently focused on ancient Egyptian artifacts. This movement, exemplified by retired professor Huang Heqing questioning the authenticity of items in a major Shanghai exhibition, reflects a broader nationalist re-evaluation of global history. While China and Egypt maintain strong diplomatic ties, this academic debate highlights an intellectual current within China that challenges the foundational frameworks of Western classical history. The controversy, sparked by questions about items like a pair of grass sandals, is adding a new dimension to the cultural relationship between the two nations.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attacks as 'cynical and calculated' and urged allies to provide more decisive action, including air defense systems and stronger sanctions enforcement.

          <p>A powerful 7.4-magnitude earthquake off the coast of the southern Philippines has resulted in at least two fatalities and caused significant damage to infrastructure, including a hospital and schools. The quake, which originated in the Philippine Trench, triggered a tsunami warning and led to the evacuation of coastal communities, although the warning was later canceled after only small waves were detected. Widespread power outages were reported, and disaster response teams are assessing the full extent of the damage.

President Emmanuel Macron is expected to appoint a new prime minister to break the current deadlock, with outgoing PM Sebastien Lecornu suggesting the appointee should be disconnected from the 2027 presidential race to focus on solving the country's problems. The article explores the possibility of a technocratic government, similar to models used in Italy, to reassure investors and navigate the difficult 2026 budget.

High blood pressure was the most common factor, affecting over 95 percent of victims.

He suggested that the current England squad benefits from a different generational dynamic, where club rivals are friendlier, and a more positive relationship with the media, which creates a better external perception.

Using photo-matching software, the research identified numerous cases of identical images being used across different adverts. One local council official described the practice as making a 'mockery' of the law, which exacerbates the city's housing affordability crisis by removing properties from the residential market.</p>

In an interview, he detailed being targeted by angry fans at an airport following the 2023 Europa League final, an incident he links to public criticism from then-Roma manager Jose Mourinho. Taylor criticized the 'win-at-all-costs' culture in football and the expectation of perfection placed on officials, which he believes negatively impacts their mental health. He expressed concern that the hostile environment, fueled by false narratives and conspiracy theories, is detrimental to the sport at all levels.</p>

          <p>Beijing has designated the Canadian semiconductor research firm TechInsights as an 'unreliable entity,' effectively banning it from working with or receiving data from Chinese organizations. The move, citing national security concerns, comes shortly after TechInsights published a report revealing that Huawei's latest AI chips contained components sourced from outside mainland China, including from companies subject to U.S. export controls. TechInsights is known for its detailed analysis of Chinese-made chips, and this blacklisting could increase the opacity of China's semiconductor industry. The action is seen as retaliation for a report that raised questions about the self-sufficiency of China's chip supply chain.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on charges of bank fraud and making false statements. The indictment was brought by a U.S. Attorney hand-picked by President Trump, who had publicly called for charges against James, a long-time political adversary. The charges relate to a mortgage on a secondary home in Norfolk, Virginia, with prosecutors alleging she misrepresented her use of the property to secure a loan with a lower interest rate. James has called the charges 'baseless' and a 'desperate weaponization' of the justice system for political retribution, a sentiment echoed by other Democratic leaders.</p>

Her identification is the fourth success for Operation Identify Me, an international police campaign launched in 2023 to name unidentified female victims of suspicious deaths across Europe. The breakthrough came after a tip was received following a German TV appeal related to the campaign. While her identity is now known, the cause of her death remains unexplained, and the police investigation is ongoing. The case highlights the effectiveness of international cooperation and public appeals in solving long-standing cold cases.</p>

          <p>The White House has repeatedly claimed that assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have surged by 'more than 1,000 percent,' but an analysis of federal court records does not support this figure. While assaults have increased, a review of charges filed for assaulting a federal officer shows a rise of about 25% this year, far below the administration's dramatic claim. Despite requests, the Department of Homeland Security has not provided data to substantiate its statistic. Former law enforcement officials express concern that such exaggerations can undermine public trust in the criminal justice system.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from China and Spain has discovered that adding salt to ice allows it to generate electricity when bent or subjected to non-uniform strain. This phenomenon, known as flexoelectricity, produced an electrical response in the saline ice comparable to that of specialized ceramic materials. The researchers successfully fabricated devices using this salt-doped ice, demonstrating its potential as a low-cost, clean energy source in cold environments. This finding builds on the team's previous research into the flexoelectric properties of pure ice, opening up new possibilities for power generation in frigid climates.</p>

The ruling characterized the feud as a 'war of words' where incendiary language is expected, and a reasonable listener would not interpret the accusations as verifiable facts. Drake had sued the record label for allowing the song's publication, but his spokesperson has indicated plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary order halting the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois, including the city of Chicago. The administration had ordered the deployment to protect federal facilities and agents from what it described as violent protesters, but local officials argued the move was a politically motivated overreach. In her ruling, Judge April Perry stated that the deployment would only 'add fuel to the fire' and suggested the administration's actions were rooted in 'animus toward Illinois elected officials.' The two-week restraining order was praised by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, while the White House announced its intention to appeal.</p>
