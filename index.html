          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has introduced a new cabinet aimed at addressing economic challenges amid ongoing trade disputes with the U.S. The cabinet reshuffle includes changes in key ministerial positions, such as foreign affairs and international trade, to better manage the strained relationship with the United States and to focus on breaking down internal trade barriers within Canada. This move follows Carney's recent meeting with President Trump, where they discussed potential renegotiations of trade deals, and the new cabinet reflects a commitment to delivering economic change and navigating the complex international trade landscape. The changes also involve fresh faces in natural resources and public safety roles, indicating a broad strategic realignment. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria in an effort to stabilize the country and foster peace. Speaking in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump stated his administration has already taken the first steps towards restoring normal relations between the United States and Syria for the first time in more than a decade. Syria has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. government since 1979, and additional sanctions were imposed in 2004 and 2011 following a crackdown on anti-government uprisings. This decision signals a major shift in U.S. foreign policy towards Syria, aiming to give the new government a chance at greatness. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with a bill to fund President Trump's agenda, which includes significant cuts to Medicaid, despite internal disputes over tax deductions. The proposed cuts aim to save $880 billion over the next decade by imposing work requirements for recipients and conducting more frequent eligibility checks, but these measures face opposition from both moderate and hardline Republicans. The bill also addresses culture war issues by stripping Medicaid funding from organizations that offer abortion services. With the GOP controlling both chambers of Congress, they are using reconciliation to fast-track the legislation, though it is already receiving pushback from Senate Republicans, who are concerned about the impact on the working poor. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lawyer representing a group of small businesses argued in federal court that President Trump's tariffs are an unlawful expansion of executive power. The businesses claim that the tariffs, imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are causing irreparable harm as they rely on imports from countries like China and Mexico. The Department of Justice defends the tariffs, asserting that Congress permits the president to impose them under a national emergency. This case marks the first time a federal court has taken up the question of the legality of Trump's tariffs, with at least six separate lawsuits targeting the president's use of tariffs. </p>

          <p>Robyn Denholm, Tesla's board chair, has sold $198 million in Tesla stock over the past six months, bringing her total profit from stock sales to over $530 million since becoming board leader. This action raises concerns about her confidence in Tesla's future, especially as Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration and his political activities have alienated some car buyers. The New York Times article notes that Tesla's car sales have declined, and the company's quarterly profit has fallen to a four-year low. Despite Musk's advice to employees to hold onto their stock, Denholm's sales have outstripped those of other Tesla directors, except for Musk himself, adding to investor unease. </p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April on an annual basis, slightly less than economists expected, but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing and energy costs were major drivers of inflation, while grocery prices saw a slight decline. Economists are watching for signs of Trump's tariffs affecting consumer prices, but the impact may take months to appear in economic data. The tentative trade agreement between the U.S. and China may temper inflation, potentially leading the Fed to cut rates twice in 2025, with the first cut expected in September. </p>

          <p>Governors and state leaders across the U.S. are expressing concerns about potential budgetary challenges stemming from the Trump administration's proposed cuts to federal aid. As states grapple with existing deficits, they worry they will be unable to absorb the financial burden if the federal government reduces funding for key public services like infrastructure, education, and healthcare. These concerns arise as the Trump administration proposes scaling back federal aid to states on programs ranging from public education to mental health, aiming to shift more financial responsibility to local governments. This shift is framed as a matter of fiscal necessity and federalism, but it raises fears of significant ripple effects throughout the economy. </p>

          <p>This New York Times article delves into Audra McDonald's Tony-nominated performance in 'Gypsy,' specifically focusing on the emotional depth and transformative power of the song 'Rose's Turn.' The article explores how McDonald's interpretation sheds new light on the character of Rose, revealing a woman driven by deeper fears of abandonment and rejection. Through interviews with McDonald, director George C. Wolfe, and musical director Andy Einhorn, the piece uncovers the elements that contribute to this precipitous journey, including a speech from 'Angels in America,' the neurotic dissonance of clarinets, and an interpolated key change. The article highlights McDonald's ability to expose a woman who was always there, but previously unseen, making the song a visceral and unforgettable experience for audiences. </p>

The agency will conduct a scientific review by October 31 to determine whether to ban the supplements or request companies to withdraw them. While fluoride is known to strengthen tooth enamel and reduce cavities, the FDA cites concerns that ingested fluoride has been shown to alter the gut microbiome and may be associated with thyroid disorders, weight gain, and decreased IQ.

This action is part of an ongoing conflict between the federal government and Harvard, with the administration accusing the university of prioritizing appeasement over accountability. The cuts are in addition to $2.2 billion previously frozen, and come as Harvard faces multiple investigations from the Education Department, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and Health and Human Services Department.

          <p>Despite signs of economic improvement, credit card debt forgiveness remains a sensible option for many borrowers struggling with high-interest rates and unmanageable balances. While inflation might be cooling and the job market seems steady, the cost of carrying credit card debt remains high, making it difficult for many households to catch up. Debt forgiveness can provide targeted relief by reducing the debt obligation, offering a path out of an otherwise endless debt cycle. While it comes with trade-offs like credit score impacts and potential tax liability, the alternative of years of mounting debt is often worse. (not investment advice) </p>
