Birmingham City Council claims to have made a fair and reasonable offer, but the union asserts that the proposal was not in line with previous discussions.

          <p>David Brooks argues that the Democratic Party's problems stem from a failure to adapt to the current political climate, characterized by widespread social distrust and a belief that societal systems are rigged. He suggests that the Republican Party, under Donald Trump, has been more successful in tapping into this sentiment by portraying elites as detrimental to America. Brooks contends that Democrats need visionaries who can shift their entire worldview, rather than relying on politicians focused on fundraising and the next election. Trump's actions, such as departing from conservative orthodoxy and assaulting institutions, have created a revolutionary government.</p>

A smaller-than-expected dip would be viewed favorably, while anything below 100,000 could trigger recession fears and prompt the Federal Reserve to consider quicker interest rate action.

The conflict stems from Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a war of words on social media.

          <p>Zia Yusuf has resigned as chairman of Reform UK, stating that working to get the party elected is no longer "a good use of my time." The resignation follows Yusuf's criticism of a Reform MP's call to ban the burka, highlighting internal divisions within the party. Despite Yusuf's contributions to Reform's recent electoral successes, including winning a by-election and gaining new councillors, his departure raises questions about the party's stability. Nigel Farage expressed regret over Yusuf's resignation, acknowledging his talent and contributions to the party's progress.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's shares experienced a significant drop of approximately 20% after the company reduced its full-year earnings guidance, citing a "dynamic macroenvironment." Despite exceeding Wall Street expectations for its fiscal first-quarter earnings, the company is navigating tariffs and concerns about a potential economic slowdown. The revised guidance reflects the impact of these factors on Lululemon's financial outlook, as comparable sales rose only 1% year over year. The company's CEO, Calvin McDonald, emphasized the intention to leverage its strong financial position to invest in growth opportunities amidst the challenging environment.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners might consider using a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay off their mortgage faster, but this strategy has both advantages and disadvantages. HELOCs offer flexibility, controlled costs, and competitive rates, with minimal closing costs and interest-only payments during the draw period. However, variable interest rates, potential prepayment penalties, and the risk of foreclosure are drawbacks to consider. Alternatives to using a HELOC include refinancing, home equity loans, mortgage recasts, extra mortgage payments, and reverse mortgages, each with their own set of implications.</p>
