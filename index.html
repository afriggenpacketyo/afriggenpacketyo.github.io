          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company to explore ways to potentially reduce costs and improve efficiency for Amtrak's Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, a project connecting Baltimore to Washington and Virginia, which has seen its estimated cost increase from $6 billion to $8.5 billion. The Department of Transportation has confirmed that the Boring Company is among several firms being considered for a new engineering contract. Concerns have been raised regarding Musk's potential conflicts of interest due to his involvement with companies regulated by federal agencies and his role in government efficiency initiatives. The Frederick Douglass Tunnel is intended to replace the 152-year-old Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel, but has faced concerns about rising costs and missed deadlines.</p>

          <p>Rapper Tory Lanez, who is serving a 10-year sentence for shooting Megan Thee Stallion in 2020, was hospitalized after being attacked at the California Correctional Institution.

An investigation has been initiated by the CCI's Investigative Services Unit and the Kern County District Attorney's Office. Megan Thee Stallion had previously filed a restraining order against Lanez, alleging harassment from prison, and a protective order was issued through 2030, preventing any contact between them.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have outlined a tax bill featuring temporary extensions of President Trump's 2017 tax law, including lower marginal income tax rates and a larger standard deduction, along with new tax breaks such as exemptions for tips and overtime pay, and tax advantaged 'MAGA accounts' for children's investments. To offset the costs, the bill proposes raising taxes on President Biden's clean energy initiatives, university endowments, and remittances sent overseas, with an expected addition of $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. The bill has already faced criticism from some House Republicans over the proposed increase to the limit on state and local tax deduction to $30,000 from $10,000, signaling potential challenges in securing enough votes for passage.</p>

          <p>The second Trump administration is facing scrutiny for blurring the lines between public office and personal enrichment, with the acceptance of a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar and the auctioning off of access to the president through sales of a meme coin. Critics point to the dismantling of a Justice Department unit dedicated to investigating cryptocurrency crimes and the narrowing of enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as further examples of ethical lapses. The administration's actions are being compared to past controversies involving other politicians, but the current situation is particularly notable for the openness with which personal benefits are being accrued.</p>

The endorsement could prove to be a liability in the general election, as New Jersey traditionally leans left, and Mr. Trump is seen as an increasingly polarizing figure in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 800,000 voters. In 2021, Ciattarelli strained to avoid appearing overtly aligned with Mr. Trump, whom, years earlier, he had called a charlatan who was “not fit to be president.”</p>

          <p>A former top campaign aide to Kamala Harris, David Plouffe, has claimed that Joe Biden's decision to remain in the 2024 US presidential election for too long "totally fucked us." Plouffe, who joined Harris's campaign after Biden withdrew from the race, described the campaign as a "fucking nightmare" due to Biden's actions. The book describes how Plouffe had received calls from donors worried about Biden’s diminishing energy, cognitive skills and ability to deliver a speech. The book alleges desperate efforts by his close staff and allies to hide the extent of his deterioration.</p>

Staff members refused access to two Justice Department officials chosen by Blanche for key roles, leading to a standoff. The White House accused Hayden of placing “inappropriate books in the library for children," which prompted the termination. The librarian of Congress is a presidentially appointed post, subject to confirmation by the Senate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nomination of Casey Means as surgeon general has sparked a virtual civil war among his supporters, particularly within Robert F.

The situation underscores the instability of a political coalition built on paranoia, distrust, and social media clout, as Means's enemies question her alignment with the medical mainstream.</p>

A federal judge ordered the cargo seized, but the boxes remained unopened for decades.
