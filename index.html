          <p>A group of Yale University classmates penned an open letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, expressing concerns about his role in the Trump administration and its potential descent into authoritarianism. The letter, signed by 140 members of the Yale Class of 1984, cites actions such as giving Elon Musk and his "DOGE cohorts" access to private data and attacks on independent media as examples of the administration's overreach. Bessent responded by defending his service to the American people and criticizing the "close-minded progressives" who oppose President Trump. The alumni initiative aims to amplify voices of concern regarding governmental actions.</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, once projected as a potential No. 1 overall pick, experienced a surprising slide in the NFL Draft, even being passed over by the Saints for Tyler Shough in the second round. This sparked reactions from figures like Donald Trump, who questioned the intelligence of NFL owners, and former Rep. Jamaal Bowman, who suggested racial bias as a factor. Sanders addressed the situation with optimism, viewing it as "fuel to the fire," while his brother posted footage of Shedeur's speech to his family. The debate highlights the complexities of draft evaluations and the intersection of sports, race, and politics.</p>

          <p>Pope Francis' last will and testament, dated June 29, 2022, details his wishes regarding his burial.

The will stipulated a simple tomb in the earth with only the inscription "Franciscus", forgoing any mention of his papacy. He concluded by offering his suffering for peace in the world and brotherhood among peoples.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department has revoked a policy that provided protections to journalists in leak investigations, potentially allowing authorities to subpoena reporters and compel testimony. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that intentional leaks of sensitive information undermine the DOJ's ability to uphold the rule of law. The policy allows for subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants to obtain information from journalists, subject to DOJ leadership approval and advance notice. This decision marks a shift back to a more aggressive approach to leak investigations, similar to policies used during the Trump and Obama administrations.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Pentagon office allegedly set up a system allowing him to access Signal messages, bypassing standard security protocols. A computer monitor in his office was reportedly installed to provide remote access to Signal and text messages from his personal cellphone, despite cellphones being prohibited in the sensitive compartmentalized information facility (SCIF). This setup has raised security concerns, as it potentially exposes Hegseth's personal communications to vulnerabilities. The Defense Department denies the existence of a "dirty line" and the current use of Signal in Hegseth's office.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an investigation into the University of California, Berkeley, concerning foreign funding, focusing on potential failures to disclose significant funding from foreign sources. The investigation revives past criticisms about the university's partnership with China's Tsinghua University. UC Berkeley denies the claims and asserts its cooperation with federal inquiries. The investigation aligns with Trump's executive orders targeting universities he views as liberal adversaries.</p>

Frozen Russian assets would be used to repair war damage in Ukraine. While omitting insistence on regaining all territory or joining NATO, these terms still pose obstacles with the Kremlin, highlighting the complexities of achieving a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>The CBS newsmagazine "60 Minutes" is facing an unprecedented crisis with the departure of its executive producer, Bill Owens, due to alleged corporate interference. This interference is linked to Paramount Global's pending merger with Skydance Media and a $20-billion lawsuit filed by President Trump over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. The fear is that the company will settle the lawsuit with an apology and payment to Trump. The staff worries about corporate support and its ability to aggressively cover the Trump White House.</p>

          <p>A 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck Ecuador, injuring at least 20 people and causing widespread damage in the port city of Esmeraldas. The earthquake damaged homes and public buildings, caused power cuts, and led to the temporary shutdown of some oil infrastructure.
