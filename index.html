          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. These nanoparticles convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light, though the resulting images are somewhat blurred. While not as powerful as night vision goggles, these lenses could be used in surgical procedures, encryption, or rescue operations, and they function even better with closed eyes. The ability to see in the dark could also be useful in counterfeit protection by revealing invisible features or inks on documents.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul defeated Alexei Popyrin in straight sets at the French Open, ending Popyrin's run in the tournament.

Popyrin, seeded 25th, struggled with unforced errors, while Paul capitalized on key moments to secure the win. This victory makes Paul the first American man to reach the quarter-finals at the French Open since 2003, marking a significant milestone in his career, as he progresses to face either Ben Shelton or Carlos Alcaraz.</p>

          <p>Japanese universities have received approximately 2.7 billion yen in subsidies from the Defense Ministry for security-related technology research since fiscal year 2015. The funding aims to support research amid budget constraints faced by domestic universities, particularly those outside Tokyo. The program's budget has increased over the years, with the allocation for fiscal year 2023 reaching 11.4 billion yen. Some universities are using the funds for projects such as developing sheets that absorb harmful gases and systems that use AI to detect cyberattacks. Despite the benefits, concerns have been raised about the potential military applications of the research.</p>

Despite the unrest, Paris police ensured PSG's trophy parade proceeded with increased security to prevent further clashes. French President Emmanuel Macron congratulated PSG on their victory, while Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau condemned the violence, emphasizing the need to distinguish between genuine fans and vandals.</p>

          <p>North Korea amended its space development law in 2022, lifting a ban on the military use of space for national defense purposes, according to an analysis by 38 North. The revised law eliminates language opposing the militarization of space and includes a warning about countermeasures against unfriendly acts. This change underscores North Korea's active promotion of space capabilities, evidenced by its claim of successfully placing a reconnaissance satellite into orbit in 2023. The amendment suggests a maturing space strategy, signaling a shift in North Korea's approach to space development.</p>

The lawsuit argues that the order violates the First Amendment right to free speech by targeting NPR for its news coverage. Experts believe NPR has a strong case, citing Trump's statements about NPR and PBS as "leftwing propaganda." The lawsuit aims to permanently block the order and declare it unconstitutional, asserting that the funding cut would devastate American communities.</p>

The findings fill a critical gap in the genetic data of prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia, identifying one of the Tibetan Plateau’s “ghost ancestors” for the first time from a genetic perspective.

Diamondback Energy delivered better-than-expected results and is returning capital to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, offering a dividend yield of nearly 3.9%. Analysts believe these companies have strong financials and the ability to maintain dividend payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that tough public spending choices are unavoidable as the government finalizes spending plans for various sectors. Increased health spending may lead to cuts in unprotected areas like transport and the criminal justice system. The government's commitment to reducing borrowing and not raising taxes further suggests potential spending cuts. The IFS suggests that the generosity of NHS funding will significantly impact other departments, particularly given the government's ambitions to improve the criminal justice system and address prison overcrowding.

The welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), is highlighted as an example of effective grassroots organizing. The Johnnie Tillmon model, which emphasizes uniting the poor across differences and building visionary projects of survival, is presented as a strategic framework. The article suggests that by harnessing the power of the organized poor, it is possible to shift from defense to offense and fight for a new social contract.</p>
