          <p>A new immersive Elvis Presley experience in London, titled 'Elvis Evolution,' has drawn sharp criticism from attendees who felt misled by its advertising. Many visitors, who paid up to £300 for tickets, expected a life-sized AI hologram of the singer but instead were shown upscaled archive footage and a theatrical performance. While the creator, Layered Reality, defended the creative choice to not mimic Elvis's iconic performances, some fans described the show as "atrocious" and are seeking refunds. The event has received mixed reviews and even saw a show canceled after a security incident.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's sovereign wealth fund, Danantara, is set to sign an $8 billion contract with American engineering firm KBR Inc. to construct 17 modular refineries. This significant deal is reportedly part of a broader trade pact between Indonesia and the United States, which also resulted in a reduction of threatened U.S. tariffs. The plan was revealed in a private briefing by Indonesian Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto. This previously unreported contract highlights deepening energy and economic cooperation between the two nations as part of a strategic agreement.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen-based UBTech Robotics, a leading Chinese manufacturer of humanoid robots, has announced plans for a share placement in Hong Kong to raise approximately $307 million. The company intends to use the proceeds to support its business operations, including working capital, investments, and loan repayments. This fundraising effort follows several others since its public listing in late 2023, as the company continues to expand its financial base. The announcement coincided with a more than 5% drop in UBTech's share price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has threatened former President Jair Bolsonaro with imprisonment for allegedly violating a social media ban. The ban was imposed as part of an investigation into allegations that Bolsonaro planned a coup to overturn his election loss. The violation occurred when political allies shared a video of a speech he gave, which the judge believes was intended for social media distribution. This development escalates the legal pressures on Bolsonaro, who is also under orders to wear an ankle monitor and is barred from contacting foreign governments.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce its first-ever sanctions targeting individuals and companies involved in people-smuggling operations across the English Channel. This new strategy will freeze the assets of gang leaders, corrupt officials, and suppliers of small boat equipment, while also banning them from entering the UK. The move is a key part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's pledge to disrupt the criminal networks facilitating illegal immigration.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores Donald Trump's increasing reliance on tariffs as a primary tool of foreign policy, often using them in ways traditionally reserved for sanctions. Unlike sanctions, which require complex legal frameworks, tariffs can be enacted unilaterally by the president, aligning with his 'America First' agenda and providing direct leverage over trade partners. This strategy, however, creates significant uncertainty in global markets and blurs the lines between economic protectionism and punitive foreign policy. The approach has been used to pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration and drug trafficking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slovenian writer Ana Schnabl critiques the tendency of US and UK publishers to favor stories from the Balkans that focus on war, trauma, and historical tragedy. She recounts being advised to write about themes specific to her culture's problematic history, revealing an expectation that Balkan literature should serve an explanatory or didactic purpose for Western audiences. Schnabl argues this pattern overlooks a diverse range of contemporary stories from the region that explore universal themes without a self-exoticizing lens. She calls for publishers to engage with a wider variety of voices beyond those that reinforce preconceived notions.</p>

          <p>According to an analysis by property portal Zoopla, the average monthly cost of renting a home in the UK has risen by £221 over the past three years. This 21% increase is attributed to high tenant demand coupled with an insufficient supply of available rental properties. The sharp rise in costs has forced some individuals to turn down job opportunities or move to more affordable areas. While the rate of rent increases has recently slowed, particularly in major cities, the overall pressure on renters remains significant, mirroring the rise in monthly mortgage payments for homeowners.

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer, has been sentenced to 33 months in prison for using excessive force during the 2020 raid that resulted in the death of Breonna Taylor. Although Hankison's ten shots did not strike anyone, they endangered a neighboring family, and he is the only officer to face conviction related to the incident. The judge rejected a Justice Department recommendation for no prison time, stating it would minimize the jury's verdict. Taylor's family acknowledged the sentence was less than hoped for but viewed it as a statement against the DOJ's position.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The court acknowledged that the plaintiffs have a plausible case but found insufficient evidence to block the policy while the lawsuit continues. This decision puts thousands of individuals, who were granted protection due to unsafe conditions in their home countries, at risk of deportation. Advocacy groups have expressed alarm, warning that the ruling will upend lives and separate families.</p>

          <p>Critics are accusing President Donald Trump of attempting to divert public attention from the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files by posting about a wide range of unrelated topics. Recent social media posts from Trump have included demands for the Washington Commanders to revert to their old name and attacks on political opponents. This flurry of activity comes after his administration announced it would not release additional Epstein files, a reversal that has angered some of his own supporters. Observers suggest these actions are a deliberate strategy to distract from the growing pressure for transparency.</p>

The B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover of the North Dakota State Fair.

He revealed that he and Warner maintained a close, mentor-like relationship long after the show concluded, with Warner calling him regularly for guidance.

          <p>This opinion article argues that while Donald Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they may have a positive side effect by exposing and pressuring other countries to dismantle their own protectionist trade barriers. Nations and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union have long-standing internal regulations and standards that hinder their own economic potential. The external pressure from U.S. tariffs has reportedly spurred movement toward creating more unified domestic markets in China and Canada. The piece suggests this forced self-reflection could lead to greater global economic freedom. (not investment advice)</p>

The Sienna, a hybrid, starts at a lower price point and offers a combined 36 mpg, significantly higher than the Odyssey's 22 mpg from its V6 engine. While the Odyssey offers more cargo space, the Sienna matches its towing capacity. Both vehicles provide comparable technology and safety features, but the Sienna's efficiency and lower entry cost make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious families.</p>

The initial high number of missing persons was largely due to tourists and campers leaving the area without checking in, a common occurrence in the chaotic aftermath of large-scale disasters.
