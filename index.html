Gross, along with former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, will join Meta to work on AI products, and Meta will acquire a stake in their venture capital firm, NFDG.

Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff has been in communication with Iranâ€™s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, while European diplomats are set to hold talks with Araghchi in Geneva. This comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his compatriots have long seen negotiating with the Iranian regime as a foolâ€™s errand.

          <p>China's export shipments of magnets to the US experienced a significant decline of 93.3% in May, attributed to Beijing's rare earth curbs in response to Washington's tariffs. This drastic reduction in magnet exports, crucial for various sectors, puts pressure on US manufacturers in defense, energy, and automotive industries. Exports to Germany and Japan also saw substantial drops, highlighting the impact of China's export controls on critical minerals. China's Ministry of Commerce stated that they are accelerating the review of rare earth-related export license applications and promoting compliant trade.</p>

Xi highlighted Chen's maxim of following facts and balancing state-led and market approaches, suggesting a pragmatic approach to navigating today's volatile world.

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to keep two Michigan coal plants open, despite opposition due to their high emissions and costs. The Department of Energy has ordered the JH Campbell coal plant to remain open beyond its planned closure date, and is expected to prolong the life of the Monroe power plant. Opponents argue this decision lacks support in Michigan, could increase costs for ratepayers, and is ideologically driven. The administration claims the move is about grid reliability, while critics say it contradicts market forces and the state's clean energy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An expert suggests that bombing Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant may not be effective, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs. The exact depth and protection of the facility are not fully known, and the weapon has never been used in practice. Even if the facility is damaged, Iran has the knowledge, experience, and resources to continue its nuclear program elsewhere. The expert argues that continued military strikes are not a good option and that the only solution is to get Iran to agree to end its nuclear capabilities.</p>
