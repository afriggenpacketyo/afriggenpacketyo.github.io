          <p>Following the end of a two-month ceasefire, Israel launched airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in hundreds of deaths.  The strikes are intended to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages, but a retired general warns that this approach may lead to more hostage deaths.  The situation is further complicated by a lack of humanitarian aid and severe damage to medical facilities in Gaza.</p>
