          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election, marking his second consecutive term in 21 years and signaling a desire for policy stability amidst global macroeconomic uncertainties. The S&P/ASX 200 index reversed earlier gains to close down 0.7%, while the Australian dollar appreciated slightly against the US dollar. Other Asian markets showed mixed performance, with Taiwan's Taiex declining and India's Nifty 50 rising. Oil prices also saw a significant drop after OPEC+ agreed to increase production, and US futures edged down despite strong gains on Wall Street the previous week.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power after the 2020 election. In his acceptance speech, Pence emphasized the Constitution as the common ground uniting Americans and highlighted the importance of finding common ground to forge a future together. His remarks came shortly after an interview aired where President Trump expressed uncertainty about whether due process applies to all individuals in the U.S., regardless of citizenship. Pence also subtly acknowledged differences with both Democrats and his own Republican Party on issues like spending, tariffs, and support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Will Hutchins, best known for his role as the comically genteel sheriff Tom Brewster on the 1950s television western "Sugarfoot," passed away at the age of 94. Hutchins' character, a law student who preferred sarsaparilla to whiskey, brought a unique comedic sensibility to the genre. After "Sugarfoot," Hutchins continued to work in television and film, including appearances in Elvis Presley movies, but later found fulfillment working as a clown, traveling the world and performing for diverse audiences. He believed that the key to comedy was to approach it with the same seriousness as a dramatic role, drawing inspiration from silent film legends like Chaplin and Keaton.</p>

          <p>After leaking for over a week, an oil well blowout off the Louisiana coast has been controlled, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. The leak, which spewed oil and natural gas in a significant geyser, contaminated nearby marshland and prompted a large-scale emergency response. Cleanup and mitigation efforts are ongoing, involving multiple agencies and contractors. The incident has brought attention to the growing problem of orphaned and aging oil wells and the need for funding to cap them. The article also notes concerns about staffing reductions at NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration, which could impact the ability to respond to future spills.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the United States, citing a "National Security threat" and a desire to revitalize the American film industry. He blamed other countries' incentives for attracting filmmakers and studios abroad, claiming it harms the US movie industry. The details of the tariff remain unclear, including whether it would apply to American production companies filming overseas. This move comes amidst existing trade disputes and tariffs imposed on other countries, including China, which has reduced its quota of American films allowed into the country.</p>

          <p>Chinese garment factories, particularly in Guangzhou, face increasing challenges due to new tariffs and trade tensions with the United States. These factories, which rely heavily on e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Shein to sell to American consumers, are seeing declining orders and considering relocation to cheaper regions or countries like Vietnam. The tariffs, combined with weakened domestic spending, are pushing many businesses to a tipping point, leading to factory closures and suspended production lines. While the Chinese government encourages domestic e-commerce, consumer caution makes it difficult to replace lost export revenue.</p>

          <p>Patsy Widakuswara, White House bureau chief for Voice of America (VOA), is leading a lawsuit against the Trump administration's order to dismantle the broadcasting network. The lawsuit argues that the administration is unlawfully attempting to shut down VOA because it deems it contrary to the government's agenda. Widakuswara emphasizes VOA's role in providing objective information, especially in countries with limited press freedom. She also highlights the potential impact on her colleagues on journalist visas who could be deported to countries with repressive regimes. The lawsuit argues that the executive order violates press freedom, the First Amendment, and laws preventing executive overreach.</p>

          <p>China is facing a heightened risk of deflation as it redirects exports, originally destined for the U.S., to its domestic market due to high tariffs. Government and businesses are supporting this shift, but it's leading to intense price competition among Chinese firms. JD.com, for example, is offering significant discounts on these goods. Economists warn that this influx of discounted goods could erode company profitability, impacting employment and consumer demand. This could worsen deflationary pressures, as evidenced by recent declines in the consumer price index and producer price index.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun calling up tens of thousands of reservists in preparation for an expanded offensive in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) aims to intensify its operations to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza and defeat Hamas militants. Critics argue that the recent military actions have not guaranteed the release of captives and question Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's objectives in the conflict. The planned offensive will target new areas and aim to destroy infrastructure above and below ground.</p>

Animal rights groups and some politicians have praised the closure, while the NIH director has stated that the agency will continue to support ethical research practices.</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed a 100 percent tariff on movies "produced" outside the United States, claiming the issue posed a national security threat. He authorized the United States Trade Representative to begin the process of taxing "any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands." The Motion Picture Association declined to comment. It remains unclear what would be subject to the tariff and how it would be applied. The vast majority of movies shown in American cinemas are produced in the United States, but Hollywood has increasingly turned to foreign locales for the cameras-rolling part of the moviemaking process.</p>

The Dodgers made a late comeback attempt but ultimately fell short. May's recent regression has been a disappointment for a banged-up Dodgers rotation looking for pitchers to step up.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the former prison on an island off the coast of California. Trump stated that the reopening of Alcatraz would serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice" and would house "America's most ruthless and violent offenders". The prison was closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, and Alcatraz Island currently operates as a tourist site. Trump's announcement comes after clashes with the courts over his policy of sending alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador.</p>
