          <p>A massive pro-Palestinian protest took place on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, with tens of thousands marching despite heavy rain to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. The demonstration, which included notable figures like Julian Assange, was authorized by the NSW Supreme Court just a day before, overriding police objections based on safety and traffic concerns. The event caused significant transport disruption but proceeded peacefully, highlighting growing public pressure on the Australian government regarding its stance on the conflict and Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>Russian authorities have attributed a large fire at an oil depot near the Black Sea resort of Sochi to a Ukrainian drone attack, which forced the nearby airport to suspend flights. The strike was part of a wider wave of Ukrainian drone attacks over the weekend targeting various installations across southern Russia. In retaliation, Russia launched missile strikes on Ukrainian cities, including Mykolaiv, where civilian infrastructure was damaged and several people were injured, continuing the cycle of attacks.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing a new law to combat illegal immigration by criminalizing the online advertisement of services that facilitate Channel crossings. Under the planned legislation, individuals who create and publish such material could face up to five years in prison.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely anticipated to lower its main interest rate to 4% this week in response to growing economic pressures, including rising unemployment and the global trade impact of US tariffs. Financial markets have priced in a high probability of the cut, which would be the fifth since last August, aiming to stimulate the UK's stagnating economy. The move comes as the economy shows signs of shrinking and inflation remains above the central bank's target, signaling a potential period of stagflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new climate study indicates that successful efforts to reduce air pollution in East Asia over the past decade may have unintentionally accelerated global warming. The significant reduction in pollutants, particularly sulphur dioxide, has also removed aerosols that have a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight away from the Earth. Researchers suggest that the removal of these particles may have contributed up to 0.05 degrees Celsius to the rate of global surface warming since 2010, unmasking the full impact of greenhouse gases.</p>
