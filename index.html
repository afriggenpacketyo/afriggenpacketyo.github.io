          <p>England's Lionesses are set for a celebratory return to the UK after clinching the Euro 2025 title against World Champions Spain in a tense penalty shootout. A reception at Downing Street, hosted by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and sports minister Stephanie Peacock, will precede a public homecoming parade in central London, culminating at Buckingham Palace. Despite public enthusiasm and prior suggestions from Sir Keir Starmer for a bank holiday, the government will not declare one, citing economic considerations and past precedents for major sporting triumphs. The team's historic victory has deeply resonated, once again capturing the hearts of the nation. This article details the official plans for their welcome and the broader public sentiment.</p>

          <p>The EU-US trade deal, while averting a full-blown trade war, introduces a 15% US tariff on many European goods, including automobiles, and retains a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum. Key takeaways highlight lingering uncertainties, the potential for future term changes by the US, and a division in Ireland due to differing tariff rates for Northern Ireland and the Republic. German industry groups expressed disappointment, anticipating significant negative effects despite the deal preventing further escalation. Economists warn that these historically high tariffs will likely lead to increased costs for US consumers. This article details the complex implications of the new trade agreement.

          <p>This opinion article condemns the escalating starvation crisis in Gaza, emphasizing the preventable deaths of children due to malnutrition and lack of aid, which it labels as "man-made" and deliberate.

The piece criticizes the global political establishment for its perceived inaction and "performative" rhetoric, asserting that only sustained public protest can apply meaningful pressure to end the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe.

          <p>Shenzhen, China's prominent tech hub, has mandated leniency for innovators whose state-funded projects fail or do not pass evaluation, provided their mistakes do not involve misconduct or abuse of power. These new rules, applicable to all universities, hospitals, and companies receiving government financial aid, aim to encourage bold exploration and reduce accountability for failures stemming from technical difficulties, market changes, or the need to explore new mechanisms. The policy seeks to foster a more risk-tolerant environment for scientific and technological breakthroughs, ensuring that researchers are not penalized or hindered from future funding applications. This article highlights a significant shift in China's innovation strategy.</p>

          <p>Japan's typically stable political landscape is experiencing significant upheaval with the surge of the far-right Sanseito party, which gained substantial seats in recent elections. Influenced by Donald Trump's "America First" rhetoric, Sanseito's "Japan First" slogan resonates with voters frustrated by persistent inflation, high prices, and a sluggish economy, particularly among the youth. The article also highlights the party's focus on immigration, blaming government policies for increased foreign residents, and criticisms of tourist behavior, which are fueling public discontent. Analysts debate whether this populist trend will endure against the long-governing LDP, noting the party's reliance on "gusto over policy."</p>

          <p>White House budget official Russell Vought, a key intellectual driver of Project 2025, downplayed the conservative blueprint's detailed Federal Reserve overhaul, stating President Trump's primary focus is simply on achieving lower interest rates. Project 2025 advocates limiting the Fed's mandate to the sole objective of stable money, yet Vought claimed ignorance of that specific chapter. Trump has publicly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell over interest rates and a building renovation, though Powell's decisions are collaborative and the Fed is self-funded. This article highlights the administration's ongoing pressure on the Fed and the potential for conflict over monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized a bipartisan push to force a House vote on releasing more federal files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, citing concerns for victim protection. However, co-sponsors Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna refuted these claims, asserting their legislation carefully redacts victim names and avoids releasing child pornography. Massie warned that blocking the vote could be a significant political liability for the GOP in the upcoming midterms, especially given the ongoing conspiracy theories among the MAGA base and President Trump's recent deflections on the matter. This article highlights the internal party divisions and political implications surrounding the Epstein files.</p>

          <p>Five Caribbean island nations offer "citizenship by investment" (CBI) programs, granting passports and visa-free access to up to 150 countries for those who buy property or make a donation, starting from $200,000. These programs are experiencing an upsurge in interest, particularly from US citizens seeking an "insurance policy" against political and social volatility at home, alongside significant tax benefits. While criticized by some for potentially "selling identity" and raising international concerns over lax oversight, the islands defend CBI as a vital economic lifeline, contributing significantly to their GDP.
