          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to take effect on August 1. In a letter, President Trump linked the new levy to Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl and cited ongoing trade deficits. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney responded by stating his government will defend its workers and businesses, noting Canada's progress in combating fentanyl trafficking. The move escalates trade tensions despite ongoing negotiations between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration escalated its global trade rhetoric this week, issuing letters that threaten new tariffs on numerous countries if deals are not reached by August 1. The proposed rates range from 25% to 50%, targeting key economies like Japan and Brazil, as well as developing nations in Southeast Asia. A 35% tariff was specifically announced for Canada, while a letter to the European Union is also expected. Despite the widespread threats, global markets have remained largely stable, with analysts anticipating further negotiations or delays.</p>

This success is largely attributed to the popularity of its revamped Model Y, which meets Norwegian consumer demands for space, all-wheel drive, and value. The trend persists even as Tesla faces a backlash in other European markets, partly due to CEO Elon Musk's political activities. A recent survey showed many Norwegians disapprove of Musk's politics, but it has not significantly impacted the company's strong market share.</p>

          <p>An eight-hour standoff in De Beque, Colorado, ended tragically when a male suspect took his own life. The incident began when the man, who had outstanding warrants, allegedly pointed a shotgun at a De Beque marshal. He then barricaded himself in a park gazebo, prompting a significant police response from multiple agencies, building evacuations, and a shelter-in-place order. The standoff concluded after police deployed flashbangs, at which point the suspect died from a self-inflicted wound. Authorities have confirmed there is no ongoing danger to the public.</p>

          <p>Economists are closely watching for the release of China's first-half GDP data, expecting it to reveal whether more fiscal stimulus is necessary to counteract external pressures. While growth is anticipated to meet the 5% annual target, concerns persist about underlying weaknesses in domestic demand and the impact of the U.S. trade war. Many experts, including a central bank adviser, have advocated for a more proactive fiscal policy to stabilize the economy if rising external uncertainties threaten to trigger a downturn.

          <p>The market for electric heavy trucks is expanding rapidly in China, leading to a significant reduction in diesel consumption and denting the country's overall oil demand. Driven by government subsidies and a fast-growing charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have surged 175% in the first half of the year. This boom, primarily in short-haul vehicles, has prompted analysts to revise down diesel demand forecasts and accelerate projections for when China's oil consumption will peak.
