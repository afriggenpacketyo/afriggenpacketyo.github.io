        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent discussions about forming an "Islamic NATO" have intensified after an Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar, which has prompted Gulf states to reconsider their security dependencies on the United States. In response, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council activated a mutual defense clause, and countries like Egypt and Iraq have called for a collective regional security approach. While a formal NATO-style alliance is considered unlikely by experts, a more probable outcome is a "6+2" security arrangement involving the six GCC states plus Turkey and Egypt. This collaboration would focus on collectivizing defense postures and sending a message of deterrence to Israel.</p>

          <p>Shares of Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals, China's largest drugmaker, increased following the announcement of its fifth drug-licensing deal this year, this time with an Indian partner. The agreement grants the Indian firm rights to develop and commercialize trastuzumab rezetecan, a newly approved cancer drug, in various global markets. This move is part of Hengrui's broader strategy to leverage international partnerships to accelerate the global reach of its research and development achievements. The deal includes an upfront payment of $18 million, with potential for over $1 billion more based on performance milestones.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has labeled recent U.S. airstrikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean as an "act of tyranny" and a violation of the principle of proportional force. In an interview, Petro questioned the necessity of using lethal force when vessels could be intercepted and crews arrested, calling the actions "murder." The strikes, which have reportedly killed 17 people, are part of the Trump administration's effort to curb the flow of narcotics into the U.S. The policy has drawn criticism from legal experts and Democratic lawmakers over concerns it may violate international human rights laws.</p>

Following a meeting at the United Nations, Lula is reviving a Brazil-China peace plan and emphasized that the UN should lead the process to regain its international authority. This diplomatic push follows a rare alignment in March when Brazil and China supported a U.S.-led ceasefire initiative at the Security Council. The original six-point plan focused on humanitarian access, prisoner exchanges, and civilian protection.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chery Automobile, China's largest vehicle exporter, jumped 11% during their trading debut in Hong Kong after the company raised $1.2 billion in its initial public offering. The successful IPO reflects the automaker's accelerating expansion into key international markets, including Europe and the Middle East. Analysts note that Chery has been building its global presence by manufacturing in multiple countries, which helps mitigate risks from tariffs imposed by the U.S., Canada, and the EU on Chinese-made electric vehicles. This strategy positions Chery favorably compared to competitors focused solely on exporting from China.</p>

A memo from the Office of Management and Budget suggests using the funding lapse to issue "reduction in force" notices to workers in programs not aligned with the president's priorities. This marks a significant departure from past shutdowns and is seen by critics, like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, as an intimidation tactic.

          <p>The return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following the host's weeklong suspension attracted an estimated 6.26 million broadcast viewers, an audience about four times its season average. The episode, which addressed Kimmel's suspension over comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, also achieved its highest rating in the key 18-49 demographic since 2015. The high viewership came despite the show being preempted by ABC affiliates owned by Nexstar and Sinclair, which cover about 23% of the U.S. market. In his monologue, Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the activist's death.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has claimed he was the victim of "triple sabotage" during his address to the United Nations General Assembly. He cited a series of technical failures, including an escalator that abruptly stopped, a malfunctioning teleprompter, and an audio system failure in the main hall. Trump demanded a UN investigation into the incidents, suggesting they were deliberate acts rather than coincidences and pointing to a news report about UN staff joking about such actions. The UN has stated the escalator issue was likely caused inadvertently by a member of the US delegation.</p>

          <p>Following Jimmy Kimmel's return to ABC, shareholders including the American Federation of Teachers and the AFL-CIO are demanding that The Walt Disney Company disclose the reasons behind his weeklong suspension. In a letter from attorney Roberta Kaplan, the shareholders suggest the board may have breached its fiduciary duties by succumbing to improper political pressure, which coincided with a $4 billion drop in Disney's stock value. The letter threatens a potential derivative lawsuit if the company fails to provide transparency regarding the decision-making process, which followed criticism from the FCC chairman and ABC affiliates.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, a program crucial for hiring skilled foreign workers, causing significant concern within the tech industry and beyond. While the fee currently applies only to future applicants, smaller companies and startups argue it would be crippling, potentially forcing them to relocate operations or halt hiring of foreign talent. The policy has also drawn criticism from other sectors like healthcare, which rely on the program to address workforce shortages. Supporters argue the fee addresses alleged abuses of the program.

          <p>A research team has successfully designed and tested an exhaust system that significantly reduces the intense heat inside nuclear fusion reactors, a major obstacle to creating clean, limitless energy. The study, conducted at the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak-Upgrade facility in England, utilized a "Super-X divertor" with an extended design to cool the plasma before it contacts the reactor walls. This advancement in controlling plasma exhaust is a crucial step toward making fusion energy more practical and commercially viable. Nuclear fusion is a promising carbon-free energy source that does not produce long-lasting radioactive waste.</p>

          <p>A former Riverside County sheriff’s deputy, Oscar Rodriguez, has been sentenced to one year in jail and 10 years of probation for the voluntary manslaughter of his girlfriend's ex-partner. Rodriguez shot and killed 39-year-old Luis Morin in 2014 while on duty, an act initially deemed justified. However, a civil lawsuit revealed Rodriguez was romantically involved with Morin's ex-partner, who had allegedly informed him of Morin's location that night. The district attorney's office had recommended a 10-year sentence and objected to the court's decision, stating it minimized the gravity of the crime.</p>

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck a sparsely populated oil-producing region in western Venezuela on Wednesday, with tremors felt in the capital, Caracas, and neighboring Colombia. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter near the town of Mene Grande at a relatively shallow depth of 7.8 kilometers. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or casualties. While strong earthquakes are not common in Venezuela, approximately 80% of the country's population resides in seismic zones. The last major quake to hit the nation occurred in 1997, resulting in 73 fatalities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Marshals Service has declared Travis Decker, the man accused of killing his three young daughters, to be deceased, prompting prosecutors to move to drop the charges against him. The declaration follows the discovery of human remains in a remote, wooded area in Washington state, which are believed to be Decker's. Decker, a former Army soldier with survival training, had been the subject of a monthslong manhunt after his daughters, ages 5, 8, and 9, were found dead from suffocation at a campsite in May. Local authorities are still awaiting DNA test results to formally confirm the identity of the remains.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly condemned President Trump's recent assertion at the United Nations that climate change is a "hoax," calling the statement "an abomination" and an embarrassment. Speaking during Climate Week in New York, Newsom argued that rejecting climate science is a form of economic self-sabotage that cedes leadership in green technology, like electric vehicles, to China. He defended California's decades of environmental policies as the foundation for its economic success and innovation. Newsom also reiterated his concerns about Trump's leadership, suggesting the president is an authoritarian.</p>
