          <p>A significant power outage impacted Spain and Portugal, causing widespread disruption. The incident halted trains and subways, disrupted traffic signals, and led to store closures and flight delays, affecting millions of people across the Iberian Peninsula. While officials initially remained unsure of the cause, they ruled out a cyberattack. Electricity was gradually restored with assistance from Morocco and France, and authorities continue to investigate the root cause of the outage, with about half the power supply restored by Monday night.

          <p>President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order aimed at cracking down on "sanctuary cities" by threatening to withhold federal funding from jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The order will notify sanctuary cities of their status and give them an opportunity to comply with federal law. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are instructed to pursue legal remedies against non-compliant cities and ensure that those in sanctuary cities do not receive federal public benefits. The move follows Trump's campaign promise to speed up deportations and addresses concerns over crimes allegedly committed by illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities.</p>
