          <p>Top Democratic leaders have formally requested a meeting with President Trump to negotiate a solution for the impending government shutdown, which is set to occur if Congress fails to pass a funding bill by September 30. The request comes after both a Republican-led House bill and a competing Democratic bill failed in the Senate. With the deadline looming, both parties are engaged in a political standoff, accusing the other of being unwilling to negotiate and preparing to assign blame if federal operations cease.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its conflict with so-called sanctuary states, warning California, New York, and Illinois that they could face lawsuits and loss of federal funding for refusing to honor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers. The federal agency claims these state laws, which limit cooperation without a judicial warrant, lead to the release of dangerous criminals into communities. State officials argue they are protecting constitutional rights and fostering trust between law enforcement and immigrant populations.</p>

          <p>Actress Joanna Page, known for her leading role in the sitcom "Gavin and Stacey," has revealed in her new book that she was groped by a television host during a filming session. She recounts that a female producer had warned her beforehand that the host could be "very handsy." Page states that she confronted the individual by hitting his hands and telling him to stop, after which the behavior ceased. The article highlights her reflection on this experience as something that was unfortunately normalized at the time.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has exercised novel powers to prevent U.S. Steel from idling its plant in Granite City, Illinois, thereby securing the jobs of nearly 800 workers. This intervention was made possible by a "golden share" agreement, a condition of the company's recent takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel, which grants the White House veto power over major decisions like plant closures. The move represents a significant assertion of governmental influence over corporate strategy in the name of national and economic security.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats in the UK are advocating for the use of the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for national emergencies like wartime, to tackle the nation's significant asylum application backlog. Their plan includes establishing temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of caseworkers to expedite decisions. The party argues this decisive action is necessary to create a more efficient and humane system while reducing the costly and prolonged use of hotels to house asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of his assassination, conservative Christian nationalist leaders are portraying Charlie Kirk as a martyr for their movement. Figures close to Kirk, including his widow and prominent pastors, are using language of spiritual battle, suggesting his death will serve as an inspiration to advance their political and religious goals. This narrative aligns with Kirk's own later career, during which he increasingly embraced Christian nationalist ideologies that advocate for the United States to be an explicitly Christian nation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market surged to new records this week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both hitting all-time highs, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by a quarter-point. This was the first rate reduction since last December, and central bankers signaled that more cuts could be on the horizon, boosting investor optimism. The positive market sentiment was further supported by major corporate news, including the launch of Apple's new iPhones and a strategic partnership between Nvidia and Intel.

Lewinsky highlighted the significant cultural shift in understanding issues of power dynamics, consent, and misogyny, which has allowed for a more empathetic reconsideration of her past and the experiences of other women.</p>
