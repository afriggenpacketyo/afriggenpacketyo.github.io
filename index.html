          <p>According to royal expert Hilary Fordwich, King Charles is reportedly finding it difficult to trust Prince Harry after his recent interviews and public airing of private family matters. Fordwich claims that Harry's behavior violates royal norms and basic decency, causing irreparable harm and alienating him from his family and the British public. Despite missing his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet, Charles is said to be constrained by legal and constitutional boundaries, with little optimism for reconciliation among royal circles. Another expert, Helena Chard, labeled Harry the "Duke of Delusions," stating that Charles has been forced to cut contact due to broken trust.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers from Tsinghua and Beihang universities have engineered the world's smallest and lightest wireless robot, which can morph its shape for both land and air travel. Inspired by Lego, the microrobot utilizes a "morphable actuator" to convert energy into force, making it suitable for complex environments such as disaster rescue operations. According to the research team, this new actuator design could also be applied to create medical devices and components for virtual and augmented reality, showcasing its versatility. Study author Zhang Yihui noted that their robot has the smallest size, lightest weight, and fastest ground movement speed compared to other known wireless land-air robots.</p>

          <p>A new UN report indicates that global development progress slowed in 2024, raising concerns about potential setbacks in recent gains, with Iceland topping the Human Development Index. The report, released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), highlights that despite a post-COVID-19 rebound by 2023, recovery is losing momentum due to stalled life expectancy and income growth, coupled with rising conflicts. UNDP chief Achim Steiner cautioned that this slowdown could reverse decades of progress, making the world less secure and more vulnerable to economic and ecological shocks. The report also notes that cuts to international aid, particularly led by the United States under President Donald Trump, will exacerbate these issues.</p>

Ministers believe there is a significant issue with individuals legally entering the UK on work or study visas and subsequently filing asylum claims.

          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and the imposition of significant tariffs on Chinese goods, experts believe that Temu and Shein will continue to be dominant forces in the U.S. e-commerce market. The de minimis rule, which exempted U.S. imports worth $800 from trade tariffs, has been closed for shipments from China, exposing Temu and Shein to duties as high as 120%. However, e-commerce and supply chain experts suggest that the companies are agile and have contingency plans in place, such as accelerating localization strategies and onboarding goods from American sellers. Deborah Weinswig, CEO of Coresight Research, believes that America's e-commerce game has been accelerating in favor of Temu and Shein.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a surge after the company reported a lower-than-feared decline in first-quarter sales and reaffirmed its full-year guidance despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainty. The high-end German retailer reported a 2% revenue decline on a currency-adjusted basis, totaling 999 million euros ($1.13 billion), slightly surpassing the 979 million euros forecast by analysts. Weaker sales were attributed to soft demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, due to uncertain consumer outlook. CEO Daniel Grieder stated that the company is closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and remains vigilant in light of elevated uncertainties, including current tariff discussions.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's Champions League fate may hinge on which version of Gianluigi Donnarumma they face when they play Paris St-Germain. The article questions whether Arsenal will face the shot-stopper extraordinaire or the error-prone flapper. Arsenal have to score at Parc des Princes or they are out, and it probably does not help them that Donnarumma's form has improved at the same rate the rest of the PSG team has during their thrilling Champions League campaign. His supposed weaknesses have lingered longer in PSG's domestic season, however, with another mistake coming in their loss at Nice last week which ended their hopes of an unbeaten Ligue 1 campaign with only four games to go.</p>

          <p>Ferrari is facing challenges in the current F1 season, with the car not performing as expected compared to last year, and the team lagging behind McLaren. The team struggled to get the best out of new tires during qualifying for the Miami Grand Prix. There are "some small upgrades" coming at the next two races in Imola and Monaco, and the team hopes that stricter rules on front wing deflection that are being introduced at the subsequent race in Spain will make a difference. Despite the challenges, Ferrari remains confident that they can make progress with upgrades, as they have in previous seasons.</p>

          <p>Germany is expected to shift its policy toward Russia as Friedrich Merz assumes the chancellorship, succeeding Olaf Scholz. Merz, from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), holds a more hawkish stance on Russia and supports sending German-made Taurus long-range missiles to Kyiv. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul shares this view, describing Russia as Europe's most acute threat. Germany also plans to increase military spending to address a depleted military and potential reductions in US security commitments under President Trump. Boris Pistorius, the Defense Minister, has called for the country to become "war ready" by 2029 amid fears of Russian expansionism.</p>
