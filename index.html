          <p>Tesla's stock value decreased by approximately 8% following CEO Elon Musk's announcement of his intention to form a new political party called the "America Party." Investors have previously shown concern over Musk's political engagements, and this new venture is renewing anxieties about his focus being diverted from the company during a critical period. Analysts note that while core supporters remain loyal, many investors feel a sense of exhaustion with Musk's political activities. The move has also drawn criticism from President Donald Trump, adding to the pressures on Tesla, which is already facing declining car deliveries and increased competition.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich is navigating a difficult period following their quarterfinal loss to Paris St. Germain in the Club World Cup and a severe injury to star player Jamal Musiala, who will be sidelined for months. The team's performance has raised concerns, highlighting a lack of offensive sharpness and struggles in recent top-tier European matches. Musiala's absence exacerbates the club's difficulties in the transfer market, where they have failed to secure key targets like Florian Wirtz and Nico Williams. These setbacks are placing significant pressure on sporting director Max Eberl and coach Vincent Kompany to strengthen the squad and improve results.</p>

          <h2>Tennessee Representative Mark Green's Resignation Further Narrows Republican House Majority</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 10:31:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Representative Mark Green of Tennessee has officially resigned from Congress, reducing the Republican majority in the House to 219-212. This move, while anticipated, intensifies the challenges for House Speaker Mike Johnson, who now has even less room for defections when passing legislation. Green, who chaired the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is leaving public office to start a private business focused on helping the U.S. compete against the Chinese Communist Party. His departure underscores the precarious nature of the slim GOP majority as they navigate key legislative priorities in a divided chamber.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in the Texas Hill Country have led to the deaths of at least 82 people, with dozens more still missing. The disaster heavily impacted Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, where at least 27 campers and counselors were killed after the Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed. The victims include young children, and extensive search and rescue operations are underway involving helicopters and specialized teams. President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration for Kerr County, as officials grapple with the immense scale of the tragedy and the ongoing effort to locate all missing individuals.</p>

This strategic move is set to bolster CoreWeave's position in the competitive AI sector by integrating critical infrastructure, including 1.3 gigawatts of data center capacity. The acquisition will eliminate significant future lease obligations for CoreWeave and provide it with greater control over its power and real estate assets. Core Scientific shareholders will receive CoreWeave shares, owning less than 10% of the combined entity after the deal closes in late 2025.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to extend statutory bereavement leave to parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks, forcing many to use sick leave for what is a period of grief. The proposed change would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, recognizing the emotional toll of early pregnancy loss as a bereavement rather than an illness. Campaigners and politicians have praised the move as a significant step forward in acknowledging the profound grief associated with miscarriage and ending a long-held societal taboo.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve meeting in July, savers are weighing whether to lock in a certificate of deposit (CD) rate now or wait for potential changes. While a rate cut this month is unlikely, future cuts are anticipated later in the year, which could lead banks to lower their CD yields soon. Experts suggest that savers with adequate liquid emergency funds should consider opening a CD now to secure currently high rates for their specific financial goals. They also recommend strategies like CD laddering, which involves opening multiple CDs with different maturity dates to diversify against future interest rate fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global copper market is confronting a potential crisis as demand, driven by clean energy technologies, is projected to double by 2050 while supply lags. This supply-demand gap is exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, including potential U.S. tariffs, prompting nations like Australia to prioritize sovereign access to the critical mineral. Australia holds the world's second-largest copper reserves, but accessing deeper, lower-grade ore bodies presents significant challenges. Innovators are developing new hydrometallurgical technologies to make these resources economically viable, which could bolster Australia's domestic processing capabilities and supply chain independence.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to communication experts, an effective apology from a leader requires taking full responsibility, demonstrating genuine empathy, and presenting a clear plan for rectification. The timing of an apology is critical; waiting too long can suggest a lack of care, while speaking too quickly without a plan can erode credibility. Leaders should avoid sounding scripted or emotionless and instead show vulnerability to build trust. The analysis comes in the context of public apologies from corporate CEOs, highlighting that a sincere, human approach is more impactful than a polished but impersonal brand statement.</p>

          <p>Netflix continues to attract elite Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese, Greta Gerwig, and Kathryn Bigelow, even though it largely forgoes wide theatrical releases for its films. The streaming giant accomplishes this by offering lucrative contracts, significant creative freedom, and access to its massive global subscriber base of over 300 million. It has also become a sanctuary for auteur-driven projects with large budgets or risky genres that traditional studios might pass on. By prioritizing its streaming audience and saving millions on theatrical marketing, Netflix has built a successful model that challenges conventional Hollywood distribution strategies.</p>

From nonstick pans and food packaging to clothing and cleaning supplies, plastic is ubiquitous, and its degraded particles have been found throughout the environment and within the human body. After receiving inconclusive blood test results for plastic-related chemicals, the author consults an expert who provides practical advice for reducing exposure, such as using natural-fiber products and avoiding processed foods.
