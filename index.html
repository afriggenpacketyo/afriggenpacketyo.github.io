          <p>The second Trump administration is facing increased criticism for allegedly disregarding ethical norms and legal guardrails, raising concerns about potential corruption. Examples include accepting a luxury jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One and later as a fixture in Trumpâ€™s personal presidential library, promoting a meme cryptocurrency that enriches his family, and pressuring law firms for donations. Additionally, the administration has reportedly disbanded a Justice Department unit investigating cryptocurrency crimes and narrowed enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These actions highlight the openness with which the president and his associates are leveraging his position for personal benefit. </p>

          <p>Shares of ImmunityBio Inc. experienced a significant increase due to positive investor sentiment fueled by the company's recent earnings report. ImmunityBio narrowed its net loss and saw a substantial rise in revenues, driven by the strong performance of its immunotherapy treatment, Anktiva, for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The company is experiencing steady growth as urological practices increase their use of Anktiva, especially in rural areas where patients previously lacked access to such treatments. This expansion opens up new markets for ImmunityBio's therapies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is heavily investing in AI-powered humanoid robots to revolutionize its manufacturing sector, aiming to maintain its economic growth and global manufacturing dominance. The government is providing substantial subsidies and support to humanoid robot firms, with over $20 billion allocated to the sector and a $137 billion fund established for AI and robotics startups. Chinese companies are rapidly developing increasingly agile and capable humanoid robots, leveraging AI and data collection to create robots that can perform various tasks in factories and elderly care facilities.

          <p>Donald Trump's offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan has put India in a difficult position, as it has historically opposed third-party mediation. Trump announced a ceasefire brokered by the US and expressed willingness to find a solution to the long-standing dispute. Pakistan welcomed Trump's comments, while India views this as an attempt to internationalize the Kashmir issue. India has maintained a firm stance against terrorism and has refused direct talks with Pakistan, making Trump's offer a contentious issue in the region.</p>

          <p>A recent auction of the Riggio family's art collection at Christie's in New York showed signs of a cooling art market, with many objects presold and little enthusiastic bidding. Experts attributed the subdued sale to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. While the collection totaled $272 million, it fell short of pre-sale expectations. The top lot, a Mondrian painting, sold for $47.6 million, less than the previous record for a Mondrian. The 20th Century Evening Sale fared slightly better, but the withdrawal of a major Warhol painting highlighted weakness in that market.</p>

          <p>Australia's Liberal Party has elected Sussan Ley as its first female leader, following a historic election loss. Ley, from the moderate faction, takes over from Peter Dutton after the party suffered a significant defeat attributed to polarizing leaders and policies. Ley has pledged to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, particularly women and younger voters. The appointment comes as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was sworn in, following his Labor Party's landslide election win.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have proposed significant restrictions on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), aiming to limit its funding and benefits as part of a broader package to advance President Trump's tax cuts. The proposal would require states to contribute funding and impose stricter work requirements on beneficiaries, potentially affecting millions of low-income families. Republicans argue this will improve program efficiency and control costs, while critics warn it would deepen hunger and poverty. The proposed changes are likely to face strong opposition from Democrats and anti-poverty groups.</p>

          <p>A shortage of air traffic controllers at the Philadelphia facility managing Newark Liberty International Airport's air traffic caused significant flight delays, with some flights delayed by up to seven hours. As few as three controllers were scheduled to work during peak hours, far below the target of 14. The FAA has been grappling with equipment and technology failures, runway construction, and staffing limitations, leading to recent disruptions. The Transportation Secretary blamed the Biden administration for 'bungling' the move of air traffic management from Long Island to Philadelphia.</p>

          <p>A Democratic National Committee (DNC) panel has recommended redoing the elections for party vice-chair, including David Hogg's, due to alleged violations of the party's charter during the February election. The resolution comes amid controversy surrounding Hogg's efforts to primary some Democratic politicians. Kalyn Free, who lost to Hogg, alleges that the DNC improperly combined questions and tallied votes, giving male candidates an advantage. DNC Chair Ken Martin expressed disappointment and expects DNC members to resolve the matter fairly.</p>

          <p>A scientist warns that proposed cuts by the Trump administration would eliminate funding for NOAA's global CO2 program, ending decades of unbroken data collection. This data is crucial for projecting the impacts of climate change. The NOAA program collects air samples from around the world to monitor CO2 levels, continuing work started by Professor Charles David Keeling in the 1960s. The scientist likened turning off the program to 'turning off the headlights on a dark street at night'.</p>

          <p>China and ASEAN are working to strengthen security cooperation by addressing trust deficits, with Cambodia recently allowing foreign warships from multiple nations to access its Ream naval base. This move is seen as an effort to demonstrate inclusivity and dispel presumptions that the base is exclusively Chinese. Beijing has outlined a new security doctrine emphasizing regional ownership of Asian affairs and peaceful dispute resolution. For this vision to foster lasting trust, China must prioritize openness, consistency, and multilateral dialogue.</p>

          <p>Severe air pollution is increasingly obscuring views of the Himalayas, even during traditionally clear months, impacting tourism in Nepal and India. Haze, formed by pollutants like dust and smoke, is becoming more intense and lasting longer due to climate change. This has led to a decrease in business for trekking guides and disappointment for tourists. Scientists say hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, with weather conditions trapping pollutants and limiting air movement.</p>
