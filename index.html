            <p>Trump administration border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, alleged MS-13 member, under the Alien Enemies Act. Homan criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen's visit to Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, arguing the administration followed the law and Constitution. Van Hollen, however, maintains that Abrego Garcia's due process rights were violated, as the Supreme Court has ordered the government to "facilitate" his return. Homan argued the Alien Enemies Act allows for a different level of due process, while also denying that tattoos are the sole determinant of gang membership. Optimism Score: 40</p>

            <p>The Israeli military admitted to "professional failures" after killing 15 Palestinian paramedics in Gaza last month, citing breaches of orders and an operational misunderstanding. An internal investigation found no evidence of executions but acknowledged an "operational misunderstanding" and "breach of orders" contributed to the deaths. A commanding officer will be reprimanded, and a deputy commander dismissed; the probe also claimed six of the victims were Hamas members, a claim Hamas denies. This comes amidst growing international scrutiny of Israel's actions toward aid workers in Gaza. Optimism Score: 20</p>

            <p>A study by the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine found that jet lag is worse when traveling east due to disrupting the body's circadian rhythm. Analyzing data from Oura ring users, researchers discovered that while sleep duration recovers quickly, sleep timing can take over a week to adjust, especially when traveling eastward. Younger adults also experience more severe effects, and factors like early morning flights and in-flight sleep contribute to sleep disturbance. Future research will assess lifestyle factors and potential remedies like light exposure and melatonin. Optimism Score: 65</p>
