          <p>The United States has deployed stealth bombers to the Pacific region amid escalating tensions with Iran. Simultaneously, the Israeli military reported its navy targeted a Hezbollah "infrastructure site" near Naqoura in southern Lebanon, allegedly used by the "Radwan Force" to launch attacks against Israeli civilians. Separately, the Israeli air force eliminated a Hezbollah militant near Baraashit. Lebanon's National News Agency reported one person was killed in an Israeli drone strike on a motorcycle in the same region, with both sides accusing each other of ceasefire violations, as Lebanon's army dismantles Hezbollah infrastructure as part of the truce. The ongoing violations could lead the Lebanese military to halt cooperation on site inspections. Optimism regarding regional stability is low given the increasing military activity.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has challenged Vice President JD Vance to a debate following Vance's remarks in Los Angeles criticizing Newsom's policies and accusing him of endangering law enforcement. Newsom's communications director, Izzy Gardon, refuted Vance's claims, calling him "a liar" and providing examples of Newsom's condemnation of violence against law enforcement. Vance's team has yet to respond to Newsom's challenge. The exchange highlights the growing political tensions between California and the Trump administration, especially concerning law enforcement and immigration policies.

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian rights activist, has arrived in New Jersey following a federal judge's order for his release from ICE detention in Louisiana. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for over 100 days, sparking protests and discussions about free speech. Upon arrival, Khalil affirmed his commitment to advocating for Palestinian rights and criticized the Trump administration for punishing his political speech. Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled that Khalil was not a flight risk or danger to the community, denouncing the government's actions as an attempt to punish Khalil for his anti-Israel stance, and the arrest of Khalil set off a series of protests.</p>

Garcia was released from a federal detention center, with no charges filed yet. He claims agents assumed he was undocumented and did not ask for identification, and he also encountered another US citizen, Adrian Martinez, who was arrested for intervening in the arrest of a man cleaning a shopping center, and the incident raises concerns about potential profiling and overreach by federal agents.</p>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed has criticized President Trump's dismissal of his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. Reed suggests Trump's rejection is politically motivated, potentially to justify a future attack against Iran. He emphasizes that if the intelligence chief, Tulsi Gabbard, made a false statement, it should be corrected immediately, not just after Israeli activity. Reed's remarks highlight the growing tension between the Trump administration and the intelligence community regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Judge Indira Talwani struck down a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities at 15%, deeming the move arbitrary and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would cost it nearly $100 million annually. The ruling follows similar blocks on caps placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health, ensuring critical research in various technology fields continues uninterrupted. This decision protects vital research funding.</p>

          <p>New court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was a doomsday "prepper" who instructed his family to "prepare for war." Boelter's wife told investigators they were preppers and that he had given her a "bailout plan" in case of exigent circumstances. Law enforcement found empty rifle cases and gun-cleaning supplies in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffmans released a statement recounting the terrifying attack, highlighting the risks associated with public service. The evidence paints a picture of a man preparing for a catastrophic event.</p>
