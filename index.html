          <h2>Scientific Research Increasingly Focuses on Unique Aspects of Female Athletes' Bodies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 19:55:30 EDT</div>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, shifting away from treating female athletes as mere variations of men. Researchers are now intensely studying the unique ways the female body is affected by elite competition, providing new insights into performance and health. Topics include how breast biomechanics and proper sports bras can impact running efficiency, the nuanced effects of the menstrual cycle on performance and anxiety, and why female athletes face a higher risk of certain injuries like ACL tears. This growing body of knowledge is not only enhancing elite performance but also helping to address issues like body image and period-related concerns, which cause many young girls to drop out of sports, fostering greater participation and well-being.</p>

Investors are advised to watch for the Federal Reserve's meeting, where Chair Jerome Powell is expected to address tariff-driven inflation and express caution. The week also features the latest nonfarm payroll report and a packed earnings schedule from major technology companies, including Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.

          <h2>Grieving Family Sues Funeral Homes After Son's Brain Was Sent in Leaking Box</h2>

          <p>A family is suing two funeral homes after allegedly receiving their deceased son's brain in an unmarked, leaking cardboard box, a discovery the father described as overwhelming and horrific. The lawsuit claims that after the son's remains were shipped from Georgia to Pennsylvania, the family was given the box, which later began to smell and leak fluid identified as brain matter. The family's attorney states that this negligent mishandling of human remains has caused severe emotional distress, as the parents' last memory is now of holding their son's brain. The lawsuit seeks compensation and answers, hoping to prevent similar incidents from happening to other families in the future.</p>

          <p>Former MasterChef host Gregg Wallace has issued an apology to anyone he may have hurt, while insisting he is "not a groper, a sex pest or a flasher." His statement follows his dismissal from the show after an inquiry substantiated 45 allegations regarding his behavior, including unwelcome physical contact and inappropriate comments. Wallace attributed some of his behavior to his background and a recent autism diagnosis, a claim that drew criticism from disability charities. He also defended his former co-host, John Torode, who was also fired over an allegation of using racist language, stating that Torode is not a racist, though he admitted the two never got along well.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has been cut short after President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, stated that Hamas's response showed a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire." The talks have been deadlocked over Hamas's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war in exchange for releasing all hostages. Amid the diplomatic stalemate, the humanitarian crisis is worsening, with the United Nations warning that children in Gaza are starving to death. UNICEF reported a 180% increase in acute malnourishment among children since February, and multiple aid agencies stress that Israeli restrictions are severely impeding the delivery of essential food and supplies.</p>

          <p>As the United Nations warns of a deepening starvation crisis in Gaza, a BBC Verify analysis of aid boxes distributed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised concerns about their nutritional value. Aid experts who examined the contents, which primarily consist of dried goods like pasta and lentils, state the boxes lack essential vitamins and minerals. One professor described the provisions as providing a "full stomach but an empty diet," which could lead to 'hidden hunger' and diseases like anemia and scurvy over time. The reliance on these food items is further complicated by severe shortages of clean water and fuel needed for cooking, exacerbating the humanitarian disaster.</p>

The national debt currently stands at over $36 trillion and has grown annually since 2001 under both Democratic and Republican administrations. While the gesture is largely symbolic, as public donations since 1996 have amounted to a fraction of government spending, it offers a novel way for citizens to contribute directly to the nation's finances.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals judge has again blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or on a temporary basis. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin ruled that a previously issued nationwide injunction against the policy can remain in place, citing it as an exception to a recent Supreme Court decision limiting such broad injunctions. The Trump administration argues that these children are not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the U.S. and thus not entitled to citizenship under the 14th Amendment. The ruling marks another legal setback for the administration on this issue, which is ultimately expected to be decided by the Supreme Court.</p>

The analysis highlighted nonverbal cues suggesting significant tension and disagreement, particularly when Trump misstated the cost of the project. Experts noted Powell's sharp glare, prolonged eye-shuttering, and head-shaking as strong indicators of disapproval and a desire to block out false information. Trump's actions, such as removing his hard hat while Powell spoke and patting him forcefully on the back, were interpreted as gestures of control and dismissal, underscoring the strained relationship between the two powerful figures.</p>

The article posits that the genre, by casting a diverse range of ordinary people, can foster social understanding and offer viewers a glimpse into perspectives outside their own experiences. Shows have been credited with raising awareness about health conditions, disabilities like Tourette's syndrome, and complex social issues such as coercive control. While acknowledging the serious negative impacts on some participants, which have led to industry changes, the analysis argues that reality TV can spark important national conversations and even positively influence viewer behavior.</p>

Konyndyk argues that the current aid system, managed by the GHF, is ineffective and that Israel is indisputably using starvation as a weapon of war to pressure Hamas.

          <p>Two high-ranking officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) who led the investigation into the 2019 "Sharpiegate" scandal have been placed on administrative leave. The officials, Jeff Dillen and Stephen Volz, had found that the former NOAA chief violated scientific integrity by altering a hurricane forecast to align with President Trump's incorrect statements. The move has fueled speculation of political retaliation, as it comes just before the same former chief, Neil Jacobs, is set to have a confirmation hearing for his reappointment to lead the agency. NOAA has denied the connection, attributing the leaves to unrelated performance issues, but the timing has raised alarm among former officials and current staff.</p>

          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche for nine hours over two days, answering questions about approximately 100 different people. According to sources, Maxwell initiated the meetings and was granted a limited form of proffer immunity, which prevents her responses from being used against her in court. Her attorney stated that she answered every question and did not hold back, though no specific promises were made in return for her cooperation. The high-level meetings are highly unusual and come as the Justice Department faces pressure to release more information about Jeffrey Epstein and his network of high-profile associates.</p>

          <p>Bill Essayli, the interim U.S. attorney for the Los Angeles region, has drawn significant criticism for using his powerful office to advance a partisan, pro-Trump agenda, leading to a campaign to block his permanent appointment. Since his appointment in April, Essayli has aggressively pursued federal lawsuits challenging California's sanctuary city and transgender athlete protection policies, and has prioritized charging pro-immigration protesters. His tenure has been marked by mass departures of career prosecutors, low morale, and accusations that his actions are politically motivated rather than aimed at public safety.

          <p>Taiwan is holding a large-scale and controversial recall vote, known as the "dabamian," targeting over 30 lawmakers, primarily from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party, who are accused of being too close to China. The vote was initiated by a civic movement that emerged after the KMT-dominated legislature blocked government bills and passed contentious legislation, which critics believe is influenced by Beijing. The outcome has the potential to shift the balance of power in the deadlocked parliament. The issue has deeply divided Taiwanese society, with both pro-recall and anti-recall camps holding large rallies, each claiming to be defending the island's democracy.</p>
