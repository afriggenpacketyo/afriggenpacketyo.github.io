          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly addressed the Iranian people, offering to share Israel's advanced water technology to solve their nation's severe water crisis. This offer is conditional on the removal of the current Iranian regime, which Netanyahu described as tyrannical. The message links a tangible humanitarian benefit directly to political change, framing it as an opportunity for Iranians to improve their daily lives by seeking freedom. This statement comes amid heightened tensions and recent military conflict between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave plummeted by 20% following the release of its second-quarter financial results, which revealed a wider-than-anticipated loss. The company reported an adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, exceeding analyst expectations. This stock decline coincides with the upcoming expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more volatility as insiders become eligible to sell their shares. Despite the loss, CoreWeave raised its full-year revenue guidance, citing that strong demand for AI infrastructure continues to outpace supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon has significantly expanded its same-day delivery service to include fresh groceries like produce, meat, and dairy in 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. The service, free for Prime members on orders over $25, aims to create a one-stop shop for a wide range of customer needs, from household goods to electronics. This major expansion positions Amazon to compete more directly with services like Instacart and Walmart+. The company plans to extend the service to an additional 2,300 locations by the end of 2025, reflecting the high demand for convenient grocery options.</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk, meat, and frozen foods, effective immediately. This benefit, previously limited to produce and seasonal food items, will now apply to 95% of store products for its 1.6 million U.S. employees. The move comes as rising tariffs spark concerns about higher consumer prices, which Walmart's CFO has acknowledged the company cannot fully absorb. The expanded discount aims to alleviate financial pressure on its workforce and may also boost employee retention and spending at its stores.</p>

She was, however, convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol and sentenced to one year of probation. The defense successfully argued that Read was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, a claim that gained significant public attention. The verdict concludes a lengthy and contentious legal battle that included a previous mistrial due to a hung jury and intense scrutiny of the police investigation.</p>

          <p>A divided federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to suspend or terminate billions of dollars in foreign aid appropriated by Congress. The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturns a lower court's injunction that had previously restored the funding. The majority found that the grant recipients challenging the freeze did not have the legal standing for the court to hear their claims. The ruling affects nearly $4 billion for USAID global health programs and over $6 billion for HIV/AIDS initiatives, which President Trump has criticized as wasteful.</p>

While Tuesday's Consumer Price Index report was benign, experts from firms like JPMorgan Chase and UBS anticipate a gradual rise in prices as companies pass on higher costs. They predict this could add up to 1.5% to inflation and subtract 1% from GDP growth. Despite this, most economists believe the Federal Reserve will still proceed with interest rate cuts, viewing the inflation spike as temporary and prioritizing a deteriorating labor market.

The move fits a pattern of attacking cities perceived as not being part of the 'real' America, playing on racist associations of urban centers with disorder.

          <p>California officials are warning that a Trump administration proposal to bar undocumented immigrants from federally funded programs would have devastating consequences. They argue the ban would harm not only immigrants but also U.S. citizens, including the children of immigrants and homeless individuals lacking documentation. Programs like Head Start could face closure, and the state's emergency healthcare system would be strained. Officials filed declarations in federal court stating the new rules would have an immediate 'chilling effect,' forcing vulnerable families to forgo vital healthcare, education, and nutritional support.</p>

          <p>A European Commission plan to impose penalties on Israel over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza remains stalled due to a lack of consensus among EU member states. The proposal, which would bar Israeli startups from accessing EU research funds, was introduced in response to what the EU calls violations of human rights in Gaza. However, key members like Germany are requesting more time for review, preventing the necessary majority for approval. The deadlock highlights the bloc's internal divisions on how to respond to the conflict, drawing criticism from human rights groups who accuse the EU of failing to use its leverage.</p>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to a new estimate from the Senior Citizens League. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase retirees received for 2025. The Social Security Administration determines the annual COLA each fall to ensure benefits keep pace with inflation, with the official announcement scheduled for October. While inflation has remained relatively stable in 2025, some economists express concern that a moderate COLA might not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year.

          <p>President Trump's nomination of E. J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics has sparked fears of political interference with crucial economic data. Antoni, a Heritage Foundation economist who contributed to Project 2025, was chosen after Trump fired the previous director for producing 'bad numbers.' Critics, including conservative economists, point to Antoni's thin credentials and ideological alignment as signs that the nonpartisan agency could be compromised. This move is seen as part of a trend toward authoritarian practices, where statistics are manipulated for political purposes, potentially eroding investor confidence in U.S. economic data.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump appeared unconcerned by a report that Russia was involved in hacking the U.S. federal court's electronic document system. When questioned about the breach, Trump responded, 'Are you surprised?' and commented that hacking is what Russia does, adding that the U.S. is 'actually better at it.' The breach, which reportedly compromised sealed records, was revealed just days before Trump's scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Trump stated that he 'could' bring up the incident during their discussion.</p>

This upgrade is part of Poland's massive defense spending initiative aimed at modernizing its armed forces to counter threats from Russia. The move ensures the F-16s will remain potent and interoperable with the new F-35s Poland is acquiring, bolstering its role within NATO.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning that sunscreen products in mousse form, including popular brands like Supergoop! and Vacation Inc., may not be effective at protecting against UV rays.

Furthermore, the FDA highlighted a safety risk, noting that the products are often packaged in containers resembling whipped cream, which could lead to accidental ingestion.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has canceled nearly half a billion dollars in grants for mRNA vaccine research, a move seen as part of a 'COVID-revenge' campaign. This action reflects the administration's broader effort to undermine policies and technologies from the pandemic response, leveraging public anger and skepticism about COVID-19. Critics fear this assault on mRNA technology, justified by controversial research, could extend beyond COVID shots to hinder development of therapies for cancer and other diseases. The administration has also dismissed key scientific advisors and committee members who shaped previous COVID policies.</p>
