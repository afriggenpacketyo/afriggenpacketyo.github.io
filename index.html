            <p>Iran's foreign minister has stated the country's desire for a "fair agreement" as talks with the United States regarding its nuclear program are set to begin in Oman. These discussions mark the highest-level engagement between the two nations since President Trump took office, although it remains uncertain whether direct negotiations will occur. Iran emphasizes that the talks will be "indirect" and focused solely on the nuclear program, with the goal of reaching a mutually respectful and equitable understanding. The Iranian delegation consists of experts experienced in negotiating on this specific issue.</p>

            <p>Financial markets are experiencing a wider and more volatile sell-off, raising concerns that aggressive and changing trade policies from Washington could be damaging the long-term financial standing of the U.S. The dollar and Treasuries are sliding, deviating from their typical flight-to-safety behavior. Analysts suggest this could indicate a structural shift away from the dollar as the world's global reserve currency, with investors actively turning away from U.S. assets. This trend could have real economic impacts, particularly for companies with significant foreign sales and potentially leading to anti-American sentiment.</p>

            <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has proposed a $1,000 property tax rebate for homeowners, but the Florida House of Representatives is pushing back with a plan to permanently lower the state sales tax. DeSantis argues the sales tax reduction would benefit tourists more than residents. Senate President Ben Albritton has suggested permanently cutting sales tax on clothing and shoes under $75. The debate highlights the challenges of providing tax relief while ensuring adequate funding for vital public services in Florida, which relies heavily on property taxes due to the absence of a state income tax.</p>

            <p>Rising tariff rates on U.S. imports are impacting countries like Vietnam, where foreign direct investment has increased as firms seek to manage risks associated with production in China. President Trump's tariff policy has led to concerns that some of Vietnam's rising exports to the U.S. may actually be Chinese products rerouted to evade higher tariff rates. This practice is seen as part of a larger game of global supply chain adjustments in response to trade pressures. The situation highlights the complex interplay of international trade and tariff policies.</p>

            <p>A recent audit by Wisconsin's Legislative Audit Bureau (WLAB) revealed that state agencies and the University of Wisconsin system failed to specifically track spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. This lack of tracking forced WLAB to estimate the institutions' spending on these programs. The University of Wisconsin was already scaling back its DEI efforts after a deal with Republican legislators. The audits also found inconsistencies in reporting and action on noncompliance related to DEI efforts.</p>

            <p>President Trump's governing style, characterized by erratic decision-making, disregard for convention, and constant public engagements, has drawn criticism, particularly in the face of economic turmoil. His decision to impose sweeping tariffs, followed by golfing and dining with donors while markets suffered losses, has been compared to the actions of historical figures like Nero. Critics argue that Trump's detachment from the anxieties of ordinary people and his tendency to act without consulting experts demonstrate a lack of concern for the consequences of his policies.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies are sparking debate over the balance between preserving American jobs and providing affordable goods to consumers. While tariffs could potentially protect jobs in specific industries by discouraging imports, U.S. consumers would likely bear the cost through higher prices. Economic analysis suggests that regions heavily exposed to import competition from China have suffered manufacturing job losses, but other Americans have benefited from more affordable goods.

            <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for arresting and detaining protesters who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, justifying the actions by labeling them as "Hamas supporters" without evidence. This approach appears to align with Project Esther, a Heritage Foundation plan advocating for the deportation of student visa and green-card holders critical of Israel and the use of anti-racketeering laws to break up pro-Palestinian groups. Critics argue that this strategy conflates support for Palestinian rights with support for Hamas and undermines constitutional protections, potentially increasing antisemitism.</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences, a biotechnology company, announced the "de-extinction" of the dire wolf, but experts at the La Brea Tar Pits, home to a vast collection of dire wolf fossils, are skeptical. The company used gene editing to create pups with genetic traits similar to dire wolves. While acknowledging the incredible technology, experts at La Brea Tar Pits emphasize that the animals are genetically engineered gray wolves rather than true dire wolves. They also highlight the importance of focusing on conservation efforts for endangered species.</p>

            <p>President Trump has appointed William "Billy" Marshall, the head of the West Virginia corrections department, to lead the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Marshall inherits an agency plagued by staffing shortages and scandal. During Marshall's tenure in West Virginia, the state's prisons faced a staffing crisis and scrutiny for squalid conditions and excessive use of force. The Bureau of Prisons also faces infrastructure challenges and has struggled to hire staff. Observers are cautiously optimistic about Marshall's appointment but express concerns about his lack of federal experience.</p>

The CEO, Jeff Bowman, decided to sell the product before tariffs increased to 145%. Bowman expresses a lack of confidence in the competence of the U.S. administration. The company could have sold three times the amount because Chinese customers have no idea what is going to happen with tariffs.</p>

Researchers tested crows' ability to identify outlier shapes in a group, finding that they could consistently recognize differences in quadrilaterals based on their geometric properties. These findings suggest that the geometric abilities of humans may build upon precursor capabilities more prevalent in the animal kingdom than previously believed. This opens new avenues for investigating mathematical skills in other species.</p>
