          <p>Republican governors from West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio are deploying National Guard troops to Washington D.C. at the request of the Trump administration. The move is part of a broader effort by the White House to address what it describes as a crisis of crime and homelessness in the nation's capital. This deployment has been met with significant opposition from local officials, including D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who views the increased federal presence as a test of the city's limited self-governance and a challenge to American democracy.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin underwent a process known as rapid intensification, strengthening from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 hurricane in just over 24 hours. This phenomenon occurs when a storm's wind speeds increase by more than 58 miles per hour within a day, fueled by conditions like low wind shear and exceptionally warm ocean waters. Experts note that climate change is making such events more common by raising sea surface temperatures, which complicates forecasting and emergency preparedness for government agencies as storms can become dangerously powerful with little warning.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched to the White House to protest President Trump's declaration of a "crime emergency" and the deployment of National Guard troops in Washington D.C. The protest followed an attempt by the administration to appoint an emergency police commissioner, which was blocked by a federal lawsuit. Marchers expressed concern over what they see as a federal overreach and a threat to the city's home rule, challenging the administration's portrayal of D.C. as a crime-ridden area.

          <p>After rapidly intensifying into a Category 5 storm, Hurricane Erin has weakened slightly to a Category 4, with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph. The hurricane's center is forecast to remain at sea, passing north of the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico without making landfall on the continental U.S. While the storm is not expected to directly impact the East Coast, its outer bands are bringing heavy rain and the risk of flooding and landslides to nearby Caribbean islands. This storm is the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season.</p>

Wheeler, a three-time All-Star and the current MLB strikeout leader, will miss several upcoming starts, with no specific timetable set for his return. His absence is a significant setback for the Phillies, though the team is anticipating the return of another key pitcher, Aaron Nola, from the injured list.

          <p>Chinese merchants selling goods on major e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu remain anxious about the potential for future U.S. tariffs, despite a current truce in trade tensions.

          <p>In a significant policy shift following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump is now urging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to agree to a permanent peace deal with Russia, moving away from his previous calls for a rapid ceasefire. Trump stated on social media that a direct peace agreement is the best way to end the war, a position that contrasts with Ukraine's long-standing demand for a ceasefire before any long-term negotiations. This change has raised concerns among European diplomats that Trump may pressure Zelensky into accepting unfavorable terms discussed with Putin.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump has reportedly told European leaders he supports a peace plan that would require Ukraine to withdraw from the Donbas region. In exchange, Russia would freeze the front lines in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, according to sources familiar with the talks. This proposal would involve Ukraine ceding control of territory that it has defended for over three years, a condition President Zelensky has previously rejected. The development indicates a significant shift in the U.S. approach to resolving the conflict, aligning more closely with Russian demands.</p>

This surge is attributed to the new, highly contagious "Stratus" variant, which now accounts for two-thirds of virus variants detected in U.S. wastewater. The spike coincides with a recent change in CDC policy, influenced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which no longer recommends updated COVID shots for healthy children.

          <p>Despite ongoing hot weather, parts of the UK are showing signs of an early autumn, such as leaves changing color and falling from trees. Experts explain this is not a true seasonal shift but a stress response from nature due to a prolonged hot and dry summer, which is on track to be one of the warmest on record. The drought-like conditions are causing trees to shed leaves and branches to conserve water, while some fruits are ripening prematurely. Conservationists worry this disruption to natural cycles could have negative impacts on wildlife that depend on seasonal food sources.</p>

The win has given fans hope that the club can avoid a quick return to the Championship, confounding the predictions of many pundits. The strong start is seen as crucial for survival, as historically, promoted teams that perform well in their initial games are more likely to stay up.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing to travel to Washington D.C. for a meeting with President Trump on Monday, following the U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska. The talks are expected to focus on a potential peace settlement, with Trump now advocating for a permanent deal rather than a simple ceasefire. After the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin described his conversation with Trump as "timely and quite useful," stating that a settlement must address the "root causes" of the crisis. European leaders are set to confer ahead of the high-stakes meeting between the U.S. and Ukrainian leaders.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a plan to move Palestinians to the southern Gaza Strip in preparation for a renewed offensive aimed at taking control of northern Gaza City. The military's civilian affairs agency, COGAT, stated that the supply of tents and shelter equipment for the relocation would resume on Sunday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Gaza City as the last major stronghold of Hamas and said Palestinians would be moved to designated "safe zones." This announcement comes as families of hostages held in Gaza call for protests to demand a deal to end the war.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman from Gaza, who was evacuated to Italy for medical treatment while severely emaciated, has died from cardiac arrest less than 48 hours after her arrival. The University Hospital of Pisa reported she was suffering from severe weight and muscle loss, with news agencies citing severe malnutrition. Her death underscores the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the UN has warned of widespread malnutrition and famine-like conditions. Israel has denied there is starvation in the territory, blaming UN agencies for failing to distribute aid that has crossed the border.</p>

          <p>Samsung is closing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share jumping to 31% in the second quarter, up from 23%. This growth is largely attributed to the increasing consumer interest in Samsung's foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer innovative designs that differentiate them from the standard smartphone form factor. While Apple still leads the market, its declining share indicates a competitive resurgence from Samsung, fueling speculation that Apple will introduce its own foldable iPhone in the near future to maintain its edge.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that crucial U.S. environmental laws, such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, are under attack from the Trump administration and its allies. These laws, which successfully helped rebuild populations of species like elephant seals and gray whales, now face proposed legislative changes that would weaken protections to favor energy development and fishing operations. The author contends that loosening these regulations is dangerous, as many marine mammal populations are already stressed by climate change, pollution, and ship strikes, making continued protection essential for ocean health.</p>

          <p>Air Canada suspended all its operations after more than 10,000 of its flight attendants went on strike over a contract dispute concerning wages and unpaid work hours. The strike, which began early Saturday, led to widespread flight cancellations, affecting an estimated 130,000 travelers daily during the peak summer season. In response to the disruption, the Canadian federal government quickly intervened, invoking its authority to force both the airline and the union into binding arbitration to resolve the dispute and resume service, a move the union has criticized as a violation of its rights.</p>

          <p>Manchester City began their season with a dominant 4-0 victory over Wolves, highlighted by an exceptional debut from new signing Tijjani Reijnders. The Dutch midfielder contributed both a goal and an assist, becoming only the second City player to do so on their Premier League debut. His dynamic, box-to-box performance earned praise from manager Pep Guardiola, who called him a "top signing for the coming years." The impressive win suggests City is poised for a strong season after adding key players to reinforce their midfield following last year's injury-plagued campaign.</p>

          <p>Greg Iles, the best-selling author known for his Southern gothic crime novels, has died at the age of 65 after a long battle with multiple myeloma. Many of his works, including the acclaimed "Natchez Burning" trilogy, were set in his home state of Mississippi and explored complex themes of race and class in the American South. Iles kept his illness private for decades while continuing to write, publishing his final novel, "Southern Man," earlier this year. He was also known for performing with the Rock Bottom Remainders, a musical group composed of fellow authors like Stephen King and Amy Tan.</p>
