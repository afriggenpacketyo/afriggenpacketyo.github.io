          <p>A series of nationwide protests, known as "No Kings," have begun across the United States to challenge what organizers describe as President Donald Trump's "authoritarianism." The first rally kicked off in New York City, with millions expected to participate in over 2,500 planned events nationwide, including major gatherings in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. In response, Republican governors in states like Texas and Virginia have placed their National Guard troops on standby, citing concerns over potential unrest. The protests have drawn support from various public figures and have seen solidarity rallies in several European cities.</p>

          <p>Following Prince Andrew's decision to relinquish his Duke of York title and other honors, the brother of the late Virginia Giuffre has publicly called for King Charles to also strip him of the title of "prince." Sky Roberts stated that his sister, who accused the prince of sexual abuse when she was a minor, would be proud of this development and that it brings a sense of justice for survivors. The prince's move comes amid ongoing pressure over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, though he continues to deny all allegations against him.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has sacked head coach Ange Postecoglou just 39 days into his tenure, making it the shortest permanent managerial reign in Premier League history. The dismissal followed a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea, which left the team with only one point from his five league matches in charge. The club's owner, Evangelos Marinakis, made the decision after a series of poor results that left Forest just above the relegation zone. Postecoglou's brief and unsuccessful stint contrasts sharply with the team's performance last season under their previous manager.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos has been released from a New Jersey prison after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. The release, which occurred less than three months into his sentence, followed a public push from Republican allies like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. In a statement, Trump acknowledged Santos was a "rogue" but argued the prison term was excessive. The commutation has drawn criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, reigniting debate over presidential power and justice.</p>

          <p>Contrary to common stereotypes, a recent study from the Kinsey Institute reveals that men are more inclined than women to accelerate relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research indicates that financial stability and the need for social and emotional support are primary motivators for men. Experts suggest that heterosexual men often rely on romantic relationships as their main source of support, making them more eager to commit. This trend is also observed by relationship coaches, who report that men are more likely to seek their services to find a partner.</p>

          <p>Amid increasing market volatility, some financial experts are highlighting income funds that utilize options-based strategies as a potential haven for risk-averse investors. Invesco's senior portfolio manager, John Burrello, suggests these ETFs offer more structural protection because their performance is not solely reliant on stock correlations and can provide income that is less sensitive to interest rate changes. He notes that with an expected rate-cutting cycle, diversifying income sources away from Fed dependency is becoming increasingly important for investment portfolios. Burrello advises investors to seek funds managed by institutional professionals and to be wary of unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An American who retired at 41 and moved to Portugal details the financial and lifestyle advantages of his decision. He and his wife save approximately $5,000 per month on living expenses compared to their previous life in Washington, D.C., due to lower taxes, healthcare costs, and daily expenditures. This has allowed their net worth to continue growing in retirement through investments. Beyond finances, he emphasizes that embracing the uncertainty of a new life abroad provided an opportunity for personal growth and building a fulfilling routine centered on core priorities like health, relationships, and learning.</p>

Investors have criticized the all-cash deal's structure, which will significantly increase KDP's debt.

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge recommends that parents delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible, ideally until at least age 16, to promote better mental health outcomes. She advises starting conversations about responsible technology use with children in late elementary school, years before they receive their own devices. Key preparations include teaching them about online privacy, the value of their time, and setting firm rules with parental controls once access is granted. This proactive approach aims to help children develop a healthier, more moderate relationship with digital technologies as they mature.</p>

          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment strategy, Warren Buffett outlines why he avoids investing in gold and other non-productive assets. He categorizes investments into three types: currency-based, non-productive items like gold, and productive assets such as farms or businesses. Buffett argues that gold's value is purely speculative, relying on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future without it generating any intrinsic value. In contrast, he favors productive assets that deliver tangible returns, like crops from a farm or profits from a company, as their success can be rationally calculated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant political gender divide has emerged among Generation Z in the United States, with young women identifying as the most left-leaning demographic in recent history. This trend is attributed to their generation coming of age amidst crises like climate change, economic instability, and threats to reproductive rights, making politics a matter of self-defense rather than negotiation. In contrast, Gen Z men's political views are more aligned with the national average, a gap potentially widened by social media algorithms. For many of these young women, mainstream liberal politics is insufficient, leading them to adopt more staunchly leftist and anti-capitalist stances.</p>
