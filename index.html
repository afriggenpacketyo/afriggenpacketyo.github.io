          <p>President Donald Trump has pardoned Changpeng Zhao, founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering and served a four-month jail sentence. The White House framed the pardon as a response to the Biden administration's "war on cryptocurrency," arguing Zhao faced no fraud allegations or identifiable victims. This move sparked strong criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who denounced it as "corruption," pointing to Zhao's guilty plea and the reported lobbying efforts that preceded the pardon. Trump, however, claimed the pardon was issued at the request of "a lot of very good people" who believed Zhao was not guilty of a crime, further fueling the controversy surrounding the decision.</p>

Prosecutors presented a harrowing account of the events, detailing how Nicholson, reportedly dependent on his parents and urged to seek mental health treatment, fatally stabbed his father and mother, then the housekeeper the following morning. His defense team argued for a not guilty verdict by reason of insanity, citing his diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. The trial now moves to a sanity phase, which will determine whether he faces life imprisonment without parole or commitment to a state mental hospital.</p>

          <p>Walt Disney Co. is alerting YouTube TV subscribers about a potential blackout of its popular channels, including ABC, ESPN, FX, and National Geographic, if a new distribution agreement is not finalized by next Thursday. YouTube TV, a prominent US pay-TV service with approximately 10 million subscribers, claims Disney is demanding costly economic terms that would raise prices for consumers and unfairly benefit Disney's own live TV products. This ongoing contract dispute follows similar impasses YouTube TV experienced with other major programmers, although those were resolved without channels going dark. The potential blackout looms critically as major sports seasons, including NFL, college football, and NBA, are currently underway, threatening widespread viewing disruption.</p>

          <p>BeOne Medicines, a global pharmaceutical company originating from mainland China, is set to significantly expand its presence in Hong Kong by introducing more cancer drugs and boosting production capabilities in Guangzhou. This strategic move capitalizes on Hong Kong's recently streamlined drug-approval regime, which has opened up greater market opportunities for pharmaceutical companies. The company has already successfully launched three cancer medications in Hong Kong and plans to seek approval for additional medical indications by the end of this year. This expansion highlights the growing synergy and market integration between mainland China's robust development and Hong Kong's role as an international financial and regulatory hub in the healthcare sector.</p>

          <p>Episode six of "The Celebrity Traitors" saw heightened drama with a cliffhanger ending and host Claudia Winkleman's visible frustration as the Faithfuls continued to struggle in identifying Traitors. Despite the return of the life-size chessboard challenge, the Faithfuls remained unsuccessful, leading to the banishment of Sir Stephen Fry, another innocent player. Comedian Alan Carr, a Traitor, reveled in his role, while Nick Mohammed's attempt at "faithful sabotage" to protect his team caused suspicion. The game intensifies with only nine players remaining, three of whom are Traitors, leaving the Faithfuls with limited episodes to uncover them. The pressure and frustration mounted, leading to the most tetchy round table discussion yet.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has canceled plans to deploy federal troops to San Francisco for an immigration crackdown, a decision that followed widespread condemnation from California leaders and protests. Mayor Daniel Lurie confirmed Trump's reversal after discussions with him and Silicon Valley leaders. Governor Gavin Newsom praised the decision, having previously called Trump's moves "right out of the dictator's handbook." Protesters had mobilized, and tensions flared earlier in the day, but the withdrawal marks a temporary relief for a city bracing for increased federal enforcement. The article notes that Trump had claimed "unquestioned power" to deploy federal forces and argued that San Francisco residents want the military in their city, though local leaders disagreed, emphasizing that every American deserves to live in a community where they're not afraid of being mugged, murdered, robbed, sexually assaulted, or shot.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has cautioned McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris about Max Verstappen's "cut-throat" competitive nature as the Formula 1 title race enters its final five races. Piastri currently leads the championship by 14 points over Norris, with Verstappen 40 points behind after a strong recent run of three wins and a second place. Hamilton, drawing from his own intense 2021 battle with Verstappen, stressed the high pressure and the need for consistency to fend off a chasing driver like Verstappen. Despite previous team repercussions for on-track collisions, the McLaren drivers are now free to race each other, adding another layer of intensity to the championship fight.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed Department of Justice superiors that there is insufficient evidence to criminally charge Senator Adam Schiff of California with mortgage fraud. This development follows President Donald Trump's public calls for Schiff's indictment, a staunch critic who acted as prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial. While Hayes, an experienced prosecutor, conveyed her assessment to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, a controversial senior Justice Department official is reportedly pushing to keep the investigation active. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, stated that career prosecutors have found the politically-motivated allegations baseless, calling for an end to the "transparently vindictive effort." Schiff himself characterized the probe as an intimidation tactic by "tinpot dictators."</p>

          <p>Economists estimate that the number of Americans filing new jobless claims increased last week, with more individuals collecting unemployment benefits in early October, signaling easing labor market conditions. Initial claims are projected to have risen to around 232,000, suggesting the labor market remains steady without a material pickup in layoffs. However, a spike in federal employee applications is noted, likely due to buyouts and furloughs during the ongoing government shutdown, which has caused an economic data blackout. The elevated number of continuing claims suggests that unemployed individuals face challenges in securing new positions, with the jobless rate rising to 4.3% in August, indicating a low hiring environment.</p>

This decision, announced by the Interior Secretary, opens up critical habitats for polar bears, caribou, and other wildlife, and includes an oil and gas lease sale in the National Petroleum Reserve. Additionally, permits were reissued for the controversial Ambler Road Project, which would cut through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, threatening migratory birds and Indigenous tribes. Environmental groups have vehemently condemned these moves, calling them a prioritization of oil corporations over conservation and cultural heritage, particularly during an ongoing government shutdown.</p>

          <p>The International Chess Federation (FIDE) is investigating Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik for his public accusations of cheating against elite players, including the late US grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky. FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich expressed concern over discussions harming reputations and well-being, especially after Naroditsky's recent death, which some supporters have linked to the stress from Kramnik's claims. Naroditsky, a popular YouTube and Twitch streamer, had voiced how such accusations profoundly impacted his legacy and "reason for waking up." Kramnik, a former world champion, has doubled down on his unsubstantiated claims and threatened legal action against those blaming him for Naroditsky's death, describing FIDE's actions as an "insulting and unfair" campaign.</p>

          <p>Alabama is set to execute Anthony Boyd, 54, using nitrogen gas, a controversial method of suffocation that defense lawyers argue constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The Supreme Court denied Boyd’s stay of execution, with liberal justices fiercely dissenting and Justice Sotomayor likening the experience to suffocating for four minutes. This will be Alabama's third execution by nitrogen, following Kenny Smith and Alan Miller, both of whom reportedly showed visible distress. Boyd, who maintains his innocence in the 1995 murder of Gregory Huguley, was sentenced by a non-unanimous jury vote of 10 to 2, a practice allowed in only two states. His lawyers argued the method inflicts "extreme pain and terror of suffocation."</p>

          <p>The US government shutdown has entered its 23rd day, nearing the record set during the first Trump presidency, with no clear end in sight due to persistent political gridlock. Unlike previous shutdowns, this one feels secondary amidst other major news, partly due to public "jaundice" and the administration's selective functioning of government services. Both President Trump and congressional Democrats appear to see political advantage in extending the closure, with Trump showing little interest in resolution and Democrats prioritizing resistance. The pain is increasingly felt by federal workers and in red states, yet the diffuse nature of the impact means no party is willing to compromise, leading to a perverse continuation of the impasse and government dysfunction.</p>

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, led by a Trump appointee, criticized the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for failing to justify such a "sweeping relief." Veterans groups applauded the decision, arguing the administration was using the shutdown as a pretext to deny veterans their day in court, some of whom have waited decades for claims related to toxic exposure such as Agent Orange. This ruling marks a significant judicial pushback against executive attempts to leverage the shutdown to halt essential government functions, protecting vulnerable groups.</p>

He indicated uncertainty about seeking congressional approval for such strikes, stating he couldn't imagine Congress would object.

Critics, including Democrats and some Trump supporters, question the legal authority and the broader implications of these actions, suggesting they could be a pretext for regime change against President Nicolás Maduro.

Despite a slight dip in data center CPU sales, Intel expects demand to outpace supply next year and is committed to advancing the Trump administration's vision for restoring semiconductor production.

Advocates like Public Counsel argue detainees face "inherently coercive conditions" without adequate legal access, exacerbated by recent immigration raids. This ruling is a significant step in upholding due process rights for vulnerable individuals, though earlier attempts to block racial profiling in arrests were lifted by the Supreme Court.
