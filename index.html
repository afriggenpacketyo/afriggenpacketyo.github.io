        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to urge them to support the budget package, which includes his legislative priorities, as it faces hurdles due to internal party divisions. Some conservatives are pushing for steeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates oppose alterations to the state and local tax deduction. Trump emphasized the need for unity and warned against undermining the bill, stating that any Republican who doesn't back what he refers to as the 'big, beautiful bill' would be 'knocked out so fast.' House Speaker Mike Johnson faces a tight margin, needing nearly full Republican support to pass the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail has been arrested for allegedly aiding 10 inmates in their escape, claiming he was threatened by one of the inmates. Sterling Williams, 33, told investigators that inmate Antoine Massey threatened to shank him if he didn't turn off the water to the cell used for the escape. The inmates breached a wall behind the cell's toilet and fled through a loading dock, escaping unnoticed for several hours. Sheriff Susan Hutson has temporarily suspended her reelection campaign as a result of the incident, and three workers have been suspended without pay as an internal investigation is conducted.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a waiver for Nebraska to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, marking a shift in federal nutrition policy. This decision reverses two decades of rejections of similar state efforts and is expected to pave the way for more states to implement such restrictions. Nebraska will begin the program in January 2026, affecting approximately 150,000 food stamp recipients, with plans to evaluate changes in spending habits and provide assistance to retailers during the transition. The move has garnered support from some health and conservative groups but faces opposition from trade groups and anti-poverty organizations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis reveals that red meat studies funded by the red meat industry are nearly four times more likely to report favorable or neutral cardiovascular results compared to independently funded studies. This finding highlights concerns about conflicts of interest in nutrition research and the potential for industry-linked studies to shape public understanding of health consequences of dietary choices. The study examined 44 clinical trials and found that independently funded studies consistently reported worsened or neutral cardiovascular outcomes. Experts emphasize the need for more comprehensive research comparing red meat to a full range of diets, including heart-healthy plant-based options, to provide a clearer picture of its risks and benefits.</p>

          <p>Palo Alto Networks reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its April quarter, yet its shares fell in extended trading, likely because the company did not raise its full-year outlook for key metrics.

Despite solid results amid trade war discussions and macroeconomic uncertainty, the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) and next-gen security ARR outlooks remained unchanged.

Experts have noted the technical challenges and high costs associated with defending the United States against such attacks, with some estimating the project could cost as much as $542 billion.

The prosecution aims to demonstrate Combs' willingness to use violence and coercion to protect his alleged criminal enterprise, while the defense argues that any violence was driven by love, jealousy, and drug use, not a desire to coerce anyone into sexual assault.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Thomas B. Edsall presents a compilation of views from scholars of the presidency who argue that the Trump presidency is characterized by 'wanton destructiveness.' The targets of President Trump’s assaults include the law, higher education, medical research, ethical standards, America’s foreign alliances, free speech, the civil service, religion, the media and much more. One scholar described it as intentionally and deliberately setting out to destroy literally every institution in America, up to and including American democracy and the rule of law. Some scholars suggest that Trump is unique in his destructiveness, while others draw parallels to figures like Andrew Johnson and James Buchanan.</p>

          <p>The discovery of 12,000 abandoned chicks in a postal truck in Delaware has raised concerns about the safety of shipping live animals through the U.S. Postal Service. Approximately 4,000 chicks were found dead, while the surviving 8,000 were taken to an animal shelter for adoption. The chicks were reportedly left without food, water, or temperature control. The incident has prompted calls for stricter regulations and increased scrutiny of animal shipping practices, with animal rights groups arguing that it is inherently unsafe for animals to travel by mail.</p>
