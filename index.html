          <h2>UK Government to Publish Nationalities of Foreign Offenders</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to release data on the nationalities of foreign criminals, a move the Conservatives claim is due to their pressure. Official data indicates a rise in foreign offenders awaiting deportation, with Home Office sources citing prison overcrowding and appeal processes as contributing factors. The data is expected to reveal that Albanians, Romanians, and Poles are among the most common nationalities for foreign criminals, with offenses including drug production, theft, and violent assault. The government insists this transparency measure is a result of their actions, while the opposition welcomes the increased public awareness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Approximately 70 Japanese lawmakers participated in the spring festival at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, a site associated with Japan's militaristic past and controversial due to its honoring of war criminals. The visit has sparked diplomatic friction with China and South Korea, where resentment over Japan's wartime actions remains strong. Despite the controversy, the cross-party group typically visits the shrine during major festivals and anniversaries. Prime Minister Ishiba sent a ritual offering but is not expected to visit personally, balancing domestic traditions with international relations.</p>

          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating both opportunities and challenges for central banks worldwide, with many welcoming the breathing room to potentially cut interest rates and ease the burden of dollar-denominated debt. However, a stronger local currency can complicate export competitiveness and potentially lead to capital flight, especially in emerging markets. Central banks are treading carefully to avoid currency wars and protect against inflation risks. The European Central Bank recently cut rates, while the Swiss National Bank may need to take drastic measures to devalue the franc if capital inflows persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a significant downturn after President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump's attacks on Powell's handling of the economy, coupled with tariff plans, have heightened fears of an economic recession. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all saw substantial losses, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022. Gold prices reached a new record high as investors sought safe-haven assets, reflecting market uncertainty.</p>

          <p>China experienced a rise in newly established private companies in the first quarter, despite the ongoing trade war with the US. Nearly 1.98 million private firms were registered, reflecting resilience in the private sector. However, these businesses are expected to face challenges due to tariffs imposed by the US, as they contribute to a significant portion of China's exports. The private sector's export and import value increased, accounting for a larger share of the country's total trade value.</p>

The LAPD would see over 400 civilian workers targeted for layoffs, resulting in the lowest number of police officers since 1995.
