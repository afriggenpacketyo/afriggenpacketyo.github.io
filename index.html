          <p>New records indicate the 29-year-old Dallas ICE facility gunman, Joshua Jahn, held peculiar beliefs, including fears of radiation exposure and an allergy to plastic, prior to the September attack. His parents described him as a "loner" obsessed with AI, believing he contracted "radiation sickness" after a seasonal job in Washington state, a former Manhattan Project site. Jahn, who was unemployed and undiagnosed with mental disorders, killed two detainees and injured one before taking his own life. The motive remains unclear, though federal authorities found "ANTI-ICE" written on a bullet and notes indicating an intent to ambush and terrorize ICE agents.</p>

Two individuals from the helicopter were safely extracted, along with three pedestrians injured on the ground, all transported to the hospital for treatment. Dramatic social media videos show the helicopter spinning multiple times before crashing into palm trees and a pedestrian bridge staircase. The incident occurred during a helicopter landing party ahead of a larger event, which organizers confirmed would proceed.

          <p>UCLA interim head coach Tim Skipper remains focused on winning, downplaying social media narratives that credit offensive coordinator Jerry Neuheisel for the team's recent turnaround. After an 0-4 start, the Bruins have won two consecutive games, with Neuheisel's play-calling significantly boosting the offense and Skipper providing energy and meticulousness. Skipper, who took over after DeShaun Foster, has used motivational tactics to keep the team intact and engaged, leading to improved morale and performance. The team's resurgence reflects collective contributions from staff and players, now favored against Maryland.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland suffered a "sore loss" with a 1-0 defeat to Germany in a World Cup qualifier, though their battling performance left them "down but not out." Despite a spirited effort, particularly in the second half where they pressed hard, they couldn't find an equalizer after Germany's first-half goal. Manager Michael O'Neill criticized the officiating and acknowledged missed opportunities and defensive errors. While automatic qualification is now a long shot, second place and a play-off spot remain achievable. The team's young squad and strong home support indicate continued potential despite the setback.</p>

          <p>The Scottish National Party (SNP), previously facing significant challenges, has demonstrated renewed political stability and momentum under leader John Swinney. Polls suggest the SNP has improved its standing, with support splintering among rivals like Labour and Reform, potentially nearing a majority in Holyrood. This would be an extraordinary achievement for a party entering its third consecutive decade in devolved power. Securing a majority is crucial for the SNP's renewed push for another independence referendum, though the UK government remains opposed, highlighting the unpredictable nature of contemporary politics.</p>

          <p>Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, has been sentenced to life in prison for her role in the 2014 murder-for-hire of her former son-in-law, Daniel Markel. Markel, a prominent law professor, was killed amidst a bitter custody dispute with Adelson's daughter. Adelson, 75, was convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy, and solicitation, receiving life without parole plus 30 consecutive years. Despite her claims of innocence and accusations of media bias, Circuit Judge Stephen Everett found the evidence clear, noting her "utter lack of remorse." Adelson is the fifth person sentenced in this captivating, decade-long case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law designed to significantly ease insurance claims for fire victims who lose personal property. Under Senate Bill 495, survivors of catastrophic fires can now receive up to $350,000—60% of their personal property coverage—without needing an itemized list of losses upfront. This measure aims to alleviate the daunting burden on victims, who previously faced extensive documentation requirements after total loss. The law also extends the claim filing period to at least 100 days and funds the nation's first public wildfire catastrophe model, enhancing consumer protection and disaster preparedness.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, the comprehensive blueprint for its future development, the implications for industrial collaboration across the Taiwan Strait are being closely examined. A recent delegation of Taiwanese executives, including representatives from major companies like Delta Electronics, explored potential partnerships with mainland Chinese manufacturers, particularly in the electric vehicle industry. This trip highlights the evolving economic relationship, where Taiwanese firms increasingly supply specialized components to leading mainland hi-tech companies. The plan's focus will likely shape future opportunities and challenges for cross-strait economic ties and regional dynamics.</p>

          <p>Cameron McGerr, a 16-year-old from Scotland, is passionately campaigning for mandatory CPR training in all Scottish schools after tragically losing both his parents to heart conditions. He believes that if he had known CPR, he might have saved his father, who died from cardiac arrest this year, three years after his mother's fatal heart attack. Cameron's "Pulse of Life" campaign has already led to CPR being introduced at his own school, Clydeview Academy. Health groups support his initiative, noting that widespread CPR confidence could significantly improve the one in ten survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.</p>

          <p>A Chicago man with legal residency, Rueben Antonio Cruz, was ticketed $130 by ICE agents for not carrying his immigration papers, despite verifying his legal status. This incident highlights an escalation of President Trump's immigration crackdown, "Operation Midway Blitz," which has led to 800 arrests in the area. Legal experts note that while federal law requires foreign nationals to carry proof of registration, it was rarely enforced before this administration. Civil rights groups criticize the tactic as "hateful" and aimed at causing panic, with some U.S. citizens also reporting being questioned for proof of citizenship.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans are facing significant anxiety over potential spikes in healthcare costs as Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) premium tax credits are set to expire. These federal subsidies, expanded during the pandemic, have been a "lifeline" for many, saving families hundreds of dollars monthly. Democrats are linking their renewal to reopening the government, making it a central issue in the current shutdown battle. Experts warn that without an extension, around seven million people could stop buying insurance, with four to five million losing coverage entirely, disproportionately affecting working-class individuals in Republican-leaning states.</p>

          <p>Several leading news organizations, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, have refused to sign new Pentagon policy restricting press access and reporting. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's policy, criticized as undermining First Amendment protections, demands reporters acknowledge understanding the rules by a Tuesday deadline or risk losing credentials. Media outlets view the rules as an attempt to stifle a free press and potentially criminalize independent news-gathering. Hegseth, a former Fox anchor, responded dismissively on social media, intensifying the conflict between the administration and the press over transparency.</p>

Tuchel, who called Rashford up to the national squad after a period of absence, stressed that talent alone is insufficient; consistent high-level performance is demanded. He emphasized that Rashford, at 27, still has time to make crucial career decisions to maximize his exceptional abilities.</p>
