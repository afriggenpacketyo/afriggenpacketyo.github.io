          <p>Warnings of retail shortages have surfaced as CEOs of major stores informed President Trump that a prolonged trade war could lead to empty shelves. Apparel and footwear, heavily reliant on Chinese imports, are expected to be the first affected due to high tariffs. Companies are anticipating price increases and consumer wariness, leading to surged orders of big-ticket items. The risk of shortages depends on the duration of the tariffs and companies' inventory management, with low-margin goods like toys and budget home goods disappearing first. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has partially blocked the Trump administration from withholding Title I federal funds from public schools that maintain diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.

The ruling prevents the administration from halting funds to schools employing plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

          <p>Reform UK is facing criticism for fielding local election candidates who have allegedly posted offensive content, including hate speech and far-right conspiracy theories. Despite claims by Nigel Farage that the party has improved its vetting process, Hope Not Hate has highlighted examples of candidates promoting anti-Islam views and other extremist content. The posts, some of which have since been deleted, undermine Farage's claims of a thorough vetting system.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire federal judge restricted the Trump administration's ability to cut or withhold federal funding from public schools that participate in some diversity and equity initiatives. Judge Landya McCafferty found that actions by the Trump administration to withhold funds would "cripple the operations of many educational institutions," and are a violation of executive branch power in overseeing local school districts. The ruling is limited to any public schools that work with the plaintiffs in the case.</p>
