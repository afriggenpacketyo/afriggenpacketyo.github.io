          <p>The BBC has learned that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office directly questioned Lord Peter Mandelson about his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as the US ambassador. The inquiry, prompted by initial vetting, sought clarification on his continued contact with Epstein post-conviction. However, newly surfaced emails showing supportive messages from Mandelson to Epstein after his 2008 conviction, which were not found during the vetting process, led to his dismissal. The incident has raised significant questions about the prime minister's judgment and the thoroughness of the government's vetting procedures.</p>

          <p>The United Nations General Assembly has passed a nonbinding resolution with a 142-10 vote, strongly endorsing a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The resolution, sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, calls for a phased plan to end the conflict and urges countries to recognize a Palestinian state, a move the United States and Israel voted against. The declaration also condemns both Hamas's attacks on Israeli civilians and Israel's military actions in Gaza that have led to a severe humanitarian crisis. This diplomatic push comes as the conflict continues to escalate, with the Israeli military intensifying strikes on Gaza City.</p>

          <p>A major rally in London, organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson under the banner "Unite the Kingdom," drew an estimated 110,000 participants, prompting a significant police presence. The event, which featured speeches from international far-right figures, highlighted growing anti-immigration sentiment in Britain. A smaller counter-protest of about 5,000 people, organized by Stand Up to Racism, was held nearby, with police working to keep the two groups separated. The demonstration reflects ongoing tensions in the UK over immigration, free speech, and the rise of nationalist movements.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking to fine Boeing $3.1 million for numerous safety and quality control violations, including those linked to the January mid-flight blowout of a door plug on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9. The proposed penalty covers hundreds of violations identified at Boeing and subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems' factories between September 2023 and February 2024. This action follows a National Transportation Safety Board investigation that blamed lapses in Boeing's manufacturing and safety oversight for the incident. Boeing has acknowledged the proposed penalty and stated it continues to work on strengthening its safety culture.</p>

          <p>Authorities have taken 22-year-old Tyler Robinson into custody as the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist and Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk. The shooting, which occurred during an outdoor debate at Utah Valley University, has been described by officials as a "targeted attack" and a "political assassination." Investigators tracked the suspect using security footage and recovered a high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon used. The suspect's father reportedly recognized his son from images released by law enforcement and played a crucial role in convincing him to surrender to authorities.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a series of significant and contentious bills aimed at transforming public education, which now await Governor Gavin Newsom's approval. Key legislation includes a mandate for phonics-based reading instruction, a plan to phase out ultra-processed foods from school cafeterias, and the creation of a state Office for Civil Rights to combat discrimination, including antisemitism, in classrooms.

          <p>Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil has disclosed that he suffered a severe stroke last Christmas, which resulted in the complete paralysis of his left side. The 64-year-old rocker explained that the health crisis was so serious his doctors initially doubted he would be able to walk again. After months of intensive physical therapy, which involved relearning to walk, Neil has made a significant recovery and is now back to performing with the band for their rescheduled Las Vegas residency. He described the recovery process as a "full-time job" but reports feeling about 95% back to his previous condition.</p>

The dissolution was a key demand of the "Gen Z" protest movement, which saw over 50 people killed in clashes and led to the appointment of an interim prime minister.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, has stated that if elected, he would order the NYPD to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should he ever travel to the city. Citing an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant issued for alleged war crimes in Gaza, Mamdani affirmed his intention to uphold international law. The pledge has drawn significant attention, as the U.S. does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction. Legal experts suggest such an action would be practically impossible and could create a major conflict with the federal government.</p>

          <p>Turkish authorities have detained Hasan Mutlu, the opposition CHP party mayor of Istanbul's Bayrampasa district, along with dozens of other officials, on allegations of corruption. This move is part of a broader crackdown on Turkey's main opposition party, which has seen numerous mayors and staff arrested in recent months. Mutlu has denied the allegations, calling them "political operations and baseless slander." The arrests are intensifying political tensions in Turkey, particularly following the detention of former Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p>

          <p>Documents related to Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's property purchases could weaken the Trump administration's attempt to remove her for cause. President Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud for allegedly claiming two properties as primary residences simultaneously. However, loan and security clearance forms show Cook described one of the properties as a "vacation home" and a "second home," which contradicts the administration's claims. Cook has sued to block her firing and secured a temporary injunction, setting up a significant clash over the independence of the central bank just before a key interest rate decision.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer has denied any knowledge of a deal between star player Kawhi Leonard and the now-bankrupt company Aspiration, which is at the center of salary-cap circumvention accusations. The team is accused of arranging a $28 million "no-show" endorsement deal for Leonard through the company, in which Ballmer was an investor, to bypass NBA salary rules. Ballmer stated that while he made an introduction, he was not involved in the specifics of the contract and would support a league investigation into the matter. The NBA has confirmed it is commencing an investigation into the report.</p>

          <p>A couple who left their conventional New York City lives to live in ten different cities over two years reflects on the transformative experience. By selling 90% of their belongings and embracing a minimalist, nomadic lifestyle, they learned to prioritize experiences over possessions, break monotonous routines, and live on less money. The constant change forced them to strengthen their relationship and deepen their self-awareness by navigating new environments together. Now married with a child and back in Brooklyn, they apply these lessons to their daily lives and plan to undertake a similar adventure with their daughter in the future.</p>

          <p>A Fulton County judge has dismissed the sweeping RICO conspiracy charges against 61 individuals who protested the construction of an Atlanta police training center known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state attorney general's office lacked the legal authority to bring the case after local district attorneys had declined to prosecute. This decision marks a major collapse of a two-year prosecution that attempted to use laws designed for organized crime to target a social protest movement. The state has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, which has been hailed by defense attorneys as a vindication against prosecutorial overreach.</p>

          <h2>Expert Discusses Potential Safety Concerns of Popular Lip Oil Products</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 11:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The growing popularity of lip oils has raised questions about their safety, particularly after social media users reported experiencing hyperpigmentation. According to Dr. Rebecca Small, a clinical professor at UCSF, some lip oils can cause this issue if they lack SPF, as the oil can magnify UV exposure on the thin skin of the lips. Irritating ingredients used for plumping effects or fragrances can also lead to dermatitis and inflammation, which may result in skin darkening. To use these products safely, consumers should focus on ingredients, choosing oils with broad-spectrum SPF and avoiding potential irritants like fragrances and certain acids.</p>

          <p>The first flights to deport migrants from the UK to France under a new returns agreement are anticipated to begin next week. The "one in, one out" pilot scheme, announced in July, allows the UK to return asylum seekers whose claims are withdrawn or deemed inadmissible. In exchange, the UK will accept an equal number of asylum seekers directly from France who pass eligibility checks. Dozens of migrants were detained in Dover last month in preparation for these returns, as the UK government implements new measures to address the increasing number of small boat crossings in the English Channel.</p>

          <p>In response to historic droughts that have severely restricted vessel traffic, the Panama Canal Authority is moving forward with significant infrastructure investments to ensure future water security. Plans include the construction of a new dam and a complementary land bridge featuring a natural gas pipeline to transport energy products without relying on the canal's water levels. These projects are critical for the key global trade route, which handles roughly $270 billion in cargo annually and is vital to the U.S. economy. The multi-billion dollar initiatives aim to mitigate the impacts of climate change and future El Niño events on canal operations.</p>
