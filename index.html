          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in its third-quarter vehicle deliveries, reaching 497,099 units and surpassing analyst expectations. This growth was partly driven by U.S. buyers rushing to take advantage of a federal EV tax credit before its expiration. However, the company faced challenges, including a sales slump in Europe due to increased competition and consumer reaction to CEO Elon Musk's political rhetoric. Tesla also reported significant growth in its energy storage division, deploying 12.5 GWh of its battery products during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has framed the ongoing government shutdown as an "unprecedented opportunity" to implement significant cuts to federal agencies. He announced plans to meet with Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, a key author of the conservative Project 2025 blueprint, to identify which agencies could face temporary or permanent reductions. This move signals an intent to use the funding impasse to advance a long-standing conservative goal of downsizing the federal government, a strategy that has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats.</p>

In his first television interview, Nash described living in constant fear for his life, stating that he prepared an escape bag in case he needed to hide. The lawsuit details allegations of manipulation, sexual assault, and threats of harm. Combs' legal team has vehemently denied these claims, dismissing them as falsehoods and asserting his innocence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The current federal government shutdown is primarily driven by a legislative battle over enhanced tax credits for health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act. These subsidies, which have made premiums more affordable for millions of Americans, are set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats have refused to pass a short-term funding bill without an extension, warning that failure to act will cause premiums to double for many. Republicans argue the extension is too costly and should be debated separately from the government funding bill.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, for $9.7 billion in cash. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and utilizes a portion of its substantial cash reserves, which total $344 billion. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO believes will stabilize the company's finances and allow it to resume its stock buyback program. The deal deepens the existing financial relationship between the two companies, as Berkshire already holds a significant stake in Occidental.</p>

          <p>Data from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas shows that U.S. employers have cut nearly 950,000 jobs through September of this year, the highest number since the pandemic-driven layoffs in 2020. Concurrently, hiring plans have been significantly scaled back, with companies expecting to hire 58% fewer workers for the remainder of the year compared to previous projections. This trend points to a stagnating labor market influenced by rising costs and economic uncertainty, with the ongoing government shutdown potentially leading to further job cuts in the federal sector.</p>

This model emphasizes supply-chain cooperation and preferential tariffs while allowing Taiwanese tech firms to maintain their primary operations at home. The goal is to support the industry's expansion abroad without conceding domestic production capacity, securing key support from the U.S. on regulations and logistics.</p>

          <p>A coroner has ruled that high-profile conspiracy theorist Kate Shemirani unduly influenced her daughter, Paloma, to reject chemotherapy for her curable non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Paloma Shemirani, 23, died after opting for alternative treatments like coffee enemas advocated by her mother, a former nurse who was struck off for her anti-vaccination views. The coroner stated that conventional treatment would have offered an 80% chance of a complete cure. The ruling concluded that the influence exerted by her mother contributed more than minimally to her death by preventing her from receiving life-saving medical care.</p>

          <p>New analysis of data from the Cassini space probe reveals that the hidden ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus contains complex organic molecules, strengthening the case for its potential habitability. Scientists examined ice particles ejected from geysers on the moon's south pole, which were collected directly by the spacecraft. These particles confirm the presence of compounds that are precursors to amino acids, the building blocks of life. While this discovery enhances the likelihood that Enceladus could support life, researchers emphasize that being habitable is different from being inhabited, and further missions are needed for confirmation.</p>

          <p>On Thursday, market watchers are focused on several key developments, including Berkshire Hathaway's acquisition of Occidental Petroleum's OxyChem unit and strong third-quarter delivery numbers from Tesla. The ongoing government shutdown is causing delays in the release of crucial economic data, such as weekly jobless claims and the nonfarm payrolls report. In company-specific news, KeyBanc upgraded Nike, and JPMorgan highlighted Amazon and Broadcom as favorite stocks for October. Meanwhile, Taiwan rejected a U.S. proposal for an even split in chip production, signaling ongoing trade and supply chain negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the complexities of open adoption, where birth parents and adoptive families maintain some form of contact, revealing that these arrangements can be fragile and are not always legally enforceable. It shares stories of birth mothers who chose open adoption with the promise of a lasting connection to their child, only to have contact reduced or cut off by the adoptive parents. While open adoptions are intended to benefit adoptees by providing access to their history, the power imbalance often leaves birth mothers with little recourse when agreements are broken, leading to profound grief and a sense of loss.</p>

          <p>The Russian government is set to increase taxes as it seeks to sustain military spending amid a slowing economy. According to the 2026 draft budget, the Kremlin plans to raise the VAT from 20% to 22% and lower the revenue threshold for small businesses to pay VAT. This strategy aims to fund defense and security without increasing borrowing, which could fuel inflation. The move is seen by analysts as a way to pass the financial burden of the war in Ukraine onto the general public and businesses, as economic growth forecasts are revised downward.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has stated he will not resign following a BBC Panorama investigation that exposed evidence of misogyny and racism within the force. The investigation used secret filming to capture officers making vile comments about immigrants and being dismissive of sexual assault claims. Sir Mark called the footage "ghastly" but insisted that significant progress has been made in rooting out corrupt officers since he took charge three years ago. He acknowledged there was a "cancer to be removed" but stopped short of agreeing with findings that the force's problems are institutional.</p>

          <p>Malaysia's Ministry of Home Affairs has banned 24 books so far this year, more than in the previous six years combined, sparking alarm among publishers and human rights advocates. Nearly half of the banned titles touch on LGBTQ themes, reflecting a growing trend of conservative censorship in the country. Critics, including PEN Malaysia, argue that the spike in bans represents a regression of democratic space and freedom of expression under Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's government. Some analysts suggest the crackdown is a political maneuver to appeal to the country's conservative Muslim voter base.</p>

          <p>A central conflict in the government shutdown debate involves Republican claims that Democrats want to provide free health care to immigrants in the U.S. illegally, a charge Democrats deny. The dispute centers on a Democratic proposal to restore Medicaid eligibility for certain noncitizens with legal status, such as refugees and asylees, which had been restricted by a recent Republican bill. Federal law already prohibits taxpayer funds from covering non-emergency medical care for undocumented individuals. Democrats maintain their focus is on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits for American citizens, not on changing laws for immigrants.</p>

          <p>Despite a record number of foreign visitors, the practice of tipping remains a cultural taboo in Japan, often causing confusion or awkwardness for service staff. In Japanese culture, excellent service is considered a standard part of the job, not something that requires an additional payment. While a few establishments in tourist-heavy areas have introduced tip jars, the concept is widely resisted by locals who believe employees should earn a sufficient wage without needing gratuities. Many restaurant owners report that staff will often chase down customers who leave cash on the table, assuming it was forgotten.</p>

          <p>A video showing former President Donald Trump promoting "MedBeds," a conspiracy theory about magical beds that can cure any disease, has been identified as a fake created with artificial intelligence. The video, which briefly appeared on Trump's Truth Social platform, contained several tell-tale signs of AI generation, including mismatched mouth movements and distorted details in the background. The MedBed myth, popular in far-right online communities, claims a secret technology is being withheld from the public.

          <p>Speculation is growing that China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, is preparing to officially enter service after it was photographed berthed next to the country's second carrier, the Shandong, at a naval base in Sanya. The Fujian, which features advanced electromagnetic catapults for launching aircraft, recently completed sea trials off the coast of Hainan. Its deployment to the southern naval base marks a significant step in its development. The side-by-side positioning of the two carriers suggests the People's Liberation Army Navy is advancing its carrier operations and power projection capabilities.</p>
