          <p>The author, Maria Yagoda, discusses her experience with hair loss during and after chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, highlighting the emotional impact and challenges of regrowth. She recounts trying cold capping to reduce hair loss during treatment, which proved to be a torturous experience. Yagoda explores the science of hair regrowth, the various treatments available, and the psychological toll of losing hair, especially for women, and the constant barrage of advertisements making dubious claims about hair regrowth. She also touches on the experiences of others dealing with hair loss due to medical conditions, childbirth, and the frustrations of ineffective treatments, emphasizing the importance of addressing the root cause of hair loss and finding a dermatologist who takes the issue seriously. The article sheds light on the emotional and psychological impact of hair loss, while also describing the difficulties and complexities of hair regrowth. </p>

          <h2>Understanding Animal Instincts: The Case of the Tailorbird and Beyond</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 06:06:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the concept of animal instincts through the example of the common tailorbird, which sews leaves together to create its nest. It delves into whether such behaviors are innate or learned, challenging the simplistic view of instinct as purely genetic. The article presents a conversation with neuroscientist Mark Blumberg, who argues against the term 'instinct' due to its multiple definitions and instead advocates for 'species-typical' behavior. Blumberg emphasizes that behaviors are shaped by a complex interplay of genetics, environment, and learning, rather than being solely determined by DNA, with complex behaviors like nest-building involving the manipulation of available materials in the environment. The discussion extends to other animal behaviors, such as herding in dogs, and highlights the importance of considering the entire system, including the animal's body, experiences, and learning, to understand behavior, and it concludes by stressing the importance of understanding behavior for both curiosity and practical reasons, such as addressing behavioral problems and improving teaching outcomes.</p>

          <p>The Honolulu Police Department is facing a lawsuit from the ACLU of Hawaii, alleging that officers are arresting sober drivers to inflate DUI arrest numbers. The lawsuit claims that officers are incentivized to make DUI arrests, even without probable cause, and that supervisors allow officers to go home early with full pay if they make a DUI arrest. The ACLU alleges that the department's focus on DUI arrests has led to investigative shortcuts and unlawful detentions, with many drivers testing 0.00 for blood alcohol content. The department has responded by initiating a comprehensive review of impaired driving arrests dating back to 2021, and the lawsuit seeks to declare the department's practices unconstitutional and unlawful.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's four-month tenure at the White House as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) has concluded, marked by significant spending cuts and considerable controversy. Musk, tasked with reducing government spending, claims to have saved $175 billion through various measures, including asset sales and workforce reductions, although some figures lack supporting evidence. His efforts have faced legal challenges and accusations of mistakes, such as erroneously cutting aid programs. Musk's presence in the White House has also raised ethical concerns due to potential conflicts of interest between his government role and his companies' business dealings, particularly regarding contracts and international ventures, and his actions have contributed to a more isolationist approach in US foreign aid.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his associate Steve Witkoff are under scrutiny for their involvement with World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm, following a $2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi. The investment, made by a firm controlled by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and violations of the emoluments clause. Critics argue that the deal could influence U.S. policy decisions, particularly regarding semiconductor exports to the UAE. The White House denies any conflicts of interest, stating that Witkoff is divesting from World Liberty and Trump's assets are managed by his children, but some senators remain skeptical, viewing the situation as a quid pro quo.</p>

Senator David McCormick disclosed that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of U.S. board members, with the U.S. government holding a golden share to ensure production levels are maintained.

          <p>The House Republicans' "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" proposes changes to federal student loan repayment plans, potentially extending the repayment period to 30 years. Under the proposed plan, borrowers would have two repayment options: a fixed payment plan over 10 to 25 years, or an income-driven repayment plan with loan forgiveness after 30 years. Experts express concern that a 30-year repayment term could lead to prolonged debt burdens for borrowers. The bill has passed in the House, and with Republican control of Congress, it is likely to pass the Senate and be signed into law by President Trump, according to experts. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy Jr.'s approach to autism research as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, arguing that his focus on environmental toxins is misguided. Kennedy has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal effort to find environmental causes, dismissing genetic research as a "dead end". However, many autism scientists believe that genetics play a more significant role in the development of autism, citing numerous identified genes associated with the condition. Researchers fear that Kennedy's emphasis on toxins could divert resources from genetic research, which has led to the development of new therapies. </p>

The agreement follows technical talks between the two nations, with China citing Japan's promise to take "credible and visible measures to guarantee the quality and safety" of aquatic products.

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against several oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP, and Chevron, alleging they are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave in 2021.

The lawsuit seeks damages and a public education campaign to correct misinformation.

          <p>One year after being convicted for falsifying business records related to a hush money scheme, Donald Trump continues to challenge the verdict. A federal appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments regarding the attempt to move the case from state to federal court. Trump's lawyers argue that the conviction relied on evidence related to his official acts as president, and that a Supreme Court ruling expanding presidential immunity would have affected the trial. Trump, who was sentenced to an unconditional discharge, maintains his innocence and claims the prosecution was politically motivated.</p>

          <p>China's power grid has implemented a new safeguard against catastrophic collapses: a quantum-powered "diamond ring" that can detect grid instability in real time. The device, developed by the University of Science and Technology of China in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation, acts as a high-precision sentinel for power lines. This advancement comes after sweeping outages paralyzed Spain, Portugal, and France, and similar chaos struck China’s Xinjiang region, highlighting the challenge of integrating weather-dependent renewables into traditional monitoring systems. The "diamond ring" uses nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors to provide unprecedented precision in monitoring grid stability.</p>

The bill, part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," includes significant changes to the tax treatment of foreign capital in the U.S. and targets entities from "discriminatory foreign countries" that impose levies affecting U.S. companies. Experts warn that this legislation could transform a trade war into a capital war by using taxation on foreign holdings of U.S. assets as leverage to further U.S. economic goals.

The author argues that Musk's actions, aimed at cutting government spending, have resulted in the termination of over 80 percent of USAID grants, leading to an estimated 300,000 deaths, primarily among children. The article cites reports of increased cases of advanced HIV symptoms and severe malnutrition in refugee camps due to the withdrawal of aid, challenging White House officials' denial of these consequences.
