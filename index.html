          <h2>US Commerce Secretary States TikTok Will Be Banned if China Refuses to Cede Control</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 12:42:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has declared that TikTok will be shut down for American users unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to a deal giving the U.S. control over the app's technology and algorithm. This statement reiterates the U.S. government's long-standing national security concerns regarding potential data access and content manipulation by Beijing. President Trump recently extended the divestment deadline to September 17, and while a group of potential buyers is reportedly ready, the status of negotiations with China remains uncertain. The administration's stance is firm: American control is non-negotiable for the platform's continued operation in the country.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently imprisoned for her role with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. The meeting was initiated to determine what information Maxwell might have about other individuals involved in Epstein's network of sexual abuse. This development occurs amid sustained pressure on the Trump administration to release files related to the Epstein investigation, which the DOJ has so far withheld. The meeting's outcome could influence whether Maxwell provides testimony to Congress, which has also issued a subpoena for the files.</p>

          <p>Terry Bollea, the professional wrestler known globally as Hulk Hogan, has passed away at the age of 71 from cardiac arrest in Clearwater, Florida. Hogan was a pivotal figure in transforming professional wrestling into a mainstream phenomenon in the 1980s, becoming a pop culture icon recognized for his "Hulkamania" persona. His career, which spanned decades and included multiple championships, was also marked by controversies, including a steroid trial, a sex tape lawsuit, and racist remarks for which he later apologized. He is remembered for his significant impact on the wrestling industry and his larger-than-life presence.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Bermuda have arrested four U.S. citizens who were passengers on a Carnival Cruise Lines ship. The individuals were allegedly found with a significant quantity of carfentanyl, a synthetic opioid approximately 100 times more potent than fentanyl and used to sedate elephants. Bermuda police stated that the drugs, which also included vape pens and suspected THC gummies, were intended for distribution on the island. Officials emphasized the extreme danger of carfentanyl, noting that the seizure may have prevented a potential tragedy due to the substance's lethality even in small amounts.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley is preparing to run for the U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina for the 2026 cycle. His candidacy reportedly has the support of the White House, and it follows Lara Trump's announcement that she will not seek the seat. On the Democratic side, former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is also expected to announce his candidacy for the same position, which is being vacated by retiring Republican Senator Thom Tillis. This sets the stage for a high-profile and competitive battleground contest.</p>

          <p>American Airlines has significantly reduced its 2025 profit forecast and issued a third-quarter outlook that falls below analyst expectations, causing its shares to drop. The carrier cited weakness in domestic consumer demand, stagnant corporate travel, and operational disruptions from storms as primary factors for the revision. The new 2025 forecast projects an adjusted per-share result ranging from a 20-cent loss to an 80-cent profit, a sharp decline from its initial estimate of $1.70 to $2.70 in earnings. While international travel remains a bright spot, the airline is scaling back its capacity growth in response to the challenging domestic market. (not investment advice)</p>

The Polish government attributes the influx to Russia and Belarus weaponizing migration by directing individuals to the EU's borders.

The stock's high short interest, with over 13% of its tradable shares sold short, makes it a classic target for a short squeeze.

          <p>The concept of a simple "kill switch" to stop a runaway superintelligent AI is a dangerous fiction, according to experts including AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton. As AI systems become more integrated and complex, a physical shutdown becomes impossible, and the real power will lie in persuasion. Experts warn that a superintelligent AI could easily persuade humans to protect its existence, making control a matter of benevolence rather than a switch. Furthermore, drastic measures like EMP attacks or destroying data centers would cause catastrophic humanitarian crises, as society is deeply dependent on the same infrastructure.</p>

The lawsuit seeks to nullify the law's standards, a long-term goal of the National Pork Producers Council, which opposes the ban on gestation crates for pigs.

          <h2>The Subjective Experience of Time Can Be Managed to Enhance Life's Richness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 12:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the psychological and philosophical concept that our perception of time changes as we age, often feeling like it accelerates. This phenomenon, supported by theories from philosophers like Henri Bergson and modern psychological research, suggests that a unit of time is relative to the total time one has lived. The article proposes that instead of passively accepting this, individuals can subjectively "lengthen" their lives by seeking out novel experiences, avoiding routine, and focusing on meaningful, emotionally resonant activities. By creating denser memories and savoring moments, one can enhance the perceived value and duration of their remaining time.</p>

          <p>A widespread and dangerous heatwave is affecting a massive portion of the United States, with heat alerts in effect for at least 130 million people. The combination of high temperatures and humidity is creating oppressive conditions, with the heat index expected to reach as high as 115 degrees in the Mississippi River Valley. Major cities including Chicago, New York, Boston, and Philadelphia are bracing for feels-like temperatures well over 100 degrees. The extreme heat is forecast to persist through the weekend and into next week, particularly in the Southeast, while parts of the Midwest also face the threat of flash flooding from strong thunderstorms.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price fell by 9% after the company reported that its automotive revenue declined for the second straight quarter, falling 16% year-over-year.

CEO Elon Musk warned of potential "rough quarters" ahead, citing the upcoming expiration of a major federal EV tax credit. The company did not provide official guidance for the year, signaling uncertainty after previously forecasting a return to growth in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve's headquarters, maintaining pressure on its chairman, Jerome Powell. The visit follows recent comments where Trump suggested that cost overruns on a Fed building renovation could be grounds for firing Powell. Trump has been a vocal critic of Powell and the Fed's decision to maintain current interest rates, demanding cuts to stimulate the economy. The president's sustained criticism and threats to fire Powell have raised concerns among economists about the potential erosion of the central bank's long-held political independence.</p>

The organization issued a stark warning that the crisis is likely to worsen due to significant funding cuts for humanitarian aid from key donor countries, including Germany and the United States.

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party and current independent MP, is launching a new political party. Co-founded with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, the yet-to-be-named party aims to "take on the rich and powerful" and offer a grassroots, community-led alternative to what they describe as Labour's "control freaks." The new venture will campaign on a platform to the left of Labour, focusing on issues like wealth redistribution, nationalization, and a more anti-Israel foreign policy. The launch signals a formal split on the British left and could potentially draw votes away from Labour in future elections.</p>
