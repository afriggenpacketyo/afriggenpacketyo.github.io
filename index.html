          <p>PayPal announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates for both earnings and revenue, prompting the company to raise its full-year guidance. Despite the positive report, the company's stock experienced a slight decline in after-hours trading. Key metrics like total payment volume and transaction margin dollars showed healthy growth, with its Venmo platform seeing a significant revenue increase of over 20%. The updated outlook suggests a strong fourth quarter, reflecting CEO Alex Chriss's focus on monetizing key assets and improving profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk fell sharply by 17% after it lowered its full-year sales and profit forecasts. The company attributed the revised guidance to weaker-than-expected growth for its popular obesity drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic in the United States. Factors contributing to the downgrade include persistent competition from compounded versions of the drugs and a slower expansion of the market. This news signals significant challenges for one of the company's key growth drivers in its largest market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spotify's stock dropped after the music streaming service reported second-quarter revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations and provided a lackluster forecast for the third quarter. The company posted a net loss, a significant downturn from the net income reported in the same period last year. While the platform saw an 11% increase in monthly active users and a 12% rise in paying subscribers, its revenue guidance for the current quarter was below analyst estimates, partly due to foreign exchange headwinds.

          <p>Boeing reported a significant reduction in its quarterly losses and a 35% jump in revenue, fueled by its highest number of airplane deliveries since 2018. The aerospace giant's adjusted loss per share was narrower than analysts had anticipated, signaling progress in its recovery efforts. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," citing improved production stability and performance across the company. However, Boeing still faces challenges, including delays in the certification of its 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fierce competition for top-tier artificial intelligence talent is underway, with tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, and Google offering massive compensation packages, reportedly up to $100 million, to lure a small pool of elite engineers. This "talent war" is driving significant salary inflation and making it difficult for AI startups to retain their key employees. The trend reflects a strategic shift where large corporations are aggressively building their AI capabilities by poaching top individuals, which could reshape the collaborative culture of the startup ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A significant policy conflict is emerging within the Trump administration between the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency. While HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) initiative aims to reduce public exposure to environmental toxins, the EPA, under administrator Lee Zeldin, is actively rolling back regulations on pesticides, PFAS chemicals, and pollutants like mercury. This contradiction is causing frustration among MAHA supporters, who are pressuring Kennedy to challenge the EPA's pro-industry agenda.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's planned tariffs, set to begin August 1, are likely to increase prices on certain imported foods for American consumers, according to a Tax Foundation analysis. The report highlights that items like Brazilian coffee, bananas, and various baked goods, which are not produced in sufficient quantities domestically, will be affected. As U.S. companies that import these goods pay the tariff tax, the additional costs are expected to be passed on to consumers, potentially causing significant price movements in the coming months.

The restoration showcases the plane's opulent 1950s interior and serves as a tribute to the innovation and the tragic lessons that paved the way for modern aviation safety.</p>

The author argues that excluding specific populations from research creates dangerous gaps in medical knowledge, repeats historical mistakes, and exacerbates health disparities for millions of people. This policy sends a message that the health of nearly 32 million LGBTQ+ Americans is not a priority, which will ultimately lead to worse health outcomes and increased marginalization.</p>
