          <p>China's top intelligence agency has cautioned former state employees with access to sensitive information about the risks of leaking state secrets, emphasizing that managing these workers post-employment is critical for national security. The Ministry of State Security highlighted the importance of vigilance to ensure information security, citing a case where an individual named Feng was imprisoned for leaking secrets after being lured by a foreign espionage agency with a consulting fee. Feng maintained ties with former colleagues and accessed classified information in a critical industry sector. The ministry urged former employees not to view declassification periods as freedom or career shackles, but to remain aware of their responsibilities to national security. The article emphasizes China's focus on preventing espionage and protecting state secrets. </p>

          <p>King Charles III's visit to Canada is intended to highlight Canada's sovereignty in response to suggestions from U.S. President Donald Trump about annexing the country. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, outlining the government's agenda for the new Parliament, which is a rare occurrence. The King's visit is meant to demonstrate the differences between Canada and the U.S., emphasizing Canada's history as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system. While Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, Carney hopes the visit will send a clear message about Canada's distinct identity and independence from the United States, particularly in light of Trump's remarks and actions. The article explains the historical context of Canada's relationship with Britain and the significance of the King's role in the Canadian government. </p>

          <p>Venezuela's electoral council, filled with Nicolás Maduro loyalists, declared an overwhelming victory for his party in regional and legislative elections, although independent vote monitors were absent. Critics are calling the election a sham to legitimize Maduro's government, with results announced on state television without providing evidence. Despite sparsely populated polling places, the electoral council claimed a turnout higher than 40 percent, although the results were not posted online, which is a departure from previous elections. Opposition leader María Corina Machado called for people to abstain, while Henrique Capriles urged participation to rally the opposition for future fights.

          <p>President Trump has postponed imposing 50 percent tariffs on all imports from the European Union until July 9, allowing more time for trade negotiations. This decision follows a conversation with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, where she requested additional time to reach a trade agreement. Trump has previously expressed frustration with the EU's slow pace in offering trade concessions during the 90-day negotiation window. The extension represents a shift in Trump's trade policies, which have introduced significant uncertainty into the global economy. The article also mentions that economists have warned that tariffs and related uncertainty were slowing business investment around the world and disrupting supply chains.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has criticized the Australian government's plan to end a Chinese firm's control of the Darwin Port, calling it "questionable." Landbridge Group, a Chinese company, was granted a 99-year lease of the port in 2015, a deal that is now under scrutiny due to national interest concerns. Xiao argued that Landbridge Group has made significant investments in maintaining and building the port, contributing to the local economy. He expressed hope that Australia would view the project objectively and foster mutual trust, urging the Australian government to create a fair business environment for Chinese companies.

          <p>India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Canada's new Foreign Minister Anita Anand had a phone call, marking the first diplomatic contact between Ottawa and New Delhi since Mark Carney became Canadian prime minister. The call signals a potential effort to repair the strained bilateral relations that deteriorated during former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's tenure, particularly following the death of a Canadian Sikh. Relations soured after Canada accused India of orchestrating the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Khalistan supporter, and both countries expelled top diplomats. Both New Delhi and Ottawa are considering restoring their High Commissioners by June, indicating a move towards normalizing relations. </p>

          <p>Businesses are finding a way to minimize the impact of tariffs by using a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule." This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions. For example, a U.S. retailer can pay the import duty on the initial price of a good from a factory to a vendor, rather than the vendor's inflated price.
