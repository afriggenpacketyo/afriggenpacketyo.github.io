          <p>Shohei Ohtani struck out six batters in three simulated innings, marking another step in his pitching comeback.

          <p>The UK's Spending Review is highlighting a Â£39 billion investment in affordable housing, described as the biggest boost in a generation, according to the Financial Times. While the Daily Mail reports a jobs slump, the Times notes that even with a Â£30 billion boost, the NHS will struggle to meet waiting list targets. Government plans to decriminalize rough sleeping are also featured, alongside international news of a school attack in Austria and sanctions on Israeli ministers. The review reflects the government's priorities and economic challenges. Optimism score is 50.</p>
