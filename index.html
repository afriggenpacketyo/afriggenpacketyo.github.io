          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James's town hall was briefly interrupted by a Donald Trump supporter who accused her of wasting taxpayer money on a "witch hunt" and claimed she would face imprisonment for mortgage fraud. The crowd responded with boos, and the man was escorted out. James, who is known for her lawsuit against Trump and his family members alleging financial fraud, did not directly respond to the man but thanked him for attending. The Department of Justice has since opened a criminal investigation into James following accusations that she misrepresented a single-family home in Virginia as her primary residence to obtain more favorable loan terms.</p>

          <p>China's recent stimulus efforts, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have not significantly boosted its stock market, as investors remain concerned about the ongoing trade war with the U.S. The stimulus package, while aligned with economic priorities outlined at last month's Politburo meeting, is seen as a temporary fix rather than a comprehensive solution. Unlike previous stimulus measures, this round is more targeted at industrial and social needs rather than direct market support. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and prop up the real estate sector for a meaningful market rally.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaans South Africans, descendants of Dutch colonizers, who are expected to arrive in the U.S. This marks the first group of Afrikaners accepted by the U.S. after President Trump signed an executive order prioritizing humanitarian relief for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination in South Africa. The group has been given P1 refugee status, granting them a pathway to U.S. citizenship and eligibility for government benefits. President Trump and others have claimed that Afrikaners are facing persecution in South Africa, while the South African government has denied these allegations, calling the move ironic given the deportation of vulnerable people from other parts of the world.</p>

          <p>Columbia University's response to pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupying the main library was markedly different from previous incidents, with campus security intervening aggressively and arresting protesters before NYPD arrived. The university's assertive approach has been praised by some, including the Trump administration's antisemitism task force, but criticized by those who believe unarmed demonstrators should not be met with force. Demonstrators vandalized the library with graffiti, leading to its temporary closure. This incident reflects a broader shift in how universities are handling disruptive protests.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax hike on rich Americans in the upcoming fiscal package. Trump wants to create a new top income bracket for those making over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6%. This proposal would roll back part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered the top rate to 37%. The potential tax increase is being considered alongside proposed cuts to Medicaid, a healthcare program for the poor.</p>
