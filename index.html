          <p>David Challen successfully campaigned for his mother, Sally Challen's release from prison after she killed his father, Richard, with a hammer, revealing decades of coercive control she endured. David's book, 'The Unthinkable,' details the family's experiences, highlighting the insidious nature of non-physical violence and the lack of language to describe it. A 2015 law recognizing psychological manipulation as domestic abuse aided Sally's release after her murder conviction was quashed and a manslaughter plea was accepted. David now advocates for domestic abuse victims, emphasizing the need to address coercive control, which he says was normalized in his childhood home, including routine sexual assault. He wrote the book to give voice to those growing up in similar situations and to push for greater awareness and action against domestic abuse.</p>

          <p>Ukraine reportedly launched a significant drone attack targeting airfields in five Russian regions, resulting in fires affecting several aircraft, according to Russia's Defense Ministry. The Ukrainian SBU intelligence agency claimed responsibility, estimating damages to Russian strategic aviation at $7 billion. The strikes reportedly hit Tu-95 and Tu-22M strategic bombers, as well as A-50 surveillance aircraft, demonstrating Ukraine's capacity to strike deep within Russian territory. This operation occurs as peace negotiations are scheduled between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul, indicating a complex interplay of military action and diplomatic efforts. The situation underscores the escalating conflict and the strategic importance of air power. The attack represents a significant blow to Russia's military capabilities. </p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul expressed reservations about President Trump's "one big beautiful bill," citing concerns about the rising national debt. Paul opposes the legislation's provision to raise the debt ceiling, arguing that it would add trillions to the national debt and remove accountability for government spending. He suggested removing the debt ceiling component and voting on it separately, potentially allowing him to support the tax components of the bill. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the bill, pointing to potential revenue from tariffs, while emphasizing that the United States would not default on its debt. The debate highlights divisions within the Republican party regarding fiscal policy and the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russell Vought, the OMB director, suggested the White House might not need Congressional approval for all of President Trump's proposed federal workforce cuts. Vought indicated the administration would rely on "executive tools" like impoundment, withholding funds allocated by Congress, for many cuts, submitting only a fraction of the cuts to Congress for approval. Critics argue that this approach undermines Congressional authority and could lead to legal challenges, particularly regarding the use of impoundment. Vought defended the cuts as necessary for government efficiency, while also disputing claims that the President's One Big Beautiful Bill would increase the deficit. The situation underscores ongoing tensions between the executive and legislative branches regarding budgetary control.</p>

          <p>An attack near a food aid distribution center in Gaza resulted in the deaths of more than 30 people and injuries to scores of others. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses reported the incident, alleging Israeli forces were responsible, but the Israeli military denied involvement. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) delivered aid earlier that day and dismissed reports of casualties around its sites. This incident occurred as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas faltered, with both sides trading blame for the lack of progress.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson defended cuts to Medicaid in the House spending bill, stating that recipients will "choose" whether to lose health care due to work requirements. He argued that the work requirements are not overly burdensome and that they should have been implemented long ago. Democrats, including Senator Raphael Warnock, criticized the bill, arguing that reporting requirements will lead to millions losing health care coverage. The bill now heads to the Senate, where its future is uncertain.</p>

          <p>Manchester United faces a crucial summer transfer window after a disappointing season. Signing Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers could address the team's goalscoring issues. Cunha's goal involvements and versatility align with Ruben Amorim's preferred 3-4-3/3-5-2 system. Securing Cunha would provide Amorim with a key resource to succeed and revitalize the team.</p>
