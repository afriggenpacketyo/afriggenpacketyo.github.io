          <p>The UK government is set to announce the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, many of which were established in the 1950s. The initiative aims to reduce flight times and delays by allowing planes to climb and descend more efficiently. Aviation Minister Mike Kane stated that modernizing airspace is a simple way to reduce pollution from flying and will set the industry up for a sustainable future. UKADS is expected to be fully operational by the end of the year, marking the largest redesign of UK airspace in decades, accommodating the significant increase in flights since the 1950s. This transformation prioritizes environmental impacts and community well-being.</p>

Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, holds a significant lead, with a Gallup poll showing 49% of respondents favoring him. Goldman Sachs noted that both Lee and his rival, Kim Moon Soo, share goals of economic growth and stable financial markets, but differ on economic policy platforms. Lee favors fiscal support for strategic industries, while Kim prefers revitalizing private entrepreneurship through deregulation and tax cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China refuted accusations from the Trump administration that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, instead claiming that the U.S. is undermining the deal. Tensions have risen following a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng, which initially led to a 90-day suspension of most tariffs. China's commerce department spokesperson said that the U.S. has continued to unilaterally provoke new economic and trade frictions, increasing uncertainty and instability. China vows to take measures to safeguard its rights and benefits if the U.S. presses ahead with actions that damage China's interests.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, backed by the previous right-wing governing party, has been elected as Poland's president, narrowly defeating liberal Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski. This victory will likely complicate Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to advance his liberal agenda. The outcome suggests Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by President Trump. While most day-to-day power rests with the prime minister, the president holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation, posing potential obstacles to Tusk's promises.</p>

          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki, backed by President Trump, won Poland's presidential election, narrowly defeating liberal Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by President Trump. While most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are set to meet in Istanbul for another round of U.S.-brokered peace talks aimed at ending Russia's invasion, though previous talks have failed to achieve a ceasefire. Ukraine is calling for a full 30-day ceasefire for negotiations, while Russia retains maximalist war goals, including annexation of Ukrainian regions. The talks come after a Ukrainian drone attack on strategic bomber bases inside Russia, which Moscow framed as a terrorist attack. Long-range drone and missile attacks continued overnight, with both sides claiming to have shot down numerous drones.</p>

Russia proposed another attempt at peace negotiations with Ukraine on Monday in Istanbul, but both sides remain firmly entrenched in their positions on territorial disputes and sovereignty that have thus far made substantial progress unlikely. The talks come a day after Ukraine launched one of the most stunning attacks of the war. In what a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told ABC News was an operation one and a half years in the making, operatives used attack drones concealed in containers carried by trucks to attack strategic bomber bases deep inside Russian territory.</p>

Mo'unga, who was visibly emotional at the end of the match in front of 51,009, likened the Brave Lupus No. 8 and Japan's 2019 Rugby World Cup skipper to a "big brother" whose influence was felt throughout the Toshiba-owned club, based in the western Tokyo city of Fuchu. Todd Blackadder said the joint leadership provided by Mo'unga and the 36-year-old Leitch had been the bedrock for Brave Lupus as they became the first two-time champions in the League One era.</p>
