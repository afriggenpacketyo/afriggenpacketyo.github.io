          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with a fractured vertebrae and additional injuries following a high-speed car accident in New Hampshire on Saturday evening. His vehicle, driven by his spokesperson, was struck from behind by a 19-year-old woman's car, causing both to hit the highway median. State police are investigating the crash, but Giuliani's security chief stated it was not a targeted attack. Despite sustaining multiple lacerations and contusions, Giuliani is reportedly in good spirits and recovering well, a testament to his resilience after a challenging few years.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has appointed Sergio Gor, his personnel chief and a close confidant, as the next US Ambassador to India, with a mandate also covering other South and Central Asian countries. The appointment has drawn mixed reactions, with some seeing it as a positive due to Gor's proximity to Trump, while others worry about his limited diplomatic experience and the broad regional role potentially complicating India-Pakistan relations. Experts suggest India may feel slighted by the shared envoy position, further straining US-India ties already impacted by Trump's tariffs. The article highlights Gor's background in Republican politics and publishing Trump's books.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old boy in Houston was critically injured after being shot while allegedly participating in a door-knocking prank, similar to the "Ding Dong Ditch" or "Door Kicking Challenge." Police reported that someone fired shots after the boy and his friends knocked on a neighbor's door and ran away. One person has been detained for questioning, but no charges have been filed yet as the investigation continues. This incident highlights the dangerous consequences of such pranks, with similar events leading to arrests and injuries in other Texas cities and warnings from police departments.</p>

Despite strong crowd support, Townsend, who was seeking her first Grand Slam singles quarter-final, couldn't overcome the two-time major champion. She was visibly emotional after the match, receiving a standing ovation as she left the court. Krejcikova will now face Jessica Pegula, while Townsend continues in the women's doubles tournament.</p>

          <p>Days after trading All-Pro Micah Parsons, the Dallas Cowboys have secured cornerback DaRon Bland with a four-year, $92 million extension, including $50 million guaranteed. This deal places Bland among the NFL's highest-paid cornerbacks, recognizing his exceptional 2023 season where he led the league in interceptions and set a record with five pick-sixes, despite playing only seven games due to injury. The extension allows the Cowboys to allocate resources after Parsons' large contract was taken on by the Packers, aiming to fortify their defense for the future.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles have secured their third consecutive men's title in The Hundred cricket tournament, demonstrating consistent dominance through expert team building and a stable core of players. Their success is attributed to strategic selections, strong leg-spin bowling, and explosive late-innings batting. However, the article suggests this era might be ending due to impending changes in the tournament's ownership and format, potentially transitioning to a T20 event and introducing new auction rules that could dismantle the current successful squads. This creates uncertainty for the future of the Invincibles' dominant run.</p>

          <p>China's navy has become the world's largest by vessel count, driven by massive investment in shipbuilding that far outpaces the United States. This rapid expansion, visible at shipyards like Dalian, fuels Beijing's growing ambitions in the South China Sea and beyond. While the US still holds advantages in overall tonnage and advanced carriers, China is quickly narrowing the gap, with analysts noting its impressive production capacity and dual-use shipyards. President Xi Jinping's goal is a "strong navy" to safeguard national security and overcome historical humiliations, as global powers watch for China's increasing projection of power.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris expressed determination to "go for it" in the world championship despite a significant setback at the Dutch Grand Prix, where he retired due to an oil leak. The retirement dropped him 34 points behind McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri, who won the race. Norris, frustrated by the loss of points and the difficulty of overtaking at Zandvoort, still believes he had the pace. While the gap is substantial, with nine races remaining, Norris remains focused on winning every race, and his team principal Andrea Stella affirms his continued belief in Norris's title chances.</p>

          <p>Manchester City has made its worst Premier League start since the 2004-05 season, following a 2-1 defeat to Brighton, raising questions about their title aspirations. Despite significant transfer spending and the return of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, the team has shown inconsistency. Manager Pep Guardiola noted the team "forgot to play" after conceding, but remains optimistic about the long season ahead. While historical data suggests teams rarely recover from such a start to win the title, City hopes the return of key players like Rodri and Erling Haaland's goal-scoring form can turn their season around.</p>

While Ukraine finds workarounds for military aid, the conflict persists, with Putin leveraging his patience and an imperialist inner circle.
