            <p>The family of Oded Lifshitz, an 83-year-old hostage killed by Hamas, continues to fight for the release of those still held in Gaza. Oded and his wife Yocheved were taken from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7, 2023 attacks, with Yocheved later released.  Daniel Lifshitz, their grandson, emphasized the need for all hostages to return for the community to heal, noting that his grandparents were peace activists who aided Palestinian children seeking cancer treatment in Israel. His grandmother felt betrayed not by Hamas, but by the Palestinian civilians who she and her husband had spent years helping. The family criticizes the international community's failure and sees the return of Oded, Ariel and Kfir Bibas' bodies as symbolic of this failure.</p>

The park will include a theme park, a 500-room hotel, and a retail complex, with construction planned to begin in 2026 pending government approval.  Universal plans to upgrade local infrastructure, including Wixams railway station and the A42, and the project has received strong local support.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant decline after the Trump administration announced a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, reversing earlier gains driven by hopes of tariff negotiations.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also experiencing substantial losses, exacerbating a multi-day sell-off fueled by concerns over the economic impact of widespread tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's earlier optimistic comments about potential trade deals were overshadowed by the White House's confirmation of the tariff implementation.  Analysts warn that the tariffs could lead to increased inflation and a potential recession, prompting speculation about the Federal Reserve intervening to cut interest rates (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has directed the Trump administration to reinstate access for Associated Press (AP) journalists to presidential events after the White House restricted their access due to a dispute over the term "Gulf of America." Judge Trevor McFadden ruled that the administration's actions violated the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, stating that the government cannot selectively exclude journalists based on their viewpoints. The AP argued that the restrictions infringed on their constitutional right to free speech, while the Trump administration maintained that the AP was not entitled to "special access" to the president. The ruling was welcomed by press freedom advocates, who criticized the initial restrictions as retaliatory and unconstitutional.</p>

            <p>The State Department is facing criticism for cutting over $1.3 billion in foreign aid, impacting programs that provide food, water, and medicine to countries like Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, and Lebanon. Advocates warn that these cuts could be a "death sentence for millions" facing extreme hunger and starvation.  The State Department claims that the majority of funding to the World Food Programme (WFP) remains active, but some programs were terminated due to concerns that funding was benefiting terrorist groups or due to the administration's move away from cash-based assistance. Some awards were inadvertently eliminated but have since been restored.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian forces have reportedly captured two Chinese nationals fighting for the Russian army in the Donetsk region. President Zelensky stated that intelligence suggests a larger number of Chinese soldiers are involved. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister condemned Russia's involvement of Chinese citizens, questioning China's stance on peace and summoning their envoy for an explanation.  The US State Department has called the reports "disturbing," citing China as a major enabler of Russia's war through the supply of dual-use goods.</p>

            <p>The State Department clarified that upcoming discussions with Iran are "not a negotiation" but a "meeting" to reiterate that Iran will not be allowed to possess nuclear weapons. Despite this, both the State Department and White House emphasize President Trump's desire to reach a deal with Tehran.  The meeting will be represented by Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East. The announcement follows conflicting reports, with Iran characterizing the talks as indirect and high-level, while the US maintains they will be direct.</p>

The judge emphasized that while the AP does not have a right to special access, it cannot be excluded based on its viewpoint. The AP expressed gratitude for the court's decision, affirming the fundamental right of the press to speak freely.</p>
