          <p>CoreWeave's stock experienced a surge after Microsoft, a major client, reported strong cloud sales and confirmed its spending plans for the upcoming fiscal year. Meta, another significant CoreWeave customer, also boosted its forecast for 2025 capital expenditures, further contributing to investor confidence. Despite concerns raised by President Trump's proposed tariffs on imports, Microsoft executives indicated that their buildout plans for AI infrastructure remain relatively stable. CoreWeave, which went public in March, provides Nvidia GPUs and competes with top cloud providers, with Microsoft accounting for a substantial portion of its revenue in 2024.

          <p>Former Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams has expressed feeling insulted by the BBC's response to his complaint regarding a Spotlight program that alleged he sanctioned the murder of informer Denis Donaldson in 2006, an allegation Adams vehemently denies. Adams is suing the BBC for damages at the High Court in Dublin, asserting that the BBC's lawyers rejected his solicitors' request for an apology and compensation, claiming the allegation was spurious and motivated by malice. The BBC maintains that the program was a product of responsible journalism, adhering to its editorial guidelines, and doubled down on the allegations, dismissing efforts to resolve the issue, according to Adams. The case is ongoing, with the BBC arguing the broadcast was in good faith and concerned a matter of public interest.</p>

Meta's finance chief, Susan Li, provided in-line guidance for the current period, anticipating sales to range between $42.5 billion and $45.5 billion, while CEO Mark Zuckerberg reassured analysts that the company is well-positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty. Analysts noted that Meta's advertising demand trends appear healthy, with the company's scale of users and advertisers, coupled with a focus on newer products, offsetting some macroeconomic challenges.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs rejected a plea deal during the final pre-trial hearing in his sexual assault and racketeering case in New York City. Jury selection is scheduled to begin next week, with prospective jurors having already filled out questionnaires. Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to five counts, including transportation to engage in prostitution and sexual assault, could face decades in prison if convicted. The defense raised concerns about an alleged victim's attorney giving a TV interview, prompting the judge to remind all attorneys to adhere to rules of professional conduct.

          <p>Paul Dabbar, President Trump's nominee for deputy secretary of commerce, emphasized the need for America to re-industrialize and decrease its dependence on China in critical technologies like semiconductors, 6G, and quantum computing. During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, Dabbar highlighted the importance of limiting Beijing's influence over global supply chains and emerging technologies. He stated that China's accession to the WTO had a detrimental impact on the US economy, resulting in the loss of millions of jobs. Dabbar proposed reframing the US trade strategy with China around national security, re-industrialization, tariff leverage, and revenue generation.</p>

          <p>A fourth round of Iran-US talks regarding Tehran's nuclear program has been postponed due to "logistical and technical reasons," according to Iran's foreign minister. The postponement coincides with President Trump's threat of action against those buying Iranian oil or petrochemicals, following new sanctions imposed by Washington. Despite the delay, both sides are eager to avoid war, though reports from Tehran indicate growing doubt about the usefulness of the talks, citing new sanctions and contradictory positions from the US delegation. The sanctions target entities involved in the illicit trade of Iranian petroleum and petrochemicals, as part of Trump's "maximum pressure" policy toward Tehran.</p>

The "AI Diffusion Rule," set to take effect May 15, imposes global export controls on advanced AI chips and model weights to prevent rival nations like China from gaining ground.

          <p>President Trump announced that any country or person purchasing oil or petrochemicals from Iran will face secondary sanctions, barring them from doing business with the United States. This declaration is part of Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, aiming to halt the Islamic Republic's oil exports, which he claims are used to finance militant groups. The comments are primarily directed at China, a major importer of Iranian oil, but analysts suggest the sanctions may not significantly impact Iranian oil flows unless the White House targets Beijing's state-owned enterprises. The president's statements underscore his belief in negotiating through strength and do not necessarily indicate a change in the administration's drive to reach a new deal with Iran.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas ruled that President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and deport Venezuelan immigrants from South Texas was "unlawful." Judge Fernando Rodriguez, Jr., a Trump appointee, wrote that Trump's invocation of the act "exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute's terms." The judge's decision covers all of the Southern District of Texas, which includes Brownsville, McAllen and Houston.
