          <p>This Fox News opinion piece asserts that the "global intifada" has reached the United States, with violence and antisemitism linked to Hamas-aligned networks. The author cites incidents such as Molotov cocktails thrown at peaceful protestors in Colorado, the murder of Israeli Embassy staff, and arson at Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiroâ€™s home. The piece alleges that campus protests are orchestrated by career professionals to carry out Hamasâ€™ plans. The author calls for holding perpetrators accountable, disrupting their support networks, and addressing those who fund and enable anti-Semitic activity. The author concludes that protests have changed, and strategies to address them must change as well.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how a network of women in Latin America revolutionized access to safe, self-managed abortions. Beginning in the 1990s, activists shared information about misoprostol, a drug initially used for stomach ulcers but found effective for abortions. They established hotlines and accompaniment groups to support women through the process, navigating legal restrictions and societal stigmas. The movement gained momentum, leading to the legalization of abortion in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, though self-managed abortions with accompaniment remain a preferred option for many, even where legal services are available, due to its warmth and commitment. The success of these networks highlights the power of grassroots activism and information sharing in reproductive healthcare. The work of these activists is now being seen as a cultural, social, political, and medical revolution.</p>

The measure would allow the U.S. to impose a tax of up to 20% on foreigners with U.S. investments if their home country levies "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. Analysts are calling it a "revenge tax" that could have significant implications for the asset management industry, potentially impacting cross-border income earned by hedge funds and private equity funds.

The court's decision highlights that justice demands an end to malicious discrimination, but also raises questions about whether institutions should provide assistance to targeted groups to increase diversity and overcome systemic discrimination.

          <p>In Vietnam, a surge of nationalism has led to the term "Cali" becoming a derogatory label for those perceived as opposing state policy. This trend is evident in reactions to the flag of South Vietnam, seen as a symbol of American imperialism. Incidents include attacks on a U.S.-backed university and criticism of a pop star for singing at an anti-communist activist's memorial. The government's control over media and education reinforces this nationalistic sentiment. This article explores the impact of this growing nationalism on Vietnamese society and its relationship with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Despite a Supreme Court loss, Mexico is intensifying pressure on the U.S. to address the flow of guns fueling violence within its borders. While a lawsuit against gun manufacturers failed, it has raised awareness of the issue. The U.S. is now acknowledging a reciprocal responsibility to clamp down on southbound guns, with officials vowing to work with Mexico to dismantle trafficking networks. Mexico is pursuing other legal avenues and the U.S. is considering terrorism-related charges for weapons traffickers. This marks a potential shift in bilateral relations, with increased focus on stopping the illicit gun commerce.</p>

The party is grappling with its identity and how to regain voter trust in a rapidly changing political landscape. While self-reflection can be useful, the party must also focus on effective leadership and clear opposition to the current administration.</p>

          <p>The Santa Cruz Wharf, damaged by winter storms, faces an uncertain future regarding full restoration. A 180-foot section collapsed, prompting a $1 million partial repair, but a full rebuild would cost $14 million. City officials are seeking state funding, but the decision hinges on budget constraints and climate change considerations. The damage highlights the challenges coastal cities face in preserving aging piers amid increasingly volatile seas. The city is working to reopen the end of the pier by early next year, but the full restoration depends on state funding.</p>

          <p>A major tsunami poses a significant risk to the entire California coast, with potential for over 680,000 people in hazard areas and $12.6 billion in damages.

Near-source tsunamis, triggered by nearby earthquakes, can strike within minutes, leaving little time for evacuation. The worst-case scenarios vary by region, with the North Coast facing the greatest risk from the Cascadia subduction zone.
