          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily halted the deployment of National Guard troops in Chicago, a move the Trump administration intended to counter protests at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. The court, however, allowed federal control over the troops. This decision follows a lawsuit by Illinois and Chicago against the White House's plan to deploy Guard members to protect federal personnel and property, mirroring a similar legal dispute in Portland, Oregon.</p>

Debates persist about adopting year-round BST for potential economic and safety benefits, though this would result in very dark winter mornings, particularly in Scotland.</p>

The park, which has seen 20 whales die since 2019, claims it cannot afford their care and is seeking government funding. Animal welfare advocates are exploring alternatives, urging the provincial government to intervene, though a suitable sanctuary for all whales is not immediately available.</p>

          <p>China's launch of an underwater data center in Hainan signals its ambition for AI leadership, but US-Gulf partnerships pose a significant challenge. The Trump administration has facilitated multibillion-dollar chip supply deals with the UAE, fostering advanced data centers like Stargate UAE built on US technology. This strategic collaboration, coupled with US government investment in semiconductor companies, aims to accelerate data center production and secure a competitive edge, challenging China's bid to dominate the rapidly expanding global data center industry.
