          <p>President Trump announced a significant policy shift, stating the U.S. would allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the country, effectively doubling the current number. This declaration followed concerns raised by the Chinese embassy regarding alleged harassment and questioning of its students at U.S. customs, particularly in Houston. Trump emphasized a desire for improved relations with China, indicating his administration aims to "get along good" with Beijing and mentioning an invitation to visit China. The move signals a potential de-escalation in diplomatic tensions and a focus on fostering educational exchange despite previous frictions.</p>

South Korean companies pledged $150 billion in U.S. investments, alongside a record $50 billion aviation purchase by Korean Air for Boeing aircraft and GE Aerospace engines. This follows a July trade deal that reduced U.S. tariffs on South Korean exports. The leaders also discussed developing Alaska's natural gas reserves and reaffirmed commitments to regional security, including countering North Korea's nuclear program. These collaborations aim to bolster both nations' economies and strategic alliances.</p>

Experts estimate the industry could exceed $100 billion by 2030, with Goldman Sachs projecting a 0.4% boost to U.S. GDP through increased productivity and healthcare savings. The drugs are already impacting consumer spending, particularly in the food and beverage industry, and prompting innovation from pharmaceutical giants. However, concerns remain about accessibility, potentially creating a two-tier society based on affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, the 75-year-old former kingpin of the Sinaloa cartel, pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn courtroom to U.S. drug trafficking charges, expressing remorse for the extensive harm caused by his organization. Prosecutors detailed his leadership in evolving the cartel into the world's largest, responsible for trafficking at least 1.5 million kilograms of cocaine and corrupting Mexican police and military. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi celebrated the plea as a "landmark victory," ensuring Zambada will spend his life in federal prison. This marks a significant win in the U.S. government's anti-cartel efforts.</p>

          <p>UK Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips has conceded that the Dash questionnaire, the primary tool used across the UK since 2009 to assess domestic abuse risk, "doesn't work" effectively. Academics and sector workers have raised concerns that the 27-question checklist fails to accurately identify high-risk victims, leading to preventable tragedies. Families of murder victims are now considering legal action, as their loved ones were not classified as high-risk prior to their deaths. Phillips acknowledged the "obvious problems" and stated a review of the entire victim support system is underway, emphasizing that the system's response to assessments is more crucial than the initial score.</p>

This measure, signed into law last week, aims to reconfigure five GOP-held congressional districts to favor Democrats, presented as a counter to similar actions by Texas Republicans. Opponents contend the plan violates the state constitution by circumventing a 30-day public review period and undermining the independent redistricting commission.

          <p>Chinese scientists have reportedly achieved a significant breakthrough in "invisibility" technology for airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, which are typically vulnerable due to their powerful radar emissions. The new method employs frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, assigning each antenna a subtly varied frequency. This makes the signal appear chaotic and difficult to intercept or geolocate from a distance, obscuring its origin. This innovation is described as a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars, potentially enhancing the survivability and operational effectiveness of these critical command nodes in military operations.</p>

          <p>Shares of Shuangdeng Group, a major Chinese battery and energy-storage systems maker, soared 55% in its Hong Kong trading debut. The company's stock, trading under 6960, opened at HK$22.50, significantly above its offer price of HK$14.51 per share. Chairman Yang Rui attributed this success to "riding two tremendous waves": artificial intelligence and overseas expansion, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. This strong performance highlights Hong Kong's buoyant IPO market, driven by the booming electric vehicle and battery sectors, signaling investor confidence in these high-growth industries.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Dauphin Island, Alabama, a barrier island, continues to shrink due to ongoing storms and sea level rise, facing an existential crisis. The hurricane severed the island's west end, destroying over 300 homes and permanently washing away land, with some residents still paying taxes on underwater lots. Mayor Jeff Collier highlights the critical need for millions in funding for continuous beach restoration and stormwater upgrades. The Trump administration's recent cancellation of the FEMA BRIC program, which provided such grants, further jeopardizes the island's future, leaving communities in limbo as they battle relentless erosion.</p>

          <p>A Utah District Court judge has ordered the state legislature to redraw its congressional boundaries by September 24, ruling that the Republican-controlled body unlawfully circumvented voter-approved safeguards against partisan gerrymandering. The current map, adopted in 2021, divided Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County among four reliably Republican districts. Judge Dianna Gibson stated the legislature failed to respect the people's constitutional lawmaking power by weakening and ignoring an independent redistricting commission. This ruling creates national uncertainty for the GOP's slim House majority, as appeals are expected but the U.S. Supreme Court has previously deferred such claims to states.</p>

The search focuses on rugged, heavily forested terrain near Rock Island Campground, where the girls' bodies and Decker's truck were found. Chelan County Sheriff Michael Morrison described the challenging conditions and the commitment of nearly 100 personnel, including FBI agents and experts, to finding Decker. DNA testing confirmed Decker's sole suspect status, and a $20,000 reward is offered for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would impose "substantial" new tariffs and restrict U.S. chip exports on countries that maintain digital services taxes (DSTs), which he claims are designed to harm American technology companies. Writing on Truth Social, Trump put dozens of countries "on notice," demanding the removal of these "discriminatory actions." This move escalates his long-standing pressure against DSTs, which typically target large U.S. tech firms like Meta and Amazon, with countries arguing these companies generate vast profits while paying little local tax. The threat highlights a contentious point in international trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in congressionally allocated education funding, which it had previously withheld, following a multi-state lawsuit led by California's Attorney General. The funds, intended for after-school programs, teacher training, and English-learner support, were frozen weeks before the school year, causing widespread uncertainty. States argued the withholding was illegal, violating the Impoundment Control Act. While the administration had cited concerns about "radical left-wing agenda" misuse, this reversal ensures vital programs for 1.4 million children, primarily from low-income families, can continue.</p>

Winery owner Chris Jambois, whose Black Sears Winery lost two vintages to smoke from the 2020 Glass Fire, fears a repeat of the "disaster" where wine tasted like "licking an ashtray." The Pickett Fire, though smaller, follows a similar path as a heatwave exacerbates fire activity across the West.
