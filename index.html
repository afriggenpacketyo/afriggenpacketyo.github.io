          <p>The Japanese government has begun releasing stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, offering consumers cheaper options as rice prices soar. Ito-Yokado and Iris Ohyama were the first to sell the rice, with a 5-kilogram bag priced at 2,160 yen ($15). The rice sold out quickly at an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, and long lines formed at an Iris Ohyama store in Sendai. This initiative aims to mitigate the impact of rising rice prices on households by selling 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 directly to retailers, a move away from previous auction-based sales. </p>

          <p>A California prisons panel has recommended parole for Patricia Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence for her involvement in the 1969 Manson family killings. The parole board found that Krenwinkel, now 77, poses a low risk of reoffending due to her age and good behavior in prison. The decision is subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor, Gavin Newsom, who previously reversed a similar recommendation in 2022. Krenwinkel was convicted of seven counts of first-degree murder for her role in the Manson family's deadly rampage, which included the killing of actress Sharon Tate and others.</p>

          <p>Brazil's environmental movement is under threat as President Lula sides with the oil industry, leading to legislative defeats for environmental protections. Environment Minister Marina Silva faced political bullying in the senate, and Lula's support for oil exploration in the Amazon and an upgraded BR319 road contradict his promise to achieve zero deforestation by 2030. The senate passed a bill stripping environmental licensing powers from Silvaâ€™s ministry, allowing companies to self-license projects. Despite public support for Silva, Lula's actions leave her exposed and raise concerns about Brazil's environmental credibility ahead of the Cop30 climate summit.</p>

Remittances are a major source of income for many African countries, often exceeding aid and foreign direct investment. The tax could lead migrants to use unofficial channels to send money, and some African countries will be hit harder than others, especially those where remittances make up a large percentage of GDP. The impact could be detrimental to lower-income groups who rely on these funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British officials are progressing with trade talks with the US, despite a court ruling overturning many of Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs, with hopes to finalize deals covering cars, metals, and aeroplane parts. The UK is proceeding as if the court ruling does not apply, believing it will be overturned by the supreme court. The team is working to ensure that businesses can benefit from the deal as quickly as possible, aiming to have car tariffs dropped in the next two weeks, while steel and aluminum tariffs could take longer.</p>
