          <p>John Bolton, who served as national security adviser under Donald Trump before becoming a prominent critic, has been indicted on federal charges related to the mishandling of classified information. The indictment alleges he shared over a thousand pages of sensitive material, including top-secret diary entries from his time in the White House, with his wife and daughter. Bolton maintains his innocence, claiming the charges are politically motivated retribution from Trump and that he looks forward to defending his lawful conduct in court. The case also notes that his personal email, containing this information, was hacked by an actor believed to be associated with Iran.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European markets experienced a significant downturn, with the Stoxx 600 index falling as credit concerns from the U.S. banking sector spread across the Atlantic. Bank stocks were particularly hard-hit, dropping nearly 3% after several U.S. regional banks reported substantial losses on commercial loans and alleged fraud, sparking fears of instability. The negative sentiment also impacted defense stocks following the announcement of a planned meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. This marks a notable reversal for the banking and defense sectors, which had previously been strong performers in the European market this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting follows a phone call between the two leaders, which Trump described as productive. In a strategic move to increase pressure on Moscow, the White House is also considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a topic to be discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This renewed diplomatic push comes after Trump claimed a recent ceasefire deal in Gaza provides momentum for resolving other global conflicts.</p>

The collaboration will begin with testing in Luxembourg, using Stellantis-provided electric vehicles like the Peugeot e-Traveller equipped with Pony.ai's self-driving software. This move is part of a broader trend of robotaxi companies expanding into Europe and the Middle East, following successful deployments in major U.S. and Chinese cities. The partnership aims to establish a strong safety record to gain regulatory approval for a gradual rollout across various European cities starting next year.</p>

          <p>Plans to build a major rare earths refinery in Saltend, UK, have been abandoned by the company Pensana, which will now pursue the project in the United States instead. Pensana cited the lack of sufficient government backing in the UK as a key reason for the decision, contrasting it with the substantial investment and support offered by the U.S. government. The company argued that artificially low prices maintained by China make refining uneconomic without significant state subsidies. The cancellation is a blow to the UK's strategy to secure a domestic supply chain for critical minerals used in electric vehicles and wind turbines.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted another airstrike in the Caribbean targeting a vessel alleged to be involved in drug smuggling, but for the first time, there are reported survivors. This is at least the sixth such strike under a Trump administration policy targeting what it calls "narcoterrorists," a campaign that has drawn criticism and calls for evidence. The White House defended the operations as a necessary tool to combat drug cartels, stating the strikes will continue. The report of survivors marks a new development in these controversial military actions, which Venezuela has condemned as extrajudicial executions of civilians.</p>

          <p>Goaltender Carter Hart is returning to the NHL on a tryout contract with the Vegas Golden Knights after being acquitted of sexual assault charges from a 2018 incident involving former Team Canada World Junior players. This article argues that his swift return, while legally permissible, exemplifies a recurring pattern in hockey where serious allegations are followed by quiet re-integration without a true cultural reckoning. It points to a systemic "code of silence" and a history of prioritizing on-ice talent over addressing off-ice misconduct. The situation leaves fans to grapple with the ethical implications, as the league's actions suggest a pattern of redemption without accountability.</p>

The piece frames this trend as part of a broader anti-fact ideology, where inconvenient evidence is dismissed as bias and fact-checking is mislabeled as censorship.

The piece contextualizes this within a long history, from boxer Jack Johnson to basketball's Larry Bird, and notes Flagg's arrival in Dallas, a city with a history of white superstars like Dirk Nowitzki and Luka Dončić.

          <p>A federal appeals court has refused the Trump administration's request to deploy National Guard troops within Illinois, upholding a lower court's restraining order. The three-judge panel determined that the president's action was a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment and that the administration failed to provide sufficient evidence of a "rebellion" that would justify such a move. The court noted that political opposition and protests against federal immigration policies do not constitute a rebellion against U.S. authority. This ruling maintains the block on the deployment, which President Trump had argued was necessary for crime prevention and protecting federal facilities in Chicago.</p>

To adapt, pubs are improving their food and coffee offerings and creating more comfortable, less "dingy" environments to attract a broader clientele.

By developing its own large-scale refrigeration infrastructure and streamlining certification processes, Indonesia hopes to bypass these intermediaries.

          <p>An immigration barrister in the UK is facing a potential disciplinary investigation after a judge found he likely used generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to prepare his legal arguments. The judge noted that the lawyer's submissions for an asylum appeal cited multiple "entirely fictitious" or irrelevant legal cases. During the hearing, the barrister, Chowdhury Rahman, appeared unfamiliar with the cases he had cited and was unable to direct the court to the relevant passages. The judge concluded that Mr. Rahman had wasted the tribunal's time, presented misleading information, and attempted to hide his reliance on AI for his legal research.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are set to call for accelerated proposals on utilizing immobilized Russian sovereign assets to provide financial and military support for Ukraine through 2027. A draft document reveals a growing commitment to find ways to use the cash balances from these frozen assets, which amount to about €175 billion in Europe. This push comes amid increasing pressure from the U.S. to take more decisive action and ensure fair burden-sharing among G7 partners. However, some nations, particularly Belgium where most of the assets are held, remain cautious about the potential legal and financial repercussions of such a move.</p>

          <p>Venezuela's ambassador to the United Nations, Samuel Moncada, has strongly condemned the recent series of U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean, labeling them "extrajudicial executions." He urged the UN Security Council to launch an investigation into the attacks, which U.S. officials claim target suspected drug traffickers but which Venezuela alleges are attacks on civilian vessels. Moncada highlighted that the strikes have resulted in 27 reported deaths since September and called for a reaffirmation of national sovereignty. The U.S., as a veto-wielding member of the Security Council, is likely to block any formal action against its military operations.</p>

          <p>Daniel Duggan, a former U.S. Marine pilot, is appealing his extradition from Australia to the United States, where he faces charges for allegedly training Chinese military pilots over a decade ago. A 2016 U.S. indictment accuses him of conspiring to provide training in 2010 and 2012 without the required license. Duggan, who became an Australian citizen and renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2012, denies the allegations and claims he is a victim of political maneuvering between the U.S. and China. His lawyers are arguing that there were legal flaws in the extradition process approved by Australia's former Attorney-General.</p>

His command oversees military operations in the Caribbean and South America, including the recent series of controversial and deadly strikes against alleged drug boats off the coast of Venezuela. The timing of his retirement is notable as the strikes face growing criticism from both Democratic and some Republican lawmakers over their legal justification. In a statement, Holsey reflected on his 37 years of service, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth thanked him for his unwavering commitment.</p>

          <p>Political analysts are concerned that Japan's current turbulent and fragmented political landscape could undermine its diplomatic stability and hinder progress in trilateral relations with China and South Korea. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is struggling to form a stable government, with prime ministerial hopeful Sanae Takaichi seeking alliances to secure a majority. Experts suggest that regardless of who leads the country, the lack of a strong, unified government will make it difficult for Japan to effectively engage in major diplomatic initiatives. This internal instability could stall momentum for the crucial trilateral summit between the three East Asian nations.</p>

          <p>Over 1,000 residents from coastal communities in western Alaska have been evacuated after a massive storm surge, caused by the remnants of Typhoon Halong, inundated their villages. The record-high water levels washed away homes, destroyed infrastructure, and contaminated the area with leaked fuel. Evacuees, many of whom lost their homes and winter food supplies, were airlifted to shelters in Anchorage. Residents described harrowing experiences of their houses floating away and are now facing an uncertain future. Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested a federal disaster declaration from the White House to aid in the recovery from what officials are calling one of the largest disasters in state history.</p>

While physical cards will still be available, ministers are positioning the optional digital version as a case study for a future mandatory digital ID scheme for all UK residents.

This move is a response to a challenging economic environment in China, marked by a property crisis and high youth unemployment, which has made consumers more hesitant to spend.
