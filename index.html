          <h2>Suicide Prevention Charity Samaritans to Close Over Half of UK Branches</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 21:08:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Samaritans, a prominent UK suicide prevention charity, has announced plans to close more than 100 of its branches over the next decade. Leadership argues that maintaining over 200 separate physical locations is financially unsustainable and hinders service modernization. The proposal involves shifting towards larger regional hubs and introducing 'virtual volunteering' from home. This has caused significant backlash from current volunteers, who fear the new model will dismantle the local support structure that has been effective for 70 years and create undue pressure on individuals handling distressing calls alone, potentially leading to a loss of experienced staff.</p>

          <p>According to the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa), one in five children in Gaza City is now suffering from malnourishment, with the crisis worsening daily. Unrwa Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini described the situation as dire, quoting a colleague who referred to people in Gaza as "walking corpses." International aid organizations are warning of mass starvation and urging global action, while the UN reports that aid entering the territory is merely a trickle. Residents describe extreme food shortages and exorbitant prices, forcing them to sell belongings for essentials like flour, while the journey to aid distribution points is often deadly.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council chairman has announced a new stadium agreement with the Washington Commanders, moving forward with plans to build a new venue at the RFK Stadium site. This development comes despite recent threats from President Trump to block any deal unless the team reverts to its former "Redskins" name. Council chairman Phil Mendelson characterized the president's comments as an unhelpful distraction and expressed confidence that the council will approve the proposal. The deal, which includes significant revenue benefits for the city, is seen as a crucial step for creating jobs and driving investment in the Ward 7 area.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against New York City, arguing that its 'sanctuary city' policies illegally obstruct federal immigration enforcement. These policies limit the cooperation of local law enforcement with federal immigration authorities and prevent arrests based solely on immigration status. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the lawsuit is necessary for public safety, accusing the city of releasing criminals onto the streets. The legal action follows a recent shooting involving an off-duty federal officer in Manhattan, for which the administration blamed the city's sanctuary policies, intensifying the national debate over immigration enforcement and local autonomy.</p>

          <p>Following his death at 71, this article reflects on Hulk Hogan's significant and complex impact on popular culture, arguing he shaped modern celebrity as both a hero and a villain. Hogan transformed professional wrestling into a global phenomenon by pioneering a brand of in-your-face patriotism and self-aggrandizing personality that became a template for reality TV stardom. His career weathered scandals including steroid use, racist language, and a high-profile lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker Media, demonstrating a pattern of public cancellation and subsequent redemption. The analysis concludes that his combative, larger-than-life persona has become a mainstream element of contemporary culture, for better or worse.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order aimed at regulating the evolving landscape of college sports, particularly name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals and revenue-sharing. The order seeks to rein in what the White House calls an "out-of-control, rudderless system" by banning third-party, pay-for-play payments while still permitting brand endorsements. It also mandates that revenue-sharing agreements must preserve or expand scholarships for women's and non-revenue sports.

The heat is affecting local wildlife, with reindeer fleeing to roads and villages to escape mosquitoes, and disrupting the region's tourism, which is typically known for its cool climate.

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the merger of Paramount Global with Skydance Media, removing the final regulatory obstacle for the major transaction. In his statement, FCC Chair Brendan Carr highlighted Skydance's commitments to the agency, which include ensuring viewpoint diversity and hiring a CBS News ombudsman to review bias complaints. Skydance also affirmed that the newly formed company will not have diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The approval allows the deal, which unites major brands like CBS, Paramount Pictures, and Nickelodeon under new ownership, to proceed toward its closing.</p>

          <p>The FCC has approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a decision mired in political controversy. The approval followed Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit with Donald Trump and came after the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show, which had criticized the settlement. Skydance, owned by the son of a Trump ally, made commitments to the FCC to address conservative grievances and cease DEI efforts. The lone Democrat on the FCC committee dissented, calling the decision a move that erodes press freedom and was linked to the settlement with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major tech companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are not overspending but are actually underspending on artificial intelligence. He argues that the AI race is a "winner-take-all" situation, and to spend less implies a lack of belief in one's ability to win. This commentary comes as these companies plan to spend a combined $320 billion on AI and data centers in 2025, a significant increase from 2024. Cramer points to Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditures as justification for aggressive investment, suggesting the most accurate chatbot will achieve a near-monopoly.

          <p>As regulators like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) move to ban or phase out artificial food colorings such as Red Dye No. 3, technology firms are innovating to create natural alternatives. Companies like French firm Fermentalg are using microalgae to produce stable, vibrant pigments like Galdieria blue, which was recently approved for use in food. The shift away from synthetic, petroleum-based dyes is driven by health concerns and consumer pressure. While natural colors can be more expensive to produce, the challenge for food brands is to match the vividness and shelf-life of their artificial counterparts to maintain consumer appeal.</p>

          <p>The post-credits scene in Marvel's new film, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," provides a significant tease for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The mid-credits scene reveals the iconic villain Doctor Doom, who will be played by Robert Downey Jr., interacting with the son of Reed Richards and Sue Storm, Franklin Richards. This encounter directly sets up the next major crossover film, retitled "Avengers: Doomsday," and hints at the reason the Fantastic Four will eventually cross over from their alternate universe (Earth-828) into the main MCU timeline. The scene confirms Doom as the next major antagonist, a pivot from the studio's original plans involving Kang the Conqueror.</p>

Despite being eligible for parole since 1999, his release was repeatedly denied, allegedly due to pressure from the U.S. and Israel.

The goal is to encourage Iran to resume cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and re-engage in negotiations to limit its uranium enrichment. However, analysts believe a significant breakthrough is unlikely, as distrust is high following the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and subsequent military actions.</p>

Recent lucrative extensions for other young receivers, like Garrett Wilson's $90 million guaranteed deal, have set a high benchmark for the market.

This move comes as homelessness reaches record highs in the U.S., driven by a severe affordable housing shortage.

          <p>This article explores the legal and political reasons why the Biden administration did not release the complete Jeffrey Epstein investigation files, despite their potential to contain damaging information about political rivals like Donald Trump. A primary obstacle is the legally protected secrecy of grand jury testimony, which can only be unsealed by a judge under exceptional circumstances where public interest outweighs privacy and judicial integrity. Furthermore, the FBI rarely releases evidence from investigations that do not lead to criminal charges. Therefore, even if the administration had a political motive to release the files, it lacked the unilateral authority to do so without court approval.</p>
