          <p>A mural in Miami honoring baseball legends Jackie Robinson and Minnie Minoso was defaced with swastikas and racial slurs. The vandalism, which included swastikas painted over the players' faces and a racial slur on Robinson's image, was reported to police and is being investigated as a hate crime. Kyle Holbrook, the artist behind the mural, vowed to restore it, emphasizing that Black history is American history. US Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick condemned the act and called for unity and resilience in the face of hatred, as this follows a similar incident in 2024 where a statue of Robinson was stolen and burned in Wichita, Kansas.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was recaptured nearly two weeks after escaping from an Arkansas prison. Hardin, who was serving decades-long sentences for murder and sexual assault, escaped on May 25 by disguising himself as a law enforcement officer. He was apprehended a short distance from the Calico Rock prison near Moccasin Creek in Izard County after law enforcement used tracking dogs to pick up his scent. Hardin had been imprisoned since 2017 after pleading guilty to the 2017 murder of James Appleton and to the 1997 sexual assault of a teacher.</p>

          <p>The White House is challenging the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) assessment that President Donald Trump's tax and spending package will increase the federal deficit by trillions of dollars over the next decade. The CBO predicts the bill would increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion, while the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forecasts the measures would reduce deficits by $1.4 trillion. The White House argues the CBO's analysis incorrectly assumes Republicans will fail to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, and OMB Director Russell Vought believes the CBO's analysis is fundamentally wrong. The White House has also accused the CBO of being partisan, while critics like Elon Musk have labeled the bill an "abomination."</p>

          <p>Israel has retrieved the body of Nattapong Pinta, a Thai citizen who was kidnapped and taken into Gaza during the October 7, 2023, attack. The prime minister's office announced that Pinta's body was returned to Israel following a special military operation in the Rafah area. Pinta, who worked in agriculture, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz and killed in captivity near the start of the war by the Mujahideen Brigades, according to the Israeli government, as this comes two days after the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages were also retrieved. The retrieval of Pinta's body occurs as Israel continues its military campaign across Gaza, with ongoing strikes and casualties reported.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Operation Spider's Web, which involved smuggling drones into Russia to attack airbases, holds important lessons for China regarding modern warfare. Despite lacking long-range missiles, Ukraine successfully targeted Russian airbases by using drones transported undetected and launched remotely. This innovative approach, as noted by US Air Force Chief of Staff David Allvin, highlights the vulnerability of seemingly impenetrable locations in the era of drone technology. Chinese military analyst Fu Qianshao suggests that China needs to guard against similar infiltration tactics targeting its military bases, especially given the potential for such attacks to be carried out by secret services or in special military operations.</p>

          <p>Susan Dominus, after a decade of interviewing parents of highly successful children, identifies five key factors that set them apart. These include fostering optimism and a belief in possibility, tailoring motivational approaches to each child's unique interests, and recognizing that learning and empowerment can happen anywhere. Parents also cultivate a genuine love for knowledge, often through travel, and prioritize love and support over being a coach or critic. These strategies emphasize creating a nurturing environment that encourages curiosity and self-sufficiency, rather than solely focusing on hard work and grit.</p>

Ukraine asserts that while an agreement on repatriation was reached, no specific date was agreed upon, and Russia resorted to unilateral actions.

          <p>Thailand has temporarily closed two of its border crossings to tourists as a safety measure due to ongoing tensions with Cambodia. The decision follows a military skirmish on May 28 in the Emerald Triangle area, resulting in the death of a Cambodian soldier. While trade remains unaffected, six other border checkpoints have tightened their opening hours and banned six-wheeled vehicles. Thailand and Cambodia share a long and disputed border, and both countries have increased their military presence in the area.</p>

          <p>Tesla is grappling with significant challenges after a disastrous first quarter, compounded by a public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.

To protect themselves, women are advised to report miscarriages to law enforcement, as this situation highlights the legal limbo many women face in the US following the overturning of Roe v Wade. While abortion is nearly banned in West Virginia, miscarriages are not explicitly criminalized, though law enforcement may use fetal remains legislation to punish women, and this has prompted concerns about the safety of inviting law enforcement into reproductive matters.</p>

          <p>Merryl Hoffman experienced a sudden cardiac arrest while walking to the subway in New York City, and her life was saved by two passing nurses. Sabrina Castle and Gianna Formisano, nurses at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, administered CPR until an ambulance arrived, ensuring Hoffman's survival. Hoffman, who had a history of heart issues, had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placed in her chest to prevent future cardiac arrests.
