          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the location of a significant explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident, which occurred at Devastating Pyrotechnics, left seven individuals unaccounted for and resulted in multiple grass fires spanning approximately 80 acres. Investigations revealed the company lacked local licenses for fireworks storage on the agricultural property, which is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. Federal agencies, including the ATF, are now assisting in the investigation into the cause of the blast.</p>

          <p>Pride in London, the UK's largest LGBTQ+ event, is proceeding this weekend despite facing significant financial pressures that are affecting similar events nationwide. A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network reveals that over 85 Pride organizations have seen a drop in corporate sponsorships, with some attributing the decline to a shift away from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives by global corporations. Consequently, some regional Prides have been canceled or forced to charge for entry for the first time, highlighting a precarious future for these community celebrations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have successfully restored damaged outer ear tissue, including cartilage, in mice by activating a dormant "genetic switch." Their findings, published in the journal Science, indicate that the inability to regenerate is linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative crucial for tissue repair. By manipulating this pathway, the scientists were able to trigger complete regeneration, offering hope that similar mechanisms could exist in other organs. The team believes this research is a significant step toward potential human organ regeneration in the future.</p>

          <p>This article critiques the media and political reaction to the punk band Bob Vylan leading a chant of "Death to the IDF" at Glastonbury, arguing it serves as a diversion from the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The author notes the chant was widely misreported as "Death to Israelis" and contends that conflating criticism of the Israeli military with antisemitism stifles legitimate debate and ignores the severe death toll in Gaza. The piece suggests that this strategy of mischaracterizing protest is becoming less effective as public awareness of the situation grows through alternative information channels.</p>

          <p>Extreme flash flooding in the Texas Hill Country has led to at least 24 deaths, with a search and rescue mission underway for many who remain missing. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities and a Christian summer camp from which at least 20 girls are still unaccounted for. Governor Greg Abbott has declared a disaster in several counties, deploying over 500 responders and 14 helicopters to the inundated region. The National Weather Service warns of continued flood risk as the area contends with power outages and destroyed infrastructure.</p>

This reflects the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's broader emphasis on a distinct Taiwanese identity, creating a complex dilemma over how to handle the island's historical legacy.</p>

          <p>This article shares the first-person account of a family who relocated from Salt Lake City, Utah, to the small, growing town of Justin, Texas. The move was prompted by a career change for the father, a pilot instructor, who sought a more stable schedule. While they were surprised by the high property taxes in Texas compared to Utah, they appreciate the slower pace of life and more diverse culture. The family notes that despite missing the mountains and friends in Utah, they feel happier and more accepted in their new Texas community.</p>
