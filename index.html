          <p>President Donald Trump announced the termination of all U.S. trade negotiations with Canada via a Truth Social post. He claimed Canada fraudulently used an advertisement featuring former President Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs, alleging it was intended to interfere with U.S. Supreme Court decisions. Trump emphasized the importance of tariffs for national security and the economy, stating Canada's "egregious behavior" led to this decision. This move marks a significant escalation in trade relations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines grounded all flights across the U.S. due to a significant IT outage, causing widespread operational disruptions. The airline confirmed a temporary ground stop was issued, affecting an unclear number of flights, including those operated by Horizon Air. While systems were reportedly coming back online later that night, at least 39 flights were canceled and 241 delayed. This incident highlights the vulnerability of air travel to technological failures and their immediate impact on passengers.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for New York Attorney General Letitia James criticized interim U.S. attorney Lindsey Halligan, alleging an "unusual and improper" conversation with a journalist. James's legal team plans to file a motion to dismiss her bank fraud indictment, arguing Halligan's appointment was unlawful due to expired term limits. The accusation stems from Halligan reportedly texting a journalist to criticize coverage of James's case, which James's lawyers claim violated Justice Department rules. This development adds a layer of controversy to James's upcoming arraignment on bank fraud charges.</p>

          <p>The White House East Wing has been demolished, with new images showing rubble where the structure once stood, as President Trump proceeds with plans for a new ballroom.

The rapid demolition, which the White House asserts did not require external approval for "Phase 1," surprised many. This development follows earlier assurances that the White House structure would remain untouched.</p>
