          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader has rejected renewed talks with the U.S. regarding its nuclear program, asserting that any agreement involving coercion is unacceptable. Experts suggest Iran is attempting to project strength despite its waning regional influence, creating a dilemma where it risks provoking a military strike from Israel or the U.S. if it acts too aggressively. The country is currently navigating international sanctions and has reduced cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), while trying to buy time through crisis management and indirect negotiations with Western powers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact-check investigation has determined that widespread claims on social media about Germany canceling its Christmas markets for 2025 are false. The viral posts originated from a single, non-credible source that used sensationalist language and AI-generated content to paint a bleak picture of the country. While a few small, local markets have been canceled for reasons like renovation or low revenue, the vast majority of Germany's over 2,500 Christmas markets are scheduled to open as planned, with cities like Berlin preparing for over 60 separate events.</p>

          <p>As winter approaches and daylight hours decrease, particularly in northern regions like Scotland, health professionals are highlighting methods to combat Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This recurring depression affects over a million people in the UK with symptoms like low mood and anxiety. A new initiative in Orkney provides residents with therapeutic lamps and 'Wintering Well' boxes, containing tools and guides to encourage outdoor activity and establish new 'light routines.' The project aims to foster a more positive psychological mindset toward winter, drawing inspiration from Scandinavian cultural attitudes.</p>

          <p>In her posthumously released memoir, Virginia Giuffre details her experience of being sexually exploited by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell as a teenager. The book recounts a brutal sexual assault by an unnamed former prime minister on Epstein's private island, which she describes as a turning point in her understanding of Epstein's cruelty. Giuffre also chronicles non-abusive encounters with powerful figures like former President Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump, which served to illustrate the extensive and influential network her abusers commanded.</p>

          <p>Counting has begun in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election to determine the successor to the current head of state, Michael D. Higgins. Voters chose between two main contenders: independent politician Catherine Connolly, backed by left-wing parties, and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys, a former senior cabinet minister. A third candidate who withdrew from the race too late to be removed remains on the ballot, with his votes being transferred. Unofficial early reports suggest that voter turnout for the election could be near a record low.</p>

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein case continues to pose a political challenge for President Donald Trump, with renewed calls from survivors and politicians for the full release of unredacted investigation files. The article explores the dynamic between the scandal and Trump's political base, noting his past friendship with Epstein in the 1990s. Some analysts suggest that while the revelations are damaging, many of Trump's supporters may view the issue through a lens of deep distrust for the entire political establishment, potentially blunting the impact of any new information.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, a significant development just before the start of early voting. This endorsement helps consolidate the Democratic Party's establishment wing behind Mamdani, who is running on an affordability-focused platform against former Governor Andrew Cuomo. The move is seen as a crucial boost for Mamdani's campaign and a key signal of party unity in a race that has exposed its ideological fault lines.</p>
