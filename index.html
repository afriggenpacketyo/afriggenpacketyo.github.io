            <p>An Israeli military inquiry found that an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders" led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The IDF stated that troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces, blaming poor night visibility for not identifying the vehicles as ambulances. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report. The report claimed six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim not supported by evidence.</p>

            <p>British fighter jets intercepted two Russian aircraft flying close to NATO airspace in separate incidents this week. RAF Typhoons were scrambled to intercept a Russian intelligence aircraft over the Baltic Sea and another aircraft leaving Kaliningrad airspace. These intercepts were part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing, working alongside Sweden. The UK's involvement, called Operation Chessman, underscores its commitment to NATO amid growing Russian aggression.</p>

            <p>The author argues against relying on anecdotal economic indicators and emphasizes the importance of analyzing data from key economic drivers: consumers, capital, and labor. By examining reports from retailers like Walmart and Amazon, banks like Citibank and JPMorgan, and payroll companies like Paychex, one can gain a more accurate understanding of the economy's health. These sources provide real-time, actionable data that can help gauge economic trends and potential recessions more effectively than traditional surveys or government data. (not investment advice)</p>

The exercises highlight increased cross-unit coordination and front-line coastal support capabilities within the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The 81st Group Army's aviation brigade, responsible for defending Beijing and central regions, participated in the drills.
