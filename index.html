          <p>Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, plans to invest $50 billion in the United States over the next five years, creating over 12,000 jobs. This investment aims to establish new R&D sites, expand manufacturing facilities across several states, and support the development of next-generation weight loss medicines. The move comes amid growing concerns about potential tariffs on pharmaceutical goods, with Roche aiming to increase medicine exports from the U.S. upon completion of these investments. This strategic decision reflects pharmaceutical companies' efforts to strengthen their U.S. presence in response to potential trade policy changes.</p>

          <p>A new ceasefire plan has been proposed by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to end the war in Gaza, envisioning a five to seven-year truce and the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The plan also includes a formal end to the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Talks are scheduled to take place in Cairo with senior Hamas representatives, following Hamas's rejection of Israel's previous proposal that included disarmament. While it is early to assess the likelihood of success, sources indicate that Hamas has shown "unprecedented flexibility" in the negotiations, potentially paving the way for a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>The military regime in Burkina Faso announced it has thwarted a coup attempt allegedly planned by individuals in Ivory Coast, accusing them of seeking to sow chaos. Interim President Ibrahim Traore, who himself came to power via a coup, has frequently accused Ivory Coast of harboring his opponents. The government claims the plot involved an assault on the presidency by soldiers recruited by the nation's enemies. This announcement comes amid increasing repression of dissent under Traore's leadership, with numerous military personnel arrested on suspicion of plotting against the government.</p>

          <p>The United States Commerce Department will impose tariffs as high as 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. This decision follows an investigation initiated by major solar equipment producers seeking protection for their US operations. The tariffs target companies allegedly benefiting from Chinese subsidies and dumping unfairly cheap products in the US market. The duties vary by company and country, with some Cambodian exporters facing the highest rates due to perceived lack of cooperation with the investigation.</p>

          <p>The UK government will publish the nationalities of foreign criminals for the first time, revealing data on offenders awaiting deportation and the crimes they committed. Home Office sources attribute the increase in foreign criminals awaiting deportation to early releases due to prison overcrowding, instability in some countries, and appeals based on human rights grounds. Figures are expected to show that Albanians, Romanians, and Poles are the most common nationalities among foreign criminals, with offenses including drug production, theft, and acts of violent assault.

While Verstappen races aggressively, pushing the limits of the rules, the guidelines have changed this year due to pressure from other drivers. This incident serves as a test of the new rules and a marker laid down by Piastri, indicating he will not be intimidated on the track.</p>

          <p>Walgreens has agreed to pay up to $350 million to settle allegations by the U.S. Department of Justice that it illegally filled millions of prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances. The government's complaint alleged that Walgreens knowingly filled illegal prescriptions between 2012 and 2023, ignoring red flags and pressuring pharmacists to fill them quickly. As part of the settlement, Walgreens will improve its compliance with dispensing controlled substances and maintain a compliance program. This settlement resolves four cases brought by former Walgreens employee whistleblowers and contributes to the over $50 billion in settlements drugmakers, wholesalers, and pharmacies have agreed to pay related to the opioid crisis.</p>

Harvard argues that the funding freeze is arbitrary, violates its First Amendment rights, and undermines American innovation.

          <p>Dallas Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison has admitted that he underestimated the level of fan affection for Luka Dončić before trading him to the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite facing backlash, Harrison maintains that the trade, which brought Anthony Davis to Dallas, was the right move for building a championship-caliber team. Harrison expressed disappointment that Davis and Kyrie Irving haven't had the opportunity to play together due to injuries. He also defended the trade by emphasizing the importance of defense, a comment that Dončić criticized.</p>
