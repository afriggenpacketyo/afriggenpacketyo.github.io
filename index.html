          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of the 1989 murders of their parents, were resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole after serving 35 years. The decision followed a recommendation by the former Los Angeles County District Attorney, citing the brothers' rehabilitation in prison. The article details the resentencing hearing, where family members testified to the brothers' transformation and their efforts to assist other inmates. The prosecution argued against their release, asserting they haven't fully admitted the extent of their crimes. A decision on their potential release will be made at a parole hearing in June, with their next court appearance for the clemency case scheduled for June 13.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, reveals how President Biden's aides allegedly suppressed concerns about his age and cognitive decline during his time in the White House. The article highlights instances of Biden forgetting names and appearing frail, relying heavily on anonymous sources. The book portrays an inner circle that avoided addressing the president's diminishing abilities rather than actively concealing them. Despite the reliance on anonymous sources, the book underscores the Democratic Party's ongoing reluctance to publicly confront questions about Biden's capacity to serve as president.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are pushing for stricter regulations on online pornography with the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), which aims to criminalize the transmission of obscene content across state lines. The article explains that the bill seeks to update the legal definition of obscenity for the internet age, replacing subjective standards with practical ones. The proposed definition focuses on material that appeals to prurient interests, depicts or represents actual or simulated sex acts, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The bill intends to equip law enforcement with the tools needed to remove obscene material from the internet.</p>

Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, said the Afrikaner refugees had been 'carefully vetted,' while suggesting that Afghans had not undergone sufficient background checks. Experts question the reasoning, noting the security threats in Afghanistan and the risks faced by those who cooperated with U.S. forces.</p>
