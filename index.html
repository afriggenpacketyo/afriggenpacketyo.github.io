        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's Small Business Administration has approved California's request for disaster relief loans following riots in Los Angeles. The decision makes small businesses impacted by the unrest eligible for up to $2 million in low-interest federal loans to cover operating expenses. The approval came after a period of public disagreement, with SBA chief Kelly Loeffler criticizing Governor Gavin Newsom's handling of the situation. A spokesperson for Newsom, in turn, blamed the "Trump-imposed chaos campaign" for the initial violence while welcoming the federal aid for the affected businesses.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has strongly criticized the Trump administration, accusing it of an "all out assault on Los Angeles" following a Department of Justice lawsuit against the city's sanctuary policies. Bass condemned federal immigration raids, stating agents were "randomly grabbing people" and that U.S. citizens had been detained. The DOJ's lawsuit alleges the city's policies hinder federal enforcement and have contributed to lawlessness.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to accelerate housing construction. The new legislation largely waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas zoned for multifamily use, eliminating lengthy environmental reviews and the threat of related lawsuits that often delay development. The move, pushed through as part of the state budget, aims to address California's severe housing shortage by removing what supporters call a major barrier to building. This change marks a significant shift in the state's approach to development.</p>

          <p>Warner Music Group has announced it will conduct an unspecified number of layoffs as part of a major restructuring plan aimed at reducing annual costs by approximately $300 million. In a memo to staff, CEO Robert Kyncl stated that $170 million of the savings would come from reducing headcount, with the remainder from administrative and real estate expenses. The company emphasized that the cuts will allow for increased investment in its core artist and repertoire (A&R) department and in mergers and acquisitions. This follows previous rounds of layoffs in 2023 and 2024 as the company continues to transform.</p>

          <p>Environmental and justice advocacy groups have expressed outrage after Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation overhauling the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Critics argue the changes, which exempt many urban housing and infrastructure projects from environmental review, represent an unprecedented rollback of essential protections. A coalition of over 100 organizations warned that the bills could harm vulnerable communities and ecosystems, particularly by exempting certain industrial facilities from review. They also criticized the hasty, non-transparent process used to pass the legislation as part of a state budget deal, calling it a blow to public engagement.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines the influence of Christian-nationalist musician Sean Feucht, who has become a prominent figure in the MAGA movement. Feucht blends Christian rock concerts with right-wing political sermons, advocating for the fusion of church and state and endorsing theocratic ideals. He has gained significant access to top Republicans, including President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson. The article details his connection to the New Apostolic Reformation movement and its goal of Christian influence over all spheres of society, while also noting recent allegations of financial misconduct against his ministry.</p>

          <p>A provision within the Republican domestic policy bill would block abortion clinics from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for any non-abortion services they provide, such as cancer screenings and STI testing. If passed, this would affect clinics nationwide, not just in states with abortion restrictions, and could have a devastating financial impact, potentially forcing some to close or reduce services. Proponents of the measure call it a significant pro-life victory, while opponents argue it will severely limit access to essential healthcare for many people who rely on Medicaid for a wide range of medical needs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate narrowly passed the Trump administration's major domestic policy bill after leadership made last-minute concessions to secure the votes of Republican holdouts. The legislation, which includes tax cut extensions and funding for border security, faced skepticism over its cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Deals, including a fund for rural hospitals and exemptions for Alaska, were struck to win over key senators like Josh Hawley and Lisa Murkowski.

          <p>Following its narrow passage in the Senate, President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill now faces significant hurdles in the House of Representatives. Speaker Mike Johnson confronts potential opposition from within his own party, as several conservative members have already voiced objections to the Senate's version of the legislation. Key concerns for House Republicans include the bill's higher overall cost, a larger increase in the debt ceiling, and deeper cuts to Medicaid compared to the version the House originally passed. With a slim majority, Johnson has very little room for defections to meet the administration's July 4 deadline.</p>

The tax would have applied to wind and solar projects using materials from prohibited countries like China, potentially raising consumer energy costs. The bill also modified the phase-out timeline for clean energy tax credits, allowing projects already in development to retain them. However, the legislation still terminates numerous consumer incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for electric vehicles and home energy efficiency, a move environmental groups warn will raise costs and emissions.</p>

While he noted the tariffs have not yet had a major economic impact, he reiterated they could lead to higher inflation.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would cause 11.8 million people to lose health insurance by 2034, primarily from Medicaid. The cuts stem from new work requirements for beneficiaries and restrictions on how states can fund their programs. While Republicans added a $25 billion fund to support rural hospitals, healthcare advocates argue it is insufficient to offset the financial damage from the broader funding reductions.</p>

          <p>YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has officially entered the World Boxing Association's cruiserweight rankings at number 14, making him eligible to compete for a world title. The ranking came just two days after his unanimous decision victory over veteran boxer Julio CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Jr. This development makes a potential title fight against current WBA champion Gilberto 'Zurdo' RamÃ­rez a possibility. While a significant milestone for Paul, the WBA's decision is seen by many as reflecting his immense financial drawing power more than his traditional boxing resume.</p>

          <p>The development of the United States' next-generation fighter jet, reportedly named the F-47, is at the center of a defense budget debate with significant implications for air superiority over China. As both nations race to develop sixth-generation aircraft, divisions in the U.S. have emerged over funding priorities for the Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. These budgetary decisions are critical, as they will directly influence America's military readiness and strategic capabilities in a potential conflict in the Pacific, particularly concerning a scenario involving Taiwan.</p>

Facing a potential defeat, ministers agreed to delay changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) until after a review, effectively gutting one of the bill's most significant measures. The U-turn has undermined the authority of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and created uncertainty for the government's spending plans, as billions in potential savings are now delayed or lost.
