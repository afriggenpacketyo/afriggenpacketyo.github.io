            <p>As retirement nears, it's crucial to safeguard savings from market volatility, especially due to tariff policies. Financial experts recommend rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance, potentially shifting to a 60/40 stock/bond allocation, while ensuring diversification. Building cash reserves equivalent to two years of income is also advised to avoid selling investments during market downturns, mitigating sequence of returns risk. Another strategy involves considering a bond ladder to provide a steady income stream and reduce interest rate risk. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Justice Department is preparing for the final phase of its antitrust case against Google, potentially leading to the company's breakup. The government argues that Google illegally stifled competition by paying for default search engine status and is proposing remedies such as spinning off Chrome and potentially selling Android. Google contends these remedies are inappropriate and would harm consumers and innovation. The outcome of the case could significantly impact digital market regulation and the competitive landscape for tech startups, especially in areas like AI.</p>

Thousands of federal jobs are at risk, impacting local families and disrupting community programs related to public health, environmental protection, and food aid.

            <p>As the US and China engage in a trade war, China should strategically require bilateral trade to be settled in renminbi. This would significantly strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the US dollar's dominance. By forcing the US to purchase Chinese currency on a large scale, demand for the renminbi would increase, potentially attracting global investors and shifting capital flows away from the US. This approach would be a proactive strategy rather than merely reacting to US tariff hikes.</p>

Failure to engage with the Global South could allow China to advance its geopolitical, economic, and technological interests, undermining the interests of the United States and its allies.

            <p>The dispute between Donald Trump and Harvard University is the latest in a decades-long conservative campaign against American academia. Trump reacted angrily after Harvard refused demands to cede control over hiring, admissions, and curriculum. Experts view this as part of a broader effort to undermine higher education and, ultimately, democracy. The government plans to freeze grants to Harvard after the university president rejected the demands, citing governmental overreach and infringement on the school's independence and constitutional rights.</p>

            <p>This article examines Adolf Hitler's early economic policies, particularly his focus on tariffs, and how they led to a trade war with Germany's neighbors. Despite inheriting a recovering economy, Hitler prioritized protectionist measures aimed at German self-reliance, which alarmed markets and strained international relations. The article draws parallels between Hitler's economic approach and the potential consequences of protectionist policies today, suggesting that trade wars can be a prelude to broader conflicts.</p>

The report arrives as the Trump administration has effectively demolished the CDC team responsible for government reports on abortion provision in the United States, which are known as “abortion surveillance” reports. The Guttmacher Institute report focuses on abortions provided through the formal healthcare system, and it does not count self-managed abortions, which appear to be on the rise post-Roe.</p>

            <p>Scientists have discovered that Greenland's coastline has expanded by over 1,000 miles due to melting ice caused by global warming. The study, analyzing satellite images from 2000 to 2020, found that approximately 66% of the newly exposed coastline is in Greenland. The increase in exposed coastline poses risks to local communities due to the increased susceptibility to landslide-triggered tsunamis and other environmental changes. The Arctic has warmed up to four times faster than the rest of the planet, causing Greenland's ice sheet to thin dramatically.</p>
