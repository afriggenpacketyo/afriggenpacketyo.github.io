          <h2>European Leaders Urge Russia to Agree to Ukraine Ceasefire</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 13:39:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several European leaders, including those from Poland, the UK, France, and Germany, have pressured Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine, beginning on Monday. The leaders, who met with Ukrainian President Zelensky in Kyiv, discussed the plan with US President Trump, who initially proposed an unconditional ceasefire. They threatened Russia with "massive" sanctions if it fails to comply, emphasizing the importance of reconnecting Ukraine's economy and reuniting families. Despite Russia's insistence on halting Western military aid to Ukraine before considering a ceasefire, Zelensky stated that any conditions would undermine diplomacy. The proposed truce would be monitored mainly by the US, with European support, and coordinated sanctions would be imposed in case of violations.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972 but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket booster malfunction, has re-entered the atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. The event serves as a reminder of the Cold War era's ambitious space exploration efforts, particularly the Soviet Union's Venera program, which aimed to study Venus. While the US focused on Mars, the Soviets achieved significant milestones with Venus, including the first probes to enter its atmosphere and transmit data from its surface. Although space law dictates ownership of crashed objects remains with the launching country, the Soviets did not claim debris found in New Zealand shortly after the failed launch. Today, space debris and re-entries are increasingly common due to increased space activity.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee was felt across several southern states, including Georgia and North Carolina, on Saturday morning. The quake's epicenter was located near Greenback, Tennessee, about 30 miles south of Knoxville. While no injuries or major damage were immediately reported, the USGS received over 23,000 reports from the public within the first hour after the event. The southeastern US is known to have earthquake risk, particularly in the New Madrid and Eastern Tennessee seismic zones. Residents as far away as Atlanta reported feeling tremors, and officials noted that earthquakes in the eastern US are typically felt over a larger distance due to the region's geology.</p>

          <p>General Motors is recalling 597,630 of its full-size trucks and SUVs in the U.S. because of manufacturing defects in the connecting rod and/or crankshaft engine components, which can lead to unexpected engine failure and increase the risk of a crash. The recall, which includes models from 2021-2024 like Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, and GMC Sierra 1500, comes amid an investigation by auto safety regulators following complaints of engine failure in GM vehicles. Dealers will inspect and repair or replace the engine free of charge, with owner notification letters scheduled to be mailed on June 9, 2025. This recall follows a previous one in November where GM recalled nearly 462,000 diesel-engine SUVs and pickup trucks due to a faulty transmission control valve.</p>

Despite a 'transitional season' with a new manager, the team displayed consistency and a strong mentality, often winning by narrow margins and scoring crucial late goals. Their dominance was evident in their perfect record against other top-four teams, securing six wins out of six matches. The team's ability to find ways to win even when performances weren't at their best underscores their achievement in a highly competitive league.</p>

          <p>The German government will no longer publish details of its military aid to Ukraine, according to Chancellor Friedrich Merz, citing the need for "strategic ambiguity" to prevent Russia from gaining strategic advantages. This decision follows initial sporadic reporting on military aid, which later became a regularly updated list due to pressure from parliamentarians and media. Merz, who recently assumed office, emphasized that Germany's commitment to supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion remains unchanged, with continued financial support promised. This shift aims to remove discussions about specific weapons systems from the public domain.</p>

          <p>Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian hospital have reached a new settlement agreement approaching almost a billion dollars for the sexual assaults committed by gynecologist Robert Hadden. The latest $750m deal covers two decades of sexual assaults by the gynecologist for more than two decades at New York hospitals. Victims question how Hadden was able to continue his crimes for so long, alleging the institutions protected a serial predator instead of their patients. The institutions are accused of knowing about his behavior and allowing him to continue practicing medicine. The plaintiffs' attorney also now represents hundreds of women in lawsuits against Dr Barry Brock, a gynecologist at Cedars-Sinai medical center in Los Angeles, who allegedly sexually assaulted patients, and against NewYork-Presbyterian, Weill Cornell medical center and Northwell Health, which employed Darius Paduch, a urologist sentenced to life in prison for sexually abusing patients, including minors.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller emphasizes the importance of instinct over data in making creative and business decisions. He argues that relying solely on research and data can stifle creativity and narrow perspectives, while simple human instinct can be a better predictor of success. Diller recounts his experiences with ABC's "Movie of the Week," where gut feelings about titles and stories led to successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker." He warns against overtraining on data, suggesting that it can hinder the ability to recognize a good idea and make common sense judgments.</p>

          <p>At least seven people have died and major roads were cut off after heavy rains led to flooding in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, on Friday night due to an overwhelmed drainage system and a growing urban population. The regional administration spokesperson, Abdinasir Hirsi Idle, told The Associated Press on Saturday that rescue efforts were ongoing. The death toll could rise because the rains were heavy and lasted for several hours, causing nine houses to collapse across different neighborhoods, and at least six major roads to suffer severe damage. Floodwaters also damaged key infrastructure, halting public transport and temporarily disrupting operations at the main airport, Aden Abdulle International Airport.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth, 81, was convicted of 23 felony counts of financial fraud after offering the victim investment opportunities with promised high returns and no risk. Prosecutors revealed that Cohen-Roth was running a Ponzi scheme, using money from new investors to pay off earlier ones and fund a lavish lifestyle. The scheme collapsed when the victim requested her money back, leaving her financially destitute.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration patterns, affecting their ability to feed and breed successfully. Rising sea levels are changing coastal stopover locations, and ocean acidification is impacting the crustaceans that migratory birds rely on for food. Extreme weather events are also posing a threat, and warmer temperatures are causing birds to shorten their routes or abandon them altogether, potentially leading to conflicts with resident animals. The article emphasizes the importance of expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly environments to mitigate these risks.</p>
