          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer and a key Tesla supplier, is aggressively expanding its international operations. Following a major IPO in Hong Kong, the company is investing heavily in new European factories in Hungary and Spain to sustain its global leadership. This push is driven by intense price wars and market saturation in China, with CATL also planning to introduce its battery-swapping technology to Europe. The move aims to localize production, secure long-term contracts, and tap into markets with higher profit margins.</p>

The 47-year-old politician secured these powerful roles during coalition negotiations, creating an unusual concentration of power. Klingbeil, who has had a steady career within the SPD, is now tasked with analyzing the party's significant loss of support in recent years. His political outlook was shaped by his experiences during the 9/11 attacks, leading him to support a stronger military for self-defense.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated that the team is holding discussions with four-time world champion Max Verstappen regarding a potential move for the next Formula 1 season. Verstappen is contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but break clauses could allow an early exit. A move could be appealing for Verstappen due to Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes' potential advantage with the new 2026 engine regulations. Russell's comments imply his own contract negotiations are being affected by the team's pursuit of the Dutch driver.</p>

          <p>A number of immigrants, including some with deep roots in the U.S., are reportedly choosing to leave the country, a phenomenon sometimes labeled "self-deportation." However, experts caution against viewing this as a widespread trend, suggesting it may be part of a political strategy to create an illusion of high deportation numbers. The article profiles individuals who have left due to the political climate and difficult immigration processes, but also notes that for many, leaving is not a viable option. Experts argue that incentivizing departures could have devastating economic consequences for the U.S. by depleting key workforces.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Zohran Mamdani's expected victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary represents a significant shift within the party. His success, achieved through a grassroots campaign focused on affordability, challenges the establishment's belief that the party must move rightward to win. The author posits that Mamdani's win proves the party's left flank can be an asset, energizing a base frustrated with passive leadership. Mamdani's campaign is presented as a model for a renewed, morally-driven Democratic party that is more aligned with the energy of its younger, more active voters.</p>

The performance was marked by a raspy voice, moments of confusion, and a perceived lack of energy, fueling existing concerns about his age and fitness for office. The immediate aftermath saw panic among Democrats, with many allies and media outlets calling for him to step aside.

          <p>The hotel minibar, once a symbol of travel convenience and indulgence, has largely fallen out of favor in the U.S. Introduced globally in the 1970s, minibars became a logistical and financial burden for hotels due to high operational costs, spoilage, and theft. By the early 2000s, major chains like Marriott began removing them. In their place, hotels are shifting to more modern and profitable alternatives, including contactless lobby marketplaces and strategic partnerships with food delivery apps like DoorDash and Uber Eats. While some luxury hotels have reimagined the minibar with local products, it has become a relic in most midscale establishments.</p>

While a practical quantum computer is likely years away, its promise lies in solving complex problems impossible for traditional computers, particularly in chemistry and materials science. The technology also poses a significant national security risk, as it could potentially break current encryption methods, prompting a government-led push for "post-quantum" security.

Araghchi also confirmed that there are no current plans to resume nuclear talks with the United States. The admission comes as Iran's parliament considers a bill to cease cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, potentially barring nuclear inspectors from its sites.</p>

Officials described a 15-year top-secret mission to study the Fordo facility and the development of the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb specifically for the target. During the strike, multiple MOPs were dropped into ventilation shafts to create a blast that would rip through the underground tunnels.

          <p>Oslo police have filed charges against Marius Borg HÃ¸iby, the 28-year-old son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, following a months-long investigation. The charges include multiple counts of sexual assault, including one instance involving intercourse, as well as bodily harm, with a "double-digit" number of alleged victims. HÃ¸iby, who has been under scrutiny since his arrest in 2024, has cooperated with police but denies wrongdoing in most cases, particularly those involving sexual abuse. The case has become major news in Norway, where the royal family is widely popular.</p>

          <p>Researchers believe they have identified the oldest rocks on Earth, dating back approximately 4.16 billion years, within Canada's Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt. This finding helps settle a scientific dispute, as previous estimates ranged from 3.8 to 4.3 billion years old. The new study used two different radioactive dating techniques that yielded the same age, strengthening the claim. Studying these primordial rocks, which are extremely rare due to Earth's tectonic recycling, could provide invaluable insights into the planet's early formation and the origins of life. The site is on Inuit land, and the local community is seeking to protect it from damage.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed on a framework for a trade deal, according to officials from both nations. While President Trump initially referred to a signed deal, the White House and Beijing later clarified it as an "additional understanding for a framework." The agreement appears to center on ensuring U.S. access to rare earth minerals, which are critical for high-tech manufacturing and dominated by China. In return, the U.S. will reportedly cancel a series of restrictive measures. The development follows talks that postponed massive tariff hikes and aims to de-escalate the ongoing trade dispute.

          <p>A recent government U-turn on planned welfare reforms raises questions about its fiscal credibility, as the reversal significantly reduces projected savings. The original plan to cut disability benefits (Pip) and Universal Credit was expected to save Â£5 billion annually, but the revised changes will likely save only around Â£2 billion. Key modifications include applying new, stricter eligibility rules only to future claimants, sparing hundreds of thousands of current recipients. This Â£2.5-3 billion shortfall, on top of other spending commitments, will likely need to be covered by higher taxes or other cuts to meet the chancellor's borrowing rules.

          <p>Following a classified briefing, several Senate Democrats have publicly cast doubt on the Trump administration's claim that recent U.S. strikes "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. Senators like Chris Murphy and Mark Warner stated they believe significant capability remains and that the president may have misled the public, suggesting the program was set back by months, not years. They criticized the lack of a coherent long-term strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. In contrast, Republican senators defended the administration's characterization, asserting the strikes were highly effective and set the program back by years.</p>

From November 2026, new Pip applicants will face tighter assessment criteria for daily living support.

          <p>The recent murder of a 17-year-old TikTok star has intensified concerns over the safety of women with public online profiles in Pakistan. Many women who use social media for self-expression or work report facing a torrent of threats, stalking, and privacy violations that can escalate into real-world violence. Experts and activists argue that this is rooted in deep-seated patriarchal norms, where women's visibility is often perceived as a threat to cultural values, making harassment seem justified to perpetrators. Despite some platform improvements, many women feel that reporting mechanisms are slow and ineffective, forcing them to self-censor for their safety.</p>

The article draws a sharp distinction between a democracy, where the military swears an oath to the Constitution, and autocracies, where armed forces are loyal to a single leader.

          <p>This article reviews Karen Russell's novel "The Antidote," which explores the fantasy of memory erasure against the backdrop of the 1930s Dust Bowl. The book centers on "prairie witches" who store painful memories for their neighbors, allowing them to live without guilt, but the narrative argues against this practice. Russell's project is to defeat the idea of getting rid of the past, suggesting that memories must be kept in circulation for societal health and justice. The novel complicates traditional Dust Bowl narratives by confronting the founding shame of land theft from American Indians, arguing that forgetting this history would be a dystopian national loss.</p>

After being pushed to the brink of extinction, grizzly populations, particularly in the Yellowstone ecosystem, have recovered successfully, meeting biological benchmarks. Proponents of delisting argue it's time to prove the ESA works and hand management to states, warning that keeping recovered species on the list erodes public support for the law.

In a speech, she argued the central split is between those who see the Trump administration as an existential threat and those who view it as survivable. Slotkin urged Democrats to act as "wartime generals" and get back to basics by focusing on "pocketbook" issues like jobs, housing, and healthcare. She emphasized that a shrinking middle class is the single greatest security threat to the U.S., as economic anxiety can fuel social division.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to publish a new rule that eliminates the 30-day warning period before levying fines on individuals in the U.S. illegally. According to the rule from the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, the government can now immediately begin issuing daily fines of up to $1,000. This policy applies to those who enter illegally or fail to comply with removal or voluntary departure orders. The practice of fining migrants, which was stopped during the Biden administration, was reinstated by President Trump, with DHS stating it is a necessary consequence for breaking the law.</p>
