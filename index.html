          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion, making it the fifth-largest in the game's history after no winning tickets were sold in Saturday night's $1 billion grand prize drawing. The next opportunity to win this massive sum, which carries an estimated cash value of $498.4 million before taxes, is scheduled for Monday at 11 p.m. ET. This marks the sixth instance in Powerball's 33-year history that the top prize has climbed past the billion-dollar mark, with the last jackpot winner occurring on May 31. A single winner could choose a lump sum or 29 increasing annual payments, emphasizing the life-changing potential of this lottery.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 00:38:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Biologists near the California-Oregon border are deploying drones equipped with loudspeakers to deter wolves from livestock, utilizing unconventional tactics like blasting AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," movie clips featuring Scarlett Johansson, and live human voices. This innovative experiment aims to reduce the increasing conflict between recovering gray wolf populations and ranchers, who have historically employed various nonlethal techniques. While initial trials show success in interrupting wolf hunts and promoting coexistence, the high cost of the specialized drones (around $20,000) and the potential for wolves to habituate to the noise present ongoing challenges for long-term viability, making it impractical for many ranchers.</p>

          <p>The No. 9 LSU Tigers secured a hard-fought 17-10 road victory over No. 4 Clemson in South Carolina, marking a significant upset in a game dominated by defensive play. Offense was scarce, with LSU's Garrett Nussmeier eventually finding Trey-Dez Green for the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter, after a previous score was ruled incomplete. Clemson's offense, led by Cade Klubnik, struggled to convert opportunities, including a missed field goal and multiple turnovers on downs, failing to capitalize on drives. This crucial win positions LSU favorably early in their season, while Clemson looks to rebound.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 6-1 defeat to the Arizona Diamondbacks, a loss that shrunk their National League West lead to just one game. Pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered an impressive performance, taking a no-hitter into the sixth inning and a shutout into the seventh, ultimately throwing 100 pitches over seven innings. However, the Dodgers' offense failed to provide adequate run support, scoring only one run and struggling with runners in scoring position, leaving eight runners on base. This continues a frustrating trend for Glasnow, who has not recorded a win in 152 days despite consistently strong outings this season.</p>

The councilmember argued that Home Depot's silence amid these "acts of terror" demonstrates a prioritization of power and profit over the working people it relies upon.

Johnson asserted that Chicago would not tolerate militarized activity or family separations, while the White House criticized the move as a "publicity stunt."

          <p>The Stringfellow family, traditional showpeople who have lived on a yard near Glasgow's River Clyde for over 40 years, are fighting eviction in Scotland's highest court. Glasgow City Council seeks to remove them for a multi-million-pound waterfront regeneration project, despite the family winning over 20 previous eviction cases. This legal battle is expected to set a precedent, as it will test the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, arguing that evicting Chanel Stringfellow and her five-year-year-old granddaughter would breach their right to a secure home and cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>German beer sales have reached a 30-year low, experiencing a 6.3% slump in the first half of 2025, while non-alcoholic beer sales have more than doubled since 2013. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting to this changing market, with non-alcoholic varieties now comprising a quarter of their production and being promoted at sporting events as a healthy alternative. This trend reflects a growing health consciousness and more mindful consumption habits among younger Germans, who tend to drink less daily. However, traditional alcoholic beer remains a deeply ingrained part of the country's cultural life, especially at festivals.</p>

          <p>Konami has released a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, marking the beloved series' return a decade after creator Hideo Kojima's acrimonious departure in 2015, which left the franchise directionless. The article explores the reasons behind Kojima's split, largely attributed to the spiraling costs of 2015's Metal Gear Solid V, and Konami's subsequent shift away from console games. Fans and critics are praising the remake for its faithful recreation, improved graphics, and retention of original voice performances, positioning it as a strong entry for both long-time fans and new players.</p>

The article highlights distressing cases of tailgating, horn-beeping, shouting, and even physical assault against instructors, emphasizing the urgent need for greater empathy on the roads and stricter enforcement against inconsiderate driving to ensure safety for new drivers.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new reality dating show, "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," described as a blend of Love Island, Married at First Sight, and Survivor. Couples meet briefly, have a fake wedding, and are then isolated on a remote tropical island to test if love can thrive under harsh, primitive conditions, stripped of modern comforts and beauty products. Contestants emphasize the show's authenticity and the challenge of building a relationship through adversity. With a slightly older average age for participants, the article suggests it reflects evolving dating trends and a desire for deeper connections.</p>

          <p>The Bayeux Tapestry will close to the public in France as it prepares for a controversial temporary move to the British Museum in London next September, a loan announced by French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.

A petition against the move has garnered 60,000 signatures, highlighting widespread concerns over the tapestry's fragility and the perceived high-handed decision-making process.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are deploying an unusual arsenal, including sniffer dogs and drones, to combat the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus), a tiny but devastating pest threatening the nation's forests. This beetle, which has killed millions of spruce trees in Europe and arrived in the UK via winds, has been labeled "public enemy number one." The efforts have successfully eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in southeast England. However, rising European populations due to climate change, creating stressed trees and favorable conditions, pose ongoing challenges to prevention and detection, requiring continued vigilance and advanced modeling.</p>

          <p>A California state bill, SB 256, aimed at preventing catastrophic wildfires by requiring investor-owned utilities like Southern California Edison to remove decommissioned power lines, failed in Sacramento.

Despite utilities withdrawing formal opposition, the bill's failure raises serious questions about accountability, the influence of powerful utility companies in legislative processes, and the ongoing risk of future wildfires from outdated and potentially re-energized infrastructure.</p>

The facility, a polarizing symbol of President Trump's immigration policy, housed detainees who allege serious medical neglect and denial of in-person access to legal counsel. While homeland security officials maintain it was clean and well-maintained, families report loved ones suffering, including one inmate who underwent colon surgery and was allegedly denied proper post-operative care.

The article highlights disturbing cases of exploitation, disrespect for the deceased, and a lack of legal recourse for families, such as one who discovered their father's head had been found by police.
