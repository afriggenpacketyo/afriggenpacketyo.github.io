          <p>Sony has projected a 12.9% decrease in net profit for the fiscal year 2025, estimating it to be around 930 billion yen. The announcement, made public on Tuesday, signals potential shifts in the company's financial performance. While the exact reasons for this anticipated decline were not provided in the article, it suggests that Sony is bracing for a less profitable year than the last, which could be attributed to various market factors or internal restructuring. The company is likely to provide more detailed explanations in their official financial reports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have been resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole. The resentencing came after emotional statements from the brothers, who acknowledged their actions and apologized to their family, with the Los Angeles judge noting the work the brothers have done to better the lives of inmates, including a hospice program for the elderly and sick. Family members testified in support of their release, detailing the brothers' rehabilitation and remorse, and their cousin said the family wanted a judge to give the brothers a lesser sentence than life without parole for the 1989 murders. District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposed the resentencing, arguing the brothers hadn't shown enough insight into their crimes.</p>

          <p>Roki Sasaki, the Los Angeles Dodgers' highly anticipated rookie pitcher from Japan, has been placed on the 15-day injured list due to a right shoulder impingement. Manager Dave Roberts revealed that Sasaki had been experiencing arm soreness since his previous start, which was his first time pitching with only five days of rest, one day less than his usual schedule. This injury follows a noticeable dip in Sasaki's velocity and a less-than-stellar performance against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Sasaki's arrival to the Dodgers was highly anticipated after a successful career with the Lotte Marines in Japan.</p>

          <p>Despite public dismissals, an internal Israeli analysis reveals that Gaza faces extreme food shortages due to blocked aid deliveries, with some Israeli military officials warning of widespread starvation unless supplies are restored urgently. The analysis exposes a divide between Israel's public stance and private deliberations, aligning with aid agencies' warnings of an impending famine. The United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting, with most members urging Israel to allow aid into Gaza, while the Israeli government maintains there is sufficient support for civilians. The article highlights the urgency of the situation, with bakeries and charity kitchens closing and the UN's World Food Program running out of food stocks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is reportedly seeking to hire lawyers to investigate employee misconduct, including "unauthorized communications with the media," according to a job posting. This action follows emails sent to some USAID employees stating they were under "administrative inquiry" for engaging with the press without authorization. Critics view this as an attempt to intimidate workers from objecting to agency downsizing. The majority of USAID employees are slated to be fired later this year as part of an agency-wide downsizing, spearheaded by Elon Musk and DOGE.</p>

          <p>State Farm will be allowed to temporarily increase homeowners' insurance rates by 17% in California following catastrophic fires, after the state gave the company permission. The insurer will be allowed to charge the higher rate at least until a hearing later this year. Consumer Watchdog criticized the move, calling it unfair and unfounded, while State Farm said that the insurer remains “deeply concerned about the financial position of State Farm General.” The higher rate comes after survivors of the Eaton fire in the working-class community of Altadena organized, first on a WhatsApp group dedicated to pickleball and later on Discord, a platform better known for gaming.</p>

          <p>José Mujica, the former president of Uruguay known for his humble lifestyle and leftist ideals, has died at the age of 89. Serving from 2010 to 2015, Mujica was a former guerrilla fighter who championed rural communities and progressive legislation. He refused to live on a presidential estate, opting instead for a modest home on a farm, and gave away most of his salary to help build housing for the poor. His legacy includes legalizing gay marriage, decriminalizing abortion, and fully regulating marijuana.</p>
