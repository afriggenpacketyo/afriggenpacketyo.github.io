          <p>Former President Donald Trump has once again promoted a false and outlandish conspiracy theory, reposting a claim that President Joe Biden was "executed" in 2020 and replaced by a robotic clone.

The spread of such theories has raised concerns about the impact of misinformation on political discourse and public perception.

          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm is forecasted to potentially make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., even as far south as northern California and Alabama. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center detected a solar flare associated with the storm. The storm is being spurred by a coronal mass ejection, which can disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. Space weather officials said that even though the coronal mass ejection is weakening, elevated solar wind conditions could still produce a significant cosmic event.</p>

          <p>Poland's presidential election is too close to call, with exit polls offering conflicting results for conservative historian Karol Nawrocki and Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski.

These firms are also aggressively seeking new markets in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and deepening trade with Europe by offering technology transfers for market access.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals a grim paradox in India: while antibiotic overuse drives resistance and superbugs, many people die because they lack access to life-saving drugs. The study found that only 7.8% of estimated cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative infections in India receive appropriate treatment. Weak health systems, limited access to effective antibiotics, and high costs prevent patients from getting the necessary drugs. Researchers advocate for smarter policies, stronger safeguards, and increased R&D to combat antimicrobial resistance and ensure access to antibiotics for those who need them most.

          <p>Former President Bill Clinton has strongly refuted claims of cognitive decline in President Joe Biden, stating that he was "on top" of his responsibilities. Clinton dismissed allegations from a recent book suggesting Biden's aides covered up declining health during his reelection campaign. He acknowledged concerns about Biden's age but affirmed that he never witnessed any signs of cognitive impairment. Clinton attributed the claims to attempts to blame Biden for Trump's reelection, emphasizing that Biden did a good job as president.</p>
