          <p>An elusive Banksy mural has appeared on the Royal Courts of Justice in central London, portraying a judge in traditional attire striking a protester, whose placard shows blood splatter. The artwork, authenticated by Banksy on Instagram, surfaced shortly after nearly 900 arrests at a London protest against the ban on Palestine Action, implicitly connecting to contemporary social issues. Security guards are now protecting the piece, which has already been partially covered. This new work continues Banksy's tradition of using public art to deliver poignant social and political commentary.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's appearance at the US Open men's final was met with a mix of cheers and significant boos, particularly when he was shown on stadium screens. The article suggests this public display was a deliberate tactic to project a "strongman image" and divert attention from pressing political and economic issues. Despite the negative reception from a largely multicultural East Coast crowd, the former president's presence generated controversy and discussion. This event highlights the polarizing nature of his public appearances and his perceived strategy of self-aggrandizement, even at major sporting events.</p>

          <p>India is actively rebalancing its international relations, strengthening ties with China and Russia amidst growing tariff friction with the United States. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent engagement with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin at the SCO summit symbolizes this strategic autonomy. Despite US tariffs on Indian goods, experts emphasize that New Delhi is not abandoning Washington but rather pursuing a multi-alignment policy to leverage relationships across various blocs. This delicate diplomatic tightrope aims to protect India's economic and strategic interests in an increasingly volatile global environment.</p>

          <p>At least 14 people were killed and dozens wounded in Kathmandu, Nepal, as police opened fire on tens of thousands of protesters. The demonstrations, dubbed the "Gen Z rally," were sparked by a government ban on major social media platforms like Facebook, X, and YouTube, alongside broader public anger over alleged corruption. Despite the government's defense of the ban as a measure for accountability, rights groups condemn it as censorship. The escalating violence and imposition of a curfew underscore deep-seated frustrations within the fragile democracy.</p>

          <p>Six people were killed and eight wounded in a shooting attack at a Jerusalem bus stop by two Palestinian gunmen. An off-duty soldier and a civilian neutralized the attackers, who opened fire at the busy Ramot Junction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the incident, vowing stronger counter-terrorism measures and ordering the encirclement of villages linked to the attackers. While no group immediately claimed responsibility, Hamas praised the "heroic operation," framing it as a response to Israeli actions. The attack occurs amidst intensified conflict in Gaza and ongoing ceasefire negotiations.</p>

An overland supply route would offer China cheaper and more secure energy, bypassing maritime chokepoints and insulating it from price volatility.

          <p>New FDA Covid vaccine guidelines, championed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" movement, are causing significant stress and inaccessibility issues in the US. Vaccines are now primarily authorized for those 65 and older or with underlying conditions, leaving many younger individuals ineligible. This policy shift, the first without widespread vaccination recommendations, has led to fears among Americans about protecting vulnerable loved ones and personal health. Healthcare professionals and individuals express deep concern over the scientific basis of these changes and the potential for increased illness and deaths.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that China's blurring boundaries between its civilian and defense sectors in artificial intelligence pose significant challenges for US policymakers and companies. Examples include drone manufacturers selling combat systems to the PLA and universities developing multi-drone coordination. This integration suggests China is developing a more agile defense industrial base with improving technological capabilities. The report warns that the US must navigate difficult trade-offs between fostering innovation through openness and safeguarding national security, to avoid being ill-positioned against China's advancements.</p>

          <p>Southern culture is increasingly dominating mainstream American trends, evidenced by a significant influx of college students from the North to Southern institutions. This demographic shift is attributed to factors like appealing campus experiences, relaxed Covid restrictions, and better value for tuition. The article explores how historical developments, including the Civil Rights Act, air conditioning, and highway programs, facilitated the South's industrial and cultural integration. It also discusses the region's impact on music, particularly the rise of Southern hip-hop and country, and the complex interplay of racial and cultural narratives within this evolving landscape.</p>

          <p>The US job market is described as "hell" by many job seekers, facing unprecedented difficulties despite strong corporate profits and a low jobless rate. The hiring rate has plummeted to a decade-low, while AI-driven online platforms create a "Tinderized" application process where résumés often go unanswered. Graduates with strong qualifications report hundreds of rejections, and experienced professionals struggle to secure interviews. This low-hire, low-fire equilibrium, exacerbated by factors like mass federal layoffs and concerns over slowing growth, suggests a looming recession, particularly impacting Black workers and younger demographics.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are challenging hopes for a US manufacturing revival, with businesses reporting increased costs and reduced investments. Manufacturers, often reliant on imported supplies, are experiencing contraction and job losses, contrary to the president's promises of lower costs and a new golden age. While some, like motorcycle jacket business Vanson Leathers, acknowledge the tariffs' disruptive nature, they also share concerns about uneven global trade practices. The article highlights the growing disconnect between Trump's economic rhetoric and the on-the-ground reality for American businesses.</p>

          <p>The new UK Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has stated that the UK could suspend visas from countries unwilling to agree to migrant returns deals. Her comments came during a Five Eyes intelligence-sharing meeting in London, where she emphasized securing borders as her "top priority." This tough stance follows a record number of small boat arrivals, which Mahmood deemed "utterly unacceptable." The proposal aligns with previous statements from the Prime Minister and signals a potentially harder, more transactional approach to immigration policy, with coordinated action among Five Eyes nations being considered.</p>

          <p>The appointment of Shabana Mahmood as UK Home Secretary is widely interpreted as a signal for a tougher stance on immigration, reflecting the government's prioritization of the issue. Mahmood, known for her "hardliner" reputation within Labour, is expected to accelerate existing plans, such as expanding military sites for asylum seekers and potentially bringing forward deadlines for closing asylum hotels. While constrained by senior party opposition to withdrawing from the ECHR, her communication style is anticipated to be more direct and less nuanced than her predecessor.

Wilson, whose views include the US as a Christian nation and questioning women's suffrage, recently shared a stage with Trump administration officials. His Moscow, Idaho-based Christ Church even opened a D.C. congregation to serve members working in the administration. Critics express concern as his hard-line theology, which downplays slavery's horrors and promotes patriarchal views, aligns with a populist, nationalist, and largely Christian America, reflecting a significant shift in evangelical influence.</p>
