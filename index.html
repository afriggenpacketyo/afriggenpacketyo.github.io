          <p>A time capsule buried by Princess Diana in 1991 at Great Ormond Street Hospital has been opened, revealing items like a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, and a passport. The capsule, intended to represent 1990s life, was unearthed earlier than planned to make way for a new children's cancer center. Selected by competition-winning children with Princess Diana's help, the contents offer a nostalgic glimpse into the era. Despite some damage, the items are largely intact, providing a unique historical record.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, testified in court, denying allegations of physically assaulting a security guard in 2018. She admitted to a verbal altercation, including cursing at the guard, whom she believed was recording her while she was four months pregnant. The security guard, Emani Ellis, is suing for assault, battery, and emotional distress, claiming Cardi B spat on her and scratched her. Cardi B maintained that the incident was strictly verbal and did not involve any physical contact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from SAP Concur indicates a decline in leisure travel to the United States in the first half of 2025, while business travel remains stable and robust. The U.S. was the top global destination for business travelers, accounting for 15% of all business air travel bookings, significantly more than Germany or the UK. This trend suggests that corporate interests in the U.S. are unaffected by broader negative travel sentiments observed in other regions. The slight increase in inbound business travel volume aligns with seasonal patterns, despite ongoing tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump's 50% Tariffs on India Implemented, Modi Promotes Domestic Self-Reliance</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's substantial 50% tariffs on India have taken effect, following an executive order related to India's Russian oil and weapons purchases. This move positions India among the countries facing the highest U.S. tariffs, potentially impacting its exports and economic growth. In response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised tax cuts and urged a national focus on "Made in India" products to foster self-reliance. Experts suggest these fiscal stimuli, including a simplified GST system, could boost domestic consumption and mitigate the tariff's economic blow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Illinois man, Emerson Evans, 31, has been arrested and charged with two counts of intentional homicide of an unborn child. He is accused of secretly administering abortion-inducing pills to his pregnant girlfriend without her consent, resulting in a miscarriage. Police determined Evans allegedly put multiple Mifepristone pills into the woman's vagina when she was seven weeks pregnant. Authorities stated Evans reportedly told police he "made the decision" for his girlfriend, leading to her medical emergency and the loss of her unborn child.</p>

          <p>China's industrial companies experienced a slower decline in profits in July, falling 1.5% year-on-year, marking the least contraction since May. This improvement is attributed to government efforts to curb overcapacity and aggressive price competition among producers. While the manufacturing sector saw profits rise by 6.8%, the mining sector continued to decline. Statistician Yu Weining noted that policy measures promoting a rebound in prices are contributing to corporate profitability, though overall profit margins remain under pressure due to softened domestic demand and persistent deflation.

This article highlights how Trump is increasingly using tariffs as a diplomatic weapon to impose political will, not just economic interests, leading to a counter-reaction.

          <p>A Wisconsin man, Ryan Borgwardt, who faked his own drowning while kayaking to flee the U.S. and meet a woman in Georgia, has been sentenced to 89 days in jail. Borgwardt was convicted of obstructing an officer, with the sentence reflecting the number of days he misled law enforcement. He initially pleaded not guilty but changed his plea to no contest, agreeing to pay $30,000 in restitution for search efforts. Prosecutors detailed his elaborate escape, including overturning his kayak and traveling through multiple countries. His wife divorced him four months after his return.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian forces have acknowledged that Russia's military has crossed into the eastern industrial region of Dnipropetrovsk, attempting to establish a foothold. This marks the first large-scale attack in the region, though Ukrainian forces claim to have halted their advance. While Moscow has not officially claimed Dnipropetrovsk, this incursion is a blow to Ukrainian morale amidst flagging diplomatic efforts to end the war. Western allies are urged to intensify efforts for future security guarantees, as the prospect of a ceasefire remains distant with Russia showing no signs of de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Australian police are conducting a massive manhunt for Dezi Freeman, 56, suspected of shooting and killing two officers and injuring a third in Porepunkah, Victoria. Ten officers were fired upon while executing a warrant for alleged sexual offenses. Police have deployed extensive resources, including a helicopter and armored vehicles, warning locals to stay indoors. Chief Commissioner Mike Bush confirmed the officers were "murdered in cold blood." Authorities believe Freeman is an experienced bushman, posing a challenge to the search in the dense bushland near his home.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's massive Starship rocket achieved crucial successes during its tenth test flight, breaking a series of previous failures. The 400-foot-tall rocket successfully deployed eight dummy Starlink satellites using its "Pez"-like system, a milestone previously unreached. The lower stage returned to Earth for a controlled splashdown, and the upper stage endured reentry heat before splashing down in the Indian Ocean. This smooth flight is vital for NASA's moon missions and Elon Musk's Mars colonization goals, reinforcing SpaceX's leading position in the launch industry despite past setbacks.</p>

          <p>The FBI is investigating a wave of "swatting" hoaxes targeting U.S. universities, triggering chaotic armed police responses as students return to campus. Nearly a dozen institutions, including Villanova and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, have experienced these false active shooter reports, causing widespread panic and campus lockdowns. Authorities note an increase in swatting incidents, which drain law enforcement resources, cost thousands of dollars, and endanger innocent people. The FBI encourages vigilance and immediate reporting of suspicious activity, highlighting past cases where hoaxes led to accidental shootings.</p>
