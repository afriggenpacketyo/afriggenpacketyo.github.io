          <p>Japan and the United States have reported progress in tariff talks and plan to hold intense ministerial-level discussions around mid-May to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Japan's chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, noted deepened discussions on nontariff barriers, bilateral trade expansion, and economic security cooperation after meeting with U.S. officials. Japan is considering increasing purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and simplifying the screening process for imported cars to address trade imbalances and potential tariffs. The U.S. administration's new tariffs on goods imported from Japan have been paused until early July under a 90-day reprieve.</p>

          <p>Owen McIntire, accused of setting fire to two Tesla Cybertrucks in Missouri, has been released from federal custody after his lawyer argued that detention would disrupt his ongoing gender-affirming medical care. McIntire, who faces federal charges including unlawful possession of an unregistered destructive device, was ordered into home detention at his parents' residence. His attorney cited McIntire's documented medical and mental health needs, including autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, depression, and gender dysphoria, as reasons for his release. Authorities found video footage of a person believed to be McIntire lighting and throwing Molotov cocktails at the Cybertrucks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to permit the removal of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had terminated an 18-month extension granted by the Biden administration, leading to a lawsuit alleging procedural violations and racial bias. A federal judge blocked the administration's efforts, citing irreparable harm to affected individuals and communities, as well as potential economic and public health consequences. The solicitor general argued that the law creating TPS barred judicial review of executive branch decisions regarding the designation or termination of a foreign state's status.</p>

          <p>Block (XYZ) reported lower-than-expected first-quarter results and issued a disappointing outlook, causing its stock to fall sharply in extended trading. The company's revenue decreased by 3% year-over-year, and gross profit also missed analysts' forecasts, reflecting challenging economic conditions. Block provided weaker profit guidance for the second quarter and full year, citing a more cautious stance on the macro outlook due to sweeping tariffs on imported goods. Despite the setback, CFO Amrita Ahuja emphasized that Block delivered its most profitable quarter ever, reflecting continued discipline and efficiency across the business. (not investment advice)</p>

Mr. Rubio's appointment to yet another job was so sudden that Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokeswoman, learned about it when a reporter read Mr. Trump’s social media post to her during a regular televised news conference.

In March, Waltz came under scrutiny after he put together a Signal chat and mistakenly included The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, disclosing discussions with top national security officials about plans for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen.</p>

While acknowledging that some of Trump's decisions may align with problematic philosophies of those around him, Bolton believes Trump himself does not share their worldview.

While Cambodia had hoped to be mine-free by 2025, this goal is now unattainable, with nearly 700 square miles of known minefields remaining.

          <p>May Day rallies across the United States swelled with demonstrators focused on immigration, education, and workers’ rights, fueled by growing opposition to President Trump’s agenda. Protesters denounced the administration’s efforts to roll back workers’ rights, cut education funding, and carry out mass deportations. Demonstrations took place in major cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, as well as smaller communities that voted for President Trump. Protesters also rallied in front of municipal buildings and public schools, with some wearing red to show support for public education. The protests coincided with traditional May Day labor rallies and a National Law Day of Action.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz has implemented a new "soda tax," adding a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages, despite a statewide ban on such taxes. The tax applies to nonalcoholic drinks with added sweeteners and 40 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces, including sodas, coffees, and energy drinks. Santa Cruz is the first city to institute a new soda tax since the statewide ban was enacted in 2018. Proponents framed the campaign as a battle against the American Beverage Association, which has heavily lobbied against soda taxes. The American Beverage Association argues that the tax unfairly burdens working families already struggling with high prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump has shifted his approach to ending the war in Ukraine, directing his frustration towards Vladimir Putin after an unsuccessful meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky. After a rocky start to negotiations with Zelensky, Trump has recently struck a more positive tone, even securing an economic deal with Ukraine. However, Trump's diplomacy has been complicated by conflicting advice from his aides, with special envoy Steve Witkoff echoing Kremlin talking points while Secretary of State Marco Rubio remains skeptical of Putin. Analysts suggest that Trump's desire for a quick resolution is clashing with Putin's reluctance to concede without further concessions.</p>

          <p>A North Korean hacker was caught attempting to infiltrate a US tech company by applying for an engineering role at the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. Executives allowed the hacker to proceed through the recruitment process to gather intelligence on their tactics. Red flags included a different name on the video call, a voice that occasionally switched, and an email address linked to a network of fake identities used by a hacking group. The hacker unraveled during the final interview when asked to verify their location and recommend local restaurants. State-sponsored attacks are a growing threat, with North Korean IT workers gaining employment at major companies to generate revenue for the state.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has proposed an increase in the film tax credit to maintain competitiveness with New Jersey and other states. New York has spent more than $5.5 billion in incentives since 2017 to support film and television productions. Each New York household has contributed approximately $16 in taxes towards producing the drama series “Billions” since 2017. This is part of a broader trend where states use tax incentives to attract film and television productions, boosting local economies but also raising questions about the cost to taxpayers.</p>

The report, commissioned by the Trump administration, expresses concern about long-term harms and criticizes American medical groups for fostering intolerant work environments. Transgender rights advocates have criticized the assessment as ideologically driven, effectively endorsing conversion therapy. The report is a victory for those who have described this field of medicine as part of a broader project that denies the realities of biological sex, while leading medical groups continue to endorse these treatments as effective in relieving psychological distress.</p>

          <p>Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks discussed the company's strategy to diversify its supply chain in response to President Trump's tariffs on China. Hasbro aims to source 40% of its products outside of China by the end of 2026, with manufacturing shifting to countries like the U.S., Turkey, China, Japan, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. While China will remain an important sourcing location, Hasbro expects to diversify production further as other supply sources mature. Cocks anticipates price increases due to tariffs but believes Hasbro's sourcing flexibility will help mitigate the impact. He also noted that 50% of revenue generated in the U.S. is either domestically-sourced or from "experiences or digital games."</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is facing criticism for watering down funding levels for maternity safety, leading to accusations of 'betrayal'. Following the publication of an interim report into poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust, almost £100m was invested into improving maternity safety annually. However, changes by the Department of Health mean that just £2m of the funding is guaranteed to be spent on maternity care this year. Campaigners and the Royal College of Midwives have questioned the commitment to maternity safety, with the latter describing the funding decision as taking "a wrecking ball" to maternity safety.</p>
