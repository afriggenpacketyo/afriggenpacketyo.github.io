          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst estimates, driven by a record-breaking performance in its trading division which generated nearly $9 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon noted the firm's major business lines performed well but also highlighted increasing economic uncertainty from geopolitical conditions and trade tensions. In response, the bank increased its provision for credit losses to $3.4 billion, signaling preparations for potentially higher loan defaults in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is intended to position the lab to better compete within the evolving space industry while continuing its vital work for NASA.</p>

          <p>California has passed a new slate of legislation aimed at increasing online safety for children, targeting both artificial intelligence and social media platforms. One first-of-its-kind law requires AI chatbots to disclose they are not human and to prompt minors to take breaks, while other bills mandate mental health risk warnings on social media apps. The new laws reflect growing concern among lawmakers over the potential harms of emerging technologies on young users.</p>

The commission found that the companies illegally restricted independent retailers from setting their own online and offline prices for their products.
