          <p>As tensions escalate between Iran and Israel, the Trump administration is weighing diplomatic solutions against potential military action, with U.S. officials signaling that the next 24 to 48 hours are crucial. Despite heightened rhetoric and increased U.S. military presence in the region, negotiations continue to assess Iran's willingness to abandon nuclear enrichment. The U.S. is sending additional aircraft and a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to protect American troops and maintain options for assisting Israel, while also considering the deployment of B-2 stealth bombers capable of destroying Iran's underground nuclear facilities. President Trump's frustration with Iran's lack of immediate answers underscores the urgency of the situation and the potential for a shift towards military intervention.</p>

The government aims to reset its approach to major infrastructure projects, appointing Mike Brown as the new chair of HS2 Ltd.

          <p>The question of whether the U.S. should support Israel in attacking Iran has exposed deep rifts among President Trump's supporters. Trump is reportedly considering assisting in targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting a clash between isolationist and hawkish factions within the Republican party. Conservative Republican congressman Thomas Massie joined Democrats to introduce a bill blocking Trump from engaging in unauthorized hostilities with Iran. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon argued that involving the U.S. in a war with Iran would undermine the coalition of Trump supporters and thwart efforts to address domestic issues.</p>

Homan contrasts this with the Biden administration, which he claims released the "vast majority" of encountered illegal immigrants into the U.S., while under Trump, zero were released in May. Homan advocates for the passage of the "Big Beautiful Bill" to complete the job, including a major deportation operation. These claims highlight a trend since Trump's return to office, with significantly reduced releases of illegal immigrants compared to the Biden years.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court heard arguments regarding California's challenge to President Trump's federalization of the state's National Guard troops amid protests over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, signaling it may have limited power to rule against the president's power to deploy troops. The judges indicated that if they had any ability to review the president's move to federalize the National Guard, it would be limited, while questioning the clarity of the requirement for consulting with a governor before deployment. The hearing took place before a three-judge panel, with the state arguing that the federalization takes guardsmen away from critical work such as wildfire prevention, and the federal government asserting the president's authority as commander-in-chief.</p>

          <p>China's humanoid robot companies are offering salaries more than three times the national average to attract engineers and AI talent, highlighting a deepening talent crunch in the sector. The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is around 31,512 yuan (US$4386), with more experienced roles commanding even higher wages. This stands in contrast to a subdued hiring landscape in other industries, where economic slowdown and corporate earnings pressure have led to layoffs and pay cuts. Despite challenges in the broader job market, the robotics sector remains a bright spot, driven by China's ambitions in AI and robotics.</p>

A study mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, indicating that the North Sea could become a biodiversity hotspot. While mobile species are expected to cope better, static creatures like sea pens may lose habitat, and the ocean quahog clam could struggle. The analysis aims to guide government planning to protect marine species as their habitats shift.</p>

          <p>California farmers are experiencing confusion and uncertainty due to contradictory signals from the Trump administration regarding immigration enforcement during the crucial summer harvest season. The state's agricultural industry, heavily reliant on undocumented labor, faces potential disruptions as immigration agents have conducted raids in farming regions. Farmers and worker advocates are seeking clarification on enforcement policies, with some employers reaching out to workers' rights organizations for guidance. While workers have largely continued to show up for work, the situation remains tense, and the industry is urging the administration to provide clear direction.</p>
