Proposed budget cuts could impact nearly half of NASA's science projects, potentially leading to the shutdown of 40 missions. Simultaneously, Trump has threatened to withdraw federal contracts from Musk's SpaceX, a crucial partner for resupplying the International Space Station and future lunar missions.

          <p>UK doctors are testing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors to combat superbug infections. Early data suggests that these pills can replace harmful gut bacteria with healthy ones, addressing infections resistant to antibiotics. The focus is on the bowels, which are a major reservoir of antibiotic resistance in humans, and drug-resistant superbugs can cause infections elsewhere in the body. The trial showed promising signals that poo pills could help tackle the rising scourge of superbugs and improve the array of gut bacteria.</p>
