          <h2>Trump's Trade War with China: An Analysis of Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 13:44:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that China has the upper hand in its trade war with the US due to several factors. China's economy is less dependent on US markets than the US is on Chinese goods, particularly rare earth minerals and electronics. America's allies are also hesitant to join the trade war, and the Chinese government faces less domestic political pressure to relent. The author argues that Trump's trade policies are rooted in a flawed premise and that the longer the trade war drags on, the more desperate Trump will become for a deal. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As collections resume for defaulted student loans, the U.S. government can garnish federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security benefits. Social Security recipients may see up to 15% of their monthly benefit reduced, while the entire federal tax refund can be seized. Wages can be garnished up to 15% without a court order, but borrowers can take steps to get out of default by enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan or signing up for loan rehabilitation. Experts advise requesting a retroactive forbearance to cover missed payments and a temporary forbearance until enrollment in a repayment plan is complete. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report on the Department of Labor's Jobs Corps Program reveals low graduation rates and high costs per student, raising concerns about its efficiency. The program, with a $1.7 billion budget in 2023, has an average graduation rate ranging from 32% to 38%, with an average cost per graduate between $155,600 and $187,653. Graduates are often hired in minimum wage positions, earning an average of $16,695 annually, leading to questions about the program's effectiveness and prompting calls for greater transparency and accountability. The Department of Labor has been active in pushing for transparency, and has also cancelled a $4 million contract for DEI consultation services and training in its Jobs Corps program.</p>

          <p>The posthumous publication of Joan Didion's therapy notes, titled 'Notes to John,' has sparked debate about the ethics of publishing a writer's unpublished work after their death. The notes, detailing sessions with her psychiatrist from 1999 to 2003, focus on her adopted daughter's alcoholism and were addressed to her husband. While some argue that such publications provide further insight into the author's life and work, others question whether Didion, known for her reticence, would have wanted these intimate journals to be made public.</p>

          <p>An aid agency warns that Sudanese people are resorting to eating charcoal and leaves to survive after fleeing an attack on a camp for displaced people near el-Fasher. People are dying of thirst and from sexual assault during their attempts to reach safety, and many bodies remain on the road between el-Fasher and Tawila. El-Fasher is the last city in Darfur under army control, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been battling the army for two years, causing a humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The invitation of Israeli Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to speak at Yale University sparked controversy due to his extremist views and past convictions for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. Critics argue that Yale's association with the event lends legitimacy to Ben-Gvir's views, while pro-Palestinian voices are being silenced through various means, including deportations and social media censorship. The controversy highlights concerns about the suppression of Palestinian perspectives and the manufacturing of consent for actions in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that tariffs imposed by President Trump would disproportionately burden lower-income U.S. households compared to wealthier ones. The study found that in 2026, taxes for the poorest 20% of households would rise about four times more than those in the top 1% if current tariff policies remain in place. Economists analyze the financial impact of policy relative to household income because it illustrates how their disposable income — and quality of life — are impacted. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool is set to introduce a "tourist tax" of £2 per night for overnight stays after hoteliers voted in favor of the plan. The levy is expected to raise £9.2m over two years, with £6.7m supporting the city's visitor economy. The charge will be managed and administered by hotels and serviced accommodation providers, and the money will be used to attract bigger events to the city.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has barred the Trump administration from denying or conditioning the use of federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions. The judge said portions of President Trump’s executive orders were unconstitutional. The judge prohibited the administration “from directly or indirectly taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funds” and the administration must provide written notice of his order to all federal departments and agencies by Monday.</p>

          <p>The Kings are playing in Edmonton with a chance to sweep the Oilers and win their first playoff series since their Stanley Cup championship run in 2014. The free-reed musical instrument has become the Kings’ unofficial postseason good luck charm — thanks to some memorable pregame performances of “The Star-Spangled Banner” played by a group representing the Koreatown Senior and Community Center. The team has even posted to pack the harmonicas for the big trip.</p>
