          <p>The Trump administration has revoked the extended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, effective September 1. This protection had been granted for an additional year by her former boss, President Joe Biden, beyond the legally mandated six-month period following her term. White House officials stated that a recent threat assessment did not find any specific dangers that would justify continuing the security detail. The move has drawn criticism from some California officials, who expressed concern for her safety.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced the expansion of its war against Hamas, declaring Gaza City a "dangerous combat zone" and suspending humanitarian pauses. Amid the escalating offensive, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that the bodies of two hostages taken during the October 7, 2023 attack have been recovered from the enclave. This military expansion has drawn international condemnation and fueled domestic protests from hostage families who fear for the safety of those still held captive. The conflict continues to exact a heavy toll on civilians in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese EV giant BYD has reported a nearly 30% drop in its second-quarter profits, earning 6.4 billion yuan ($894.6 million). The decline is attributed to an intense price war and aggressive marketing within the competitive domestic Chinese market, which has squeezed profit margins. This downturn in domestic earnings occurred despite a significant surge in the company's overseas performance. BYD's international sales grew by almost 145% year-on-year, indicating strong global demand for its more affordable electric vehicle models.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data shows that the median price for condominiums in the U.S. fell by 2.1% in July compared to the previous year, a trend largely driven by an oversupply of units on the market. This price drop is particularly pronounced in states like Florida and Texas, where a surge in inventory has coincided with rising costs for prospective buyers. However, real estate experts caution that the lower sticker prices may not represent a true bargain. Buyers must also factor in escalating expenses such as rising HOA dues, higher insurance premiums, and potential special assessments for building repairs.</p>

          <p>Shares of "buy now, pay later" company Affirm surged 15% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that significantly surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The company posted a net income of $69.2 million, a strong reversal from a $45.1 million loss in the same period last year, and provided optimistic guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. CEO Max Levchin cited continued consumer strength and momentum from partnerships with major retailers like Amazon and Shopify. The positive results helped alleviate concerns about increased competition and the recent loss of Walmart as a partner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, rose to an annual rate of 2.9% in July. This slight increase from June's 2.8% marks the highest level since February and aligns with economists' expectations, suggesting that inflationary pressures persist in the economy. While overall inflation remains well below its peak, the figure is still above the central bank's 2% target, complicating upcoming decisions on interest rates. The report also noted that consumer spending remained strong, increasing by 0.5% during the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An executive order by President Donald Trump has officially ended the "de minimis" trade exemption, which for nearly a decade allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. The sudden change is causing significant operational and financial challenges for global businesses, from small online sellers to large corporations like Tapestry and Lululemon, who had built supply chains around this provision. The elimination of what the administration called a "catastrophic loophole" is intended to curb tariff evasion and the import of illicit goods.

While the company's overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, the strong performance of the cloud unit and a revival in its e-commerce business have been well-received by investors.

It examines the role of the internet and music blogs like Pitchfork in shaping the genre's trajectory and discusses how the "indie" aesthetic eventually influenced major pop artists.

The ministry's savings estimates, which suggested up to £2.9 billion could be saved, were based on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now warning that the mergers could potentially result in no savings and might even cost taxpayers money, depending on how they are implemented. Critics have called it "astonishing" that the government would embark on such a massive reform without independent, up-to-date evidence.</p>

The filing draws a parallel to the July attack by Shane Tamura, who also left behind writings explaining his motives before killing four people.

The expansion was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. However, some analysts point to a potential slowdown, as nominal GDP growth, which doesn't account for inflation, has decreased. The strong GDP figures come as the country faces economic headwinds, including the recent implementation of 50% tariffs on Indian imports by the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly preparing a second, improved offer for Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak, a move that could become a British record transfer deal. This potential transfer is seen as the key to unlocking a series of other deals before the transfer window closes. Newcastle is already close to signing Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade as a replacement and is also pursuing Brentford's Yoane Wissa. Should these moves proceed, it would likely clear the way for Isak's desired transfer to Liverpool, creating a domino effect across several Premier League and European clubs.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has publicly stated his support for a quarter-point interest rate cut at the central bank's upcoming September meeting. In a recent speech, Waller expressed concern that the U.S. labor market could be weakening more rapidly than current data suggests and argued that the Fed should act preemptively. He also indicated that he would be open to a larger half-point cut if the next employment report shows a substantial economic slowdown. Waller's comments provide a strong signal that a shift in monetary policy is likely forthcoming. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested two firefighters who were battling a wildfire on Washington's Olympic Peninsula, stating that the individuals were in the country illegally. The arrests were part of a criminal investigation into the contractors that employed the 44-person crew. The incident drew a sharp rebuke from Senator Patty Murray, who called the administration's immigration policy "fundamentally sick" and "dangerous" for detaining firefighters during an active wildfire season. Federal authorities maintained that the enforcement action did not interfere with firefighting operations in the area.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation, including Senators Roger Wicker and Deb Fischer, visited Taiwan to express strong support for the self-governing island. During a meeting with President Lai Ching-te, Wicker described Taiwan as a "free country" with an absolute "right to remain free," reinforcing America's commitment to its security. The visit comes amid heightened military pressure from Beijing, which views Taiwan as part of its territory and opposes any official exchanges between Taipei and Washington. China's Foreign Ministry condemned the visit, calling it a serious violation of its "one-China" principle.</p>

          <p>The restaurant chain Cracker Barrel has become the target of a right-wing culture war backlash after updating its "Old Timer" logo and redesigning its store interiors for a more modern aesthetic. Critics, including Donald Trump Jr., accused the company of becoming "woke" and abandoning its traditional American image, linking the changes to diversity and inclusion initiatives. The campaign against the company was amplified by conservative activists who called for boycotts and framed the corporate rebranding as an ideological betrayal. The incident highlights how corporate marketing decisions can be drawn into broader political and cultural conflicts.</p>

          <h2>Upcoming Military Parade in Beijing Expected to Reveal Shifts in PLA Leadership</h2>

          <p>An upcoming military parade in Beijing is being closely watched by international observers for insights into the current hierarchy of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). Since the PLA does not regularly publicize personnel changes, the generals chosen to lead formations will provide clues about who is currently favored by the top command. Conversely, the absence of prominent figures may indicate who has been affected by President Xi Jinping's ongoing anti-corruption campaign. The event offers a rare public display of the military's leadership structure and potential rising stars.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, the U.S. ambassador to China, David Perdue, is not expected to attend a major military parade in Beijing commemorating the end of World War II. This move is seen as part of a coordinated effort by several Western nations to decline invitations to the event. While it remains unclear if a lower-level diplomat will attend in the ambassador's place, the decision reflects ongoing diplomatic tensions between the United States and China. The parade is a significant national event for Beijing, and the absence of key foreign dignitaries is notable.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) held a major two-day career expo in Arlington, Texas, as part of a significant recruitment drive to hire thousands of new deportation officers. The event is one of the first since new legislation allocated billions for expanded immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. The agency has loosened hiring restrictions, such as age limits, and is offering large bonuses to attract applicants. The recruitment effort has drawn a wide range of candidates while also attracting protests from immigrant rights advocates.</p>
