          <p>China's box office is experiencing a slowdown during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, with revenue lower than previous holidays, despite the popularity of the Hollywood film "Mission: Impossible â€“ The Final Reckoning." The industry is grappling with underwhelming performances and broader economic challenges affecting domestic consumption. Last year, China's box office revenue declined significantly, raising concerns about the market's long-term resilience. However, some observers remain optimistic, citing improvements in domestic productions as a potential driver for future growth. The film market is expected to rebound as Chinese productions improve in quality and continue to attract audiences. </p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that tough public spending choices are unavoidable as the UK government finalizes its spending plans. The level of funding for the NHS will significantly impact potential cuts to unprotected areas like transport and the criminal justice system. While spending increased sharply in 2024, it will no longer increase year-on-year due to government commitments. The IFS suggests that a huge amount depends on the generosity of cash handed to the NHS and defense, potentially pulling funding from other areas.</p>
