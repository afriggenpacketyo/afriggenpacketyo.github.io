        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta is rolling out new content restrictions for teen users on Instagram, aligning the platform's default settings with a PG-13 movie rating standard. These automatic protections, affecting all users under 18, will block searches for sensitive terms like 'gore' and prevent teens from following accounts that regularly post age-inappropriate material. The update also extends to Instagram's AI features to ensure responses are suitable and introduces a more restrictive 'Limited Content' setting for parents seeking greater control over their teen's online experience.</p>

          <p>Actress and producer Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first novel, a thriller titled "Gone Before Goodbye," in collaboration with bestselling author Harlan Coben. The book follows an Army combat surgeon, Maggie McCabe, who becomes entangled in an international conspiracy while dealing with personal challenges. Witherspoon aimed to create a formidable female action hero comparable to characters like Jason Bourne, drawing inspiration from her parents' military medical backgrounds. The authors hope the novel will be adapted into a film or television series, potentially launching a new franchise.</p>

          <p>The mother, boyfriend, and aunt of a 12-year-old Connecticut girl have been charged in her death after her remains were discovered in a storage bin outside an abandoned home. Authorities allege that Jacqueline "Mimi" Torres Garcia endured prolonged physical abuse and malnourishment before she was killed last fall. The investigation began after police responded to reports of suspicious activity involving the bin being dropped off at the property. The case has prompted the state's Department of Children and Families to launch a thorough review of its history with the family.</p>

          <p>Military families are expressing significant financial anxiety over the possibility of missed paychecks due to the ongoing government shutdown. Despite White House assurances that funds have been identified to pay service members, the uncertainty is causing considerable stress for households already living paycheck to paycheck. Advocacy groups note that many military families have limited savings, making even a temporary delay in pay potentially devastating. This situation forces families to make difficult decisions about which essential bills to pay, compounding the sacrifices they already make.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has seized approximately $15 billion in bitcoin linked to a massive "pig butchering" fraud operation based in Cambodia. The seizure, the largest in DOJ history, targets assets controlled by Chen Zhi, the alleged leader of the scheme who remains at large. Prosecutors claim his multinational conglomerate, Prince Holding Group, operated forced-labor compounds where trafficked individuals were made to carry out cryptocurrency investment scams. These scams defrauded victims worldwide of billions by building trust before stealing their funds.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has pointed to recent bankruptcies in the U.S. auto market as an early warning sign of excessive risk in corporate lending. Citing the collapse of firms like First Brands and Tricolor Holdings, Dimon suggested that over a decade of a credit bull market has led to lax standards. He warned that if an economic downturn occurs, more significant credit issues are likely to surface across the market. JPMorgan itself took a $170 million charge-off related to the Tricolor failure, highlighting the tangible risks for major financial institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is excelling at his new club, Napoli, after leaving Manchester City on a free transfer this summer. His impressive performances have sparked debate over whether Manchester City allowed the 34-year-old star to depart prematurely. Despite a storied career with City, he was deemed surplus to requirements as the club saw an exodus of several senior players. De Bruyne's current form, with a high rate of goals and assists, suggests he could have remained a key player for his former team, which has had a mixed start to the season.</p>

          <p>An article explains that homeowners who take out a reverse mortgage retain full legal ownership and title of their property. The lender places a lien on the home to secure the loan, but does not take ownership. This financial tool allows seniors aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without making monthly payments. The loan balance, including interest and fees, becomes due when the borrower sells the home, moves out, or passes away, at which point the heirs can choose to repay the loan to keep the house or sell it.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has announced his support for suspending President Emmanuel Macron's controversial 2023 pension reforms until after the 2027 presidential election. The move is a significant concession aimed at securing the support of Socialist MPs and surviving crucial no-confidence votes that threaten to topple his government. The reforms, which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64, sparked widespread protests and were forced through parliament without a final vote. This potential reversal highlights the fragile political position of Macron's administration and its struggle to pass a budget.</p>

          <h2>Government Shutdown Unlikely to Halt Mortgages, but May Delay Government-Backed Loans</h2>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is not expected to significantly disrupt the mortgage market, though it may cause delays for some borrowers. While conventional loans from private lenders should proceed as normal, applications for government-backed loans from the FHA, VA, and USDA could face processing slowdowns due to furloughed federal employees. The USDA is expected to halt the issuance of new home loans entirely during the shutdown. Additionally, homebuyers in flood zones may face complications securing required flood insurance from the FEMA-administered national program, potentially delaying closings.</p>

          <p>While hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have their pay delayed due to the government shutdown, members of Congress and the president will continue to be paid. Lawmakers' salaries are funded by a permanent appropriation under the Constitution and are not subject to the annual funding lapse. Similarly, the president's salary cannot be reduced while in office. In contrast, non-essential congressional staffers and executive branch employees will be furloughed, and even essential workers who must remain on the job will not receive their paychecks until the shutdown ends.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding legislation before the fiscal year begins on October 1, forcing federal agencies to cease all non-essential functions. Under the Antideficiency Act, agencies cannot spend money without congressional authorization. Essential services, such as national security, law enforcement, and air traffic control, continue to operate, but employees in these roles work without immediate pay. Entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare continue to pay benefits, but customer service and administrative functions may be severely curtailed due to staff furloughs.</p>

          <p>A massive surge in spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure is boosting economic indicators like GDP, but some analysts warn this boom may be concealing underlying weaknesses. While billions are being invested in data centers and chips, there are concerns about the sustainability of this momentum. A Deutsche Bank analysis suggested that without this AI-related investment, the U.S. economy might already be in a recession. The situation draws comparisons to the dot-com bubble, raising questions about whether current spending levels and market valuations are sustainable long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats are introducing legislation to protect the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) nutrition program from the effects of government shutdowns. The bill aims to reclassify WIC funding as mandatory, ensuring it remains fully funded without being subject to annual budget disputes. As the current shutdown continues, fears are growing that contingency funds for the program, which serves 6.7 million low-income women and children, will run out. Some state and local WIC offices have already begun scaling back services or placing new applicants on waitlists.</p>

          <p>The explosive demand for data centers, driven by the AI boom, is creating a new and valuable real estate asset class known as 'powered land.' This refers to land that has been prepared with the necessary permits, utility commitments, and infrastructure to support large-scale data center operations. Global real estate investment firms are now focusing on securing these power-rich sites, transforming them into tradable assets before any buildings are constructed. This shift highlights that the primary challenge in the data center market is no longer construction but securing the massive amounts of electricity required. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Colorado families who sued a school district over policies they claimed violated their parental rights.

While the court turned away the case on procedural grounds, Justice Samuel Alito wrote a separate statement, joined by two other justices, expressing concern. He noted the growing national importance of the questions raised by the case regarding parental authority.</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has effectively taken control of Nexperia, a chipmaker owned by China's Wingtech, citing security of supply risks. This action followed warnings from U.S. authorities, who had raised concerns about Nexperia's Chinese CEO and its parent company's inclusion on a U.S. national security threat list. The Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to block or reverse management decisions, a move aimed at preventing the transfer of sensitive technology. The intervention has heightened geopolitical tensions with Beijing, which condemned the takeover as "robbery in legal disguise."</p>
