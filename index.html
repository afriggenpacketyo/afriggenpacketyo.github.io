          <h2>WTA to Provide Ranking Protection for Players Freezing Eggs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 14:59:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) will now offer ranking protection to female tennis players ranked in the top 750 who choose to freeze their eggs or embryos, provided they spend more than 10 weeks away from competition. This new rule aims to alleviate the pressure on players to return to the court prematurely after undergoing the procedure. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, shared her personal experience of rushing back to tennis after freezing her eggs and emphasized the importance of this protected ranking for players' health and well-being, allowing them ample recovery time without jeopardizing their careers. This initiative is seen as a positive step towards supporting female athletes' family planning decisions. The context of the WTA's decision stems from a growing awareness of the challenges faced by female athletes balancing their careers and personal lives.</p>

          <p>After declining for three consecutive months, inflation rose again in May to 2.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which could potentially impact gold prices. Historically, inflation and gold prices have shown a positive correlation, with gold often used as a hedge against inflation. However, this relationship is not always consistent, as demonstrated by recent months where gold prices rose despite declining inflation due to other economic factors like market uncertainty. While the minimal 0.1% increase in inflation may not guarantee a rise in gold prices, investors are advised to consider multiple factors when making investment decisions, with gold limited to 10% or less of their overall portfolio to avoid overcrowding other assets at the same time.

          <p>Starbucks is piloting a new banana-flavored protein cold foam at five U.S. locations, aiming to tap into the growing popularity of protein-enhanced beverages and snacks. This test is part of Starbucks' broader strategy to reimagine its menu and introduce innovative products through its "Starting Five" program. As part of this menu redesign, Starbucks plans to reduce its food and beverage offerings by 30% by the end of Fiscal Year 2025 to streamline operations and enhance customer experience. The move comes as Starbucks seeks to boost sales and revitalize its brand under the "Back to Starbucks" restructuring plan, which includes operational and aesthetic upgrades.

          <p>In his New York retrial, Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley but acquitted of a similar charge involving Kaja Sokola; the jury remained deadlocked on a third charge of sexual assault against Jessica Mann. The jury, composed of seven women and five men, reached this partial verdict after days of tense deliberations, marked by internal disputes and requests to speak privately with the judge. Weinstein, who did not testify, faced accusations from Haley, Sokola, and Mann, all of whom testified during the trial. The retrial was initiated after Weinstein's initial 2020 conviction was overturned, and the jury's inability to reach a unanimous decision on all counts highlights the complexities of the case. The judge instructed the jurors to continue deliberating on the remaining count.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk publicly stated his regret for some of his recent social media posts directed at President Donald Trump, admitting they "went too far." This follows a public dispute between Musk and Trump, which had disrupted their close partnership and raised concerns about the future of Musk's companies, Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict originated from Musk's opposition to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a Trump-backed tax and spending bill that Musk claimed would undermine the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The initial disagreement led to a drop in Tesla's stock value, but shares have since recovered, and Trump indicated a willingness to speak with Musk despite their differences.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's implementation of tariffs, the U.S. Treasury collected a record $22 billion in tariff payments in May, signaling the financial impact of these trade policies. While these revenues represent a small fraction of the federal government's overall income, House Republicans are considering using them to offset projected losses from their proposed tax and spending bill. However, concerns remain about whether tariff revenues can adequately compensate for the potential economic consequences of the tax cuts, with some analysts suggesting that the costs could ultimately be passed on to consumers through higher prices or reflected in narrower profit margins for companies. The debate highlights the complex interplay between trade policy, government revenue, and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may see a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to estimates from The Senior Citizens League and policy analyst Mary Johnson. This projection is based on recent government inflation data and is slightly higher than previous forecasts, with Johnson describing it as "about average." The COLA is designed to help Social Security checks keep pace with inflation, with the official announcement typically made in October based on third-quarter inflation data. The final COLA may fluctuate depending on how President Trump's tariff policies impact inflation and consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war is increasingly viewed as a failure, with the U.S. economy slowing while China's economy thrives. The tariffs, initially touted as painless and beneficial, have not yielded the promised results, and Trump's approach has alienated allies and prompted legal challenges. Despite claims of a successful deal with China, the lack of details suggests that Trump may have conceded more than he gained. As the trade war falters, Trump is expected to blame domestic opponents and call for national solidarity, but his divisive rhetoric and lack of broad support make it difficult to rally the country behind his policies.</p>

Despite a rise in tax revenue and tariff collections, yields have remained high, offsetting some of the shortfall.
