          <h2>Trump's Meeting with Zelensky Sparks Hope for Ukraine</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's previously strained relationship with Ukraine, his recent meeting with President Zelensky has offered a glimmer of hope amidst the ongoing war with Russia. Trump questioned Putin's motives and hinted at potential sanctions, signaling a possible shift in his approach to the conflict. This development is significant for Ukraine, which has been wary of a peace plan perceived as favoring Moscow. Trump's rare rebuke of Putin following a missile attack on Kyiv further fueled optimism that he may not force Ukraine into a disadvantageous agreement. Optimism is cautiously rising among Ukrainians as they assess the implications of this evolving dynamic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are facing a wave of lawsuits from state officials, small businesses, and political groups, challenging his authority to impose taxes on imports without congressional approval. Rick Woldenberg, CEO of an educational toy company, is among those legally contesting the tariffs, highlighting the economic strain they place on businesses. The lawsuits argue that Trump is overstepping his constitutional powers by sidestepping Congress in matters of taxation. This legal battle underscores the growing opposition to Trump's trade policies and their potential impact on the economy.</p>

          <p>Aviation experts are investigating the circumstances leading to a fatal plane crash near Ronald Reagan National Airport, focusing on the use of 'visual separation' by the crew. The Black Hawk helicopter crew requested and received permission to navigate around other aircraft visually, rather than relying on air traffic control. This practice, while common, carries inherent risks if mishandled, and is being scrutinized as a potential contributing factor in the crash.

          <p>The Chinese coastguard has reportedly seized a tiny sandbank, Sandy Cay, in the South China Sea, escalating tensions with the Philippines. The Philippine government has yet to respond, but the move prompted a warning from the White House, which called it 'deeply concerning if true.' The incident occurred as US and Philippine forces conduct annual war scenario drills, criticized by China as provocative. Competing claims over territory in the South China Sea have fueled regional disputes for years, with China asserting dominance through island-building and naval patrols.</p>

          <p>The Green Party is calling for the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to withdraw its interim guidance on single-sex spaces, deeming it 'ill-considered and impractical.' The guidance, prompted by a UK Supreme Court ruling, addresses the use of single-sex facilities by transgender individuals. Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer argues that the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination and creates confusion for employers and service providers. The Liberal Democrats have also raised concerns about enforcement, prompting calls for further parliamentary debate.</p>

          <p>The Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) reports a significant increase in requests for church asylum, driven by growing fears of deportation among refugees. Churches provide temporary shelter to allow asylum cases to be reevaluated, particularly in Dublin cases where individuals have already applied for asylum in another EU country. However, the incoming government's intention to increase deportations has put pressure on church asylum programs, with reports of police evictions and penalties for church officials. The EKD defends the practice as a last resort to protect vulnerable individuals.</p>
