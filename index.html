          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 08:46:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive new budget bill, championed by President Trump, is set to become law after passing the House. The legislation permanently extends the 2017 tax cuts, which primarily benefit corporations and wealthy individuals, while also increasing the standard deduction temporarily. To finance these cuts, the bill imposes steep reductions and new work requirements for Medicaid, potentially causing millions to lose health coverage, and reforms the SNAP food assistance program. It also boosts defense and immigration enforcement funding, raises the SALT deduction cap temporarily, and makes changes to Social Security taxes and child tax credits.</p>

          <p>Hamas is currently consulting with other Palestinian factions before responding to the latest US-backed ceasefire proposal, which includes a 60-day pause in fighting and a phased release of hostages. President Trump anticipates a decision from Hamas within 24 hours, noting that Israel has accepted the necessary conditions for the truce. Meanwhile, Israeli military operations continue in Gaza, with recent deadly strikes reported in Khan Younis. The proposal's key points include unrestricted aid, a phased Israeli withdrawal, and negotiations for a permanent end to the war, a crucial demand for Hamas.</p>

          <p>A 90-day pause on extensive US tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty for consumers and businesses. If new trade agreements are not reached, a baseline 10% duty and additional country-specific reciprocal rates will take effect, potentially fueling inflation and harming financial markets. While the Trump administration has announced deals with China and the UK, the status of pacts with many other nations, including the EU, remains unresolved. Experts suggest the deadline might be extended for some countries, but the ongoing threat of tariffs continues to stifle investment and economic planning.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists at the Magna Roman Fort, part of Hadrian's Wall, have unearthed a collection of "unusually large" 2,000-year-old shoes, sparking a historical mystery. Several of the leather shoes are equivalent to a modern US size 15, a size range that is exceptionally rare at other Roman sites. The shoes were discovered in a defensive ditch, preserved by low-oxygen soil conditions. Researchers are now investigating which Roman regiments were stationed at Magna, speculating that the diverse origins of soldiers from across the vast empire could explain the presence of individuals with larger feet.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that celebrating the Fourth of July feels hollow this year, as the gap between America's democratic ideals and its reality widens. The authors, three legal professionals, note that while marginalized communities have always recognized this hypocrisy, a recent backslide in civil rights and an increase in anti-democratic actions are making it apparent to all. They contend that despair is not a solution and urge grassroots action to defend and transform democracy from the ground up. The piece calls for envisioning a more equitable future and taking concrete steps in local communities to make that vision a reality.</p>

          <p>The latest installment in the Jurassic Park series, "Jurassic World Rebirth," attempts to reset the franchise but ultimately falls flat. The review praises director Gareth Edwards for the film's impressive scale and clear action sequences, but criticizes it as a plodding and disenchanting experience. The plot, a familiar mix of mercenaries and a shipwrecked family on a dinosaur-infested island, lacks narrative stakes and memorable characters. Despite a capable cast including Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, the film suffers from rote dialogue and an overall sense of boredom, making the dinosaurs feel more like wallpaper than a genuine threat.</p>

          <p>With a July 9 deadline approaching, the European Union is scrambling to secure a trade deal with the US to avoid potentially crippling tariffs of up to 50% on its goods. However, negotiations are hampered by sharp divisions among EU member states regarding what concessions are acceptable. While some leaders like Germany's Chancellor Merz advocate for a quick resolution, others like France's President Macron resist what they see as blackmail. Experts believe a limited, UK-style agreement is the most likely outcome, but the EU may find it difficult to accept a deal that leaves significant US tariffs in place.</p>

The assault occurred on the same day President Trump held a phone call with Vladimir Putin, which Ukrainian President Zelenskyy called a deliberate signal of Moscow's intent to continue the war. Trump later described the call as "very disappointing," stating he made no progress in convincing Putin to end the conflict.

          <p>Recently surfaced images of a new variant of China's J-20A stealth fighter have sparked speculation that the aircraft will be publicly unveiled at a major military parade in Beijing. The parade will mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The photos show a J-20A prototype with modified engine air intakes, known as diverterless supersonic inlets (DSI), which are smaller than on previous versions. These changes are believed to be optimized for the new, more powerful WS-15 engines, enhancing both the fighter's stealth capabilities and its overall aerodynamic performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how the Continental Army, under George Washington, was instrumental in creating a national American identity where one had not previously existed. In 1775, the 13 colonies were disparate and competitive, with stronger ties to Britain than to each other. The shared experience of the Revolutionary War—fighting together, traveling across different colonies, and enduring common hardships—forged a new sense of unity among soldiers. The army also established national symbols and traditions, such as a new flag and celebrating Washington's birthday, which helped replace loyalties to the British crown and laid the foundation for a new nation.</p>

          <p>The passage of President Trump's major budget legislation has amplified concerns about the long-term stability of the US dollar and the nation's growing debt. The bill is set to raise the federal debt ceiling by $5 trillion, a move that allows for more government borrowing but also risks greater debt accumulation. According to one analyst, investors were already seeking to diversify away from US dollar assets even before the bill's passage due to existing economic pressures. The new spending and debt could accelerate this trend, further questioning the US currency's long-held status as a global safe-haven asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Rise of AI-Generated Music and the Blurring Lines of Authenticity</h2>

          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of AI-generated music through the lens of The Velvet Sundown, a seemingly popular but likely artificial band on Spotify. The author argues that the band's innocuous, genre-blending sound is perfectly suited for the modern era of streaming, where music often serves as an ambient backdrop rather than an object of active listening. The piece suggests that services like Spotify have conditioned listeners to prefer algorithmically generated "vibes" over the intentionality of human artists. The success of soulless, AI-created content reflects a cultural shift where music's role has moved from defining identity to simply filling the void.</p>

          <p>The body of Marites Buenafe, a 62-year-old doctor, has been found by authorities in Alaska after she went missing during a hike. Buenafe disembarked from the Norwegian Bliss cruise ship in Juneau for a hike on the popular but challenging Mount Roberts trail and failed to return to the ship. An extensive search involving multiple agencies, helicopters, and drones was launched. Her body was located by an Alaska Army National Guard helicopter crew approximately 1,700 feet below a ridge line. Her body has been recovered and will be sent for an autopsy.</p>

          <h2>New US-Vietnam Trade Pact Aims to Counter Chinese Transshipments</h2>

          <p>The United States has announced a new trade pact with Vietnam that includes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on items transshipped through Vietnam from other countries. This "transshipping" tariff is a clear effort to crack down on Chinese manufacturers who have been rerouting exports through Vietnam to evade higher US duties. While the deal provides some trade relief for Vietnam, it raises complex enforcement questions about how to define and verify the origin of goods. The agreement is seen as a template for future US trade deals in the region.</p>

          <p>A North Korean civilian has successfully crossed the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and has been taken into custody by the South Korean military. The man was first detected near the Military Demarcation Line, prompting a 20-hour surveillance and tracking operation by Seoul's forces. Due to dense vegetation and landmine risks, troops approached the man at night, and he willingly followed them to safety. Defections across the land border are rare, and the individual will now be questioned by intelligence authorities to determine the circumstances of his escape from the North.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Club World Cup's initial stages reveals a mixed bag of outcomes, particularly concerning attendance and playing conditions. Despite solid average attendance figures of around 35,000 per game, the use of very large stadiums meant venues were, on average, only 51% full. Oppressive heat was a significant factor, with Washington D.C. being the hottest host city and New Zealand's Auckland City experiencing the most severe conditions. On the field, data supports the narrative that South American teams, particularly from Brazil, performed strongly, earning a win or draw in 77% of their matches.</p>
