          <p>An opinion piece discusses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system after 2047, when the 'one country, two systems' framework is set to expire. The author reflects on initial worries in the 1970s regarding the 1997 handover and urges calm, suggesting that dwelling on the post-2047 scenario is unproductive. The author highlights the need to address the issue of land leases and contract law, which were previously raised but largely ignored during the lead up to 1997. The piece ultimately encourages a measured approach to future uncertainties. </p>

          <p>Residents of Wharncliffe Side, a village in Sheffield, are protesting against the construction of 300 new homes on green belt land, citing the existing doubling of the village size due to previous housing developments.

Green belt land is a designated area of open countryside in major towns and cities in the UK and it is aimed at controlling urban growth. </p>

          <p>Poland began voting in a high-stakes presidential election that will shape the country's political future, particularly regarding abortion rights, LGBTQ protections, and EU relations. The front-runners are pro-EU Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski and nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, with polls suggesting a likely runoff. The election occurs amidst a power struggle between the Polish prime minister and the outgoing conservative president, Andrzej Duda, potentially influencing the government's policy reform efforts.

          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others, half of them critically.

New York City officials have inspected the bridge and found no major structural damage, while the National Transportation Safety Board is set to investigate the incident.

          <p>A new internal survey suggests that the German military (Bundeswehr) does not have 'systemic' extremism, with only a small percentage of soldiers exhibiting right-wing extremist views. However, other problematic attitudes, such as chauvinism and xenophobia, were found among some soldiers. Researchers remain skeptical of the safeguards in place, particularly given past incidents involving far-right networks within the military. While the military has implemented anti-extremism measures, concerns persist about the potential normalization of right-wing attitudes in wider society and the challenges of rigorous screening amid recruitment efforts. </p>

          <p>A 1993 Minneapolis murder case was reopened decades later, with investigators focusing on bloody, bare footprints found at the crime scene. The victim, Jeanie Childs, was stabbed more than 60 times, and the footprints were determined to belong to the killer. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile that repeated itself on multiple items at the scene. Investigative genetic genealogy linked the DNA to Jerry Westrom, who was arrested in 2019. Though Westrom denied knowing the victim, his DNA and footprints were found at the scene. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is shifting its financing approach in Africa by promoting Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund large infrastructure projects, moving away from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This model grants Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Examples include the extension of Kenya's Standard Gauge Railway, where Chinese financiers would contribute 40% of the project cost and operate the railway for at least 25 years to recoup their investment. </p>

          <p>Romania is holding a presidential election rerun after the previous vote in November was annulled by the constitutional court due to irregularities. The previous election saw far-right candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round, but the vote was later found to have been compromised by electoral violations. These violations included the use of social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messaging as part of a 'Russian hybrid attack,' which Moscow denies. Georgescu has been banned from standing in the rerun. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed delaying the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and charging current beneficiaries with 'unsatisfactory immigration status' a monthly fee of $100 starting in 2027, citing budget deficits. The proposed changes aim to address a $12 billion deficit in the state budget, attributed to factors such as President Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. While Newsom affirms his commitment to protecting immigrant communities, he argues that the state must take difficult measures to ensure Medi-Cal's long-term viability. </p>
