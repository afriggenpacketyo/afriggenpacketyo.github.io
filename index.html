          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of spot-fixing charges by an independent commission, nearly two years after the Football Association began its investigation. The four charges, which could have resulted in a lifetime ban, alleged he deliberately received yellow cards to influence betting markets. While acquitted of match-fixing, the commission found Paqueta guilty on two counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation by not providing required information. A sanction for these breaches will be determined at a later date, while Paqueta has expressed his relief and eagerness to return to playing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has sent letters to 17 major drugmakers, demanding they take steps to significantly reduce U.S. drug prices within 60 days. The directive calls for companies to offer medicines at the "most-favored-nation" price, which is the lowest price offered in other developed countries, to all Medicaid patients. Trump threatened to use every available tool to combat "abusive drug pricing" if the companies do not comply by the September 29 deadline. The announcement led to a drop in pharmaceutical stocks as the industry faces renewed pressure to reform its pricing models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a 90-day postponement of planned tariff increases on Mexican goods, maintaining the current rates to allow time for trade deal negotiations. The existing 25% tariffs on certain goods and cars, along with 50% on some metals, will remain in place. The decision followed a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, which Trump described as "very successful." The extension provides a window for both nations to formalize a broader trade agreement, averting an escalation that could have impacted the economies of both countries.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court on Thursday intensely questioned the Trump administration's legal basis for imposing widespread tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Judges probed whether the law, which has never before been used for this purpose and does not explicitly mention tariffs, grants the president such broad authority. The case challenges the centerpiece of Trump's economic agenda, with judges expressing concern over the "unbounded authority" the administration claims. The court's decision, which is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court, will have significant implications for U.S. trade policy.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Padres have significantly upgraded their pitching staff by acquiring All-Star closer Mason Miller and left-handed pitcher JP Sears from the Oakland Athletics. Miller, known for a fastball that averages 101 mph, has 20 saves this season and is under team control through 2029. In exchange, the Athletics received a package of four prospects, including highly-touted shortstop Leo De Vries. The trade is a major move for the Padres as they aim to solidify their position in the National League wildcard race before the trade deadline.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the withdrawal of approximately 1,350 National Guard members from Los Angeles, nearly two months after their deployment to address unrest related to immigration raids. The presence of the troops was highly contested by California's Democratic leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who sued the federal government over what he termed an illegal deployment. With protests subsiding, the troops had a diminished role, leading to the drawdown. About 250 California Guard members will remain to protect federal buildings and agents in the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis posits that Hamas is deliberately leveraging the severe hunger and suffering in Gaza to achieve its strategic goals. The article argues that by creating a famine, the group aims to generate international outcry against Israel, thereby increasing pressure to end the war on terms favorable to Hamas. According to the author, this explains the group's intransigence in cease-fire negotiations and its criticism of aid efforts. The piece concludes that the most effective way to undermine Hamas is for Israel and the international community to flood Gaza with aid and alleviate civilian suffering.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a head-to-head clinical trial, Eli Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro was shown to provide cardiovascular benefits comparable to its older treatment, Trulicity. The study found Mounjaro was not inferior to Trulicity in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events for patients with Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, Mounjaro showed a more comprehensive benefit, including a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and superior kidney protection. These results strengthen the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment, especially as Trulicity's patent is set to expire in 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for what observers are calling an unprecedented interference in Brazilian democracy. The U.S. has imposed steep tariffs and sanctioned a supreme court judge, actions seen as an effort to support former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for an alleged coup attempt. Critics, including political scientists and former diplomats, argue that Trump is weaponizing U.S. trade and foreign policy for personal political ends. The moves have infuriated many Brazilians and are seen as a reckless assault on the country's sovereign institutions.</p>

          <p>A former nurse and a mother have lost their High Court challenge against the registration of Gender Plus, England's first private clinic providing hormone treatment to teenagers with gender incongruence. The claimants had argued that the regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), acted irrationally by approving the clinic without fully considering updated NHS guidance that urges "extreme caution." However, the judge ruled that the CQC's assessment was rationally focused and had patient safety as a primary concern. The clinic, which maintains it follows all relevant guidance, can continue its operations.</p>

This move is conditional on Israel meeting certain terms, including a ceasefire and a commitment to a long-term peace process.
