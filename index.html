          <p>Shares for cereal manufacturer WK Kellogg experienced a significant surge following reports that the company is nearing a $3 billion acquisition deal with Italian confectioner Ferrero. The potential purchase would add brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes to Ferrero's portfolio, deepening its presence in the U.S. market. This move reflects a broader trend of consolidation within the packaged foods industry, which has faced challenges from consumers shifting towards healthier breakfast options and private-label brands amid inflation. The deal could be finalized as soon as this week.</p>

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former chairman of the UK's Conservative Party, has announced his defection to the rival Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage. In a statement, Berry criticized what he termed "Old Westminster politics" and expressed his belief that challenging the established order is necessary for meaningful change. His move follows a similar defection by David Jones, another former Conservative cabinet member, signaling growing political shifts and challenges for the Conservative party's leadership and future direction after recent electoral events.</p>

The proposal would allow individual lenders to issue more than 15% of their new mortgages at loan-to-income ratios higher than 4.5, potentially creating up to 36,000 new higher-leverage mortgages annually. This change comes as millions of existing homeowners face rising monthly payments, though the Bank noted that recent interest rate cuts are beginning to provide some relief for many households.

          <p>State inspectors approved the written emergency plan for Camp Mystic, a Texas summer camp, just two days before a devastating flood killed more than two dozen people there, most of whom were children. While records show the camp met state regulations for disaster procedures, the details of the plan remain unclear, raising questions about its adequacy. The camp, located in the flood-prone Hill Country, did not relocate its 650 campers and staff despite receiving weather warnings, and was overwhelmed when the Guadalupe River rose dramatically in the early morning hours.</p>
