        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has called off a planned deployment of federal agents to San Francisco following a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie. The decision was also influenced by calls from prominent tech executives who noted the city's "substantial progress" in addressing public safety issues. Mayor Lurie confirmed the cancellation, highlighting recent statistics showing a significant citywide drop in crime, with violent crime at its lowest since the 1950s. This reversal of plans was supported by California Governor Gavin Newsom and praised by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as a testament to the city's local leadership.</p>

          <p>During a White House roundtable, President Trump denied reports that two B-1 bombers were flown near Venezuela, calling the information false. He simultaneously emphasized his administration's aggressive stance against drug trafficking, suggesting that cartels would soon face increased danger when attempting to smuggle drugs by land. The discussion followed a confirmed U.S. military strike on a suspected narco-trafficking vessel that killed three people. When questioned, the president indicated he did not believe a formal declaration of war against cartels was necessary to authorize lethal force against traffickers.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old girl has been charged with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter following a car crash in April that resulted in the deaths of four other teenagers. According to prosecutors in Marin County, the driver was also cited for speeding and violating her provisional license terms. A California Highway Patrol report indicated the vehicle was traveling at 60-65 mph in a 40 mph zone when it went off the road and struck a tree, subsequently catching fire. The driver's inexperience was cited as a likely factor, and there was no evidence of drug or alcohol impairment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who had pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering. The White House stated the pardon was an exercise of constitutional authority, framing Zhao as a victim of the Biden administration's "war on cryptocurrency." Zhao had served four months in prison as part of a multi-billion-dollar settlement with the Justice Department. The pardon drew attention due to ties between Binance and a crypto venture founded by Trump's sons, though the president claimed not to know Zhao personally.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved increased oil and gas drilling across 1.56 million acres of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), a move strongly condemned by environmental groups. The Interior Department also announced a new lease sale in the National Petroleum Reserve and reissued permits for the controversial 211-mile Ambler Road Project. Proponents, including Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, argue these actions will bolster energy independence and create jobs. However, conservation organizations and numerous Indigenous tribes warn of devastating impacts on wildlife and on the sacred lands of the Gwich’in people.</p>

          <p>The International Chess Federation (FIDE) is investigating Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik for public statements made before and after the recent death of U.S. grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky. Kramnik had accused Naroditsky and other elite players of cheating, which Naroditsky described as causing him significant stress in his final public stream. The chess community has been shaken by the 29-year-old's death, remembering him as a skilled and humble player who was also a popular streamer. FIDE stated it is concerned about public debate turning into harassment and bullying, while Kramnik has doubled down on his claims online.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted Alabama to execute Anthony Boyd using nitrogen gas, marking the seventh time the state has employed this controversial method. Boyd's lawyers argued the procedure, which induces death by oxygen deprivation, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, citing witness accounts of previous prisoners convulsing on the gurney. In a scathing dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor described the method as akin to suffocation. Boyd, who has maintained his innocence in the 1995 murder for which he was convicted, was sentenced to death based on a non-unanimous jury verdict of 10-2.</p>

          <p>The current government shutdown, now in its 23rd day, appears poised to continue as both political parties seem to see a political advantage in its extension. Unlike past shutdowns that dominated news cycles, this one has received less attention, partly due to a glut of other major news and a sense of routine. The Trump administration has selectively mitigated the shutdown's impact on certain federal workers, while Democrats feel little incentive to reopen a government they argue would legitimize the president's actions. This political calculus has created a perverse situation where the growing pain for federal workers is not enough to force a resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously rejected an attempt by the Trump administration to pause nearly all court cases concerning veterans' disability benefits during the ongoing government shutdown. The 9-0 ruling from the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims rebuffed the Secretary of Veterans Affairs' argument that a lack of funding prevented the agency from meeting court deadlines. Veterans' advocacy groups had accused the administration of using the shutdown as a pretext to delay justice for veterans, some of whom have waited decades for their claims to be heard.

          <p>The UK government's inquiry into grooming gangs has been thrown into disarray after two leading candidates for its chair withdrew and four members of its survivors' panel resigned. The search for a new leader is now expected to take months as the government seeks to re-engage with victims and survivors. The turmoil escalated after the resigning panel members called for Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips to step down, accusing her of betrayal. However, other survivors have written in support of Phillips, highlighting deep divisions within the group advising the high-profile investigation into child sexual exploitation.</p>

          <p>Apple has lost a landmark lawsuit in the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal, which ruled that the company abused its dominant market position by charging excessive and unfair commission fees in its App Store. The case could benefit around 36 million iPhone and iPad users in the UK, with lawyers seeking approximately £1.5 billion in damages for purchases made over the last decade. The ruling asserts that Apple's 30% commission on developers and its exclusion of competing payment platforms constituted illegal practices. Apple has stated its intention to appeal the decision.

          <p>In the wake of federal indictments related to illegal NBA betting, basketball Hall of Famer Carmelo Anthony commented on the increasing pressure athletes face due to the rise of sports gambling. Speaking with CNBC, Anthony stated that the betting culture "mentally affects" players, even if they claim not to care, because it alters how their performance is perceived by the public. He expressed concern that gambling is "changing the narrative of the game," where a player's value can be judged solely on whether they met a betting line. The former Knicks star was not involved in the federal case.</p>

          <p>A significant U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean, the largest in decades, has prompted analysis into the Trump administration's ultimate goals regarding Venezuela. While the official justification is a war on drug trafficking, experts suggest the show of force is more likely an intimidation campaign aimed at achieving regime change by pressuring President Nicolás Maduro and his inner circle. The U.S. has conducted lethal strikes on vessels it alleges carry "narco-terrorists," but analysts note that the primary drug routes are not in Venezuela. The deployment includes warships, fighter jets, and the authorization of CIA operations.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations but lowered its financial guidance for 2025 due to a supplier fire. The fire at an aluminum supplier's plant is disrupting the production of Ford's profitable large trucks and is expected to cost the company between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. Despite this setback, the automaker plans to mitigate the impact by significantly increasing truck production once supplies are restored. Without the fire, Ford's CFO stated the company would have raised its guidance, signaling strong underlying performance. (not investment advice)</p>

The author contends that President Trump's framing of the move as "hostile" ignores the preceding U.S. actions, including blacklisting numerous Chinese institutions and expanding export restrictions on American technology. According to the article, Beijing's policy is a reasonable and predictable blowback, using a blueprint for economic leverage that the White House itself established, highlighting the escalating nature of the trade conflict.

The move, which affects about 8% of its headquarters workforce, is part of an effort to simplify operations and accelerate growth under incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke. The company has been underperforming compared to rivals like Walmart, with its sales being more vulnerable to shifts in discretionary consumer spending.
