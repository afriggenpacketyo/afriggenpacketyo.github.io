          <p>An 11-year-old boy was fatally shot in broad daylight at Folwell Park in Minneapolis, prompting a police investigation and a call for public assistance. Witnesses reported seeing multiple cars in the vicinity when the gunfire erupted, and a nearby resident attempted to rush the boy to the hospital before flagging down an officer. Despite lifesaving efforts by first responders, the boy was pronounced dead at the scene. Police Chief Brian Oâ€™Hara emphasized the severity of the crime and urged anyone with information to contact the authorities to help bring justice to the child's family, as the investigation continues to unfold. The local community is reeling from this tragic event. The optimism score for this article is very low given the nature of the situation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Due to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, many insurance underwriters are avoiding offering coverage to vessels with perceived U.S., Israeli, or U.K. links, regardless of the price. According to Lloyd's List, some underwriters are refusing to cover these vessels altogether, while rates for those offering coverage have risen significantly. The notification period required by underwriters has also been reduced from 48 hours to 24 hours due to the market's fluidity. Concerns about potential actions by Iran, including blocking ships, and the role of China, a major customer of Iranian oil, are influencing the insurance market. The rising rates should ease if a tentative ceasefire holds, though uncertainty remains due to volatile political developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent PwC consumer survey reveals that families are maintaining their back-to-school spending despite economic pressures, with nearly three-quarters expecting to spend the same or more than in 2024. Consumers are value-oriented, focusing on necessities like books and school supplies, while cutting back on technology and clothing. Retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy have indicated plans to raise some prices, influenced by concerns about tariffs. Artificial intelligence is also playing a role, with one in five shoppers planning to use AI tools to find online deals. Gen Z parents are more likely to shop exclusively in physical stores, contributing to the resilience of brick-and-mortar retail.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to proceed with planned welfare changes despite facing a growing rebellion from Labour MPs, who oppose cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits. Over 120 Labour MPs have signed an amendment to block the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, which would make it harder for disabled individuals with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payments. Starmer argues that the current welfare system is unsustainable and traps people on benefits, while critics cite concerns about increased poverty and inadequate impact assessments. The Conservatives have yet to confirm their voting stance, while Chancellor Rachel Reeves anticipates Â£5 billion in annual savings by 2030 from the reforms. (not investment advice)</p>

The exhibit, created by photographer Keith Vinson and his classmates, aims to ensure these stories are seen and heard. One portrait features Lakeydria Houston, a survivor of sexual assault in the Army, portrayed as strong and stable. The exhibit also features portraits by Tarik Warren, a campus maintenance worker who painted the gallery's walls and is now a featured artist.

          <p>United Nations Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has offered rare praise for President Donald Trump following the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This positive statement comes days after Guterres condemned U.S. strikes on Iranâ€™s nuclear facilities, expressing alarm over the growing risk of conflict. Trump announced the ceasefire after what he called the "12-Day War," referencing Israel's historic Six-Day War. The President later expressed frustration with both Israel and Iran as the ceasefire appeared to falter, but ultimately affirmed that Israel would not attack Iran, and both sides wanted to end the war.</p>

          <p>A recent suicide bombing at a Christian church in Damascus, which killed 25 and injured 63, has raised concerns about Syria's postwar cohesion. The Syrian government condemned the attack as an attempt to undermine national coexistence, while religious leaders denounced the violence. Observers warn that the attack targets not only Christians but also the social fabric of the entire country and the transition process. President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised an inclusive government, but challenges remain in ensuring the safety and representation of religious minorities, as foreign fighters and underfunded security forces contribute to ongoing instability.</p>

Cuomo accuses Trump of declaring war on Democratic states and working families, while Mamdani emphasizes the need to combat authoritarianism and address the city's affordability crisis. Voters are considering both national and local issues, particularly affordability, as they make their choices. High temperatures could impact voter turnout, with the city's election board taking precautions to ensure polling sites remain functional. The election could mark a political comeback for Cuomo, while Mamdani's progressive platform has garnered support from some voters.</p>

          <p>A columnist reflects on the reaction to President Trump's decision to attack Iran's nuclear facilities, cautioning against drawing direct parallels to the Iraq War. While acknowledging the validity of criticism and concern, the author argues that the "Iraq syndrome cosplay" is misleading, as there is no proposed "boots on the ground" scenario. The author emphasizes that Iran has been committing acts of war against America and Israel for decades through terrorist proxies and that the intelligence regarding Iran's nuclear program has changed. The author concludes that while the situation could worsen, it is unlikely to resemble the events in Iraq, except for those unwilling to see it differently.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold 100,000 shares of the chipmaker's stock on Friday and Monday, amounting to nearly $15 million at Tuesday's opening price.

Despite the sale, Huang still owns over 800 million Nvidia shares and holds a net worth of approximately $126 billion. Nvidia's stock has surged over 800% since December 2022, driven by high demand for its GPUs in the artificial intelligence market. (not investment advice)</p>
