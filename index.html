          <p>Asia-Pacific markets, including Hong Kong, Japan, and mainland China, experienced gains on Monday as investors processed the latest economic data out of China. China's GDP rose 4.8% in the third quarter, aligning with analyst expectations, and its benchmark lending rates remained unchanged, consistent with forecasts. Despite this moderate growth and earlier credit concerns in the U.S., American markets also closed higher last Friday, influenced by a softening U.S. stance on trade talks with China. This article highlights a broader regional market resilience and positive investor sentiment amidst specific economic indicators, suggesting a cautious but stable financial outlook.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy expanded by 4.8% in the third quarter from a year ago, matching analyst predictions, yet fixed-asset investment unexpectedly contracted by 0.5% in the first nine months. This marked a "rare and alarming" drop, not seen since 2020, as investment into infrastructure and manufacturing slowed significantly. Property investment extended its decline, sliding 13.9% through September, while retail sales and industrial production showed some resilience. However, persistent deflationary pressures and unchanged benchmark lending rates suggest underlying economic challenges, with experts warning of downward pressure on fourth-quarter GDP growth.

          <p>Thousands participated in "No Kings" rallies across the U.S. and globally on Saturday, protesting President Trump's policies, including his administration's crackdown on undocumented migrants and the deployment of National Guard troops. Demonstrators expressed outrage over perceived authoritarian actions and attacks on the media, despite Republican criticisms labeling the events as "Hate America" rallies. Organizers reported larger turnouts than previous events, emphasizing a fierce love for the country and a commitment to fighting for its democratic principles. The article details the widespread scope and diverse motivations behind these significant nationwide demonstrations, which largely remained peaceful.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump publicly accused Colombian President Petro of being an "illegal drug leader," threatening to cut U.S. funding and impose major tariffs, following a U.S. strike on an alleged drug boat. Separately, disgraced former Congressman George Santos described his commuted prison sentence as disproportionate but a "large slice of humble pie," while a Guardian investigation uncovered a Republican-tied network working to counter Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health initiatives on behalf of major soft-drink and snack-food corporations. The article also briefly notes Portland residents mocking Trump's "war-ravaged" city comments, offering a snapshot of diverse political news.</p>

Despite Musk's long-standing criticism of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," Qiu highlights significant cost reductions and performance improvements in the technology.
