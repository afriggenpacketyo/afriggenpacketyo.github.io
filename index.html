          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina recounts his early decision to back AI voice startup ElevenLabs in 2022, committing funds after just a 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski. Reina, a venture partner, recognized Staniszewski's deep technical expertise and forward-thinking vision for voice AI, a sector largely overlooked by other investors before ChatGPT's emergence. ElevenLabs, specializing in advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning technology, has since achieved a $3.3 billion valuation and is planning global expansion and an IPO within five years. This article showcases Reina's investment philosophy of identifying promising founders and nascent industries before they gain widespread attention, leading to significant returns.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has commenced a five-day tour across Asia, with planned stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, where he is set to engage in high-stakes trade discussions with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Trump also expressed his openness to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, noting their past interactions and Kim's condition for such a meeting. The tour's primary focus includes sealing a deal to end the US-China trade war, with global markets keenly observing for any signs of tariff relief or new agreements. Additionally, discussions are expected to cover sensitive topics such as Taiwan, Russia, and the release of Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy newspaper founder imprisoned in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers faced an 11-4 defeat in World Series Game 1 against the Toronto Blue Jays, prompting internal discussions about whether a week-long break following their NLCS sweep contributed to a lack of sharpness. Key pitchers, including Blake Snell and Emmet Sheehan, delivered subpar performances, with Snell acknowledging his longest break between starts since returning from injury. While manager Dave Roberts downplayed the layoff's impact, historical precedent suggests teams with extended breaks often struggle in the World Series opener. This article delves into the potential effects of being "too fresh" on player velocity and movement, especially for pitchers.</p>

          <p>A nationwide manhunt is actively underway in the UK for Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian national convicted of sexual assault against a schoolgirl and a woman, who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu, who was slated for transfer to an immigration detention center ahead of deportation, is now "at large" in London, prompting a multi-agency police search. Justice Secretary David Lammy expressed profound anger, and prominent political figures, including Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch, have denounced the "unacceptable" error. An internal investigation into the Prison Service's operational blunder is in progress, with an officer having been removed from their duties.</p>

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei faces significant political headwinds and declining popularity ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections, despite his "shock therapy" policies successfully curbing hyperinflation to 2.1%. Critics, including former party members like Marcela Pagano, argue his radical austerity measures have severely impacted the middle class, increased poverty, and led to numerous business closures. While macroeconomic successes include the first budget surplus since 2010, the social cost is high, with plummeting purchasing power and rising unemployment. Milei's government is also grappling with corruption scandals, and securing a win is crucial to maintain political capital and counter the resurgent Peronists.</p>

The proposed 90,000-square-foot ballroom, designed to accommodate 999 people, will dwarf the main White House and is being privately funded by various major tech companies, defense contractors, and the president himself. The project proceeded rapidly without complete signoff from the National Capital Planning Commission, sparking "manufactured outrage" according to the administration.</p>

          <p>Russia is grappling with a severe demographic crisis characterized by a shrinking and aging population, a challenge President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly vowed to address. Birth rates have significantly declined, exacerbated by ongoing financial uncertainty, the war in Ukraine, and a substantial exodus of young men. In an effort to reverse this trend, the Russian government is implementing increasingly restrictive laws promoting "traditional family values," including bans on abortion promotion, "child-free ideology," and outlawing LGBTQ+ activism. Critics argue these controversial measures are unlikely to effectively boost birth rates and instead infringe upon individual freedoms, while the option of increasing immigration is hindered by growing anti-migrant sentiment.</p>

          <p>A recent Pew Research Center report indicates that the US Latino population has nearly doubled since 2000, now standing at 68 million and representing one in five Americans. This demographic surge accounts for over half of the country's total population growth during this period. The article highlights that while births have been the main driver of this increase, recent years have also seen a significant rise in both legal and illegal immigration. Key findings from the report reveal Latinos as the youngest major ethnic group with a median age of 31, a substantial majority being US citizens, and notable increases in English proficiency and college attendance across the population.</p>

The driver was wounded and subsequently taken into custody for a mental health evaluation. This incident unfolded amidst ongoing demonstrations against the crackdown, which President Trump later announced had been called off for the Bay Area. The article details the chaotic shooting, the swift response from the FBI, and the broader context of community opposition, including earlier deployments of flash bangs and smoke grenades to disperse protesters at the base.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico have jointly appealed to a US appeals court to halt a Trump administration order that forces them to unwind their nearly nine-year-old joint venture. The US Department of Transportation (USDOT) mandated the end of the partnership, which enables the carriers to coordinate scheduling, pricing, and capacity for US-Mexico flights, citing ongoing anticompetitive effects. Both airlines contend that the USDOT's action is "arbitrary and capricious," would inflict substantial unrecoverable costs, cause severe disruptions to flight operations, and could lead to the loss of up to $800 million in annual consumer benefits. They argue the decision is unrealistic and based on unsubstantiated reasoning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US military is deploying the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and its strike group to waters off South America, signifying a major escalation of military firepower in the region. This deployment aims to bolster US capacity against illicit actors and drug trafficking, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who also announced the 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat, resulting in six deaths. The move, involving thousands more troops, fuels speculation about the Trump administration's broader intentions, with critics suggesting it targets Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

          <p>The first West Nile virus death of the year in Los Angeles County has been confirmed, involving an individual hospitalized in the San Fernando Valley for neurological illness caused by the mosquito-borne virus. This article reports 14 infections in the county this year, with half occurring in the Valley, a region experiencing persistent drought conditions. Studies indicate that droughts, paradoxically, can increase West Nile virus risk by concentrating infected mosquitos and birds around scarce water sources, leading to faster transmission to humans. Officials warn of severe illness symptoms, including paralysis and death, emphasizing the heightened risk during dry La Niña seasons and the need for public awareness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing to auction new offshore oil drilling leases along US coastlines that have been off-limits for decades, including waters off New England, the Carolinas, and California. This initiative reverses a Biden administration decision to limit drilling and comes after the reopening of 1.56 million acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing. The plan, part of a five-year leasing program, faces strong bipartisan opposition from state governors and lawmakers who are concerned about the significant environmental and economic risks posed by offshore drilling.

          <p>A federal judge in Portland, Oregon, has rejected the Trump administration’s request to immediately lift her order blocking the deployment of federalized National Guard troops to the city. This ruling is a key development in a series of lawsuits challenging President Trump's authority to deploy military personnel into Democratic-run cities, a move fiercely resisted by local and state leaders. The judge cited concerns that the administration had attempted to evade her initial restraining order and noted that an appeals court is currently considering a rehearing of the case. Similar legal battles over National Guard deployments are also ongoing in Washington D.C. and the Chicago area, underscoring a broader constitutional debate regarding presidential powers.</p>
