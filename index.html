          <p>Israeli airstrikes have targeted Syrian government sites in Damascus and southern Syria for a third consecutive day, amidst escalating sectarian violence in Suweida province that has killed over 350 people. Israel stated its goal is to protect the Druze minority and force Syrian military withdrawal, while Syria's government condemned the attacks as a violation of international law. The United States announced that "specific steps" have been agreed upon to end the violence, as the humanitarian situation in Suweida deteriorates with shortages of water and medical supplies. The conflict involves clashes between Druze militias and government-backed Bedouin tribes, heightening regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated his ambition to supply China with more advanced chips than the currently permitted H20 model, following the recent lifting of a ban on the latter. Huang emphasized that as technology advances, the chips available to the Chinese market should also improve, despite ongoing U.S. export controls that have impacted Nvidia's sales. He highlighted the significant potential of the Chinese AI market while navigating the delicate balance of U.S.-China tech tensions. The U.S. government has suggested it may continue to allow some chip sales to ensure Chinese companies remain reliant on American technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 00:10:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has announced that the underfunded Overdose Data To Action (OD2A) grant program will receive its allocated federal money, but in incremental payments rather than a single annual sum. This decision comes after NPR reported concerns from CDC staffers that a delay or loss of the roughly $140 million could trigger layoffs and program shutdowns nationwide. While the administration insists the program is not threatened, public health officials express uncertainty about operating complex services without a clear funding timeline. The shift in disbursement strategy has not been explained, creating distrust among some state health departments.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers are expressing skepticism that a new push to modernize equipment will solve deeper systemic problems, such as chronic staffing shortages, grueling schedules, and stagnant pay. While the Trump administration has secured $12.5 billion to upgrade technology, many controllers argue these measures fail to address critical quality-of-life issues that lead to low morale and fatigue. The nationwide shortage has forced many controllers to work mandatory six-day weeks, a situation exacerbated since the mass firings in 1981. Current and former controllers told NPR that without addressing pay and working conditions, the system remains under immense stress.</p>

          <p>During the murder trial of Dr. James Craig, his former office manager testified that the dentist seemed unconcerned after his wife, Angela, fell ill from a protein shake he had made her. The witness, Caitlin Romero, told the court that Craig suggested he had merely "added too much protein" to the shake. Prosecutors allege Craig fatally poisoned his wife with cyanide and tetrahydrozoline. Romero also testified about a personal package containing potassium cyanide that was delivered to the office for Craig, and that he had predicted his wife's death on two separate occasions before she passed away, which prosecutors argue shows premeditation.</p>

          <p>Recent mass layoffs at the U.S. State Department have caused significant confusion and disruption, with current and former officials warning of heightened risks to national security. The Trump administration cut over 1,300 domestic staffers in an effort to streamline the agency, but sources told CBS News the process was chaotic and arbitrary. Some key offices, such as the one assisting families of employees who die overseas, were entirely eliminated, while others working on critical issues like passport fraud and Israeli-Palestinian affairs were unexpectedly gutted. The poorly executed cuts have reportedly damaged morale and weakened the nation's diplomatic capabilities.</p>

The bills include measures concerning the Federal Reserve's ability to issue a digital currency and establishing clearer regulatory frameworks.

Auto exports to the U.S., a critical sector of Japan's economy, plunged 26.7% in June, with carmakers reportedly absorbing the tariff costs to maintain market share.

The data, obtained by CBS News, indicates that while 70,583 deportees were convicted criminals, the severity of those crimes often did not match the administration's public emphasis on violent offenders.

The fire ignited near Aguanga on Wednesday afternoon and spread quickly, though crews reported making good progress on its perimeter by nightfall. Residents in parts of Lake Riverside, Anza, and the Cahuilla Reservation were ordered to leave their homes, with care centers established for people and animals. Over 200 firefighting personnel, supported by engines, dozers, and helicopters, were assigned to combat the blaze, which was 0% contained as of Wednesday evening.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly questioned President Trump's assertion that the federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein is a "hoax." On his social media platform X, Musk sarcastically noted that it was "amazing" Epstein died in prison for a supposed hoax, and he challenged the president to release the related files to prove his claim. Trump had recently lashed out at his own supporters for believing there was more to the Epstein case, calling them "stupid" and "foolish." The exchange highlights a public rift between the two influential figures over the transparency and conclusions of the government's investigation into the late sex offender.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially canceled $4 billion in federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, a move state leaders have decried as illegal. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy cited mismanagement and incompetence, calling the project a "boondoggle" that has failed to deliver on time or on budget. Governor Gavin Newsom vowed to fight the decision, stating that the project has created thousands of jobs and is nearing the track-laying phase. The project, which aims to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, with its price tag soaring from $33 billion to $128 billion.</p>

A new study identified five specific volatile components in the plant's pollen that trigger allergies, which have worsened for many residents since 2018.

The lawsuit claims that the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department are violating due process rights by turning immigration courts into traps. The twelve plaintiffs were all seeking legal protection, such as asylum from anti-LGBTQ+ violence, when they were arrested. This legal challenge asserts that the practice discourages compliance with legal obligations and weaponizes a supposedly neutral forum against vulnerable immigrants.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized President Trump for what he calls a wasteful and cruel deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles. His comments followed a Pentagon order to withdraw half of the troops, a move Newsom claims came after the administration realized the absurdity of the deployment, which he said cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Newsom accused the president of using the troops to appear tough on immigration and terrorize communities rather than pursue violent criminals.

          <p>Recent federal immigration raids on workplaces are highlighting significant flaws in the E-Verify system, which over a million employers use to confirm hiring eligibility. Gary Rohwer, a business owner in Omaha whose facility was raided, said he followed all the rules but was still penalized because the system vets documents, not people, making it easy to fool with stolen identities. Experts argue that E-Verify is a broken, "wink-and-nod" system that fails to prevent the hiring of undocumented workers and exposes businesses and identity theft victims. Homeland Security Investigations acknowledged that Rohwer's business was a victim in a criminal identity theft investigation.</p>
