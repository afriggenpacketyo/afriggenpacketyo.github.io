          <p>A new report indicates that coral bleaching is affecting 84% of the world's coral reefs, marking the most severe bleaching event on record. Scientists attribute this crisis to rising ocean temperatures caused by human-induced climate change, particularly the burning of fossil fuels. Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel algae due to stress from warming waters, increasing their risk of disease and starvation. Experts emphasize that addressing the root cause of climate change is crucial to protect coral reefs and the marine ecosystems they support. </p>
