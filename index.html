          <p>A major spending bill proposed by Republicans is causing a downturn for clean energy stocks due to several new provisions. The legislation includes a new tax on wind and solar projects that use Chinese components and also accelerates the phase-out of critical investment and production tax credits. This change compresses project timelines and adds significant execution risk for developers. While large-scale renewable companies have seen their shares fall, the rooftop solar industry is viewed as a relative winner under the current draft of the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

In a letter to the university, officials threatened the loss of all federal funding if immediate changes are not made to address a campus environment where antisemitic incidents have allegedly festered.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review a case that could further dismantle campaign finance regulations by challenging limits on spending coordinated between political parties and candidates. The challenge, brought by Republican committees and Vice-President JD Vance, argues these restrictions infringe on First Amendment free speech rights, similar to the logic in the landmark 2010 Citizens United decision. The case could significantly alter the landscape of political fundraising by allowing for much tighter collaboration and financial support between parties and their candidates.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: The Rise of an Anti-Empathy Worldview in Conservative Politics</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece explores the growing conservative argument that empathy is a "fundamental weakness" that liberals exploit for political gain. The author critiques this view, particularly as framed for Christian audiences in books like "Toxic Empathy," suggesting it serves as a coping mechanism to dismiss the human suffering caused by certain right-wing policies. The article argues that this framework mislabels conscience as a political trick and risks making believers insensitive to the moral demands of their faith regarding the poor and oppressed.</p>

          <p>The Senate has initiated a marathon voting session, known as a "vote-a-rama," on the Republican-led "One Big, Beautiful Bill," a massive legislative package central to President Trump's second-term agenda. The bill, which passed the House narrowly, combines tax cut extensions with increased spending on defense and border security, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. With a slim majority, GOP leadership is navigating internal divisions and procedural hurdles from Democrats to pass the bill before a self-imposed July 4 deadline.</p>
