          <p>A CNBC analysis, featuring insights from prominent economists and officials like Ray Dalio, explores the severe risks associated with the growing U.S. budget deficit. The article highlights three main areas of potential fallout: market instability, economic strain including inflation and reduced investment, and negative international relations implications for national security. Experts from the Penn Wharton Budget Model suggest the U.S. has less than two decades to alter its fiscal course before facing the possibility of default, emphasizing that inaction could lead to dire consequences.

          <p>A recent ARD Deutschlandtrend poll reveals a continued decline in support for Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD), which would receive only 13% of the vote if an election were held now. The conservative CDU/CSU bloc, led by Friedrich Merz, has gained ground, polling at 30%, while the far-right AfD remains strong at 23%. The survey also highlights key public concerns, including migration, the economy, and social injustice, with a majority of Germans expressing fear over recent discussions about "readiness for war." Additionally, there is majority support for reintroducing compulsory military service for both men and women.</p>

          <p>Chloe Childress, an 18-year-old camp counselor and recent high school graduate, was among those killed in the devastating flash floods in Hunt, Texas. Remembered by her school as a compassionate and empathetic leader, she was set to attend the University of Texas at Austin. Childress was a co-president of her school's honor council and founded a club to help senior citizens, embodying a commitment to community. Her death is part of a larger tragedy where catastrophic flooding claimed at least 80 lives, including numerous children and counselors at summer camps along the Guadalupe River.</p>

          <p>Some international LGBTQ+ travelers are reconsidering or canceling trips to the United States due to the current political climate, including anti-LGBTQ+ policies and rhetoric. Travel platforms have noted a decline in U.S. bookings from Canadian and European users, while some advocacy groups have decided not to attend U.S.-based events. This trend reflects a sentiment that the U.S. is becoming less welcoming, with travelers choosing to spend their money in countries they perceive as more inclusive. The shift could impact the U.S. economy, as the LGBTQ+ travel market represents significant global purchasing power.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are meeting at the White House, presenting a united front after recent joint strikes on Iran. However, the visit is overshadowed by the ongoing war in Gaza and a significant U.S. push for a ceasefire agreement. While both leaders celebrated their cooperation against Iran, the key focus remains on whether a deal can be reached to end the Gaza conflict. The proposed 60-day pause in fighting hinges on Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the war, a condition Netanyahu has so far rejected, creating a difficult diplomatic hurdle.</p>

          <p>The British government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after the 24-week mark. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will provide people with necessary time to grieve without having to use sick leave. The move, praised by campaigners like Myleene Klass, is seen as a significant step in legally recognizing early-stage pregnancy loss as a bereavement rather than an illness.</p>

          <p>Analysts are urging Chinese authorities to take more decisive action to combat ongoing deflation and weak domestic demand. China's GDP deflator, a broad measure of prices, has been negative for over a year, and consumer prices have fallen for four consecutive months. Experts from CICC argue that government attempts to address the issue by cutting supply have been ineffective because the core problem is insufficient demand. This weakness is attributed to downturns in the property and financial sectors, as well as declining income expectations among Chinese households, creating a persistent deflationary spiral.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump is systematically purifying the Republican party by purging anyone who shows dissent. The article cites the recent retirement announcement of Sen. Thom Tillis, who opposed a Trump-backed bill, as the latest example of this trend. The author contends that Trump's threats of primary challenges force out moderates and principled conservatives, regardless of whether their seats are then lost to Democrats. This process, which has been ongoing for years, is transforming the GOP into a smaller, more compliant organism where personal loyalty to Trump is valued above all else.</p>

The performer, Hayley Sinclair, turns her show into a public takedown of Alex, creating a national sensation. The story, told from the perspective of Alex's junior colleague, is a snackable and entertaining commentary on the power, ego, and potential corruption within the critic profession.</p>

However, other analysts argue the drop is a natural market correction after years of a strong dollar and that there is no viable alternative to its global dominance. The key question remains whether this is a temporary slump or the beginning of a larger shift away from the dollar's supremacy. (not investment advice)</p>
