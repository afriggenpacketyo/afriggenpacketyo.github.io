        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As G7 leaders convene in Canada, ongoing trade instability, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are expected to dominate discussions. Uncertainty surrounding these issues largely stems from the White House's economic and foreign policy decisions, prompting allies to question President Trump's alignment with them. The summit aims to facilitate consensus on global economic and geopolitical challenges, however, Trump's trade tariffs and the looming threat of a global trade war pose internal challenges for the group. Bilateral meetings are anticipated, but the likelihood of significant trade deals remains uncertain as the July 9 deadline for potential tariff increases approaches. The overall global economic and geopolitical landscape appears uncertain as these leaders meet to discuss the future. </p>

          <p>President Trump is attending the G7 summit in Canada while his aides negotiate with allied nations over imposed tariffs, amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. Trump's schedule includes a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, followed by meetings with other G7 leaders and a cultural event. Trump's attitude towards allies and his tariff policies have strained relationships, further complicated by his previous remarks about acquiring Canada and Greenland. During a meeting with Carney, the Canadian Prime Minister humorously clarified that Canada is not for sale, emphasizing the importance of partnership and collaboration. The summit takes place during a tense geopolitical period, with both trade and security concerns on the agenda.</p>

          <p>In the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, a juror was dismissed due to inconsistencies regarding his place of residence and was replaced with an alternate juror. The judge expressed concerns about the juror's candor and potential bias in wanting to be on the jury. The dismissed juror was a 41-year-old Black man, while the replacement is a 57-year-old White man from Westchester. The trial resumed with a paralegal presenting charts and texts related to Combs' staff communications, with Combs pleading not guilty and facing a potential life sentence if convicted.

          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to review a case involving First Choice Womenâ€™s Resource Centers, a Christian nonprofit, against the New Jersey attorney general, concerning free speech rights. The case stems from a subpoena issued by the attorney general seeking records related to allegations that the center might be misleading women about abortion services. The center argues that the subpoena infringes upon its First Amendment rights by potentially chilling its free speech. The Supreme Court will consider whether New Jersey's investigatory demand must first be adjudicated in state court. This case raises important questions about the intersection of free speech and reproductive health services.</p>

          <p>Experts predict potential shifts in mortgage rates this summer, influenced by inflation, employment, and consumer spending reports, but do not anticipate dramatic swings. One scenario suggests rates will remain stable around 6.875% to 7.125% unless there's a clear break in labor or inflation unexpectedly cools. Alternatively, rates could rise if inflation jumps above 3% or the economy grows too fast, potentially spooking bond markets. Conversely, rates might decline if the economy shows signs of cooling, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut rates sooner than expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's military parade in Washington D.C., intended to celebrate the U.S. army's 250th anniversary and his 79th birthday, was met with a disappointing turnout and a seemingly unenthusiastic crowd. The event, funded by taxpayers and corporate sponsors, occurred amidst large-scale protests across the country expressing opposition to Trump's vision of America. While the parade aimed to showcase Trump's power and deter dissent, it was overshadowed by the vibrant and hopeful displays of the protesters. The parade served as a reminder of Trump's dictatorial ambitions and the forces enabling them, yet the spectacle appeared to be a self-conscious imitation of authoritarianism.</p>

While some see this as another consequence of restrictive abortion laws, others argue it's about who decides for incapacitated individuals.

          <p>At least 34 Palestinians were reportedly killed in shootings near food distribution centers run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in the southern Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. Witnesses claim Israeli troops opened fire on crowds attempting to reach the GHF centers, which are supported by the U.S. and Israel. The GHF system was established to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid, but U.N. agencies and major aid groups have rejected it, citing its inability to meet the territory's needs and concerns about aid being used as a weapon. The incident underscores the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and the challenges of aid distribution amidst ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a rally after President Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., or close plants. The transaction, described by Trump as a "partnership," will result in U.S. Steel becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. All regulatory approvals have been received, and the deal is expected to be completed promptly. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit, filed by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, claims the government continues to implement diversity, equity, and inclusion programs instituted under former President Biden. Faust argues that he is subject to discriminatory race-based policies at the USDA, citing higher administrative fees and less favorable loan guarantee percentages.

          <p>Approximately 200 kilograms of premium Sato Nishiki cherries, valued at around 1 million yen ($7,000), have been stolen from an orchard in Kaminoyama, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan. The owner of the orchard discovered the theft and reported it to the police, noting that only the Sato Nishiki variety trees had been stripped of their fruit. Yamagata Prefecture is the top producer of cherries in Japan, where the fruit is often used for presents and served in high-end restaurants. The theft follows a record-poor harvest last year due to extreme heat.</p>

          <p>Recent trade talks between the US and China in London have generated cautious optimism about de-escalating tensions between the two countries. Negotiators agreed on a framework to implement the consensus reached in Geneva, addressing issues like rare earths, student visas, and jet engine parts. Observers are hopeful that this momentum can lead to broader dialogue on challenging issues such as military communications, security, climate, and fentanyl cooperation. The talks have paved the way for the potential resumption of important communication mechanisms and the discussion of key bilateral and multilateral issues.</p>
