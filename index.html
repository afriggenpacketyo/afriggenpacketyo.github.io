          <p>The Department of Justice has charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside an immigration detention center in Newark. This action follows an oversight visit by McIver and other Democratic members of Congress. Concurrently, the department dropped a misdemeanor trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka, stemming from the same incident. McIver claims the charges are politically motivated and mischaracterize her actions, while the U.S. Attorney maintains that no one is above the law. The New York Times article details the conflicting narratives and video evidence surrounding the event, which involved a physical circle formed around Baraka, leading to a confusing scuffle.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserts that Russia and Ukraine will immediately begin negotiations towards a ceasefire and an end to the war, following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Trump expressed optimism, there was no confirmation from Putin regarding when peace negotiations would occur or addressing demands for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reaffirmed Ukraine's desire for a full and unconditional ceasefire, warning of stronger sanctions if Moscow is not ready.
