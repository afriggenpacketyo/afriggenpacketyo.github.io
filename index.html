          <p>A former off-duty pilot, Joseph Emerson, has reached a plea agreement after being accused of trying to shut down the engines of an Alaska Airlines flight in October 2023. Emerson, who claimed he was suffering a mental health crisis and believed he was dreaming, will plead guilty to a federal charge and no-contest to state charges. The agreement includes probation, community service, and restitution, potentially avoiding additional prison time. The incident has heightened scrutiny of mental health and safety protocols for airline cockpit personnel.</p>

          <p>The Department of Transportation has officially withdrawn a proposed regulation that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays and cancellations. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, faced strong opposition from airline industry groups who argued it would increase ticket prices. The department stated it will now reconsider such extra-statutory requirements while continuing to enforce existing consumer protection mandates from Congress, including refunds for canceled flights.</p>

          <p>Two recent studies indicate that using cannabis to self-medicate for stress, depression, or trauma could have adverse effects, potentially increasing paranoia and other mental health issues. One study found that individuals who began using marijuana to cope with emotional distress were more likely to experience paranoia later, compared to those who used it recreationally. The research also highlights the increasing potency of modern cannabis, with experts suggesting a standardized THC unit system to help users understand consumption levels and associated health risks.</p>

          <p>U.S. military veterans are expressing outrage over the arrest of former Army sergeant Bajun Mavalwalla II on federal conspiracy charges related to a protest against immigration policies. Mavalwalla, who has been active in helping Afghan allies resettle in the U.S., was arrested weeks after a demonstration in Spokane, Washington. Advocacy groups, including #AfghanEvac and Human Rights First, argue that his arrest criminalizes peaceful dissent and represents a dangerous move toward authoritarianism, vowing not to be intimidated.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Newsmax's antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, which alleged that Fox engaged in monopolistic practices to suppress conservative media competitors. The dismissal, issued by Judge Aileen Cannon, was based on a procedural issue, labeling the filing an impermissible "shotgun complaint" for how it structured its allegations. Newsmax has been granted permission to refile an amended complaint by the following week, with the company stating it views the dismissal as a technical matter.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris topped the timesheets during Friday practice at the Monza circuit ahead of the Italian Grand Prix, narrowly outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Norris expressed that the field was "a bit close for my liking," indicating a tight competition for the weekend's race. The high-speed Monza track presents a different challenge from recent venues, and several drivers, including Norris and his teammate Oscar Piastri, were seen testing the limits of their cars. Lewis Hamilton, who will drive for Ferrari next season, described his first experience in a red car at Monza as "amazing."</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its biggest one-day drop in more than a year, falling to 6.29% following the release of a weaker-than-expected August jobs report.

The decline provides a monthly savings of nearly $170 on a typical home loan, though it remains uncertain if this drop is significant enough to reinvigorate housing market demand, which has been sluggish.

While Trump has dismissed the issue as a "hoax," continued revelations or the release of new, damaging information could create a lasting political crisis, though it is also possible the controversy will eventually fade without significant impact.</p>
