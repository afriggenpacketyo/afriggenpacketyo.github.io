          <p>President Donald Trump has begun his second state visit to the United Kingdom, marking a historic occasion as the first elected U.S. leader to be hosted twice by a British monarch. The visit includes a royal reception at Windsor Castle with King Charles III and a dinner with the royal family. Discussions are anticipated to cover the deep ties between the U.S. and the U.K., coinciding with the upcoming 250th anniversary of the United States' founding. This diplomatic engagement aims to strengthen the special relationship between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The sun's 11-year solar cycle is expected to peak in 2025, potentially leading to more intense solar storms. While some warnings about global power and communication disruptions can be exaggerated, experts caution against dismissing the risks entirely. A 2021 study suggests internet infrastructure is vulnerable to severe storms, which could paralyze global communications for extended periods. Suggestions for making the internet more robust include shifting infrastructure south and implementing shorter, more resilient connections, as past events like the 1859 Carrington Event demonstrate significant potential for disruption.</p>

          <p>China has launched a comprehensive 19-point plan to boost service consumption and expand domestic demand for economic growth. The measures include relaxing market access and increasing supply in culture, sports, and healthcare industries. Authorities also pledged to strengthen fiscal support, attract foreign investment, and adjust school holiday schedules to encourage travel. Furthermore, financial institutions are encouraged to provide more loans and interest subsidies for consumer spending in key areas, reflecting Beijing's commitment to leveraging internal demand for economic stability and growth.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times, accusing the newspaper of defamation and libel. This action follows a history of a complex relationship between Trump and the publication, which he claims has engaged in decades of biased reporting. The lawsuit is unusual as it does not allege specific inaccuracies but rather criticizes the newspaper's overall campaign coverage and perceived political alignment. Trump views the Times' endorsement of Kamala Harris and its generally negative portrayal of him as "election interference," though legal experts suggest such claims face significant First Amendment hurdles.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Grapples with Pace and Scale of Upcoming Interest Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 02:59:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to reduce its key interest rate by a quarter-point, initiating discussions among economists and investors about the future trajectory of borrowing costs. The central bank typically employs either a measured pace for modest adjustments or rapid cuts during economic deterioration. Most analysts anticipate a "recalibration" approach, with potentially five rate reductions by mid-next year to maintain economic growth. However, persistently elevated inflation, partly due to tariffs, could temper the speed of these cuts, despite a recent slowdown in hiring strengthening the case for monetary easing.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports saw a smaller-than-anticipated contraction in August, falling 0.1% year-on-year, a significant improvement from July's 2.6% decline. This milder contraction was largely due to a rebound in shipments to Asia, its largest trading region, and a sharp jump in exports to Western Europe. However, exports to the U.S. continued to fall steeply, particularly in autos, despite a recent trade deal. While overall export volumes are holding up against U.S. tariffs, economists project a potential shrinkage in 2026 due to anticipated slower external demand.

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella projects that the company's new $30 billion investment in the UK's AI sector could boost the British economy by 10% within the next five years. This investment is part of a larger £31 billion "Tech Prosperity Deal" signed during President Trump's state visit, involving other tech giants like Google and Nvidia. Microsoft will also contribute to building a powerful supercomputer in Essex. Nadella likened AI's potential economic impact to that of personal computers, acknowledging energy consumption concerns but emphasizing AI's benefits in healthcare, public services, and business productivity.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has denied the Menendez brothers' petition for a new trial, ruling that the presented new evidence would not have altered the initial murder conviction. Erik and Lyle Menendez had filed a writ of habeas corpus, claiming new evidence proved their father, Jose Menendez, was sexually abusive. The judge found the new evidence, including a 1988 letter and a declaration from a former bandmate alleging sexual assault, not compelling enough to create reasonable doubt. The brothers, sentenced to life in prison in 1996, were recently made eligible for parole but were denied in August.</p>

          <p>NPR is preparing to trim over $5 million from its annual budget this fiscal year, as public radio stations grapple with the cessation of federal funding. Congress voted in July to defund public media, prompting NPR to anticipate significant financial challenges despite a recent spike in listener contributions. While NPR plans to balance its $300 million budget without major layoffs or programming shifts, many local member stations are struggling. Some stations have already announced layoffs or dropped their affiliation with NPR, highlighting the profound impact of the funding cuts on the public radio system nationwide.</p>

          <p>Disabled entrepreneurs and employees in the UK are facing significant challenges as the government implements severe cuts to the Access to Work grant scheme. Josh Wintersgill, a successful business owner, saw his one-on-one support slashed by 80%, jeopardizing his company. The Business Disability Forum warns that these cuts are "setting up to fail" disabled individuals and businesses, contradicting government ambitions to increase disabled employment. Despite a surge in demand and spending on the program, long processing delays and reduced awards are forcing some to shut businesses and decline job offers, prompting calls for urgent reform.</p>

          <p>The shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university has intensified political polarization in the United States, drawing comparisons to Germany's 1933 Reichstag fire. Without clear evidence of motives, Donald Trump immediately blamed the "radical left," rejecting calls for national healing. This event occurs amidst a week of global instability, including deepened conflict in Gaza and NATO airspace violations. The article suggests Kirk's death could be exploited to consolidate power, silence dissent, and accelerate tribalism, with concerns about intensified repression against academics, journalists, and civil servants.</p>
