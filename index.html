          <p>Warren Buffett, whose firm Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in Kraft Heinz, has voiced his disappointment with the company's decision to split back into two separate entities. The move unwinds the major 2015 merger that Buffett helped orchestrate, which has since seen the company's stock value plummet by nearly 70%. Buffett stated that while the merger did not perform as expected, he does not believe that deconstructing the company will solve its underlying issues with shifting consumer tastes. Following his comments, Kraft Heinz shares fell by over 5%.</p>

          <p>During Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Beijing, China and Russia signed over 20 bilateral cooperation agreements in sectors like energy, aerospace, and AI. This move aims to strengthen their economic partnership as both nations face increasing trade pressure and tariffs from the United States. Analysts suggest that despite a recent dip in Chinese auto exports to Russia, there is significant potential for growth in trade settled in their local currencies. The agreements signal a strategic pivot towards new markets and a response to being pushed away from the US market.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, 78, has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, ending a 34-year career in Congress. Nadler cited the need for "generational change" within the Democratic party as a primary motivator, referencing the pressures that led to Joe Biden's withdrawal from the previous presidential race. As the former chair of the House Judiciary Committee who led two impeachments against Donald Trump, Nadler expressed a desire for younger leadership to confront the challenges posed by Trump's political agenda. His decision opens up a competitive primary for his Manhattan district seat.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming memoir, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett defends the 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, arguing that the ruling "respected the choice" of the American people by returning the issue of abortion to the states. Barrett, a key conservative vote in the landmark case, suggests the original 1973 ruling had usurped the democratic process on a morally complex issue. Her comments are expected to generate significant controversy, especially given that polling indicates a majority of Americans support legal abortion access. The book reportedly avoids detailing court deliberations but offers insight into her judicial philosophy.</p>

More importantly, the joint appearance of the three leaders symbolized a strengthening alliance, described by some analysts as an "Axis of Upheaval," in a direct challenge to the U.S.-led global order.

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has blocked the scheduled execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate convicted of a 1986 murder. His attorneys successfully argued that his severe dementia renders him incompetent to be executed, as he cannot understand the reason for his punishment. Menzies, who had chosen death by firing squad, has been on death row for 37 years, during which his mental condition has significantly deteriorated. The court has ordered a lower court to reevaluate his competency, acknowledging the legal precedent that executing individuals who lack comprehension of their fate constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.</p>

These drones are equipped with speakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from movies, and live human voices to startle the predators and interrupt their hunts. This creative approach is part of an effort to find coexistence strategies as wolf populations recover and come into increasing conflict with ranchers.

Texas Republicans aim to solidify gains in the Rio Grande Valley and dilute Democratic votes in urban areas like Houston and Dallas.

Other recommended strategies include considering no-penalty CDs for greater flexibility and using a "CD ladder" approach to stagger maturity dates.

          <h2>U.S. Treasury Yields Rise on Concerns Over Potential Tariff Refunds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields jumped at the start of September trading, with the 30-year yield briefly topping 4.97%. The increase was driven by a recent federal court ruling that deemed most of the Trump administration's tariffs illegal. This has raised the possibility that the government may have to refund billions of dollars in collected tariff revenue. Investors are concerned that such a refund would strain the U.S. fiscal situation and potentially lead to a surge in new Treasury issuance to cover the shortfall, thus pushing yields higher.

          <p>In a landmark U.S. legal case, Russell Marubbio has been convicted of a 1987 sexual assault based on DNA analysis that distinguished him from his identical twin brother. Forensic scientists used advanced techniques to identify minute genetic mutations that occur after an embryo splits, which are unique to each twin. This "ultra-deep sequencing" allowed investigators to definitively link Marubbio to the crime scene evidence from nearly four decades ago. The successful application of this technology in a U.S. court sets a major precedent for solving future criminal cases involving identical twins.</p>

Musk has previously suggested that Optimus could turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company. The company plans to begin pilot production of the robots in 2025 for use in its own factories, though it faces growing competition in the humanoid robotics space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has released a list of 68 specific jobs that will be eligible for President Donald Trump's "no taxes on tips" policy. The new rule, part of a larger tax bill, allows workers in designated sectors like food service, hospitality, and transportation to claim deductions of up to $25,000 per year on tip income through 2028. Occupations on the list include bartenders, hairdressers, taxi drivers, and golf caddies. While popular, the policy is expected to impact a small segment of the workforce, as many tip-earners have incomes low enough to be exempt from federal tax.</p>

However, the public remains divided on whether China or the United States is the world's greater power, showing a continued wariness of American influence.

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling that President Trump's global tariffs are illegal has created a significant and complex problem for the U.S. government. If the ruling is upheld, the administration could be forced to refund billions of dollars in wrongfully collected duties, a process that would be an administrative nightmare. This situation is described as a consistent method of the Trump administration: taking actions at the edge of executive power and then presenting courts with the chaotic consequences of reversing them. The article argues this challenges the constitutional power of Congress to control taxation.</p>
