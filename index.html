          <p>Thirty mayors from the Los Angeles area convened to denounce federal immigration raids, with LA Mayor Karen Bass accusing the Trump administration of conducting a "national experiment" to usurp local authority. Bass highlighted the $134 million cost of deploying the Marines and National Guard, funds she argued could better serve the cities. Paramount Mayor Peggy Lemons described the fear instilled in her community, while Huntington Park Mayor Arturo Flores, a Marine Corps veteran, criticized the militarization of immigration enforcement as undermining democratic values. The mayors collectively condemned the administration's actions as fear-based political theater targeting immigrant communities and eroding public trust.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking to revoke a Biden administration rule limiting carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power plants, a rule projected to significantly reduce greenhouse gases and harmful air pollutants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin argued that the Trump administration can both protect the environment and grow the economy, claiming the Biden-era rules would suffocate the economy. The agency also plans to loosen updated limits to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, despite evidence showing the rule's effectiveness in reducing mercury emissions.

          <p>President Trump's spending bill, after passing the House, faces Senate challenges due to Republican disagreements over balancing tax cuts, immigration enforcement, and defense spending with the growing national debt. Critics like Elon Musk have condemned the bill, which would raise the deficit by trillions over the next decade and disproportionately benefit the wealthy. The bill's tax cuts, including eliminating taxes on tips, contribute significantly to the deficit, while proposed Medicaid work requirements could leave millions uninsured. The legislation also includes provisions targeting immigrants, such as a new tax on remittances, potentially impacting families abroad. (not investment advice)</p>

The company reports that only 20% of landlords report rent payments, despite renters paying an estimated $1.4 trillion annually.

          <p>The WTA Tour will now offer ranking protection to female tennis players who choose to freeze their eggs or embryos, allowing them to start families later without jeopardizing their careers. This protection is available to players ranked in the top 750 who spend more than 10 weeks out of competition. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, praised the rule, saying it reduces the pressure on players to return to the court too quickly. Stephens herself has previously used the off-season to freeze her eggs and emphasizes the importance of not feeling forced to return early and risk their health.</p>

          <p>Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, known for his Russia-friendly stance, made a surprise visit to Ukraine for a summit on bolstering European support for Kyiv. Despite seeking EU membership, Vucic has maintained close ties with Russia, even attending Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow. During the summit, Vucic refused to sign a joint declaration calling for tougher sanctions against Moscow, citing the declaration's "anti-Russian" sentiment and its mention of sanctions as reasons for his abstention. Serbia relies heavily on Russia for energy supplies and has resisted joining Western sanctions against Russia.</p>

This statement comes after a public dispute between the two, which impacted Tesla's stock performance. The feud began with Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which he claimed would increase the U.S. budget deficit. Trump had previously stated there would be consequences for Musk if he supported Democratic candidates, but later indicated he would be open to a conversation.</p>
