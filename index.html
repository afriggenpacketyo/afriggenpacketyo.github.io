          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng reported its eighth consecutive month of delivering over 30,000 cars, demonstrating resilience amid an intense price war in China's EV market. While competitors like Nio and Li Auto showed mixed results, market giant BYD continued its dominance with over 2.1 million passenger car sales in the first half of the year. The fierce competition, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government, is also pressuring international players like Tesla, which saw its market share and sales decline in the face of new, competitively priced models from local brands such as Xiaomi.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has accepted the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the deal brokered by Qatar and Egypt. The proposal aims to halt the conflict, which began after the October 7th attack, and facilitate negotiations to end the war and secure the release of remaining hostages. This development comes as Israeli officials continue to state that the war will only end with the dismantling of Hamas, while Hamas has demanded a permanent truce and a full Israeli withdrawal from the territory.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of "30% or 35%" on Japanese goods if a new trade agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. This potential increase is significantly higher than the current 10% levy most Japanese exports to the U.S. face. Trump expressed doubt that a deal would be made, while also criticizing Japan's policies on rice imports. The warning escalates trade tensions as the 90-day pause on broader global tariffs, implemented in April, is set to expire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data shows that the number of migrants apprehended for crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally reached a new historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 apprehensions. This continues an extraordinary decline in illegal immigration that the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive deportation policies and enhanced border security measures. These policies include empowering officials to swiftly deport migrants, deploying additional troops to the border, and staging an intense messaging campaign to encourage self-deportation. The low numbers stand in stark contrast to the record highs seen under the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price fell by 7% amid a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump concerning the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Musk criticized the bill for increasing the national deficit and for provisions that would cut support for renewable energy and phase out EV tax credits, which could harm Tesla's business. In response, Trump suggested Musk could lose more than just his EV mandate, alluding to the substantial government contracts his companies like SpaceX rely on. The conflict adds to investor uncertainty as Tesla prepares to release its second-quarter delivery numbers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," a 940-page legislative package, has ignited fierce debate over its contents and fiscal impact. The bill aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, expand the child tax credit, and allocate $170 billion for defense and border security, while also cutting funds for programs like Medicaid. Critics, including former ally Elon Musk, have condemned the bill for potentially adding trillions to the national debt.

          <p>A coalition of 20 states, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for sharing confidential Medicaid recipient data with the Department of Homeland Security. The lawsuit alleges that federal health officials unlawfully transferred sensitive informationâ€”including names, addresses, and immigration statusâ€”to be used for immigration enforcement. The states argue this action violates federal privacy laws, upends longstanding policy, and creates a "culture of fear" that could deter people from seeking vital medical care.

While some regions rely on more stable groundwater, long-term forecasts suggest dry conditions will continue, straining water supplies and impacting farmers, wildlife, and the environment.

          <p>This opinion article vehemently criticizes the Senate's version of the "Big Beautiful Bill," labeling it a "fiscal monstrosity" that adds nearly $4 trillion to the national debt. The author argues that while the bill contains a few pro-growth policies, they are overshadowed by pork-barrel spending, budget gimmicks, and a cynical expansion of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The piece contends that both political parties are fiscally irresponsible, indulging current constituents with tax cuts and spending while sending a massive bill to future generations.
