            <p>An Iranian delegation has arrived in Muscat, Oman, for indirect talks with U.S. officials regarding Tehran's nuclear program. This meeting follows Tehran's rejection of direct negotiations with the United States last month, with Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi describing the meeting as both an opportunity and a test. The Iranian ministry stated its dedication to diplomacy, intending to assess the other side's intent and resolve. The talks are a developing story, with updates expected as the discussions progress.</p>

            <p>A measles outbreak in western Texas, one of the worst in a decade, continues to spread due to vaccine skepticism. Two unvaccinated children from the Mennonite community have died, with over 500 infections reported in the region and linked cases in neighboring states. Health officials are struggling to reach vaccine-hesitant residents, facing mixed messaging from federal officials, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has endorsed immunization conspiracy theories in the past. The outbreak highlights the challenges of achieving herd immunity in communities with low vaccination rates.</p>

            <p>Mental health workers at Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles have initiated a five-day hunger strike to protest for better pay and benefits after nearly six months of striking.

Kaiser Permanente acknowledges some disparities but maintains its pay is competitive, while management expresses concern over the hunger strike and eagerness to return to negotiations.</p>

            <p>Panamanian opposition politicians are accusing the US of a “camouflaged invasion” following increased military presence at former US bases, ostensibly to protect the Panama Canal from Chinese influence. This move has sparked outrage due to potential violations of the canal's neutrality treaty and memories of past US military interventions. Frustration is growing over the government's handling of the diplomatic crisis, with accusations of secrecy and conflicting accounts of negotiations with the US. Popular demonstrations are expected to protest US policy and the government's handling of the situation.</p>

            <p>Researchers have discovered an experimental medication, lepodisiran, that significantly reduces lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), a genetic cholesterol-like particle associated with increased heart attack and stroke risk. The drug, made by Eli Lilly, effectively "silences" the gene responsible for Lp(a) synthesis, potentially benefiting millions worldwide with elevated Lp(a) levels. Unlike LDL cholesterol, Lp(a) is primarily determined by genetics and unaffected by lifestyle changes, making this drug a potential breakthrough in cardiovascular treatment. While promising, further trials are needed to confirm its clinical impact. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK government is considering nationalizing British Steel to prevent its collapse, with Parliament set to vote on measures to keep the company afloat. The move comes after the Chinese owners, Jingye, requested a large taxpayer bailout without guaranteeing job security. The government aims to maintain steel production in the UK for strategic reasons, as well as preserve jobs. While nationalization is not yet confirmed, it appears increasingly likely, despite concerns about the significant costs involved. (not investment advice)</p>
