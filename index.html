          <p>Alibaba has created a new AI foundation model, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B, that delivers high performance despite its compact size. The model is reportedly ten times faster on certain tasks and was developed with a 90% reduction in training costs compared to its predecessor. This technical innovation allows it to outperform many larger, more expensive models from the previous year, highlighting a significant leap in AI efficiency. The cost to train was estimated at under $500,000, a fraction of competitors' expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson for the killing of Charlie Kirk, the motive remains unclear, fueling intense political discourse. Utah's governor suggested the suspect was indoctrinated with leftist ideology, while reports indicate authorities are investigating his connection to the transgender community, a group Kirk often criticized. The lack of a clear motive has allowed various political figures to frame the tragedy to support their own narratives, from calls for the death penalty to discussions on radicalization. The community and nation grapple with the political and social implications of the violent act.</p>

          <p>A London march organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew an estimated crowd of over 110,000, far exceeding expectations. The event, focused on anti-migration rhetoric, saw clashes between a small group of supporters and police, leading to 26 officer injuries and at least 25 arrests. Speakers, including a video appearance by Elon Musk, condemned uncontrolled migration and the current UK government. The large turnout and ensuing violence highlight growing tensions around migration and nationalism in the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>Educators are observing a significant increase in "emotionally based school avoidance" (EBSA), where children find attending school too traumatic, an issue exacerbated since the COVID-19 pandemic. A mother shared her regret over forcing her autistic daughter to attend school until she experienced a breakdown, highlighting the severe distress it can cause. Schools are now trying to address the problem with more inclusive approaches and specialized support units, recognizing that anxiety, social media pressures, and sensory overload are contributing factors. The UK government and local councils are implementing new strategies to support affected students.</p>

          <p>The Venezuelan government accused the U.S. of illegally boarding a civilian fishing boat in its Exclusive Economic Zone, escalating tensions over U.S. counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean. A U.S. official confirmed that Coast Guard personnel from the USS Jason Dunham conducted a search for drugs based on a tip, but found no contraband. The official stated the vessel was in international waters, disputing Venezuela's claims of an eight-hour occupation and provocation. The incident follows a U.S. announcement of increased military presence to combat drug smuggling in the region.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge accused the Trump administration of attempting to bypass legal protections for asylum seekers by deporting a group of African migrants to Ghana. The judge expressed concern that Ghana intends to return these individuals to their home countries, where they face persecution or torture, despite U.S. court orders prohibiting such returns. The ACLU, representing the deportees, argued this action violates U.S. obligations under the UN Convention Against Torture. The judge ordered the government to explain its actions, highlighting a significant legal and ethical conflict in U.S. immigration policy.</p>

In a trade-off that angered environmentalists, the bill also tightens restrictions on offshore drilling and extends the state's cap-and-trade program.

          <p>Dr. Earl Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University who led a landmark lawsuit against the state of Maryland for underfunding its historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), has died at 81. His 15-year legal battle resulted in a historic $577 million settlement in 2021 for four of the state's HBCUs. Richardson's advocacy and leadership not only transformed his own university but also brought national attention to the systemic funding disparities faced by Black institutions across the country. He is remembered as a visionary who was "armed with history" in the fight for educational equity.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's new striker, Nick Woltemade, made an immediate impact by scoring the winning goal just 29 minutes into his debut against Wolves. The 6-foot-6 German forward, signed from Stuttgart, headed in a cross to secure a 1-0 victory for his new club. The goal was a timely contribution, especially after it was revealed that fellow new signing Yoane Wissa would be sidelined with an injury. Woltemade's performance and classic number nine goal quickly won over the home crowd, offering a promising start to his career at St James' Park.</p>

          <p>According to leaked military planning documents, the Trump administration has drafted a proposal to deploy 1,000 Louisiana National Guard troops for law enforcement operations in the state's urban areas. The plan, which would require a request from Louisiana's Republican governor, outlines a mobilization lasting until September 2026 to supplement local police in cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The proposal aligns with the administration's focus on crime in cities, though critics have described such deployments as political stunts. The Pentagon has not confirmed the plan, stating that leaked documents should not be interpreted as official policy.</p>

          <p>A staffer for Mexico's ruling party, Salvador Ramírez, has resigned after making controversial comments about the murder of Charlie Kirk on a major television news program. Ramírez suggested Kirk, a promoter of gun rights, was given "a spoonful of his own chocolate," prompting swift backlash online. The incident drew the attention of the U.S. deputy secretary of state, who warned that foreigners glorifying violence are not welcome in the U.S., leading the network to apologize and Ramírez to step down. This marks another instance of an individual facing professional consequences for commentary following the activist's death.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service confirmed that two tornadoes touched down in rural San Juan County, Utah, on Saturday afternoon. The first tornado was observed near Montezuma Creek, while a second, radar-indicated tornado formed east of Monticello. Both storms tracked northeast across the state line into Colorado, prompting tornado warnings for the sparsely populated area. While Utah typically averages only two tornadoes per year, these are the second and third of 2025. No immediate reports of major injuries were released, though damage to mobile homes and trees was considered likely.</p>

          <p>A series of intense Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City resulted in the deaths of at least 32 people, including 12 children, according to medical staff at Shifa Hospital. The strikes are part of an escalated Israeli offensive in the area, which Israel describes as the last major stronghold for Hamas. The Israeli military has ordered residents to evacuate the city, but hundreds of thousands remain amid famine-like conditions. The bombardment, which destroyed several high-rise buildings, continues to exacerbate the dire humanitarian crisis as the war, which began in October 2023, persists with a devastating toll on civilians.</p>

          <h2>Experts Analyze 'Extremely Online' References Engraved on Bullet Casings from Kirk Shooting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 15:26:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bullet casings found at the scene of Charlie Kirk's assassination featured engraved messages described by experts as "extremely online," blending internet memes, gaming references, and anti-fascist themes. The engravings included the emoticon "OwO" from furry subculture, a command code from the video game Helldivers 2, and lyrics from the Italian anti-fascist anthem "Bella Ciao." Experts caution against drawing simple conclusions about the shooter's motive from these messages, suggesting they may be a form of "doublespeak" designed to create confusion and generate viral attention online. The eclectic mix of references highlights the complex nature of online communication.</p>
