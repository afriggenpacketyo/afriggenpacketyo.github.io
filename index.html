          <p>The U.S. Embassy in Qatar advised American citizens to shelter in place due to a credible threat, coinciding with Qatar's temporary airspace closure. This advisory followed a State Department warning for increased caution worldwide after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in response to Iran's vow to retaliate if the U.S. joined the conflict. While Qatar's foreign ministry confirmed the airspace suspension for safety, they stated that the embassy advisories did not reflect specific threats within the country, emphasizing a stable security situation monitored closely by Qatari authorities. The U.K. also issued a similar shelter-in-place recommendation for its citizens in Qatar, reflecting heightened regional concerns.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she might favor an interest rate cut at the July policy meeting if inflation remains contained. Bowman's remarks echoed similar sentiments from Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting the Fed is considering easing monetary policy. This comes as President Trump has pressured the Fed to lower rates to alleviate the national debt's financing costs. Bowman noted that the impact of tariffs on inflation may be delayed and smaller than initially expected, paving the way for potential rate adjustments to sustain a healthy labor market (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses how to prioritize paying off medical debt versus credit card debt, noting that while conventional wisdom favors paying off high-interest debt first, medical debt often operates under different rules. Credit card debt can damage credit scores faster due to monthly reporting and compounding interest, while medical debt typically has a grace period before being reported. Credit card companies are also more aggressive with collections, while medical providers may offer payment plans or financial assistance. Ultimately, the article advises a proactive approach to managing both types of debt to avoid serious financial consequences.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) issued a direct warning to the United States, stating that Iran will retaliate. IRGC Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi condemned the U.S. action as a violation of international rules and vowed that it would not go unanswered. Mousavi also stated that while Iran will continue to punish Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, it will also act against the U.S. for its involvement, framing the U.S. action as an attempt to assist Israel.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, signaling the beginning of a decade-long survey of the cosmos. As a survey telescope, Rubin will create an elaborate, four-dimensional map of the cosmos, cataloging 37 billion astronomical objects and revisiting them every three nights for ten years. The observatory's data pipeline connects it to the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California, where images will be analyzed and distributed to astronomers worldwide, issuing approximately 10 million alerts each night. The observatory is also likened to a planetary insurance policy, detecting near-Earth objects, and some predict it could generate evidence pointing toward alien intelligence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the United States' bombing of Iran's nuclear sites, Nader Hashemi argues that the official reason of preventing nuclear weapons is not the sole motivator. He contends that the attacks aim to eliminate Iran's regional influence and establish Israeli hegemony in the Middle East, supported by Arab autocrats. Hashemi points to Iran's internal weakness due to economic sanctions and a crisis of legitimacy, as well as its weakened regional position following the loss of allies. He concludes that Iran's primary threat to the U.S. and Israel is its independent foreign policy, challenging Western influence in the region.</p>

          <p>An 18th-century oil painting at Florence's Uffizi Gallery was allegedly damaged after a museum visitor tripped while attempting to take a selfie. The incident involved a portrait of Ferdinando de' Medici by Anton Domenico Gabbiani. The museum director, Simone Verde, stated that while the damage could be repaired quickly, the incident may lead to stricter regulations on visitor behavior. The exhibition featuring the damaged portrait is temporarily closed until July 2, with the painting undergoing restoration.</p>

          <p>Compass has filed a lawsuit against Zillow, alleging that the online property website's new rule violates antitrust laws. Zillow's policy bans home listings from its platform if they appear on other services for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow. Compass argues that this "Zillow ban" leverages Zillow's market dominance to stifle competition and restrict consumer choice. Compass CEO Robert Reffkin stated that no company should have the power to ban agents or listings based on their business model, and that it's a matter of protecting consumer choice.</p>
