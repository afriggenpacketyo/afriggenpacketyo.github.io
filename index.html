        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alabama lawmakers have passed legislation providing additional legal safeguards for police officers, setting legal standards for the use of force and providing for an immunity hearing. Republicans argue the "Back The Blue" bill offers a clear legal framework for officers making split-second decisions, while Democrats express concerns that it could embolden misconduct and disproportionately harm Black individuals. The bill allows an immunity hearing where a judge will decide if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties, and requires law enforcement departments to track use of force complaints.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger than anticipated growth in the first quarter of the year, expanding by 0.7% between January and March, surpassing analyst forecasts of 0.6%. According to the Office for National Statistics, this growth was primarily fueled by the UK services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the figures as evidence of the UK economy's underlying strength and potential for future growth.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy, boosted by a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is projected to see moderate growth in the coming years, according to the International Monetary Fund. Despite the threat of potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, Denmark is expected to be largely shielded due to its reliance on a "merchanting and processing" system where manufacturing is contracted to other countries. The IMF notes that direct impacts from U.S. tariffs are expected to be limited, though heightened trade tensions pose risks to the outlook, as Danish drugmakers increasingly rely on intellectual property rather than domestic production.</p>

          <p>Russia has released its delegation list for upcoming peace talks with Ukraine in Turkey, notably excluding President Vladimir Putin, signaling he will not meet directly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Former President Trump, who has advocated for peace talks, initially considered attending but will instead visit the United Arab Emirates, sending Secretary of State Marco Rubio in his place. Zelensky expressed uncertainty about Ukraine's approach to the talks, awaiting Russia's delegation, which will be led by Putin aide Vladimir Medinsky, while emphasizing the need for Western sanctions if Putin rejects the meeting. The talks aim to address the ongoing conflict, which has resulted in significant troop losses and equipment destruction for both sides.</p>

The "Great Charter," originally dating from June 1215, is considered a foundational document for constitutions and legal systems worldwide, particularly influencing the US Declaration of Independence and Constitution.</p>

Four sick children, accompanied by their parents or guardians, were transported from Gaza through Israel to Jordan, where they will receive specialized medical care. The evacuation plan, initiated in February, aims to bring 2,000 sick children to Jordan, though progress has been slow due to Israeli delays and ongoing hostilities. The article underscores the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, with a population of 2.1 million facing the risk of famine due to the Israeli blockade preventing essential aid supplies from reaching the population.</p>

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei has issued a decree to tighten immigration policies, drawing comparisons to the Trump administration's approach. The new measures include stricter requirements for citizenship and permanent residency, making it easier to deport migrants who enter the country illegally or commit minor crimes. The decree also mandates that foreigners pay for public health care and education, a shift from the country's long-standing tradition of providing free access to these services. Critics worry that the new rules will challenge Argentina's history of openness to immigrants, while the government claims the changes will address "chaos and abuse" and ensure the sustainability of public services.</p>

Kevin Keen advocates for auto-enrollment schemes, similar to those in Guernsey, Australia, and the UK, to ensure more residents save for retirement. This call comes ahead of a conference focused on adapting to the island's increasing elderly population, with projections indicating a 50% rise in the number of people aged 75 and over in the next 20-30 years.

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling its release of stockpiled rice to address near-record high rice prices, according to sources familiar with the matter. The government is considering releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months through July, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. This move comes in response to a rice shortage partly caused by a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption at restaurants due to a surge in foreign tourists. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions.</p>

          <p>The Independent Schools Council (ISC) reports that private school fees in the UK have increased by 22.6% in the last year, exceeding government predictions, following the introduction of VAT on fees. The average termly fee for a day school in January was £7,382, including 20% VAT. The ISC expects a reduction in pupils applying for private schools as a result, but the Treasury says the increase in fees are not only down to VAT and the data "misrepresents reality". Many schools reduced their fees, excluding VAT, to cushion the impact on parents, but the sector has been hit by a "triple whammy" of national insurance changes, an end to charitable business rates relief and "the blow of 20% VAT on fees".</p>

          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has commenced construction on its fifth terminal, set to open in the mid-2030s, to accommodate the anticipated surge in air travel demand in Asia. The new terminal will nearly double the airport's existing area, increasing its capacity to handle 140 million passengers per year. The decision to expand is driven by projections that air travel will grow nearly 7% over the next 25 years, with the Asia-Pacific region expected to be a major driver of this growth. The expansion aims to connect Changi with 200 cities, up from the current 170, further solidifying Singapore's position as a leading air hub.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a tax bill that would slash billions in climate-related funding and roll back clean energy tax credits to fund President Trump's tax cuts. The proposed legislation targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, impacting renewable energy, manufacturing, and electric vehicles. Environmental groups and renewable energy companies are lobbying against the cuts, arguing they are vital to supporting new industries and would disproportionately affect Republican districts. The bill would also streamline permitting for fossil fuels and rescind Clean Air Act pollution funding.</p>

The manuscript, acquired for a mere $27.50 after World War II, could be worth millions today, and is now celebrated as a cornerstone of constitutional history.
