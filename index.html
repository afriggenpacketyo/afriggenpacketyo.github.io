          <p>Officials in Yolo County, California, have confirmed that the remains of all seven workers missing after a Tuesday explosion at a fireworks warehouse have been found. The warehouse, operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, was not permitted to store fireworks at its Esparto location. The property is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, whose home was also destroyed in the blast. The investigation, involving state and federal agencies like the ATF, is now transitioning to a law enforcement-based incident.</p>

          <p>Poland has introduced temporary border checks with Germany and Lithuania, a move that analysts see as a sign of increasing strain on the European Union's Schengen borderless travel zone. This follows similar actions by Germany, France, and Austria, often justified by concerns over migration and security. Experts argue these controls are more about political symbolism than effectiveness, as they disrupt local economies and supply chains without significantly curbing irregular migration. The trend towards national self-interest threatens one of the EU's most tangible achievements.</p>

          <p>The deadly Texas floods were caused by a storm system that combined remnant moisture from a former tropical storm with local thunderstorms, dumping exceptional amounts of rain. Some areas, like Bertram and Liberty Hill, received upwards of 20 inches of rainfall over the holiday weekend. This deluge caused the Guadalupe River's forks to swell rapidly, with one section rising 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The region's topography, which is prone to flash flooding, exacerbated the disaster's severity.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to block a provision in a new domestic policy bill that eliminates its Medicaid funding. The organization argues the measure is unconstitutional and specifically designed to punish the healthcare provider for its role in the public debate over abortion. The lawsuit states that cutting off Medicaid reimbursements would have "catastrophic consequences" for the more than one million patients they serve annually.</p>
