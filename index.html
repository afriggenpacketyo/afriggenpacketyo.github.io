          <p>Palantir's stock surged after the company reported its first-ever billion-dollar revenue quarter, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. The software analytics provider attributed its strong performance to high demand for its artificial intelligence platforms and government contracts, leading it to raise its full-year financial forecast. CEO Alex Karp celebrated the "extraordinary numbers" and expressed immense pride, though some analysts remain cautious about the stock's high valuation relative to its growth.

          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations, primarily due to declining same-store sales in the U.S. for its KFC and Pizza Hut chains. Both brands struggled with value messaging and competition, posting a 5% sales drop domestically. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to perform well with a 4% same-store sales increase, driven by popular new menu items, though even this was slightly below analyst projections.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was preventable, faulting OceanGate for using "intimidation tactics" to evade regulatory oversight. The comprehensive report states the company operated outside established safety protocols and continued using the vessel despite damage that likely compromised its hull. The investigation identified a "toxic" safety culture and critically flawed operational practices as key factors leading to the deaths of the five people on board.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that police guidance on disclosing the immigration status and ethnicity of crime suspects "needs to change" to provide more transparency. The call follows a case involving two men, reportedly Afghan, charged with the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl, where police withheld such details, citing national guidelines. The debate highlights a tension between public demand for information and the need to ensure a fair trial, with past events showing how a lack of official information can fuel dangerous misinformation.</p>

          <p>The ongoing political conflict over congressional redistricting, exemplified by the situation in Texas, is analyzed as a cynical political maneuver where Republicans currently hold more advantages. While Democrats in states like New York and California have threatened retaliatory gerrymandering, Republicans face fewer institutional and legal obstacles in states they control. This article suggests that in a nationwide battle where both parties abandon principles for partisan gain, the GOP is better positioned to secure a net gain of congressional seats.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a significant bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, with the total offer potentially reaching £73.8 million (€85m). The Premier League club's proposal includes a guaranteed payment of £65.2 million (€75m) as it seeks to secure the 22-year-old Slovenian forward. The move indicates United's serious interest in the player, who is also being pursued by Newcastle, and suggests a willingness to let current striker Rasmus Hojlund leave to accommodate the new signing.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. citizens are speaking out after being wrongfully arrested and, in some cases, criminally charged during aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Los Angeles. One woman, Andrea Velez, was on her way to work when she was detained and charged with assaulting an officer, a felony case that was later dismissed. These incidents highlight a pattern of aggressive tactics and questionable arrests by federal agents, with critics accusing the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney of targeting bystanders and protesters.</p>

          <p>Redwood Materials, a battery recycling startup founded by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, is repurposing old electric vehicle batteries to power microgrids for AI data centers. The company found that many used EV batteries still have significant usable capacity, making them a cost-effective energy storage solution for the power-hungry AI industry. For its first project, Redwood has partnered with AI infrastructure firm Crusoe to build a large-scale solar and battery storage system, aiming to provide 24/7 renewable power.</p>

          <p>A perinatal psychiatrist argues that a recent FDA advisory panel discussion on the use of SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy promoted significant misinformation and fear. The author contends that the panel overstated risks and ignored robust data supporting the safety and necessity of these medications for treating severe maternal mental health conditions. Untreated perinatal depression poses real dangers to both mother and baby, and the author stresses that evidence-based care, not fear-mongering, is needed to support pregnant individuals.</p>

          <p>More than £100 million in Premium Bond prizes, including eleven £100,000 awards, are currently unclaimed in the United Kingdom, according to a BBC report. Critics argue that the operator, the government-owned National Savings and Investments (NS&I), is not doing enough to trace the winners. The process is particularly difficult for those who were gifted bonds as children or only have old paper records, leading to calls for reform to make it easier for people to claim their winnings.</p>

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit decreased by 16.0% in June to $60.2 billion, its narrowest point since September 2023, as reported by the Commerce Department. The change was driven by a sharp decline in the import of consumer goods, reflecting the impact of President Trump's sweeping tariffs on global commerce. While the narrowing deficit provided a boost to second-quarter GDP figures, underlying economic indicators suggest that overall activity may be weakening as a result of the trade policies.

While an interim government is in place and a tribunal has been established, a growing sense of disillusionment is spreading across the country as the process moves slowly and other societal problems persist.</p>

While most rail routes have reopened after widespread disruptions from fallen trees and 90mph winds, SSEN warned that due to complex damage, some homes may not have power restored until Thursday.</p>
