          <p>California's parole board has denied parole for Erik Menendez, who, along with his brother Lyle, was convicted of murdering their parents in 1989. The panel cited Menendez's prison conduct, including rule violations, as a primary reason for the denial, stating he still poses an unreasonable risk to public safety. Despite family support for his release and his own claims of remorse and growth, the board determined he must wait another three years before his next hearing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered a halt to the expansion of a controversial immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades. The ruling cites violations of environmental laws and the failure of state officials to consider alternative locations for the facility, known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The injunction requires the state to wind down operations and remove temporary structures, marking a significant victory for environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe who argued the project threatened the delicate ecosystem.</p>

          <p>India and Russia have committed to expanding their bilateral trade, defying pressure from the Trump administration, which has threatened tariffs over India's significant purchases of Russian oil. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar emphasized the stability of the relationship during a visit to Moscow, outlining plans to increase Indian exports to Russia to balance the trade deficit. This strategic partnership underscores India's independent foreign policy and its long-standing ties with Russia, even amidst complex global geopolitical dynamics.</p>

For Ukrainians, a fair resolution is becoming a distant dream, and the reality of ongoing Russian attacks overshadows diplomatic gestures.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that corn plants can communicate with each other by releasing a gas called linalool, which signals neighboring plants to alter their soil composition. This mechanism helps the plants defend against herbivores, though it may also reduce their growth in densely planted fields. The international team of scientists believes this discovery could lead to new strategies for optimizing the use of this chemical signal to enhance pest resistance and improve crop yields in agriculture.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, was not lawfully appointed as the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey and has disqualified her from ongoing criminal cases. The judge found that the Trump administration's "novel series of legal and personnel moves" to install her in the position was not legally valid. The decision has been stayed to allow the administration time to appeal, with Attorney General Pam Bondi stating they will immediately challenge what she called an "activist judicial attack."</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department announced it will continuously vet all 55 million valid U.S. visa holders for any violations that could lead to revocation and deportation. This move is part of a broader immigration crackdown by the Trump administration. Concurrently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced an immediate halt to the issuance of new worker visas for commercial truck drivers, citing concerns over road safety and the protection of American jobs, a move that comes amidst a reported shortage of drivers in the U.S.</p>

          <p>This legal analysis characterizes the Supreme Court's decision regarding canceled NIH research grants as "incomprehensible gobbledygook" that creates a complex jurisdictional puzzle. The fractured 5-4 ruling, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett providing the pivotal vote, splits the case between two different courts, potentially delaying any resolution for years. The author argues this convoluted outcome effectively allows the Trump administration's policy to stand, causing irreversible harm to public health research while making it exceptionally difficult for plaintiffs to seek legal recourse.</p>

          <p>Families who lost babies under the care of the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust feel "ignored and dismissed" after a meeting with Baroness Amos, the chair of a new national review into maternity services. The families, who have been campaigning for a specific, independent inquiry, claim the meeting was unproductive and that the chair was unprepared. Their frustration is compounded by the appointment of a former regulator to the review team, which they believe compromises the investigation's independence and fails to address systemic safety issues.</p>

          <p>The online message board 4chan will refuse to pay fines proposed by the UK's media regulator, Ofcom, under the new Online Safety Act, according to its lawyer. The US-based company argues that Ofcom's requests create no legal obligations in the United States and that American businesses are protected by the First Amendment. This defiance sets up a significant international clash over internet regulation, with 4chan's legal team calling the investigation an "illegal campaign of harassment" and preparing for a potential US court battle.</p>
