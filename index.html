        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that despite disagreements with Trump's approach to the Ukraine war, his influence could push both sides toward a much-needed ceasefire. The editorial acknowledges Trump's correct observations about the war's tragic human cost and the potential for economic benefits from its end. Instead of withdrawing, Trump should increase pressure on Russia and Ukraine to reach a deal, potentially including Russia retaining controlled territories in exchange for lifted sanctions and security guarantees for Ukraine. The article underscores the importance of the U.S. demonstrating resolve to prevent further Russian aggression and end the conflict, emphasizing the need for a settlement that allows Ukraine to thrive and sends a message to potential aggressors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ibram X. Kendi argues that the Trump administration is systematically attacking Black history by purging content, removing books, and defunding institutions. Kendi draws a parallel to the Atlanta Race Massacre of 1906, where false accusations fueled violence against Black Atlantans. He highlights the story of J. Max Barber, a Black magazine editor who challenged lies during that era and faced persecution. Kendi contends that the administration's framing of Black history as "D.E.I." is a dangerous tactic that mirrors historical justifications for racist violence and aims to erase Black contributions from public memory, thereby undermining the opportunity for all Americans to understand the enduring impact of racial inequity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines the potential impact of the NBA's rumored expansion into Europe on the existing European basketball landscape. While the move could bring financial benefits and increased TV coverage, concerns are raised about the potential harm to established leagues like EuroLeague and the dilution of the player pool. The cultural differences between the NBA's entertainment-focused model and Europe's tradition-rich fan culture are also highlighted. The article questions whether the American franchise model, with its potential for team relocation, can coexist with European clubs deeply rooted in their cities and histories, ultimately asking whether commercialization will come at the cost of the unique atmosphere and identity of European basketball.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how Hungary, under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, has become an inspiration for U.S. conservatives, despite criticisms of its slide towards electoral autocracy. Orbán's government has been accused of remaking the courts, stifling independent press, and passing laws to suppress civil society. Despite these concerns, many U.S. conservatives admire Orbán's unapologetic style and policies on immigration and cultural issues. The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) convening in Budapest symbolizes this cross-cultural admiration, with some seeing Orbán's Hungary as a model for conservative populist leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are raising concerns about the safety of the U.S. food supply following significant cutbacks to federal agencies responsible for monitoring it. These cuts have led to staff shortages and reduced inspections, potentially increasing the risk of foodborne illness outbreaks. The article highlights the administration's rollback of USDA food-safety rules and the closure of FDA testing labs as contributing factors to the problem. While agencies claim streamlining operations won't affect safety, inspectors report being stretched thin and morale plummeting, leading to fears of another major contamination incident similar to the Boar's Head deli meat case.</p>

          <p>Conflict resolution facilitator Priya Parker suggests using "magical questions" to cut through small talk and reveal people's personalities in group settings. These questions are designed to spark curiosity and elicit responses that help people feel like individuals rather than just a group. Parker emphasizes that magical questions should be relevant to the context of the group and allow everyone to participate, regardless of their backgrounds or opinions. She provides examples such as asking about someone's first concert or a gift they deeply loved, noting that these questions can lead to deeper conversations and connections.</p>

          <p>World financial markets welcomed a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports, causing U.S. futures to jump and oil prices to rise. The court found that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not authorize the use of tariffs. While the White House appealed the ruling, investors appeared encouraged by the potential end to months of trade war turmoil. The ruling also pushed the dollar higher against the Japanese yen and boosted stock markets in Asia and Europe.</p>

Xi emphasized self-reliance in advanced manufacturing as the backbone of China's economy. This push could conflict with the Trump administration's demands to address trade imbalances and reduce state subsidies to Chinese companies. Experts suggest China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, potentially leading to continued trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Complaints about substandard living conditions in social housing in England have increased more than fivefold in the past five years, according to the housing watchdog. The Housing Ombudsman attributes this rise to an "imbalance of power" between tenants and landlords, leading to "simmering anger" and a breakdown in trust. Issues such as asbestos, electrical and fire safety concerns, pest control, and leaks, damp, and mould are common grievances. The watchdog calls for a "transformative overhaul" of the system, including an independent review of funding practices and a "national tenant body" to strengthen tenant voice and landlord accountability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will begin revoking visas for some Chinese international students, including those in "critical fields" or with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The government will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. This move has drawn criticism from Beijing, who claims the U.S. is unreasonably canceling visas under the pretext of ideology and national rights. The announcement follows increased scrutiny of ties between U.S. higher education and China, with concerns raised about access to federally-funded research.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, a key component of his economic policies, ruling that an emergency law invoked by the White House did not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court said the US Constitution gave Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations and this was not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The White House has criticized the ruling and said it would appeal within minutes of the ruling. Global markets have responded positively to the ruling.</p>

          <p>The government has outlined plans for reforming the UK pension industry, including the creation of £25bn "megafunds" instructed to invest locally to fuel economic growth.

Seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms already approved the gist of these reforms in a voluntary agreement earlier this month. The government is also including a legislative back-stop, which will allow it to push through the new rules, if insufficient progress is made by the end of the decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by strong demand ahead of the potential negative effects of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. The automaker's global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. Despite the positive sales figures, Toyota anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to Trump's tariff measures and a stronger yen.

The White House has 10 days to complete the bureaucratic process of halting the tariffs, although most are currently suspended anyway.
