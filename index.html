          <p>The U.S. Defense Department is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the United States. Through a $400 million investment, the Pentagon aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for rare earths, which are critical for military technologies like F-35 jets and drones. This public-private partnership is designed to reduce American dependence on China, which currently dominates the global market, and will fund the expansion of MP Materials' processing and magnet manufacturing capabilities, backed by price guarantees.

          <p>Vietnam's government is implementing a significant tax hike on alcoholic beverages, with the rate set to increase from 65% to 90% by 2031. This move is part of a broader strategy to curb what officials see as harmful consumption habits and to improve public health, as alcohol is cited as the second-highest cause of death in the country. The increased tax revenue is also intended to support the nation's ambitious goals for universal health insurance coverage, especially as its population ages. The alcohol industry has voiced opposition, citing recent declines in sales and concerns about consumers turning to unregulated products.</p>

          <h2>Electric Vehicle Adoption Surges in Nepal Amid Favorable Government Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 09:33:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nepal is experiencing a rapid increase in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, driven by government incentives and a public desire to combat severe air pollution in cities like Kathmandu. Favorable tax policies for EVs compared to gasoline-powered cars have made them an attractive alternative, with over 70% of new private vehicle imports now being electric. The government has set an ambitious target for 90% of new private vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. This transition is seen as a crucial step in reducing the nation's carbon footprint and leveraging its abundant clean hydropower resources for sustainable transportation.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its shares jump after reinstating its 2025 profit outlook and providing a stronger-than-expected forecast for summer travel. CEO Ed Bastian stated that while booking levels are lower than initially predicted at the start of the year, they have stabilized, prompting the airline to trim capacity outside of peak periods. The company reported strong growth from premium cabin sales and its American Express partnership, which helped offset a decline in main cabin revenue. While the full-year earnings forecast was lowered from January's optimistic prediction, the update provided a much-needed boost of confidence to investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book, "Loud and Clear" by Brian Anderson, details the history of the Grateful Dead's legendary "Wall of Sound," a massive and innovative sound system from the early 1970s. The article reviews how the band, led by sound engineer Owsley "Bear" Stanley, attempted to create a perfect and egalitarian live audio experience by placing a colossal array of speakers directly behind them. While the concept was visionary, allowing for unparalleled clarity at great distances, it was also a logistical and technical nightmare. The complexity and expense of the system ultimately contributed to the band's temporary hiatus, illustrating the tension between artistic innovation and practical sustainability.</p>

Other contributing factors include the loss of manufacturing jobs, the deinstitutionalization of mental health patients without adequate community support, and a slow-growth movement that drastically reduced the city's housing capacity, all of which converged to create today's severe housing shortage.</p>

While NASA is reportedly working to host the existing reports, scientists and environmental groups have expressed alarm, fearing the action will impede access to vital information and could be a precursor to replacing the assessment with misinformation.</p>

          <h2>A Look Back at the Unsettling Artistry of Nuclear Test Photography</h2>

          <p>The article reflects on the 2003 book "100 Suns" by Michael Light, which compiled declassified government photographs of U.S. nuclear weapons tests conducted between 1945 and 1962. These images, captured by military photographers, served as both scientific records and propaganda, but also possess a disconcerting artistic quality, depicting surreal, man-made fireballs against desolate landscapes. The author notes that after the 1963 Test Ban Treaty moved detonations underground, this visceral public record of the government's activities vanished. This left citizens without a powerful visual reminder of the destructive power being developed in their name.</p>

          <p>Celebrating its 25th anniversary, the "Dora the Explorer" franchise continues to evolve with a new live-action film, "Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado." The article explores the character's legacy as a trailblazer for Latino representation in media, which began in 2000 amid a political climate often hostile to bilingualism. Creators recall how they intentionally made the character a pan-Latina hero who used Spanish as a "superpower" to solve problems, empowering a generation of young viewers. The franchise's enduring appeal is highlighted by its expansion into new animated series and the influence it has had on a new generation of actors and creators.</p>

          <p>A new Republican reconciliation package signed into law by President Trump includes substantial cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. According to an analysis by the Urban Institute, the legislation will cause 22.3 million families to lose some or all of their benefits, with an average loss of $146 per month for those most affected. The changes include expanding work requirements to older individuals and parents of teenagers, which could disqualify even working families who fail to meet new administrative hurdles. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the changes represent the largest cut to SNAP in history. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A dispatch from the federal building at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City provides a firsthand account of immigration enforcement tactics. The article describes how federal agents coordinate to detain asylum seekers immediately after they exit their immigration hearings.

The scene is depicted as tense and efficient, with one detained migrant observed shaking as he was surrounded by agents.

          <p>A specific, seemingly minor clause within the new Republican tax-and-spending law could effectively eliminate the profession of gambling in the United States. The article from The Economist explains that while the full effects of the sprawling legislation are still being analyzed, this particular provision is poised to have a devastating impact on individuals who make their living from gambling. The change targets the financial structures and tax considerations that have historically made professional gambling a viable, if risky, career. This unexpected consequence highlights the far-reaching and sometimes hidden impacts of major legislative packages on niche industries and professions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva argues that abandoning globalization and multilateral institutions in response to current world crises would be a grave mistake. He contends that the international order is failing due to the illegal use of force by powerful nations, the hollowing out of trade organizations, and a failure to address global inequality and climate change. Lula asserts that these institutions are ineffective because they no longer reflect global realities, not because they are inherently flawed. He calls for rebuilding multilateralism on fairer, more inclusive foundations to address humanity's shared challenges.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has proposed barring foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits in the UK, calling the current welfare bill a "ticking time bomb." The proposal would require individuals to become British citizens before accessing such support, with exceptions for those covered by international agreements. Badenoch accused the Labour party of ignoring rising costs, while also criticizing Reform UK's plan to scrap the two-child benefit cap. The plan highlights a key dividing line on welfare reform, as the current government recently watered down its own proposed cuts to disability benefits after a significant backlash.</p>

          <p>Economist Dean Spears, co-author of "After the Spike," makes the case that the world should be concerned about falling birth rates and a future of depopulation. He argues that a larger, or at least stable, population fosters greater progress, as more people contribute to the collective knowledge and innovation that improves life for everyone. The article explains that Spears rejects both alarmism and the conservative argument for a return to traditional gender roles as a solution. Instead, he advocates for a careful, long-term conversation about creating a society that better supports parenting for all, making it easier for people to choose to have children.</p>
