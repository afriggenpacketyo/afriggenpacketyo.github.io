        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a spokesperson, former President Joe Biden's last prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test, a common screening method for prostate cancer, was conducted in 2014, which is consistent with medical recommendations for men over 70. Current guidelines suggest that men aged 55 to 69 should discuss the pros and cons of PSA testing with their doctors, while those 70 and older are generally advised against it due to the risk of false positives. The article notes that medical experts emphasize that PSA screenings are not foolproof and can produce false positives or negatives, sparking debate about their appropriate use. Biden's representatives revealed that doctors discovered a small nodule in his prostate during a routine physical last week.</p>

          <p>As talks between Iran and the United States progress, the possibility of Washington investing in Iran if sanctions are lifted presents a complex geopolitical situation. While Iran is open to US investors, this willingness is conditional, particularly tied to complete sanctions relief, with concerns about economic espionage and strategic concessions. Washington’s hesitation is compounded by China’s increasing economic and strategic cooperation with Tehran. The article suggests that if a nuclear framework stabilizes, phased US investment under regional mediation could emerge as a possibility, though any substantial economic opening would require approval from the US Congress.</p>

          <p>Some Americans are puzzled by how former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could have only recently learned that he had an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had already spread to his bones. Although guidelines advise against screening after age 70, experts say that even men who test diligently may develop an aggressive cancer after none was found at a recent checkup. Doctors explain that fast-growing and aggressive prostate cancers can suddenly spring up between screenings, and occasionally, aggressive prostate cancers arise without giving any hint of their presence on the PSA.</p>

However, populist-minded thinkers across the political spectrum think that there may be grounds for concern about price gouging.
