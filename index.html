          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from ICE detention in Louisiana after a federal judge granted bail, a decision criticized by the Department of Homeland Security. Khalil, a green card holder, had been in custody since March following his arrest in New York City. The judge's order supersedes an immigration judge's denial of asylum and order for continued detention. Khalil's attorney asserts that his detention was retaliatory for his pro-Palestinian activism and speech protected by the First Amendment, while the Department of Justice argued against the return of his green card. The terms of Khalil's release include surrendering his passport and restricting domestic travel, and he plans to hold a press conference in New York. The article reflects on the conflict between judicial and executive powers and the implications for national security, while also highlighting the personal impact on Khalil and his family. Optimism surrounding Khalil's release is tempered by the ongoing legal battles and political tensions.</p>

          <p>MLB has suspended Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts and San Diego Padres manager Mike Shildt for one game each following a bench-clearing incident during their game. Padres reliever Robert SuÃ¡rez received a three-game suspension for intentionally hitting Shohei Ohtani with a pitch. The incident was sparked after Dodgers pitcher Jack Little hit Fernando Tatis Jr. with a pitch, leading to Shildt's ejection. Tension had been building throughout the series, with Tatis being hit multiple times by Dodgers pitchers. The Padres won the game 5-3, but concerns remain about Tatis's health after the incident.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles and criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass for their sanctuary city policies, accusing them of encouraging violent protesters and endangering federal law enforcement. Vance claimed Newsom and Bass have made it "open season on federal law enforcement" and that the President is responding forcefully. He also incorrectly referred to Senator Alex Padilla as "JosÃ© Padilla" while commenting on Democratic lawmakers getting handcuffed. Padilla was recently removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference. Vance's visit underscores the ongoing tension between the Trump administration and California over immigration policies.</p>

The Canal and River Trust reports spending thousands of pounds to retrieve the bikes, with Nottingham being a particular hotspot.

Local groups and council members have been retrieving the bikes themselves, and Lime states that they are working with authorities to address the problem.</p>

          <p>The appropriateness of wearing shorts to work remains a debated topic as offices relax dress codes. While some companies allow shorts, especially during summer, others maintain a more formal standard, particularly for client-facing roles. Stylists recommend tailored shorts and advise monitoring colleagues' attire to gauge appropriateness. Some companies, like Santander, explicitly prohibit beachwear, while others, like We Are Social, embrace creative expression through clothing. The perception of shorts may also differ between men and women, and some individuals find shorts more comfortable than traditional office wear.</p>

          <p>Diplomatic efforts are underway to de-escalate the conflict between Israel and Iran, with President Trump setting a two-week window for a resolution. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva, where he expressed Iran's readiness to consider diplomacy. However, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's approval is needed for any breakthrough, and the ongoing Israeli airstrikes and cyber attacks are complicating the process. Several countries have offered to host direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran, though Trump has expressed frustration with Iran's lack of engagement in negotiations.</p>

          <p>Former colleagues of Zia Yusuf, the former chairman of Reform UK, have described his leadership style as demanding and lacking empathy, drawing parallels to his previous role as CEO of Velocity Black. Some Reform employees found it difficult to work with Yusuf's "Goldman Sachs-like mentality," while Velocity Black employees cited issues such as controlling behavior and harsh sackings. Yusuf's abrupt departure and return to Reform also mirrored a similar break at Velocity. Despite criticisms, some acknowledged Yusuf's vision and ability to raise money, while others questioned whether Reform had adequately assessed his leadership qualities before his appointment. Yusuf denies these claims.</p>

The judge stated that American Oversight failed to prove that the agencies' recordkeeping programs were inadequate or that the court could provide redress for already-deleted messages.

The article explores the rise of romance fiction, particularly romantasy, and its appeal to young women, with tropes like "enemies to lovers" and a focus on female pleasure driving sales. Despite commercial growth, attitudes towards the genre remain derisive, particularly towards "spicy" titles. Some industry experts believe sexism keeps the genre from the mainstream, while others note changing attitudes due to the economic force of romance readers. The rise in sales is a positive sign.</p>

          <h2>NATO Summit Dominated by Concerns Over Trump's Views</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is largely shaped by concerns about President Trump's views on defense spending and the alliance itself. Secretary General Mark Rutte is aiming to secure a commitment from European allies to increase their defense spending, a key demand of Trump. The summit will be shorter than usual, reportedly due to Trump's preferences, and will focus on areas of agreement to avoid highlighting divisions. While some European nations are increasing their defense spending, driven by both Trump's pressure and concerns about Russia, many will struggle to meet the new targets. The summit is an effort to appease Trump and maintain the alliance's unity despite differing views on trade, Russia, and the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A report from Israel's N12 news outlet claims that Israeli operatives used a secret weapon to simultaneously kill nine top Iranian nuclear scientists in their beds as part of Operation Narnia. The operation was launched during the opening salvo of Operation Rising Lion. Israeli intelligence officials stated that killing the scientists was a crucial part of the operation, as their knowledge is irreplaceable. The report identifies the scientists who were allegedly killed. Israel has previously used unconventional methods to target Iranian nuclear scientists.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, over three months after his detention. Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested by ICE in March, sparking demonstrations. The government has not accused Khalil of a specific crime but invoked a rarely-used portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The judge expressed skepticism about the government's requests to keep Khalil detained, suggesting his arrest was related to his protests. Khalil's attorneys argued that his free speech rights were being violated, and his release comes with travel restrictions and the surrender of his passport.</p>

Sharp differences exist between Israeli and American assessments of Iran's nuclear capabilities, and Trump has expressed distrust for his own intelligence community. As Israel escalates attacks, analysts warn that Iran could use the talks to buy time or accelerate its nuclear program.

The film establishes a tense atmosphere of staged hospitality, with the delegation's movements and interactions carefully controlled.
