          <p>A significant power outage impacted Spain, Portugal, and parts of France on Monday, causing widespread disruptions to trains, airports, and other essential services. Energy authorities suspect a problem within the European grid led to the incident, though the exact cause remains unclear. Portuguese officials have ruled out a cyberattack, and investigations are ongoing to determine the source of the disruption in the European electricity grid. This event highlights the interconnectedness and potential vulnerabilities of the European power infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz is urging Princeton University to take action regarding a professor, Seyed Hossein Mousavian, accused of having allegiances to the Iranian regime, citing safety concerns for students amidst rising antisemitism. Mousavian, a Middle East security and nuclear policy specialist, faces scrutiny over his past support for U.S.-designated terrorist groups and alleged involvement in the assassination of Iranian dissidents. Cruz and others argue that Mousavian's presence at Princeton provides a platform for anti-American propaganda and endangers students, while the university president has remained silent on the matter.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old driver was sentenced to two years in a youth offenders institution for causing the deaths of three teenagers in a car crash near Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire. Edward Spencer, who had a history of "showing off" while driving, admitted to causing the deaths by careless driving after the crash in April 2023, just six weeks after passing his test. The court heard that Spencer was speeding at 64mph before the crash and social media videos revealed his reckless driving habits. The victims' families are advocating for graduated driver licensing and black box technology to improve young driver safety.</p>

          <p>Cicadas are expected to emerge in large numbers across the eastern United States in the spring of 2025, with Brood XIV being the primary group to appear. The emergence will likely be concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, with smaller pockets in other states like Georgia, Illinois, and Virginia. These periodical cicadas emerge when the soil reaches 64 degrees Fahrenheit, typically in late April or May, and remain above ground for 4 to 6 weeks. The interactive map created by CBS News' data team, using information from the University of Connecticut's Cicada Project, shows the predicted locations of the cicada emergence.</p>

Concerns over Trump's aggressive trade policies, which investors fear will lead to inflation and recession, have contributed to the market downturn.

          <p>Quinn Slobodian argues that the obsession with IQ within MAGA circles and among tech leaders in Silicon Valley is misguided, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence. The emphasis on IQ, historically used to measure educational outcomes and find an elite, may become irrelevant as AI automates many white-collar jobs. Slobodian suggests this focus on hardwired intelligence overlooks the potential for early interventions and standardized outcomes, potentially leading to a future where the value of IQ diminishes in the face of AI's capabilities.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that President Trump's first 100 days are perceived as bringing significant changes, but with too much emphasis on tariffs. While his supporters remain loyal, others believe his policies are not adequately addressing inflation. Approval ratings on the economy and inflation have declined, although his deportation program continues to receive majority approval. The poll highlights a partisan divide, with MAGA Republicans holding a more positive outlook on the economy and prioritizing immigration, while Democrats express frustration and disapproval.</p>
