          <p>A man in his 40s has died and a woman of the same age is hospitalized after both sustained gunshot wounds in Clissold Park, north London. The Metropolitan Police were called to the scene on Wednesday evening and have described it as a "deeply distressing" but isolated incident. Investigators believe the two individuals were known to each other and have recovered a firearm, stating there is no wider risk to the public. The park remains closed as the investigation continues and authorities work to contact the victims' relatives.</p>

He is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to discuss trade, the war in Gaza, and Ukraine. Meanwhile, First Lady Melania Trump continued royal engagements, joining Queen Camilla for a tour of the famous Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House. The visit marks an unprecedented second state visit for a U.S. president, which Trump described as one of the highest honors of his life.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to visit Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Madrid, with European political and security issues on the agenda. A potential point of contention is their differing approaches to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While both leaders have criticized Israel's military operations in Gaza, Spain has taken a more proactive stance, joining a genocide case at the International Court of Justice and imposing an arms embargo. Germany has so far resisted imposing sanctions, creating a notable policy divergence as the wider European Union considers its own measures against Israel.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced £150 billion in investment commitments from U.S. firms, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. This initiative, aimed at creating over 7,600 jobs, includes major pledges from companies like Blackstone, Microsoft, and Google to deepen economic ties between the two nations. The announcement comes as Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Trump are set to meet with investors to discuss economic deals. However, this positive development is contrasted by some pharmaceutical firms halting UK investments and concerns over slowing domestic business investment due to rising costs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's National Immigration Administration reported 15.89 million visa-free entries by foreign nationals between January and August, accounting for approximately two-thirds of all international arrivals. This growth is significantly driven by visitors from Southeast Asian countries. A key factor was the reciprocal visa-free agreement with Malaysia, which took effect in July and has since resulted in 150,000 visa-free trips by Malaysian passport holders.

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has appointed five new advisers to its influential vaccine committee, several of whom have publicly questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Public health experts have expressed alarm, noting that some new members have histories of promoting anti-vaccine rhetoric and unscientific claims, particularly regarding COVID-19 precautions. The committee is scheduled to vote on recommendations for the measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox (MMRV), hepatitis B, and COVID vaccines. Critics worry these appointments could lead to policies that restrict vaccine access and undermine public health during a time of ongoing measles outbreaks.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Sky's decision to suspend star player Angel Reese for publicly criticizing the team's roster has drawn significant backlash, highlighting what some see as a pattern of mismanagement. Reese, a two-time All-Star, was suspended for comments about the need for better players, a sentiment later echoed by the team's general manager. Critics argue the punishment was petty and out of step with league norms, feeding into online abuse directed at Reese. This incident is viewed as the latest in a series of missteps by a franchise that has historically struggled to retain top talent like Candace Parker and Elena Delle Donne.</p>

He has used player absences to give opportunities to new faces from MLS, several of whom have emerged as valuable roster additions. While the team's performance has been uneven, this period of tactical experimentation and roster expansion may ultimately position them for a stronger showing when it matters most.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being analyzed as part of a disturbing trend of violence inspired by nihilistic and ironic online meme culture. The alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, engraved the bullet casings with ideologically inconsistent references to video games and internet in-jokes, which he reportedly called "mostly a big meme." Experts on internet culture suggest this act was not driven by a coherent political ideology but by a desire to perform for a deeply online audience, mirroring other recent shootings. This phenomenon highlights a challenge for law enforcement and society in understanding motives that are detached from traditional political frameworks and rooted in digital subcultures.</p>

The new ordinance, effective May 2026, prohibits the sale of birds, fish, reptiles, and rabbits, building on a 2010 law that banned the sale of dogs and cats. Animal welfare groups like the SPCA and PETA praised the move, citing the often inhumane conditions in which animals are bred for retail.

The man's removal was halted after his lawyers made a last-minute claim that he was a victim of modern slavery. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood criticized the move as an attempt to "frustrate a removal" and vowed to fight such claims, while the UK's anti-slavery commissioner expressed concern over her rhetoric.

The crash, which resulted in 260 fatalities, is alleged to have been caused by a faulty fuel cutoff switch on the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. The complaint argues that the switch's design and placement made it susceptible to being inadvertently turned off, leading to a loss of engine thrust during takeoff. The lawsuit claims both companies were aware of this risk, citing a 2018 FAA caution about similar mechanisms on other Boeing aircraft.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times is being viewed by First Amendment experts as a strategic move to intimidate and silence critical press coverage. The lawsuit targets three articles and a book concerning Trump's finances. Legal analysts suggest the case may be dismissed under anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) laws, which are designed to protect free speech from frivolous litigation intended to create a chilling effect. The high bar for a public figure to prove "actual malice" in a defamation case makes such lawsuits difficult to win, indicating the primary goal may be to punish journalists through the legal process itself.</p>

          <h2>Record-High Beef Prices Driven by Dwindling Cattle Herds and Strong Demand</h2>

          <p>The price of ground beef in the U.S. has risen 51% since before the pandemic, reaching historic highs due to a confluence of supply and demand factors. The nation's beef cattle herd is at its smallest size in 75 years, a result of past droughts and high operating costs that have discouraged ranchers from expanding. While American demand for beef has remained strong, recent data suggests consumers are beginning to resist the high prices, with spending on ground beef starting to plateau. With the slow pace of herd repopulation, analysts expect beef to remain in short supply and prices to stay elevated for the foreseeable future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge's ruling in the government's antitrust case against Google has attempted to address the company's monopoly in internet search without stifling its ability to compete in the emerging field of artificial intelligence. The penalties bar Google from making exclusive deals to be the default search engine but stop short of forcing a divestment of its Chrome browser. Some policy experts are concerned the remedies are too weak, as Google's vast search data provides a significant advantage in developing AI. The case highlights the challenge of applying century-old antitrust laws to the rapidly evolving technology landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the formation of a federal task force, including the National Guard, to be sent to Memphis, Tennessee, to combat crime. This move, supported by the state's Republican governor but not the city's Democratic mayor, follows similar deployments in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Legal experts and civil liberties advocates express concern that this is normalizing the use of the military for domestic policing in non-emergency situations. Critics argue that such deployments test the limits of presidential power and are an inappropriate response to crime, which they say should be addressed through community-based solutions rather than military intervention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While foreign state-run media and influencers from Russia, China, and Iran are actively discussing the assassination of Charlie Kirk, their efforts appear to have minimal impact on the American conversation. Experts who monitor disinformation say that these campaigns are primarily spinning the event to fit their own domestic narratives, such as blaming Ukraine or mocking U.S. instability. Although Utah's governor warned of foreign bots encouraging violence, analysis shows that the toxic online discourse surrounding the shooting is overwhelmingly homegrown. Researchers caution, however, that the U.S. is less equipped than ever to monitor such campaigns due to the dismantling of relevant government task forces.</p>

          <p>An influential CDC advisory committee is meeting to discuss key vaccine policies, including recommendations for fall COVID-19 boosters and the hepatitis B vaccine for infants. The meeting is under intense scrutiny following the appointment of several members who have publicly questioned vaccine safety by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Public health experts are concerned that the committee could narrow recommendations for COVID shots or alter the long-standing policy of vaccinating newborns against hepatitis B. These changes could limit vaccine access and insurance coverage, potentially reversing decades of progress in preventing infectious diseases.</p>

          <p>Researchers analyzing the assassination of Charlie Kirk suggest the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, was primarily motivated by a desire for notoriety within online subcultures rather than a coherent political ideology. Evidence, including meme-laden engravings on bullet casings and post-shooting jokes about having a manifesto, points to an act of "performative violence." This behavior emulates a script developed around past mass shootings, where the focus is on generating discourse and being remembered. While Robinson expressed anger at Kirk's anti-trans rhetoric, experts argue his actions were more about performing for an online audience than advancing a specific political cause.</p>

The article profiles several individuals who are relocating to more welcoming states, facing job insecurity due to eroded workplace protections, and worrying about access to gender-affirming care. For example, one law student chose to pay $45,000 a year in out-of-state tuition in Minnesota rather than accept a nearly free scholarship in her home state of Indiana due to its hostile political climate.

Originally associated with anti-fascist partisans in Italy during World War II, the song has a complex history and has been adopted by various resistance and protest movements globally. Its recent popularization through the Netflix series "Money Heist" introduced it to a new generation. The song's appearance in this context highlights its evolution from a historical anthem of liberation to a flexible symbol of resistance in modern pop culture and political discourse.</p>
