          <p>Retail egg prices in the United States experienced a 12.7% decrease in April, falling to an average of $5.12 per dozen, according to the Consumer Price Index. This marks the first month-to-month decline since October 2024, offering consumers a slight reprieve from record-high prices. However, egg prices remain significantly elevated, sitting 79% higher than the same month a year earlier due to the persistent impact of bird flu outbreaks, which have led to the culling of millions of egg-laying hens. Outbreaks in Ohio and South Dakota in April alone affected over 927,000 hens, continuing to constrain the egg supply.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has introduced the "Invest America Act," proposing that the federal government provide a $1,000 seed investment in a private, tax-advantaged account for every American child at birth. The accounts would allow contributions from individuals, family, and businesses up to $5,000 annually, with investments placed in a low-cost fund tracking the S&P 500. Distributions after age 18 would be taxed at the capital gains rate. Cruz argues this initiative would give every child a stake in the American free enterprise system, though the proposal comes amid concerns about the U.S. national debt.</p>

          <h2>Economists Anticipate Inflation Re-Acceleration Amid Trump's Trade War</h2>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses economists' concerns about inflation re-accelerating as companies adapt to President Trump's trade war. While U.S. inflation cooled slightly in April to 2.3%, economists warn this may be a temporary lull before prices surge due to import taxes. The report notes that the Trump administration has agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs with China, but economists still expect tariffs to stoke inflation while denting growth. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation, prioritizing the stability of long-term inflation expectations.</p>

          <p>A federal court is hearing arguments in a case challenging President Donald Trump's tariffs, marking the first time his economic agenda has been legally scrutinized. The U.S. Court of International Trade will consider whether Trump exceeded his power by enacting tariffs on over 180 countries. The lawsuit, filed by domestic businesses, argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the president to issue such sweeping duties. The Department of Justice contends that IEEPA "clearly" authorizes the president to impose tariffs.</p>

          <p>This article discusses Germany's decision to label the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as "extremist," making it eligible for surveillance and a potential ban. The author argues that banning a party with nearly a quarter of the seats in Parliament undermines democracy by removing the judgment from the ballot. They suggest that the proper solution is political, with other parties addressing popular discontent over immigration instead of letting the AfD dominate the issue. The author concludes that the AfD is now too big to ban without undermining the will of many Germans.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April rose 2.3% on an annual basis, slightly less than economists expected, but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

          <p>This New York Times article discusses President Trump's trade policies and his claims that China needs America more than America needs China. The article notes that Trump has recently cut tariffs on China, suggesting that America's reliance on global trade diminishes his negotiating position. Retailers warned that prices would rise and shelves would go empty. Markets tumbled. In the meantime, tariffs remain much higher than they were before Trumpâ€™s second term, and prices on clothes, appliances, video game consoles and everything else made in other countries will likely rise as a result.</p>
