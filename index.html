          <p>Baidu's stock price surged following the release of two new, free-to-use AI models.  These models, including an updated Ernie model and a reasoning model, aim to regain Baidu's leading position in China's AI market. The stock jump is seen as a delayed reaction to the models' release and Baidu's shift towards an open-source strategy.</p>

          <p>Baidu, once a leader in China's generative AI, is striving to regain its position. The release of two new free-to-use AI models reflects this effort, but experts highlight Baidu's challenges in keeping up with competitors like DeepSeek and the slow adoption of its Ernie bot.  Baidu's shift towards open-source models is a key part of its strategy.</p>
