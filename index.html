          <p>The Bank of England has maintained the UK's interest rates at 4.25%, but suggested potential cuts as early as August amid persistent inflation exceeding the Bank's target rate. Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned about global unpredictability, citing concerns over the Israel-Iran conflict's impact on energy costs and overall prices. While marginally raising expectations for the UK economy, the Bank acknowledged underlying growth as weak and noted signs of softening in the labor market. Susannah Streeter from Hargreaves Lansdown indicated that the possibility of two interest rate cuts this year remains viable, offering potential relief for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's pursuit of a global leadership role is reportedly impacting its relationships with neighboring countries in South Asia, as economic instability and political fragility threaten the region. Despite the Neighborhood First Policy aimed at improving regional ties, some experts suggest India's foreign policy is primarily focused on the US, Europe, and East Asia. Hostilities between India and Pakistan have stalled the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), hindering economic integration. Experts suggest that India's unilateral approach to regional issues and perceived diplomacy of domination have fueled resentment, while China expands its influence through economic and strategic partnerships.</p>

          <p>International calls for restraint appear to be unheeded as the world anticipates an escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, with the US potentially considering direct military action against Iran. The Kremlin warned that US intervention would trigger a "terrible spiral of escalation," while the UK government convened an emergency Cobra meeting. Diplomatic prospects appear increasingly bleak as both Iran and Israel exchange increasingly lethal blows. President Trump remained ambiguous about potential US involvement, stating that the next week would be significant and that he prefers to make decisions at the last moment, particularly concerning war.</p>

          <p>The future of HPV vaccination in the United States is now uncertain after the nationâ€™s health secretary dismissed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and replaced them with individuals who have spread misinformation about vaccines or have been involved in litigation against vaccine manufacturers. The ACIP was expected to vote on whether to recommend a single dose of the HPV vaccine and whether to strengthen recommendations that advise vaccination starting at 9 years of age. Some of the new members appear to have a bias against HPV immunization, raising concerns that they may soften existing guidelines or even advise the CDC to remove the vaccine recommendations for certain groups. Experts worry that this could erode public trust in vaccines.</p>

Clinical trials demonstrated nearly 100% effectiveness in preventing HIV and superiority to daily oral medications. Lenacapavir uses a multi-stage approach, distinguishing it from other antivirals by inhibiting HIV at multiple stages of its lifecycle, making it a significant breakthrough in the fight against the HIV epidemic.</p>

While energy companies will fund the discount, the government aims to offset potential bill increases through savings from cutting energy companies' expenditure and addressing problem debt.

The US is home to 23.8 million millionaires, an increase of 1.5% from the previous year, driven by a strong performance on Wall Street and a stable US dollar. However, the first six months of 2025 have been more volatile due to trade war concerns and recession fears, impacting the dollar. UBS economist James Mazeau suggests it is too early to determine if US household wealth growth will slow, noting that a weaker dollar could spur wealth growth in countries with non-dollar currencies.</p>

Pashinyan also accused other senior clergymen of immoral behavior, leading to condemnation from opposition parties and former presidents.

          <p>A US senator, Mike Lee, posted controversial comments on social media following a shooting in Minnesota that involved two state lawmakers and their spouses. Lee's posts, which have since been removed, attributed the incident to "Marxists" and appeared to blame the Minnesota governor. Critics have condemned Lee's remarks as divisive and harmful, accusing him of using a tragedy to stoke political fears. The senator's actions have sparked debate about the role of political leaders in responding to national tragedies and the impact of social media on political discourse.</p>

          <p>Samsung is planning to release a thinner version of its flagship foldable smartphone to compete with Chinese rivals like Honor and Oppo, who have released thinner and lighter devices. Slimness has become a critical factor in the foldable phone market, as consumers are less willing to compromise on thickness and weight for the larger screen real estate. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that Apple plans to enter the foldable market starting next year. While the market for foldable phones remains small, accounting for just 2% of the overall smartphone market, thinner designs may attract more consumers.</p>

He proposes building "Scientist AI," a non-autonomous system designed to predict and block potentially harmful actions by other AIs. Scientist AI would act as a guardrail, assessing the moral acceptability of an AI agent's actions and preventing those deemed harmful, with the goal of ensuring AI remains aligned with human values.</p>
