          <h2>Swedish Defense Firm Saab Reports Significant Profit and Sales Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 07:05:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swedish defense contractor Saab announced a substantial 49% year-on-year increase in its second-quarter operating income, surpassing analyst expectations. The company's sales also grew by 30%, leading to a more than 14% surge in its share price. This performance reflects a broader trend of increased defense spending across Europe, with NATO members raising their targets and the EU proposing a larger budget for security. In response to high market demand, Saab has raised its full-year sales growth forecast, capitalizing on what its CEO described as a dramatic ramp-up in the European defense market.

          <p>American rap icon Snoop Dogg has officially become a co-owner of the Welsh soccer team Swansea City, joining the ownership group led by American businessmen Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen. The club, which currently plays in the second-tier EFL Championship, hopes the investment and Snoop's massive social media following will boost its global profile and revenue. In a statement, Snoop Dogg expressed his connection to the club's "underdog" spirit, likening it to his own story. This move follows a trend of celebrity ownership in Welsh soccer, notably Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney's successful investment in Wrexham AFC.</p>

          <h2>Social Media Debates Relationship Expectations After Man Refuses Girlfriend's Shopping Request</h2>

          <p>A man's Reddit post about refusing to stop at the store for his girlfriend's kombucha after his 12-hour workday has ignited a debate online about relationship dynamics and expectations. He explained that his girlfriend, who works fewer hours, often asks him to run errands for items she forgot, making him feel like "the bad guy" for saying no. Commenters were divided, with some arguing he should make the small effort and others sympathizing with his exhaustion after a long shift. A psychiatrist interviewed for the article suggested the girlfriend's requests might be a way of seeking reassurance of his love and care.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors highlight the importance of establishing clear policies for family offices and businesses that employ family members to avoid potential conflicts and operational issues. Using the example of Sargento Foods, the article suggests implementing formal requirements, such as outside work experience and objective performance goals, to ensure family employees earn their positions. Without such structures, family businesses risk high turnover among non-family executives and difficult situations when underperforming relatives need to be managed or terminated. Establishing these professional standards helps ensure the business remains competitive and well-managed for the long term.</p>

          <p>Democrats are strategically amplifying the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's failure to release the "Epstein files," despite promises to do so. This political maneuver aims to create a rift within the Republican base, as many of Trump's own supporters and right-wing influencers are now echoing the demands for transparency. The article argues this is a politically astute move for Democrats, as it capitalizes on public distrust and Trump's contradictory statements on the matter. It effectively puts Trump on the defensive with his own voters over his perceived protection of powerful individuals, a narrative Democrats are weaving into a broader case of broken promises.</p>

While reaffirming Germany's commitment to Israel's right to self-defense, he also noted his government does not support Israeli settlement policy.

After his administration promised to release documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's alleged co-conspirators, it has now reversed course, claiming no such "client list" exists. This pivot has alienated key right-wing figures and a portion of his base, who view it as a betrayal and a cover-up.

The severe weather is expected to move north into Scotland over the weekend.

          <p>Health insurance premiums on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces are projected to increase by an average of 15% next year, with some plans rising by 20% or more, according to a new KFF analysis. Experts attribute this record-setting pace to the Republican-passed budget bill that allows enhanced ACA subsidies to expire in 2025. The lapse of these subsidies, which had significantly expanded coverage, is expected to cause healthier individuals to drop their plans, leaving a costlier patient pool for insurers. This shift, combined with rising medical service prices, is driving up costs for millions of Americans who purchase their own insurance. (not investment advice)</p>

John Sarcone III was set to be removed as interim U.S. attorney, but the Justice Department has now named him "special attorney to the attorney general," granting him the same powers without a time limit. This move bypasses the traditional Senate confirmation process and has drawn criticism for circumventing oversight. Sarcone has faced scrutiny over his residency qualifications and for providing a disputed account of being threatened by an undocumented immigrant, which was contradicted by surveillance footage.</p>

          <p>The Texas Legislature is meeting for a special session to redraw the state's congressional map, a move pushed by President Trump's political team to bolster the Republican majority in the U.S. House. The current map, established after the 2020 Census, is already being challenged in court for allegedly diluting the power of non-White voters. Now, the Trump administration's Justice Department is alleging that four Democratic-held districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders that must be redrawn. Critics argue the mid-decade redistricting is a purely political maneuver that is legally risky and could backfire on Republicans in a state with rapidly changing demographics.

          <p>In a podcast interview, veteran pollster Frank Luntz discusses the deep-seated anger and distrust that he believes has been eroding American democracy for over two decades. He traces the origin of the current political crisis back to the 2000 presidential election, arguing that subsequent economic hardships and a sense of betrayal fueled a political environment ripe for a figure like Donald Trump. Luntz expresses profound concern over the current state of division, where citizens no longer want to listen to each other. He suggests that restoring democracy requires new leadership from outside the political mainstream and a renewed focus on core values like truth and freedom.</p>

While defending Harvard against unprecedented federal pressure, including threats to pull billions in funding, he has also initiated internal reforms to promote viewpoint diversity and restore open inquiry.

          <p>A new analysis explores the seemingly contradictory future economic scenarios of a world with too few workers due to declining birthrates and one with too few jobs due to AI automation. Research from Vanguard's chief global economist suggests that long-term economic growth is more closely tied to innovation than to population size, pointing to historical periods of high growth during slow population increases. However, whether AI will provide the necessary productivity boost to offset an aging workforce remains uncertain. Experts are divided, with some predicting transformative gains while others foresee only modest impacts, highlighting the profound uncertainty surrounding how these two major trends will ultimately interact and shape the global economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's goal to hire 10,000 new ICE officers and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents faces significant challenges, according to experts and historical precedent. A similar hiring surge during Trump's first term fell short due to difficulties in recruiting enough qualified applicants and long hiring times. Experts note that recruiting for law enforcement is currently difficult nationwide, and past rapid hiring sprees have sometimes led to lowered standards and increased corruption cases. To meet the aggressive targets, the administration may need to rely on contractors, military personnel, or expand programs that deputize local law enforcement, raising further legal and logistical concerns.</p>
