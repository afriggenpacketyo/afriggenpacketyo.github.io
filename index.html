          <p>The Senate approved a budget resolution championed by Republicans, setting the stage for making President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and increasing the debt ceiling. The move was largely along party lines, with some Republicans expressing reservations about the budget's mechanisms. Democrats criticized the framework, arguing that it favors the wealthy and undermines social safety nets. The budget would address border funding for the Trump administration as well as extend the hallmark tax cuts Trump passed in 2017.</p>

          <p>President Trump's implementation of widespread tariffs has sparked global alarm and comparisons to Brexit, marking a significant shift in US trade policy. Trump has long advocated for tariffs, arguing they will revitalize the US economy and generate revenue. However, many economists and businesses fear the tariffs will harm consumers and disrupt global trade. The move has been met with criticism and skepticism, with some drawing parallels to the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and its role in exacerbating the Great Depression.</p>
