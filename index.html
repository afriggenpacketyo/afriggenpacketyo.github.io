          <p>Manchester United is evaluating the future of forward Alejandro Garnacho, whose performance has declined since scoring against Manchester City earlier in the season. Initially a key player, Garnacho faced disciplinary issues and has struggled to maintain his scoring form, raising questions about his long-term role with the club. Manager Ruben Amorim initially dropped Garnacho due to perceived issues with his attitude, but has since reinstated him. Despite this, Garnacho's contributions have diminished, leading to fan discussions about whether the club should sell or continue to support the young player's development.</p>

          <p>With Trump's tariffs threatening global trade, Britain is advised to collaborate with the G7 (excluding the US), the EU, and Asia to uphold a rules-based global trading system. Mark Carney, potentially the next Canadian prime minister, is seen as pivotal in constructing a new global trade order. Steps include associating Canada with the EU as a privileged trade partner, extending this association to the Commonwealth, and imposing sanctions on selected US service exports. Britain is encouraged to increase defense spending and public investment to mitigate recession risks amidst Trump's economic policies.</p>

          <p>The PLA's Shandong aircraft carrier reportedly explored an alternative route east of Taiwan before a recent drill, possibly to train against American warships and discover new routes in case of a conflict. Instead of the wider waterways between Taiwan and the Philippines, the Shandong went through the Philippine archipelago's narrower waterways. Analysts suggest this could give the PLA southbound options to approach the western Pacific through the Bashi Channel. The Shandong conducted joint exercises with naval and aerial units southeast of Taiwan, highlighting China's strategic military maneuvers in the region.</p>
