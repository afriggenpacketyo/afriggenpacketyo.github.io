        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury Secretary has accused India of engaging in financial "arbitrage" by purchasing discounted Russian crude oil, refining it, and then reselling the finished products to global markets, including Europe. This practice is described as profiteering from the sanctions imposed on Moscow following the war in Ukraine. In response, the U.S. administration has implemented additional tariffs on Indian exports to discourage the country from continuing these transactions. The move highlights growing international economic pressure related to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A local council in Epping, England, has successfully obtained a High Court injunction to stop a hotel from being used to house asylum seekers, mandating their removal by September 12th. The legal action followed weeks of large protests and rising community tensions after an asylum seeker residing at the hotel was charged with the sexual assault of a teenager. The Home Office expressed concern that the ruling could significantly impact its nationwide capacity to house asylum seekers. The council leader cited the need to de-escalate the volatile situation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Secretary announced a new policy requiring Intel to provide the government with a non-voting equity stake in exchange for funds from the CHIPS Act. This marks a shift from the previous administration's approach of providing direct grants, with the new strategy aiming to ensure that American taxpayers see a return on the investment. The administration suggests this model could be applied to other recipients of CHIPS Act funding as well. The news caused Intel's shares to climb amid discussions of further government involvement to bolster domestic chip manufacturing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is facing criticism over its use of the term "scientifically justifiable" as a criterion for funding, a standard that critics argue is vague and politically motivated. This policy has led to the abrupt defunding of hundreds of studies, particularly those focused on health disparities, race, and gender identity. Opponents claim the phrase lacks formal criteria and serves as a tool for censorship, allowing the administration to eliminate entire fields of research while claiming to uphold scientific rigor. The move has created significant turmoil within the scientific community.</p>

          <p>Shares of Viking Therapeutics fell by over 40% after the company released midstage trial data for its oral obesity drug that failed to meet investor expectations. The results showed lower efficacy and higher rates of patient discontinuation due to side effects like nausea and vomiting compared to competing drugs from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. This outcome is a significant setback for Viking, diminishing its prospects as a major competitor in the lucrative weight-loss drug market and reinforcing the dominance of the market's current leaders.</p>

          <p>In a rare departure from federal health guidance, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued a strong recommendation for COVID-19 vaccinations for children aged 6 months to 2 years. This contrasts with the CDC's current position, which states that healthy children of any age may receive the shot in consultation with a doctor but does not broadly recommend it. The AAP emphasized that its recommendations are based on science aimed at protecting the health of children, highlighting a growing rift in public health messaging.</p>

          <p>A Southern California family with twin boys has formed a deep bond with a "surrogate grandmother" they met through a Facebook group called Surrogate Grandparents USA. The arrangement filled a void for both the family, whose biological grandparents were not actively involved, and the woman, whose own children did not plan on having kids. The relationship has blossomed over two years, with "Nana J" becoming an integral part of the family's life, joining them on trips and for holidays, showcasing how unconventional connections can create a strong sense of community.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department for imposing new immigration-related conditions on federal grants for crime victim services. The lawsuit argues that withholding these critical funds, which support crisis centers and advocacy programs, unless jurisdictions cooperate with federal immigration agents is an unlawful overreach. The states contend that this policy forces them to choose between essential victim support and their established "sanctuary" policies, ultimately harming community trust and safety.</p>

While national average yields for CDs are modest, online banks are providing significantly more competitive rates, particularly for short-term CDs of one year or less. This phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, means savers can currently lock in higher returns on shorter-term investments.

          <p>Apple is reportedly expanding its iPhone manufacturing capacity in India as the U.S. government applies economic pressure on the country over its continued purchases of Russian oil. The expansion involves new and existing plants operated by partners like the Tata Group and Foxconn. This move is consistent with Apple's long-term strategy to diversify its supply chain beyond China, a process accelerated by recent geopolitical and trade tensions. By increasing its Indian production, Apple may also be positioning itself to navigate the complex trade dynamics between the U.S. and its partners.</p>

The letter was a gesture of gratitude for Mrs. Trump's efforts to raise awareness about the thousands of Ukrainian children who Kyiv says have been forcibly abducted by Russia. This act of soft diplomacy aims to highlight the severe humanitarian impact of the war and engage influential figures in the cause of reuniting these children with their families.</p>

          <p>According to reports, Nvidia is developing a new artificial intelligence chip for the Chinese market that would be more powerful than its current, export-restricted H20 model. This development follows a recent agreement where Nvidia and AMD consented to give the U.S. government a 15% share of their sales in China in exchange for permission to resume selling certain chips there. The move illustrates Nvidia's strategy to continue competing in the lucrative Chinese market while navigating the complex and evolving U.S. export control regulations.</p>

While concerns about Ukraine's long-term future persist, the leaders appear to be collectively supporting the U.S.-led peace initiative, which aims to strengthen Ukraine's position ahead of any potential negotiations with Russia.</p>

          <p>Travelers across the United Kingdom are being warned to expect significant delays over the upcoming bank holiday weekend due to a convergence of factors. An estimated 17.6 million car journeys are anticipated, leading to heavy traffic congestion, particularly in the south of England. Compounding the issue, extensive engineering works will close several major rail lines, and a strike by the RMT union is set to halt services on CrossCountry trains on Saturday.

          <p>During Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to the White House, body language experts noted that President Trump's physical gestures conveyed a sense of dominance and control. Actions such as a power fist pump, pulling Zelenskyy closer during handshakes, and patronizing touches were interpreted as non-verbal assertions of authority. In response, Zelenskyy employed subtle countermeasures, like placing his hand atop Trump's during a handshake, to signal resistance. The analysis reveals a complex and tense power dynamic that played out between the two leaders beyond their spoken words.</p>
