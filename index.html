          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has determined that Iran is not meeting its nuclear non-proliferation obligations, marking the first such instance in two decades. The IAEA's board of governors passed a resolution addressing Iran's lack of cooperation and concerns regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities. This action raises the possibility of referring the matter to the UN Security Council. Iran's foreign minister previously cautioned against supporting the resolution, warning of a strong response from Iran.</p>

          <p>A state of emergency was declared in Spokane, Washington, after protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) led to unrest and violations of a city-imposed curfew.

City officials emphasized the importance of upholding First Amendment rights while maintaining public safety.

          <p>Top European business leaders are encouraging the continent to capitalize on recent market volatility, hoping that the United States' economic dominance is diminishing. They point to Europe's Stoxx 600 outperforming the S&P 500 since late 2024, coupled with capital inflows into European stocks and outflows from U.S. equities. Factors contributing to this shift include converging growth rates and cheaper valuations in Europe. However, trade tensions between the EU and the U.S. remain a potential challenge, though leaders are optimistic about finding a resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

The latest GDP figures revealed a contraction of 0.3% in April, highlighting the challenges the government faces. The success of this Spending Review hinges on its ability to stimulate and sustain economic growth.</p>

          <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a warning that some Jolly Rancher sweets are unsafe to eat due to the presence of mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) and mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH). These chemical compounds are not compliant with UK laws and could potentially damage DNA and increase the risk of cancer if consumed regularly over time. The FSA advises consumers to avoid buying and selling the affected products, which include Jolly Rancher Hard Candy, Jolly Rancher 'Misfits' Gummies, Jolly Rancher Hard Candy Fruity 2 in 1, and Jolly Ranchers Berry Gummies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended a performance of 'Les MisÃ©rables' at the Kennedy Center, which he recently took control of, against the backdrop of ongoing protests in Los Angeles. The musical's themes of revolution and social injustice contrasted sharply with Trump's actions, including sending troops to quell immigration protests. The evening was marked by a mix of cheers and boos, as well as cultural ignorance from Trump's allies. Trump's appearance was intended to boost fundraising for the Kennedy Center, but it also highlighted the cultural divide in Washington.</p>

          <p>A former nuclear cruise missile launch site in Okinawa, built during the U.S. military occupation, has been opened to the public, revealing a dark legacy. The Mace B cruise missile launch site is the last remaining of four constructed in the 1960s. The United States deployed nuclear weapons on Okinawa during the Cold War despite anti-nuclear sentiment in Japan. The site, now owned by Soka Gakkai, serves as a reminder of the past presence of nuclear weapons in Okinawa and the potential threats they posed.</p>

          <p>Despite promises to break the cycle of political retaliation, new South Korean President Lee Jae-myung has approved investigations into his predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, and his wife. Each of the previous six South Korean presidents has faced criminal investigations, often with disastrous consequences. Concerns are growing that Lee will use his power for his own gain, potentially undermining the country's political future. Lee himself has faced legal cases and allegations of corruption, and a retrial on election law violation charges has been delayed until after he leaves office.</p>
