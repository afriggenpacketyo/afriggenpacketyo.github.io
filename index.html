          <h2>Republicans Clash Over Clean Energy Tax Credits Affecting Alaskan Communities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 09:53:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article details the intraparty conflict among Republicans in Congress regarding the repeal of Biden-era clean energy tax credits, particularly concerning their impact on isolated Alaskan communities. For villages like Noatak, these tax credits are crucial for funding solar panel farms and reducing reliance on expensive diesel fuel flown in from afar, costing residents exorbitant amounts for electricity. Senator Lisa Murkowski is a key proponent of retaining these credits, emphasizing their importance for long-term energy projects and job creation in Alaska. The article highlights the financial struggles faced by Alaskans, who often have to choose between heating fuel and gasoline, and underscores the uncertainty caused by potential defunding of these credits, leaving renewable energy projects in limbo.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to attend two crypto-focused dinners this month, one a high-priced fundraiser and the other aimed at meme coin holders. The first event, costing $1.5 million per plate, is hosted by MAGA Inc. and features David Sacks. The second dinner offers access based on holdings of the $TRUMP token, with entry determined by a blockchain-based contest. Despite the hype, there are no guarantees of meeting Trump, and the event can be canceled, with attendees receiving a Trump NFT instead. The $TRUMP token has surged in value following the announcement, benefiting its creators who have already earned over $324 million in trading fees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Concerns are growing in Taiwan regarding the resilience of its energy grid in the event of a Chinese attack or blockade, as the island heavily relies on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG). Experts suggest energy facilities would be primary targets, potentially crippling the island's infrastructure and military capabilities. While some analysts estimate Taiwan could sustain itself for approximately 30 to 40 days under a blockade by rationing electricity and utilizing coal-fired generators, others advocate for increased investment in renewable energy sources like solar power. Calls are also emerging to restart the island's nuclear program to bolster energy security.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer (MLS) is experiencing a surge in sponsorships and stadium attendance, buoyed by the rising popularity of soccer in the U.S. and the arrival of Lionel Messi.

The upcoming 2026 World Cup, to be held in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, is also contributing to this growth. The article notes that MLS's fanbase is younger and more diverse, making it an attractive demographic for advertisers, though viewership metrics remain opaque due to exclusive streaming on Apple TV's MLS Season Pass.</p>

GM President Mark Reuss has spearheaded this effort, aiming to compete with luxury brands like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla. The strategy involves isolating Cadillac's products from GM's other brands and prioritizing value over volume, with a focus on bespoke vehicles like the $300,000 Celestiq. While Cadillac has seen success in North America, challenges remain in China, where sales have declined amid growing competition from domestic brands.</p>
