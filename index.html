          <p>Sarah A Boardman, the artist behind the official portrait of Donald Trump displayed at the Denver State Capitol Gallery of Presidents, states that Trump's public lambasting of her work is negatively impacting her business and jeopardizing its future. Trump described Boardman's picture as "truly the worst" in a post on Truth Social, adding that is had been distorted and the artist had lost her talent as she aged. The portrait was removed from the gallery. Boardman's statement reveals the tangible consequences of the former president's remarks on her professional life.</p>
