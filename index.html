          <p>An internal analysis by the Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency indicates its proposal to repeal greenhouse gas emission standards would lead to higher gasoline prices. Contradicting public claims of savings, the report cites data showing that disincentivizing electric and fuel-efficient vehicles would increase gasoline demand and prices. The analysis also projects that the policy change would result in the loss of approximately 450,000 jobs by 2035, along with lower fuel efficiency standards for new cars and trucks.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's executive order to hike tariffs on imports is expected to drive up consumer prices and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. The new duties, which set a baseline tariff of at least 15% for most countries, could cost the average American household over $2,000 annually. Economists warn that goods like appliances, furniture, cars, and clothing are likely to become more expensive as companies can no longer absorb the costs. The policy may also lead to fewer product choices and supply-chain delays.</p>

          <p>Paula Deen has suddenly closed The Lady and Sons, the iconic Savannah restaurant that launched her to fame over 25 years ago. The establishment, known for its classic Southern cuisine, was instrumental in her rise as a Food Network star. Deen announced the closure on her website, stating she and her sons would now focus on their Paula Deen's Family Kitchen franchise locations. The unannounced closure follows a pattern of other sudden shutdowns of Deen's restaurants over the years, including one in 2014.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, failed to secure an automatic qualifying spot for the U.S. Junior Ryder Cup team. After impressive rounds of 66 put him in contention near the top of the leaderboard at the Junior PGA Championship, he shot a final-round 74. He finished in a tie for ninth place, four strokes short of the qualifying position. While one captain's pick remains for the team, it is considered unlikely that Woods will be selected for the spot.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has escalated his criticism of the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, calling for other board members to seize control if Powell does not cut interest rates. In a series of social media posts, Trump labeled Powell a "stubborn MORON," breaking with the presidential tradition of respecting the central bank's political independence. The attacks came shortly before a lackluster jobs report was released, which Trump used to amplify his demands for lower rates to counteract the economic impact of his tariff policies.</p>

          <p>A tractor-trailer crash on Interstate 83 in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, resulted in a massive spill of hot dogs across the highway during Friday's morning rush hour. State police reported that the truck experienced a mechanical issue, causing it to strike another vehicle and rip open its trailer against a concrete divider. The spill led to significant traffic delays as cleanup crews dealt with the slippery franks covering the road. Four people sustained non-life-threatening injuries in the incident, and the spilled hot dogs were deemed unusable.</p>

          <p>A clinic in Buffalo, New York, named La Bodega, is achieving remarkable success in combating the U.S. hepatitis C epidemic, which affects millions. By providing treatment in a single visit using new FDA-approved testing machines, the clinic has cured about 98% of its more than 7,000 patients. This model offers a stark contrast to the national situation, where less than a third of those with the disease have been treated despite available cures. The clinic's success is now influencing bipartisan legislative efforts to create a national plan to eliminate the disease.</p>

The FAA also acknowledged its controller failed to warn the plane about the helicopter's proximity.

          <p>This opinion article critiques the Trump administration's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner as part of a broader war on objective data. The author satirically suggests that if numbers like economic reports, poll results, or even a person's weight are unfavorable, the administration's solution is to discard the source rather than address the reality. The piece argues that this approach creates a fog of misinformation, leaving policymakers and the public unable to identify or solve real problems, ultimately leading to a state of collective ignorance where feelings replace facts.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves at the trade deadline, acquiring right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase, along with versatile outfielder Alex Call. Manager Dave Roberts stated that the additions raise the team's overall floor as they head into the final months of the season. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage reliever, while Call provides a right-handed bat and solid on-base skills. The front office hopes these moves will complement improvements from the team's existing core of star players.</p>

          <p>A BBC feature explores the dynamics of cults and the challenges survivors face, drawing on the expertise of a psychotherapist who is herself a cult survivor. The article explains that cults can be non-religious and often use manipulation tactics like "love bombing" and creating an "us-versus-them" mentality. Red flags include promising simple answers to complex problems and erecting high barriers to exit. The piece calls for greater destigmatization and more specialized mental health support for those who leave such coercive groups.</p>

          <p>Social media giant ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok and Douyin, disclosed at an internal meeting that the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years. According to sources briefed on the meeting, about half of the firm's 120,000 employees have been with the company for over three years. The disclosure appears to counter online speculation of high turnover rates and suggests ByteDance is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry, especially after it abandoned the infamous "996" work culture in 2021.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S. for years. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's decision was motivated by racial animus and did not fully consider the current conditions in those countries, postponing the terminations until at least November.</p>
