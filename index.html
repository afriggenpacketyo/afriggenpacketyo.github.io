        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poland stated that Russian drones violated its airspace during an attack on Ukraine, prompting Poland and NATO allies to scramble warplanes, marking the first time a NATO country has engaged in such a response during the war. Prime Minister Donald Tusk condemned the incursion as an "act of aggression" and confirmed communication with NATO. A NATO spokesperson affirmed the deployment of Dutch fighter jets, confirming it was the first time NATO aircrafts have engaged potential threats in Allied airspace. Polish authorities are investigating the incident and have requested urgent talks under Article 4 of the NATO treaty, while Ukrainian President Zelenskyy called it a dangerous precedent for Europe. The article reflects escalating tensions and NATO's commitment to defending its territory. </p>

          <h2>Wholesale Prices Unexpectedly Decline in August</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 09:15:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that wholesale prices unexpectedly declined by 0.1% in August, offering potential relief for the Federal Reserve as it considers an upcoming interest rate cut. The producer price index (PPI), which measures input costs for goods and services, fell short of expectations, leading to gains in stock market futures and slightly negative Treasury yields. Futures market pricing indicates a high probability of an interest rate cut, though the Fed is closely monitoring inflation data. While inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, officials are hopeful that easing housing and wage pressures will gradually lower prices, though concerns remain regarding the potential inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs.

          <p>Analysts expressed astonishment at Oracle's revenue projections, particularly for its cloud infrastructure business, leading to a significant after-hours stock rally. The company anticipates substantial revenue growth in cloud infrastructure, projecting an increase from $10 billion to $18 billion this fiscal year, and further growth to $144 billion in the coming years. Oracle's remaining performance obligations soared, indicating strong contracted revenue, and analysts raised their estimates on the stock, with some calling for substantial upside. While Oracle faces competition from major cloud providers, its unique approach to data center infrastructure and substantial growth projections have generated considerable excitement among investors and analysts. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses current interest rates for HELOCs and home equity loans, noting that they are lower than many alternative borrowing products and are expected to decline further if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. As of September 9, 2025, average rates for 5-year home equity loans are 8.22%, 10-year loans are 8.37%, 15-year loans are 8.24%, and the average HELOC rate is 8.10%. HELOCs offer a revolving line of credit with variable interest rates, while home equity loans provide a lump sum with fixed interest rates, and both may offer tax benefits for IRS-eligible home improvements. Homeowners should carefully consider their needs and shop around to find the best rates and terms, considering that their home will function as collateral for either product.

          <p>Peter Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, anticipates the release of more "embarrassing" correspondence between himself and Jeffrey Epstein. This follows the release of documents including a letter where Mandelson called Epstein his "best pal", written over 20 years ago. Mandelson expressed regret over his friendship with Epstein and sympathy for his victims, likening the association to "an albatross around my neck". The Prime Minister defended Mandelson, stating he retained confidence in him and that he had repeatedly expressed his deep regret for his association with Epstein. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that investing in 1-ounce gold bars and coins this fall could be worthwhile, as prices are expected to keep rising due to global instability and potential interest rate changes. The premium on 1-ounce gold products is currently attractive, and gold can diversify and safeguard portfolios during uncertain times. Gold is largely uncorrelated to other asset classes, making it a low-risk investment during volatility, and can be seen as a form of "wealth insurance". Potential risks include limited liquidity, counterfeiting, and the need for secure storage, and consulting a professional is advised before investing. (not investment advice)</p>

The pandemic has exacerbated the issue, and school closures can severely impact children's reading and math skills, as well as their emotional health. Despite the challenges, some communities are finding ways to provide education through underground classrooms and makeshift schools. </p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy, announced plans to cut approximately 9,000 jobs, or 11.5% of its global workforce, as part of a company-wide transformation to simplify its organization and improve decision-making. The company expects the headcount reduction to incur a one-off cost of 8 billion Danish kroner ($1.26 billion). This move marks the first major decision by CEO Maziar Mike Doustdar, who recently took over the company. Novo Nordisk has been facing challenges in maintaining market share amid supply chain issues and increased competition in the weight-loss drug market. </p>

          <p>The article discusses the challenges in space law and security, highlighting concerns such as the blurring lines between civilian and military uses, collisions between satellites, flight congestion, and space debris. Existing space treaties and legal frameworks are outdated, failing to keep pace with the increasing number of actors and commercial players in space. While some countries have attempted to circumvent global treaties with their own legislation, the lack of comprehensive international agreements poses risks. Experts suggest the need for new norms, financial penalties for bad actors, and international cooperation to address these challenges. </p>

          <p>Weleda, a natural cosmetics company, has launched an inquiry into its links to a Nazi concentration camp following allegations that an anti-freeze cream it produced was tested on prisoners. A report alleges Weleda ordered raw materials from a garden in the Dachau camp and made a cream used in hypothermia experiments on prisoners. The company said a previous report found no evidence of testing the cream on prisoners in freezing conditions. Weleda has committed to transparently researching its history and expects results of the new investigation by early 2027. </p>
