            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, must be returned to the U.S. The justices declined to block a lower court's order to bring Garcia back, acknowledging an "administrative error" led to his deportation. Garcia, an alleged gang member according to the Trump administration, was flown to El Salvador's Cecot mega-jail under an arrangement between the two countries. The Supreme Court's order directs the lower court to clarify its ruling, considering deference to the executive branch in foreign affairs.</p>

            <p>Consumer sentiment declined more than expected in April, hitting its lowest point since June 2022, according to the University of Michigan survey. Inflation expectations soared to their highest levels since the early 1980s, with concerns about business conditions, personal finances, and the labor market all deteriorating. The survey indicates a rising risk of recession, with unemployment fears reaching levels not seen since 2009. The survey comes amid concerns that President Trump's tariffs will raise inflation and slow growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon anticipates that S&P 500 earnings estimates will decline further due to the uncertainty created by President Trump's trade negotiations.

Dimon noted that companies are already pulling back on acquisitions and investments, adopting a cautious approach due to policy uncertainty. While consumer spending has remained stable, there are signs that consumers are accelerating purchases in anticipation of higher prices due to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Iran is seeking a "real and fair" agreement with the United States on its nuclear program, according to a senior aide to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ahead of talks in Oman. The talks, mediated by Oman, aim to reach a deal on Tehran's nuclear program. President Trump has warned of potential military action if Iran refuses to negotiate, while Iran has threatened to expel U.N. nuclear inspectors. U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has not started a weapons program but has undertaken activities that would better position it to produce a nuclear device if it chooses to do so.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. could have significant consequences for drugmakers and American patients. Experts warn that the tariffs could disrupt the pharmaceutical supply chain, drive up drug prices, and exacerbate existing drug shortages. Generic drug manufacturers, which often rely on ingredients made in China and India, could be particularly affected. The tariffs could undermine efforts to control healthcare costs, as Americans already pay significantly more for prescription drugs than people in other developed countries.</p>

            <p>Farah Nabulsi's film, 'The Teacher,' explores the impact of Israeli occupation on Palestinian life in the West Bank. The film follows Basem, an English teacher grappling with grief after his son's death in a military prison. He forms a bond with a student, Adam, who lost his brother, and tries to prevent him from seeking violent revenge. The film highlights the senselessness of loss and the importance of relationships in the face of difficult circumstances.</p>

Morant was also suspended for 25 games at the start of the 2023-24 season after being seen on video waving a gun in a car.</p>

Trump argues that tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, but many economists expect prices to increase across a range of imported goods.
