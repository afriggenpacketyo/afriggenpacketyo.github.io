        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is modifying planned welfare reforms, including disability benefit cuts, in response to potential rebellions from Labour MPs. The changes aim to soften the impact of cuts worth £5 billion annually by 2030. Individuals losing Personal Independence Payment (PIP) will receive it for a 13-week transitional period instead of four, and carer's allowance will continue during this time. Recipients with the most severe conditions will not be reassessed and will receive extra income support, while a scheme allowing disabled individuals to try employment without risking benefits will be introduced. The welfare package as a whole could push an extra 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, into relative poverty, according to the government's impact assessment.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a series of strikes against Iran early Friday morning, prompting a declaration of a state of emergency by Defense Minister Israel Katz. Katz stated that a missile and drone attack against Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future. Air raid sirens were activated in Tel Aviv following the announcement. A U.S. official confirmed that the U.S. had advance notice of the strikes, but did not provide assistance or have any involvement in the Israeli operation. The nature and extent of the damage caused by the Israeli strikes remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Following Israel's missile strike on Iran, airlines globally have canceled flights to Israel and are rerouting flights to avoid a large area of Middle Eastern airspace. Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have suspended service to Tel Aviv through at least Saturday, with Tel Aviv-bound flights returning to the New York area. Israeli airline El Al has indefinitely suspended service and advised customers against going to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport, with no bookings being taken until at least the end of June. Flights en route to Israel have been diverted to various EL AL destinations, leaving travelers stranded and airlines scrambling to adjust their schedules.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump called on Iran to negotiate a nuclear deal, hours after Israel launched airstrikes against Iran. Trump stated that he gave Iran "chance after chance" to make a deal and warned them about the military capabilities of the United States and Israel. Iranian media reported that the airstrikes targeted Tehran and Natanz, which houses a key nuclear facility, while the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran's Isfahan nuclear site was not impacted, and "no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site." Trump also claimed that the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard was killed during the attack, though this remains unverified.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old girl in Arkansas died after being attacked by a pack of dogs she was caring for at a makeshift animal rescue. The Saline County Sheriff's Office responded to a 911 call and found the girl fatally attacked within a fenced area on the property. Approximately 30 dogs were housed on the property as part of the rescue operation, and officials are unsure why the attack occurred. Neighbors reported previous complaints about the dogs' behavior and a lack of control by their owners, with fourteen of the dogs involved being euthanized after the incident.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a major operation against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, scientists, and senior military commanders, while Iran retaliated by launching over 100 drones at Israel.

The U.S. stated it was not involved in the Israeli strikes, and President Trump urged Iran to make a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program.

          <p>Seven men have been found guilty of sexually exploiting two teenage girls in Rochdale over a five-year period, with the victims being repeatedly sexually assaulted. The girls were groomed from the age of 13 and treated as "sex slaves," being plied with drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. The victims had troubled home lives and were exploited by the men, who worked on the town's market or as taxi drivers. Police admitted they should have done more at the time and have since improved how these investigations are managed, with the men prosecuted as part of Operation Lytton, an ongoing investigation into historical child sexual exploitation in the town.</p>

The plane crashed shortly after takeoff, hitting buildings near the airport, and the data recorders will be crucial in determining the cause. India's aviation regulator has ordered additional safety inspections on Air India's Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 aircraft.

          <p>Following Israel's attack on Iran, Hezbollah, a major Iran-backed militia group based in Lebanon, issued a statement condemning the attack but did not offer to join in any retaliation. Analysts suggest this restraint could be due to significant losses suffered by Hezbollah in the previous year's war with Israel, or a prioritization of internal restructuring, including leadership changes and local arms production. Despite a ceasefire, Israel has continued to attack sites connected with Hezbollah, while the Lebanese government has also stepped up efforts to contain the group. This comes amid international calls for Hezbollah's disarmament and growing pressure from within Lebanon.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets experienced a downturn while oil prices surged after Israel launched a military strike on Iran. S&P 500 futures contracts fell by 1.1%, and U.S. benchmark crude oil jumped by 7.3% to $72.91 per barrel. Markets in Asia and Europe also saw declines, and analysts suggest that increased oil prices could be a primary channel through which this escalation impacts the global economy. The main risk for global energy markets is the possibility of Iran attempting to block the Strait of Hormuz, though there has been no direct impact on oil production or export facilities in Iran so far.

A group of Democratic state attorneys general challenged the order as unconstitutional, arguing that it usurped the states' constitutional power and sought to amend election law by fiat.

Democrats are demanding a full investigation into the matter, while some Republicans believe Padilla should be censured for his behavior.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the rise of a tech-aligned right-wing political movement, spearheaded by figures like Elon Musk, and its disillusionment with the Trump administration. The tech world, traditionally left-libertarian, was initially drawn to Trump's promises of deregulation and tax cuts. However, the administration's policies, including tariffs, ultimately undermined their priorities. The author suggests that Democrats should consider how to win back voters from this fractured coalition, particularly those who feel alienated by the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent attacks on judges appointed with the help of the Federalist Society signal a growing rift between the former president and the conservative legal movement. Trump expressed frustration after a court ruled against his tariffs, prompting him to criticize Leonard Leo, a key figure in the Federalist Society. This stems from Trump's expectation that his judicial appointees would consistently support his agenda, regardless of legal principles. The author argues that this divergence reflects a fundamental difference between political conservatism and the legal philosophy of originalism, which guides many Federalist Society judges.</p>

          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees. Lawyers argued that the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights, particularly for families with children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). The court ruled that the government was entitled to prioritize raising revenue for public services, even if some families could no longer afford private school fees.

          <p>Israel launched strikes across Iran, targeting the "heart" of Iran's nuclear program, killing senior military figures and nuclear scientists. Iran retaliated by launching about 100 drones towards Israel, which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was intercepting. Explosions were reported in Tehran and at the Natanz nuclear facility, with the IDF confirming it struck the site. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said there has been no increase in radiation levels at the Natanz plant, and urged maximum restraint to avoid further escalation.</p>
