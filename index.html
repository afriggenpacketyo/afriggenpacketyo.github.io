        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the administration has not ruled out expanding immigration enforcement operations beyond current locations like Chicago and Los Angeles. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Noem emphasized a focus on addressing crime and violence in various cities, asserting that resources are being prepared for potential deployments. This comes amid the Trump administration's broader strategy of targeting "sanctuary" jurisdictions and using federal forces to intervene in cities, a move that has drawn criticism from state leaders like Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to introduce a new $250 "visa integrity fee" for non-immigrant travelers visiting the United States, effective October 1. This policy is expected to significantly impact visitors from non-visa waiver countries such as Mexico, China, and Brazil, raising the total cost of a visa to nearly $442. Travel industry experts express concern that the increased cost will create friction and reduce international travel volumes, potentially harming the tourism sector just as the U.S. prepares to host major international events.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced that it killed Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, in an airstrike in Gaza City. Israel's Defence Minister praised the operation, which reportedly targeted Obeida in the al-Rimal neighborhood. For years, the masked figure of Abu Obeida served as the public face of the militant group, delivering propaganda and threats against Israel. Hamas has not yet confirmed his death, which comes as Israel plans a major offensive to seize control of Gaza City.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that despite a recent flurry of diplomatic activity, a just peace for Ukraine seems unlikely due to Vladimir Putin's maximalist goals and Donald Trump's contradictory and improvisational approach. The author suggests Putin is patiently using obfuscation and manipulation to wear down his adversaries, exploiting the West's desire for a quick resolution. The article posits that Trump, for all his posturing as a peacemaker, risks being outmaneuvered unless he adopts a clear, forceful strategy that leverages U.S. military power to coerce Putin into ending the war.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership aims to create a combined UK-Norwegian fleet to operate in the North Atlantic, significantly strengthening NATO's northern flank against potential threats, particularly from Russian submarines. The deal was seen as a major victory for the British defense industry over international competitors.</p>

          <p>A protest against the use of hotels to house asylum seekers in East London resulted in four arrests after some demonstrators became aggressive toward police. The Metropolitan Police reported that a group of masked protesters entered the Canary Wharf Shopping Centre, leading to a confrontation where one officer was punched. The arrests were for offenses including assault on police and public order violations. The incident prompted police to authorize dispersal orders and measures to prevent protesters from concealing their identities in the area.</p>

          <p>An international flotilla, including climate activist Greta Thunberg and actor Liam Cunningham, has departed from Barcelona with the goal of breaking Israel's blockade and delivering humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Organizers state the convoy aims to bring food, water, and medicine to the territory, where food experts have warned of famine conditions amid the ongoing war. Thunberg emphasized that the mission is about highlighting how Palestinians are being "deliberately deprived of the very basic means to survive."

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed that a baby has died from whooping cough, marking the first fatal case in the UK this year. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the infection during her pregnancy. This tragedy occurs amid growing concerns about declining vaccine uptake in the country, with none of the main childhood vaccines reaching the 95% target needed for herd immunity last year. Health officials are urging pregnant women and parents of young infants to ensure vaccinations are up to date, emphasizing that they are the best defense against this potentially fatal illness.</p>

The urchin population had exploded due to an imbalance in the ecosystem, creating "barrens" where kelp could not grow. By culling the urchins, the fast-growing giant kelp has been able to return, restoring critical habitat for over 800 marine species.</p>

          <p>Two climate activists were arrested in Barcelona after smearing the iconic Sagrada Familia basilica with red and black paint. The protest group, Futuro Vegetal, stated the action was to express outrage over devastating summer forest fires in Spain, which they link to government inaction on climate change and the livestock industry. The demonstration is the latest in a series of disruptive protests by the group, which has previously targeted artworks and private property to draw attention to what it calls a "climate emergency." Spain has suffered one of its worst wildfire seasons in recent memory.</p>

          <p>In his highly anticipated debut as the full-time starter for the No. 1 ranked Texas Longhorns, quarterback Arch Manning had a difficult outing in a 14-7 loss to Ohio State. Manning completed 17 of 30 passes for 170 yards with one touchdown and one interception, later stating his performance was "ultimately not good enough." Head coach Steve Sarkisian defended his young quarterback, criticizing the "out of control" external expectations placed on him and urging patience, saying, "let's finish the book before we judge it."</p>

          <p>A report highlights the growing danger of indoor heat-related deaths in Arizona, particularly among low-income, elderly, and medically vulnerable residents. The article profiles several cases where individuals died in their homes after their air conditioning failed and they could not afford repairs, revealing a crisis of energy poverty in one of the nation's hottest regions. As climate change drives more intense heatwaves, experts warn that such preventable deaths could surge, exacerbated by rising utility costs and policies that reduce access to financial assistance and affordable clean energy.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author, a self-described liberal, makes the case that hunting can be a more honest, sustainable, and ethical way to consume meat compared to factory farming. She recounts her own journey to becoming a hunter, detailing the emotional gravity of taking an animal's life and the deep connection to nature it fosters. The author argues that hunters are often deeply invested in conservation, funding wildlife management through licenses and taxes, and that the reflexive disdain for hunting from the political left is misplaced, overlooking shared interests in ethical food systems.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actor Jeremy Allen White shared his experience playing Bruce Springsteen in the upcoming film "Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the creation of the 1982 album "Nebraska." White expressed his initial apprehension about portraying the iconic musician, citing the intimate connection Springsteen has with his fans and his own lack of musical experience. He discussed finding a connection with the character through the feelings of fraudulence and trauma Springsteen was experiencing at the time, a theme he also explores in his role on "The Bear."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece warns that the global strategic environment is becoming increasingly unstable due to the advancement and proliferation of ballistic missile capabilities. The author argues that, similar to the Cold War, a new multipolar arms race allows adversaries to hold entire populations hostage under the threat of nuclear conflict. The article suggests that war is now "just one press of a button away," and the likelihood of such an event, even if accidental, is growing. It concludes that while the nature of war has changed, the world's trajectory toward perpetual conflict can and must be reversed.</p>
