          <p>Analysts and former government officials are tempering expectations for upcoming trade talks between the US and China in Switzerland. The meeting between Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is viewed as a preliminary discussion to set the agenda for more formal negotiations. Despite Trump's suggestion of halving tariffs, significant concessions from either side are unlikely, as the US seeks a deal to ease market pressure and China hopes for tariff rollbacks. The article suggests the talks are more about establishing frameworks than reaching a definitive agreement to resolve the ongoing trade war.</p>

Hayden was instrumental in modernizing the Library of Congress through digitization efforts, and her dismissal follows other actions by the Trump administration to reshape arts institutions, including staff changes at the National Endowment for the Arts and the Kennedy Center.

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, are scheduled for a resentencing hearing in Los Angeles court next week, offering them a new opportunity for potential release. Judge Michael Jesic ruled that the hearing will proceed despite efforts by the current district attorney, Nathan Hochman, to oppose the resentencing. The brothers were originally sentenced to life in prison without parole, but former district attorney George GascÃ³n had requested their sentences be reduced to 50 years with the possibility of parole.

          <p>President Trump intends to sign an executive order aimed at discouraging the criminal enforcement of regulatory offenses, with the goal of reducing the burden on small businesses. The order would require agencies to publicly list regulatory violations that could lead to criminal charges and provide guidance on when violators would be referred for prosecution. The order would also discourage prosecutors from pursuing charges not on the lists or those that do not require proof of criminal intent. The article notes that the order will not apply to immigration or national security matters.</p>
