          <h2>Staffing Cuts at National Parks Raise Summer Safety Concerns</h2>

          <p>Recent staffing cuts at the National Park Service, driven by Trump administration policies, are raising safety alarms as the summer season begins. At Assateague Island National Seashore, for example, lifeguard towers are shuttered, prompting fears of potential drownings. An advocacy group reports a 24% loss of permanent staff since the administration took office, a symptom of what they call chaos and dysfunction within the agency. The administration maintains that public-facing personnel are prioritized, but local officials worry about the immediate jeopardy to visitors.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has placed Cleveland Guardians pitcher Luis Ortiz on paid leave amid a gambling investigation. The inquiry focuses on two specific wild pitches thrown by Ortiz in June games, which were flagged by a betting integrity firm for unusual wagering activity. The bets, placed in multiple states, were on the pitches being a ball or a hit batsman, and Ortiz proceeded to throw erratically in both instances. The Guardians have stated they will cooperate with the league's confidential investigation.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed the Trump administration's signature legislative package, which includes major tax and spending cuts, increased defense funding, and enhanced immigration enforcement. The bill, approved by a slim 218-214 margin, now heads to the president's desk. The legislation overcame internal Republican opposition after intense pressure from the White House and party leadership. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it will add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over ten years and cause millions to lose health insurance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has put 139 employees on administrative leave after they signed a "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's direction under the Trump administration. The employees' letter argued the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment. In response, the EPA accused the career staff of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and stated it has a "zero-tolerance policy" for such actions. The move comes as the agency, under administrator Lee Zeldin, has pursued significant deregulation and budget cuts.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that most Americans who display the U.S. flag do so out of patriotism and to show support for the military, rather than to make a political statement. While many perceive others fly the flag for political reasons, they do not cite this as their own motivation. The survey also found that Republicans are more likely than Democrats to fly the flag to express patriotism or make a political point. A large majority believes it should be illegal to burn the flag in protest.</p>

On the economy, growth has been minimal, and new wage policies may be impacting business hiring.

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, has been granted a permit to operate methane gas generators at its Memphis data center, despite strong opposition from local residents and environmental groups. Community leaders argue the generators pollute their historically Black neighborhoods, which already suffer from high rates of respiratory illness. The Southern Environmental Law Center states the turbines can emit tons of harmful pollutants. The NAACP has filed a lawsuit against xAI, alleging violations of the Clean Air Act, and remains committed to holding the company accountable.</p>

The measures are among the largest in the city's recent history for a peacetime event.

The extensive security arrangements reflect the high-profile nature of the event, which will host leaders from 28 countries and major international organizations.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative David Valadao of California is facing intense criticism for voting in favor of the Trump administration's megabill, which is expected to cut Medicaid coverage for a large portion of his constituents. Over two-thirds of residents in Valadao's Central Valley district rely on the program. Despite previously vowing to oppose harmful cuts, Valadao supported the bill, citing concessions for rural hospitals and agriculture. Democrats have already targeted him over the vote, calling it a "betrayal" and vowing to unseat him in the next election.</p>

          <p>The impacts of the sweeping tax and spending bill will be staggered, with many key provisions not taking effect until after the 2026 midterm elections. New work requirements for Medicaid recipients, for instance, are slated to begin in 2026, while changes to food assistance (SNAP) work rules could start this year. Some tax changes, like deductions for tips and overtime, will be reflected in 2026 tax filings, but tax credits for electric vehicles and green home upgrades will end much sooner. The bill's complex timeline means its full effects will unfold over several years. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers argue that while the economy is stabilizing, significant risks remain, rooted in high local government debt that has hampered financial operations.

The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons, which inflates list prices. Instead, manufacturers could offer a transparent, lower price directly to health plans, similar to their direct-to-consumer offers. With employers sharing a portion of this reduced cost, employees' out-of-pocket expenses could be significantly lowered, improving access to these transformative but currently expensive medications.

The exemption is limited to occupations that customarily receive tips and includes an income cap to prevent misuse by high earners.

Reporters found mini marts in Hull selling counterfeit and smuggled tobacco, often hidden in secret tunnels, with little fear of consequence. Experts link these operations to international crime gangs, people trafficking, and the employment of illegal workers. The problem is exacerbated by underfunded Trading Standards teams and low penalties, fostering a sense of decline and lawlessness on local high streets.</p>
