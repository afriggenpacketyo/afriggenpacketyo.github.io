          <p>The Trump administration's plan to house up to 30,000 migrants at Guantánamo Bay has been scaled back, with tents erected for the purpose being dismantled after only three months. The operation never expanded beyond housing 32 migrants in pre-existing buildings. The decision to dismantle the tents suggests a shift away from housing tens of thousands of migrants at the base, despite the president's initial vision.

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to block new federal grants, citing concerns about antisemitism, race-conscious admissions policies, and a lack of viewpoint diversity. Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent a contentious letter to Harvard's president, criticizing the university's management and accusing it of betraying its ideals. The move follows Harvard's lawsuit challenging the government's decision to cut research funding. This action signals a potential shift in the administration's tactics against elite universities, moving towards a more systematic approach to restricting funding, which could be more difficult to challenge in court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the evolving attitudes of Americans towards Israel, noting a decline in support and a rise in sympathy for Palestinians. This shift is attributed to events such as the Hamas attacks and Israel's military response in Gaza, which have sparked protests and political divisions in the United States. While the US has historically been a strong ally of Israel, recent polls suggest that this support is waning, particularly among Democrats and younger voters. The article explores the historical context of the US-Israel relationship and considers the potential implications of these changing sentiments on future policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is facing scrutiny over his campaign tactics in the New York City mayoral race, with allegations of coordinating with a super PAC through a practice known as 'red-boxing.' Cuomo's campaign website posted information that closely resembled spending instructions for the super PAC supporting him. The New York City Campaign Finance Board is investigating potential violations of campaign finance rules, which could result in penalties and loss of public matching funds. This situation raises questions about the boundaries between candidate campaigns and independent expenditure groups.</p>

          <p>President Trump has falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, in an effort to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. However, the national average for gasoline prices is significantly higher than Trump's claim, with U.S. drivers paying over $3 per gallon. While gasoline futures did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, this figure does not reflect the retail prices consumers pay at the pump. This highlights a disconnect between Trump's statements and the reality of gasoline prices for American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
