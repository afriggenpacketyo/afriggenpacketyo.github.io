          <p>Amid deadly flash floods in Central Texas that have claimed numerous lives, a U.S. Coast Guard rescue swimmer is being hailed as a hero. Petty Officer 3rd Class Scott Ruskan, 26, from New Jersey, single-handedly rescued 165 victims, many of them children from a flooded summer camp. This was reportedly the first rescue mission of his career, and he served as the only triage coordinator on the scene. His actions have been praised by officials, highlighting a story of immense courage and selflessness in the face of a devastating natural disaster.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, but it continues to pose a significant flash flooding risk to the Carolinas. The system is bringing heavy rain, with forecasts predicting 2 to 4 inches and localized amounts up to 6 inches. Flood watches are in effect for central North Carolina and south-central Virginia. In Chatham County, North Carolina, a highway has partially collapsed, and over 100 roads are flooded, prompting rescue operations for stranded motorists and warnings for residents near the rising Haw River.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will provide people with necessary time to grieve without returning to work prematurely. The move has been praised by campaigners and politicians as a significant step in legally recognizing early pregnancy loss as a form of bereavement.</p>

          <p>The latest round of indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, held in Doha, Qatar, has ended without a conclusive agreement. According to Palestinian sources, the Israeli delegation lacked the necessary authority to finalize a deal. The talks, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, are expected to resume, but significant obstacles remain. This development comes as BRICS leaders expressed "grave concern" over the ongoing conflict and called for an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and the release of all hostages and detainees.</p>

          <p>The taste of chocolate varies significantly worldwide due to different production methods and consumer preferences. American chocolate often has a distinct, slightly sour note from the use of butyric acid to ensure a long shelf life, a flavor that can be unfamiliar to European palates. In contrast, European chocolate is strictly regulated, emphasizing high cocoa content and traditional processes like conching for a creamy texture. Meanwhile, emerging markets in India and Africa are developing their own unique chocolate cultures, reflecting local tastes and production capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has successfully deported eight men to South Sudan, a country under a State Department 'do not travel' advisory due to widespread conflict and crime. The men, who had been convicted of violent crimes in the U.S., were flown to their destination after a series of legal battles that reached the Supreme Court. Their flight was initially diverted to a U.S. military base in Djibouti for weeks while courts reviewed the case. A federal judge ultimately concluded that a Supreme Court ruling on deportations to third countries prevented him from halting the removal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant global trend of declining fertility rates is reshaping societies in the U.S. and around the world, presenting complex challenges. Researchers attribute this shift to increased economic independence for women and changing lifestyle priorities, with more couples choosing to have fewer or no children. While this trend has positive aspects, such as fewer adolescent births, it also raises concerns about depopulation, aging workforces, and the long-term viability of social safety nets like Social Security. This demographic pivot is prompting a new political and social debate about family policies and population growth.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is scheduled to visit China next week, where he will discuss the controversial ownership of the Port of Darwin with President Xi Jinping. The visit, described as a "friendly gesture" to maintain positive relations, will include addressing Australia's position on Chinese investment, particularly concerning the strategic port. The port was leased to a Chinese-owned company in 2015, a deal that has since drawn scrutiny over national security implications. This diplomatic engagement aims to navigate a sensitive issue while fostering broader trade and political ties.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that the increasing financialization of housing across Europe is a primary driver of the continent's housing crisis and growing political disillusionment. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have acquired vast portfolios of residential properties, pushing up prices and rents to maximize shareholder returns. This corporate capture of housing, enabled by decades of privatization and deregulation, has exacerbated inequality and fueled support for far-right parties. The author argues that fundamental structural changes are needed to reclaim housing from financial markets.</p>

          <p>The United States men's national soccer team lost 2-1 to Mexico in the Gold Cup final, a defeat that raises concerns about the team's progress under coach Mauricio Pochettino ahead of the 2026 World Cup on home soil. Despite a promising run in the tournament, the loss continues a pattern of inconsistency, particularly against top-ranked opponents. While the tournament provided valuable experience for fringe players, the result leaves supporters questioning if the team is on the right track. Pochettino cited the heavily pro-Mexico crowd as a factor in the outcome.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas have stated they were caught off guard by the catastrophic flash floods that killed at least 80 people over the Fourth of July weekend. The torrential rain caused the Guadalupe River in Kerr County to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night while residents were asleep. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly noted that the county lacks a river warning system and had no reason to believe the flooding would be so severe. This lack of advance warning contributed to the devastating impact on communities, particularly Camp Mystic.</p>

The summit also saw Russian President Vladimir Putin attend via videoconference, while Chinese President Xi Jinping was represented by his premier.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial has shown that a single injection of a gene therapy can significantly reverse hearing loss in individuals with a specific genetic mutation. The therapy delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. In a small-scale trial, all 10 participants, including children and adults, showed considerable hearing improvement within months. One 7-year-old participant regained nearly all her hearing, demonstrating the profound potential of this cutting-edge treatment for certain forms of congenital deafness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has created confusion in global markets by announcing that new tariffs, previously expected by July 9, will now take effect on August 1. President Trump stated that letters detailing new tariff rates or trade deals would be sent to partners starting Monday. However, the shifting deadline plunges importers into an extended period of uncertainty. The delay was clarified by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after the president appeared uncertain about the effective date, adding to the unpredictability surrounding the administration's aggressive global trade policy.
