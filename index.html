          <p>An article from Vox examines the potential long-term economic consequences of Trump's policies, particularly the risk of undermining the U.S. dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. Trump's trade war and erratic foreign policy have shaken global investors' confidence in America's economic and political stability, leading to discussions of 'de-dollarization.' The article explains that the dollar's reserve status keeps borrowing costs low for the U.S., and its displacement would lead to higher interest rates, a weaker currency, and reduced living standards for Americans. While the dollar's reign is unlikely to end soon due to the lack of a viable alternative, Trump's policies have accelerated the desire for an alternative global monetary system.</p>

          <p>British counterterrorism police have arrested seven Iranian nationals in connection with two separate investigations, one involving a suspected terror plot and the other concerning a national security offense. Five men were detained under the Terrorism Act for allegedly planning an attack on a specific location, while three others were arrested for an unrelated national security threat. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper highlighted the operations as some of the most significant counter-state threat and counterterrorism efforts in recent years, with MI5 warning of a growing threat from attackers linked to Tehran, particularly against Iranian dissidents in the U.K. The investigations aim to determine any connections to the Iranian state, reflecting the complex challenges to national security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns about the decline of the American film industry and 'messaging and propaganda.' The move has sparked alarm within the film industry, with unions warning of a potential 'knock-out blow' and raising questions about the definition of a 'US film' in an increasingly globalized production landscape. While the details remain unclear, the proposed tariffs could impact American production companies filming abroad and potentially lead to retaliatory measures from other countries, further harming the industry's profitability. The UK's Department for Culture, Media & Sport and the Motion Picture Association have not yet responded to requests for comment.</p>

          <p>Ohio authorities have arrested Gregory J. Moore, Aliza Sherman's former divorce attorney, and charged him with murder, aggravated murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy in connection to her 2013 stabbing death. Moore, who previously served jail time for lying to police during the investigation, is accused of orchestrating Sherman's kidnapping as a delay tactic for her upcoming divorce trial. The indictment includes messages showing Moore lured Sherman to his locked office, where she was later attacked. The Aliza Sherman Fund was started in 2023 by Sherman's daughter to support Cleveland Clinic patients and caregivers who have experienced violence.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article analyzes Israel's decision to mobilize tens of thousands of reservists for an expanded military offensive in Gaza, aiming to increase pressure on Hamas. The move follows the collapse of a two-month cease-fire and aims to re-enter Gaza cities to force Hamas to disarm. However, questions remain about whether this escalation will achieve Israel's goals of destroying Hamas and releasing all hostages, or simply intensify the conflict with dire consequences for Palestinians. The article notes that while the Trump administration seeks a new cease-fire, disagreements persist over conditions, and the expansion of military operations puts hostages at grave risk, according to families of the hostages.</p>

          <p>A mainland Chinese military magazine reports that Beijing's sixth-generation fighter, unofficially dubbed the J-36, could potentially block airspace to foreign bases in Guam for up to two hours from 1,000km away in a future conflict over Taiwan. The goal of the next-gen fighter is to counter Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army weaknesses against the American B-21 stealth bomber within the first island chain. The article in Shipborne Weapons suggests that this fighter could impede the US Navy and Air Force from maintaining air superiority over the western Pacific. The Chinese stealth aircraft is undergoing flight tests near Chengdu, while the US also announced its sixth-generation fighter, the F-47, in March.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian argues that Trump's tariffs are not solely based on economic theory but reflect a broader political vision of protectionism. The tariffs aim to protect a way of life and create good-paying factory jobs, appealing to those who have lost out due to globalization. However, the author contends that the tariffs mask more sinister desires, such as tax breaks for the wealthy, and fail to address the real issues underlying economic pain, such as gutting welfare and rising inequality. A democratizing spirit is needed to guide us to work collectively to ensure that all people can lead decent and meaningful lives, even in a chaotic world.</p>

Critics worry that the database could lead to eugenics, loss of rights, and mandatory participation without informed consent. The health agency did not respond to questions about whether individuals would be able to opt out of the database, or how it would be structured, what kind of security and privacy measures would be taken, and whether similar databases would collect information on other conditions.</p>

          <p>General Motors has been engaged in a decade-long effort to revive Cadillac as the quintessential American luxury car brand. GM President Mark Reuss has taken a special interest in Cadillac, aiming to restore its prominence and compete with brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz. The strategy relies heavily on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the flagship Escalade. Despite challenges with sales in China and electric vehicle production, Cadillac has largely stayed true to its plan, focusing on value over volume and elevating the brand's status.</p>

          <p>An article from Vox discusses the potential of delaying or eliminating menopause through emerging research and treatments, raising questions about the desire to remain young and fertile forever.

          <p>A review of Wally Lamb's 'The River Is Waiting' in the Los Angeles Times discusses the novel's exploration of trauma and dysfunction after a troubled father accidentally kills his son and is sentenced to prison. The novel delves into the father's guilt and remorse, but the reviewer finds the character narcissistic and the emotions performative. While the author attempts to faithfully reflect prison life, the reviewer finds much of the plot and dialogue cliche. The novel ultimately fails to provide an authentic epiphany, leaving the reader feeling that the protagonist never truly reckoned with his regrets or learned from his mistakes.</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic, Hollywood strikes, and industry-wide contraction have led to a scarcity of entry-level positions, making it difficult for recent graduates to find work. Industry veterans note that conditions are harsher than ever, with TV writing roles significantly declining and entry-level employees staying in their positions longer. Young creatives are questioning whether Los Angeles is still the best place to launch their careers, as productions leave California due to high costs and low tax incentives.</p>

          <p>An article in the Los Angeles Times discusses the historical significance of Lewis W. Hine's photographs in exposing child labor exploitation in the early 20th century and the current efforts in some states to roll back child labor laws. Hine's images, which documented the harsh conditions faced by child laborers, played a crucial role in sparking social reform and the passage of protective legislation. However, the article argues that the impact of such photographs is diminished in today's media-saturated landscape, where images are abundant and the advent of AI raises questions about photographic authenticity. The push to roll back child labor laws is driven by conservative groups, citing labor shortages and parental rights, but critics argue it could lead to exploitation.</p>

While young children's brains are more adaptable to neural plasticity, adults can also benefit from language learning, which enhances connectivity between brain regions. Although multilingualism improves cognitive abilities, it is unclear if this directly translates to higher intelligence, as various factors influence cognitive skills.</p>
