          <p>The Trump administration welcomed a group of 59 white South Africans as refugees, citing persecution, a claim disputed by the South African government which asserts that white South Africans are not disproportionately targeted by crime and are among the wealthiest in the country. The move has drawn criticism, with some viewing it as politically motivated and racially biased, especially given the administration's strict immigration policies towards non-white populations. The US embassy has published guidelines for Afrikaners and racial minorities in South Africa seeking US resettlement, offering federal assistance upon arrival. Senator Jeanne Shaheen has called the decision baffling, while the Episcopal Church's migration service has refused to participate, citing its commitment to racial justice.</p>

          <p>Counter-terrorism police are investigating suspected arson attacks at two properties linked to Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister. A fire damaged the entrance of Starmer's private home in Kentish Town, and another fire occurred at a house converted into flats in Islington, both being treated as suspicious incidents. Police are also looking into a car fire as part of the probe. Starmer, who lives at Downing Street, has thanked emergency services, but cannot comment further due to the ongoing investigation, with counter-terrorism officers leading the probe as a precaution due to Starmer's high-profile status.</p>

Garber defended Harvard's commitment to freedom of thought while criticizing the federal government's overreach into private universities' affairs, as the Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in funding to the university and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status. He refuted claims that Harvard is a partisan institution, emphasizing its commitment to intellectual diversity and inclusivity.

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant flight delays due to a staffing shortage at an air traffic control facility and recent radar outages. The FAA is delaying incoming flights to Newark by several hours from various airports, causing cascading effects worldwide.

          <p>The White House is considering policies to encourage parents to stay home with their children, including increased child tax credits and the removal of federal tax credits for day care. This push aligns with a conservative social agenda promoting traditional family structures, though studies are inconclusive about whether children fare better in day care or at home. The proposed legislation aims to give families more choice, but critics argue it may not be sufficient for one parent to stay home, especially given the rising costs of living and the need for two incomes in many American families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on Chinese products following significant trade disruptions and warnings from American businesses about higher prices. The agreement lowers US tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% and China's tariffs on American goods to 10% for 90 days, while officials seek a more permanent trade deal. The move follows weeks of escalating tariffs that brought much trade between the countries to a standstill. Some analysts view the agreement as a retreat that vindicates China’s decision to retaliate forcefully, while others see it as a welcome reprieve for businesses.</p>

The Department of Transportation confirmed the Boring Company is one of several firms being consulted, while Musk has previously criticized Amtrak and other rail projects. The Frederick Douglass Tunnel aims to replace a 152-year-old tunnel along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.</p>

The US allows thousands of additives in food, often self-certified as safe by companies, while Europe generally presumes new food additives unsafe until proven otherwise.

Investors are now focused on whether this temporary fix can be turned into a lasting agreement, with tech, retail, and travel companies seeing widespread gains.

          <p>Yeshiva University has reversed its decision to recognize an LGBTQ student club, called Hareni, citing violations of Jewish principles and the legal settlement. The university claims that Hareni was operating as a pride club under a different name, which is antithetical to its Torah values. Lawyers for the students argue that the university violated the agreement with hostile religious rhetoric. This decision comes after years of legal battles and debates over religious freedom and civil rights.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials, influencers, and state-run media are portraying the initial trade agreement and 90-day tariff pause with the US as a victory for Beijing. They argue that their defiant public posture worked and was a major reason they were able to strike a deal with U.S. officials with relatively few concessions. Chinese negotiators appear to have convinced President Donald Trump's administration to roll back most of the 145% tariff rate that Trump imposed, and slash them to 30%. In exchange, China pledged to roll back most of the countertariffs it announced against the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to reduce high prescription drug prices in the US, citing that Americans pay much more than patients in other countries. The order directs US officials to ensure that deals over drug costs made by foreign countries do not result in "unreasonable or discriminatory" price hikes for Americans. It also proposes that the US be given Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status, meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers. Experts are skeptical of the claims, and the order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in courts and Congress.</p>

          <p>Receipts from US tariffs hit a record level in April, totaling $16.3 billion, as revenue from President Donald Trump's trade war started kicking in. Customs duties were 86% above the $8.75 billion collected during March and more than double the $7.1 billion a year ago. This influx in tariffs helped shave some of the imbalance for April, a month in which the Treasury generally runs a surplus because of the income tax filing deadline hitting mid-month. The surplus totaled $258.4 billion for the month, up 23% from the same period a year ago.</p>

The South African government has denied this saying any allegations of persecution would not meet the threshold required under refugee law.

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer's robust language on immigration feels like an acknowledgement that it is one of the biggest and most transparent political failings. There were the projections made by Sir Tony Blair's government two decades ago that allowing unlimited migration from central and eastern Europe would tempt modest numbers of people to move here – and huge numbers turned up. In the 2010s, the Conservatives repeatedly promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands a year, and repeatedly failed. Labour are acutely aware of Farage's capacity to communicate in a way that resonates with those who feel successive governments have not just ignored them on this issue, but belittled and demeaned their views too.</p>

          <p>President Trump turned his sights to the little-known Digital Equity Act, calling the program “racist” and “unconstitutional” in a post on his social media site Truth Social on Thursday, vowing to end the program “immediately.” The Digital Equity Act is relatively obscure outside of broadband circles -- a $2.75 billion program tucked into the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that Biden signed into law in 2021. People in the broadband world typically frame the digital divide -- the gap between internet haves-and-have-nots -- as a three-pronged issue: access to a strong internet connection, the means to afford it and the tools to use it. It’s this last component that the Digital Equity Act was created to address.</p>
