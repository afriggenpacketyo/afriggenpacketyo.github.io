        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wage growth in the UK showed signs of cooling, decreasing to 4.7% in the three months to August from 4.8% previously. Concurrently, the national unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.8%, with the increase primarily driven by younger workers. Analysts interpret this data as a sign of the labor market stabilizing after a period of volatility, though concerns remain about the impact of rising national insurance costs on hiring, particularly for part-time and entry-level positions. The figures suggest a softening labor demand, which could lead to an easing of cost pressures in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The decisive seven-wicket victory was secured on the fifth morning in Delhi, with opener KL Rahul scoring an unbeaten half-century. This win solidifies India's third-place position in the early World Test Championship standings. The foundation for the victory was laid by first-innings centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal and Gill himself, overcoming a resilient second-innings fightback from the West Indies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is launching the Janus Project, a significant new program to deploy commercial nuclear microreactors for powering its bases worldwide. This initiative aims to address the logistical challenges of fuel supply, especially in remote or contested areas, and support the increasing energy demands of modern military technology. Using a contracting model inspired by NASA's commercial partnerships, the Army will collaborate with private companies to build and operate these small, factory-built reactors. The program is designed to enhance energy independence and is seen as a game-changer for military operations, particularly in strategic locations like the Indo-Pacific.</p>

The fires, including massive blazes in the Cairngorms national park, caused extensive damage to wildlife and the rural economy, with over 200 incidents reported across Scotland. Hosted by the Scottish government, the meeting involves the fire service, environmental groups, and land managers to improve resilience and prevention strategies. Discussions include the role of climate change and the controversial practice of muirburn, with a new licensing scheme for the latter having been delayed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of U.S. rare earth mining companies experienced a significant rally in premarket trading, continuing gains from the previous session. The surge is a direct market reaction to President Trump's threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports in response to Beijing's new export controls on critical minerals. This development has heightened investor focus on a potential renewal of the trade dispute between the two economic giants. China's dominant position in the global rare earths supply chain makes any disruption or trade barrier highly impactful for the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Severe flooding in western Alaska, caused by the remnants of Typhoon Halong, has resulted in one confirmed death and two people missing. The storm brought hurricane-force winds and a destructive storm surge that destroyed homes and led to the rescue of over 50 people. A U.S. Coast Guard official described the impact on the villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok as "absolute devastation," with search and rescue operations ongoing. The disaster has raised concerns about the long-term recovery for these remote, predominantly Alaska Native communities, especially with winter approaching and critical infrastructure damaged.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced an end to the Israel-Hamas war following the release of remaining Israeli hostages and over 1,900 Palestinian prisoners. While the initial steps of a 20-point peace plan have been executed, Middle East experts emphasize that the most challenging negotiations lie ahead. Key unresolved issues include the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas, and the establishment of an international body to govern the territory. The fragility of the ceasefire was highlighted when Hamas reportedly failed to return the remains of all hostages who died in captivity.</p>

          <p>Doctors are debunking several claims about acetaminophen, widely known as Tylenol, following President Trump's recent assertions linking its use in pregnancy to a higher risk of autism. Experts have refuted the unproven theory that low autism rates in the Amish community are due to their avoidance of medications like Tylenol, noting that the Amish do use the drug and that genetic factors can influence autism prevalence. Medical professionals also countered the administration's advice against giving Tylenol to young children, stating it is safe and necessary in certain situations when used correctly.

As a minority government, Labour requires support from opposition parties to win the crucial vote. The Welsh Conservatives have offered to negotiate a deal in exchange for scrapping the land transaction tax for main homes. Without a passed budget by the start of the financial year, government spending would be automatically restricted, a scenario the First Minister warned could result in "mass redundancies" across the public sector.</p>

His work provides a unique historical record, documenting a wide array of city dwellers, from musicians and paperboys to beggars.

          <p>A new report from DHL and New York University suggests that global trade has proven resilient against the Trump administration's tariff increases and is not heading toward a reversal of globalization. The study forecasts that global trade volume will grow at an average annual rate of 2.5% through 2029, a pace similar to the previous decade but slower than earlier predictions. While trade saw a surge in the first half of the year, likely due to businesses front-loading shipments to avoid tariffs, growth is expected to slow significantly in the coming year. The research indicates that a collapse of global trade is a risk but not the current reality. (not investment advice)</p>

While proponents, including public figures like Sir Steve McQueen, emphasize the potential to reduce inequalities and catch the cancer early, some medical experts remain cautious.

          <p>A report by the National Audit Office (NAO) has revealed that two UK government schemes designed to improve home energy efficiency were severely flawed, leaving tens of thousands of homes needing remedial work. The investigation found that an alarming 98% of homes fitted with external wall insulation under the ECO4 and Great British Insulation Scheme have problems that could lead to damp and mould. The NAO criticized the schemes for weak oversight, an under-skilled workforce, and suspected fraud, allowing installers to perform substandard work. The government has acknowledged the "unacceptable, systemic failings" and promised that repairs will be made at no cost to homeowners.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented new tariffs on imported timber and furniture, a move the White House says is intended to protect national security and bolster U.S. industries. As of Tuesday, softwood lumber imports face a 10% duty, while certain furniture and kitchen cabinets are subject to a 25% tariff. These rates are set to increase further next year for some products. The tariffs are expected to significantly impact major exporters like Canada, the primary supplier of lumber to the U.S., as well as Vietnam, Mexico, and China for furniture. Experts anticipate the duties will drive up construction costs and home prices in the United States.</p>

This flight marks the final test of the current prototype before SpaceX moves to a new version with upgrades designed for future missions to the Moon and Mars.

The performance marked a potential turning point for the pitcher, who has had a difficult season after being a key part of the team's World Series run last year.

          <p>The Venezuelan government has announced the closure of its embassy in Oslo, Norway, just days after Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. While the official statement cited a restructuring of foreign services, the timing is widely seen as a reaction to the Nobel Committee's decision to honor Machado for her work promoting democracy. The Norwegian foreign ministry called the closure "regrettable" but emphasized that the Nobel Prize is awarded independently of the Norwegian government. The move reflects the Maduro government's hostility toward Machado and adds to recent tensions between Venezuela and Western nations.</p>

Cameron McGerr believes he might have been able to help his father, who died of a cardiac arrest, if he had been taught life-saving skills at a younger age. He has already successfully persuaded his own school to introduce the training and is now taking his "Pulse of Life" campaign to the Scottish Parliament.
