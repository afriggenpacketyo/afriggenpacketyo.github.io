          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports starting August 1, escalating trade tensions as a deadline for a new agreement approaches. In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney, the US president linked the proposed tariffs to Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States and existing trade imbalances. The letter also warned that the tariff rate could be modified based on the bilateral relationship and that any retaliation from Canada would result in even higher levies. This move adds to existing tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and autos, creating further uncertainty for Canadian industries heavily reliant on US trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Natural Resources has announced the discovery of 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year. These discoveries, which include significant deposits of rubidium and gold, are part of a national strategy to enhance resource security amid a global race for critical minerals. Investment in mineral exploration saw a substantial year-on-year increase, particularly for elements like tin, bauxite, and copper, which are vital for the aerospace, semiconductor, and green energy sectors. The government plans to continue advancing strategic prospecting to bolster its national energy and mineral resource security.</p>

          <p>A 33-year-old former public school teacher in South Carolina, Nicole Ballew Callaham, has been charged with multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor. Authorities allege the misconduct began in 2021 and involved a prolonged pattern of abuse and "grooming behavior" with a male student who was in his early teens at the time. The investigation started after the victim, now 18, came forward to report the experience. Callaham, who has since resigned from her teaching position, faces similar charges in Greenville City, as the alleged conduct extended into that jurisdiction while the student attended school there.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of travelers from six Southeast Asian countries reveals that the United States is losing its appeal as a travel destination for many. Nearly 80% of respondents indicated a decline in interest, citing concerns over potential discrimination, gun violence, and actions by the Trump administration as more significant than cost. While overall interest has waned, travelers from Vietnam and the Philippines showed increased interest, possibly due to large diaspora communities in the U.S. Conversely, a majority of Singaporeans expressed less interest in visiting, reflecting a broader trend of negative impressions of the U.S. as a travel destination.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with US Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal to discuss strengthening Ukraine's air defense capabilities and imposing tougher sanctions on Russia. The meeting occurred as Russia intensified its missile and drone strikes, and the senators are co-sponsoring a bill for a 500% tariff on goods from countries buying Russian energy. Zelenskyy emphasized the urgent need for enhanced defenses, including interceptor drones, and expressed willingness to collaborate with European allies on purchasing large US defense packages. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump announced he would make a "major statement" on Russia, expressing frustration with Vladimir Putin following recent attacks.</p>

The incident occurred in a seven-mile-long wastewater tunnel under construction, with the collapse happening miles from the only access point. Four workers entered the tunnel to help their 27 trapped colleagues before the Los Angeles Fire Department's Urban Search and Rescue teams arrived. Fortunately, none of the workers sustained visible injuries, managing to climb over a large pile of dirt to escape.

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The ruling grants a temporary injunction as a class-action lawsuit, filed by the ACLU on behalf of immigrant parents and their infants, proceeds. This legal challenge was structured to comply with recent Supreme Court limits on universal injunctions. The White House criticized the decision as an "unlawful attempt to circumvent" the Supreme Court. The lawsuit argues the president's order violates the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to all persons born in the United States.</p>

          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for creating the perfect political slogan by analyzing 20,000 campaign messages. The research highlights eight key words that resonate emotionally with voters across cultures: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. While not a guarantee of victory, these words act as "emotional shortcuts." The book contrasts these universally appealing terms with more "bespoke" slogans like "Get Brexit Done," which are effective for single-issue campaigns. The analysis also notes the trend towards AI-crafted, micro-targeted messages, which may eventually replace traditional, broad-based slogans.</p>

          <p>Irvine Welsh, author of the cult novel 'Trainspotting,' is releasing a sequel titled 'Men in Love,' which explores his famous characters' relationships immediately after the original story. In a recent interview, Welsh expressed concern that the internet and artificial intelligence are creating a "post-culture society" where people become "dumbed down machines." He fears that as machines think for us, human intelligence atrophies. Welsh, who is also a DJ, remains deeply connected to his political roots and the social decay that inspired his first book, arguing that economic insecurity has now expanded from the working class to engulf the middle class as well.</p>

          <p>This commentary reflects on the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, where over 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were killed in a UN-designated "safe area." The author, Ed Husic, shares the story of a survivor and questions the international community's repeated declarations of "never again" in the face of mass atrocities. The article highlights the painful cycle of witnessing suffering, followed by belated action and legal recognition of genocide. It directly poses the question of how much longer it will be before the world applies the same "never again" declaration to the ongoing humanitarian crisis and loss of life in Gaza.</p>

While Tesla aims to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space, its Austin pilot has faced some issues, including a minor accident and traffic violations captured on video.

          <p>The UK is experiencing an extraordinary year for weather, with its warmest spring on record and a third heatwave already underway in July. This article explains that these are not just isolated hot spells but part of a clear trend driven by human-influenced climate change. Scientists warn that global warming disproportionately increases the intensity of heatwaves, making them 3-4°C warmer in the UK than they would be otherwise. Unlike the famous 1976 heatwave, which was an isolated event, today's extreme heat is becoming a more regular feature of British summers. Projections indicate that hot spells will become even more frequent, especially in southeastern England.</p>

          <p>Despite having the world's lowest birth rate, South Korea is experiencing a boom in its fertility clinic industry, with treatments rising nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022. This trend reflects a shift in attitudes, as more individuals and couples turn to IVF and egg-freezing to plan their families amid social and financial pressures that delay parenthood. Last year, one in six babies in Seoul was born with the help of fertility treatment. While the national birth rate remains critically low, it saw its first slight increase in nine years in 2024, offering a small glimmer of hope for the country's demographic crisis.</p>

          <p>A senior Israeli official has stated that Israel believes the deeply buried stockpiles of enriched uranium at Iran's Isfahan nuclear facility, which was hit by the U.S. military, are potentially retrievable. This assessment contrasts with more definitive statements from the Trump administration that the strikes "obliterated" the sites. Meanwhile, the U.S. agency that designed the "bunker buster" bombs used on two other sites, Fordo and Natanz, is still awaiting data to confirm if the munitions were effective. Iran's president has claimed the damage is so severe that authorities cannot access the sites, adding to the conflicting views on the outcome of the strikes.</p>

The suspended staff received penalties of 10 to 42 days of unpaid leave.

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a faster rate than the overall pace of global warming. The findings indicate that heat waves are not only getting hotter but are also lasting longer, with the most extreme and rarest heat waves showing the greatest increases in frequency. This means that each fraction of a degree of warming will have a disproportionately larger impact on creating long-lasting, dangerous heat events. The study underscores the urgent need for accelerated adaptation strategies to protect people, agriculture, and infrastructure, particularly in tropical regions which are expected to be the most severely affected.</p>

          <p>A new report from the United Nations Aids Agency (UNAIDS) warns that decades of progress in the global fight against HIV/AIDS are in jeopardy due to sharp funding cuts, particularly from the United States. The Trump administration's decision to halt most funding for the PEPFAR program, the largest single contributor to the global response, has left UNAIDS with a nearly 50% budget shortfall. The agency estimates this could lead to an additional six million new infections and four million AIDS-related deaths over the next four years. The fallout is already being felt in countries like South Africa, where scientific trials are being suspended and access to life-saving drugs is threatened.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a policy change that will exclude undocumented children from the federal Head Start preschool program, reversing decades of precedent. The move is part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for undocumented immigrants and pressure them to self-deport. The Department of Health and Human Services reclassified Head Start and at least 12 other programs as "federal public benefits," thereby allowing for the exclusion of children without legal immigration status. Critics, including the National Head Start Association, warn the policy will create fear and confusion among all low-income families and deny vulnerable children access to crucial early education and nutrition.</p>
