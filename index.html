          <p>Johann Wadephul, a close ally of Friedrich Merz, has been named Germany's new foreign minister, succeeding Annalena Bock. Wadephul, a CDU lawmaker since 2009, brings extensive experience in foreign policy and security matters to the role. He is a staunch European supporter and has been a vocal advocate for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, while also criticizing Donald Trump's proposed peace deal that would cede territory. Wadephul has already engaged with other foreign ministers, signaling a proactive approach to international relations for Germany. Optimism score is at 75.</p>
