          <p>President Trump has directed the Pentagon to develop options for using military force against drug cartels that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations. This directive follows a February designation of groups like the Sinaloa Cartel as global terrorists, enabling the use of American intelligence and defense assets against them. While officials state that military action is not imminent, the move formalizes a basis for potential operations on foreign soil or at sea. The policy aims to treat these powerful criminal syndicates as armed terrorist groups rather than just drug-dealing organizations.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies like Meta and Alphabet are seeing significant returns in their digital advertising businesses, largely driven by advancements in artificial intelligence. Meta attributed its 22% year-over-year sales increase to AI-powered efficiencies in its ad system, noting a rebound in spending from Asian-based e-commerce firms. While tech giants thrive, smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest reported more lukewarm results, underscoring a trend where advertisers gravitate toward larger, more stable platforms during economic uncertainty. The robust performance is fueling further massive investments in AI infrastructure by industry leaders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For a fourth time, the Texas House failed to achieve a quorum as Democrats continued their boycott of a special session focused on a controversial Republican-led redistricting plan. The proposed maps would likely grant the GOP more congressional seats, and Democrats have fled the state to prevent a vote, despite threats of arrest and loss of pay. Republican officials are pursuing legal action to compel their return, while Democrats have indicated they will stay away until the special session ends. In response, California Democrats are exploring ways to adjust their own state's map if the Texas plan proceeds.</p>

          <p>In a pointed diplomatic gesture, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly gave a Soviet-era award to President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, intended for a senior CIA official. The award was meant for Juliane Gallina, the CIA's deputy director for digital innovation, whose son died in 2024 while fighting for Russian forces in Ukraine. The move appears calculated to highlight the sensitive situation of a CIA official's son fighting for an adversary, though sources indicate the Kremlin was likely unaware of the son's family background initially. The incident occurred during Witkoff's visit to Moscow to discuss the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) should be aware of several factors that could impact their borrowing limits this August. Key influences include fluctuating home values, as regional markets show mixed signals with some areas seeing price declines for the first time in years. A homeowner's personal credit profile is also critical, as changes in credit scores can prompt lenders to adjust available credit. Furthermore, the broader interest rate environment plays a significant role, with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts possibly leading to more favorable lending terms and higher credit limits.

Switzerland is the world's largest gold refiner, and the uncertainty had pushed prices to an all-time closing high of $3,491.30 before the White House statement prompted a partial reversal.

          <p>Tesla has been granted a permit to operate a ride-hailing business across Texas, positioning it to compete with services like Uber and Lyft. The permit, issued by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, allows the company's subsidiary, Tesla Robotaxi LLC, to run a "transportation network company" until 2026. This formalizes and expands a limited, invitation-only service the company has been running in Austin using Model Y vehicles with a human safety supervisor. The permit notably allows for operations with or without a human driver, a key step in Elon Musk's long-stated ambition for a fully autonomous robotaxi network.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire southeast of Athens has killed one elderly man and forced the evacuation of thousands of residents as it spread rapidly through homes and dry terrain. The body of the man was discovered inside his home in the Togani area, near where the fire originated. Fanned by powerful winds, the blaze near Keratea grew quickly, with authorities issuing emergency alerts for seven different areas. This is one of over 50 fires that have broken out across Greece in the last 24 hours, marking one of the most severe days for wildfires this summer amid challenging, windy conditions.</p>

          <p>Spain's national ombudsman is investigating a decision by the local government in Jumilla, a town in the Murcia region, to ban Muslim religious festivals from public facilities like sports centers. The measure, proposed by the far-right Vox party and approved by the conservative Popular Party-led council, restricts activities "unrelated to the City Council." The move has been condemned as "Islamophobic and discriminatory" by Muslim community leaders and Spain's migration minister. The ombudsman is seeking clarification on how the town plans to accommodate the constitutional right to worship for all religious groups.</p>

          <p>The daughter of Bhim Kohli, an 80-year-old man killed by teenagers in Leicestershire, claims police "sat on information" that could have prevented his death. A report revealed police knew the identities of two boys who racially assaulted another man in the same park two weeks prior, an incident Mr. Kohli witnessed, but did not arrest them until after his death. Leicestershire Police cited officer shift patterns and a bank holiday for the delay, stating the initial incident was not deemed serious enough for immediate escalation, a conclusion the victim's daughter strongly disputes.</p>

          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, for processing Russian crude is not expected to derail progress on a long-delayed EU-India free trade agreement. Experts argue the designation is largely symbolic and that the greater pressure on India comes from the threat of U.S. tariffs, which may paradoxically push New Delhi closer to securing a deal with the EU. As India seeks to diversify its economic partnerships amid global volatility, a stable trade relationship with the EU has become increasingly attractive, making the single refinery sanction a minor issue in the larger geopolitical context.

          <p>The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, launched a sharp, undiplomatic attack on UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer for criticizing Israel's decision to expand its war in Gaza. In a social media post, Huckabee provocatively invoked the World War II bombing of Dresden, asking Starmer if the UK surrendered to the Nazis and dropped food on them. The comments came in response to Starmer's call for an immediate ceasefire and went far beyond the public remarks of President Trump. Huckabee, a Trump appointee, has a history of making intemperate and controversial statements in support of Israel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses a record $1.21 trillion, consumers can employ several strategies to combat compounding interest charges. One effective method is transferring balances to a card with a 0% introductory APR, allowing for principal-focused payments for a promotional period. For those facing severe financial strain, many card issuers offer hardship programs that can temporarily reduce or pause interest rates. Other tactics include paying off the balance before the statement closing date to prevent interest calculation or consolidating multiple high-interest debts into a single, lower-rate personal loan.

          <p>Archaeologists from East Carolina University believe they may have discovered the wreck of La Fortuna, a Spanish privateer ship that exploded during an attack on a colonial North Carolina port in 1748. The remains were one of four shipwrecks found at the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site. Wood samples suggest the vessel was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon from the ship was found in 1985. The team recovered over 40 timbers to protect them from erosion, shedding new light on colonial maritime history and military conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has dismissed a judge's criminal contempt finding against the Trump administration over the deportation of over 250 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. A lower court judge had found officials willfully disregarded his order to halt the deportations, which were conducted without due process under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. However, a divided three-judge panel ruled that the lower court's order raised "troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions" like foreign policy. The decision is a victory for the administration in one of its most high-profile and aggressive anti-immigration actions.</p>
