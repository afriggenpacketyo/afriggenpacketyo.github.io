            <p>The Supreme Court issued a temporary block on the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a law previously used during wartime. The ACLU filed an emergency appeal, arguing that immigration authorities were attempting to restart removals under this act. The court's order prevents deportations from the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting. This action follows concerns raised by immigration lawyers about the use of the act to deport Venezuelans accused of gang membership.</p>

            <p>Economists are raising concerns that President Trump's proposed tariffs on imports could lead to corporate profiteering, allowing companies to increase prices beyond what is necessary to cover the tariff costs. This "greedflation" phenomenon could be exacerbated by consumer expectations of rising prices, giving companies cover to inflate profits. Experts warn that US consumers could face an average effective tariff rate of 28%, leading to a potential 3% rise in consumer prices. The Federal Reserve also acknowledges the potential for tariffs to generate a temporary rise in inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge in his case cited sufficient evidence of gang membership to deny bail, though Garcia maintains his innocence and claims to fear persecution from a rival gang.

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom issued clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation, as part of Easter clemency actions. Bin, a former gang member, was sentenced in 2008 for shooting at a rival's home. He became a minister in prison, leading to a reduced sentence. Newsom's pardon aims to prevent Bin's deportation to Cambodia, a country he left as a toddler. Newsom also offered a posthumous pardon to Sgt. Richard Allen Penry, a Vietnam War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient.</p>

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to further investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by refusing to turn around two flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members who were sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador last month. The order does not rule in either way on the merits of Boasberg’s inquiry, however, and merely gives the petitioners in the case a deadline of April 23 by 5 p.m. to file their reply to the government.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely watching the US bond market amid economic uncertainty fueled by trade tariffs. The recent sharp rise in US government bond rates, coupled with falling bond prices, suggests a loss of investor confidence. This volatility can affect public spending, household finances, and business growth. The bond market's reaction to tariffs led President Trump to introduce a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for most countries. (not investment advice)</p>
