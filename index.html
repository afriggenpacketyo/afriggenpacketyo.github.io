          <p>Palestinian Oscar-winning director Basel Adra reported that Israeli soldiers conducted a raid at his West Bank home, searching for him and going through his wife's phone while his 9-month-old daughter was present. This incident followed an attack by Israeli settlers on his village, injuring his brothers and cousin, and comes after Adra felt increasingly targeted since his Oscar win for "No Other Land." The documentary chronicles settler violence in Masafer Yatta, depicting residents' struggle against Israeli military demolitions and highlighting the broader context of Israeli military rule in the West Bank. Adra described Saturday's events as "horrific," emphasizing a system designed to terrorize Palestinians, while the Israeli military stated its forces were in the village due to Palestinians throwing rocks and injuring Israeli civilians.</p>

          <p>Hainan province and Hong Kong have signed a significant memorandum of understanding, marking a new phase of two-way coordination and shared ambition across multiple sectors, including finance, trade, investment, data, tourism, and talent exchange. This strategic partnership aims to leverage Hong Kong's world-class financial system, which oversaw HK$35.1 trillion in assets last year, to provide crucial reinforcement, structure, and global credibility for Hainan's developing free trade port reforms. The collaboration is designed to transform Hong Kong from being a sole gateway to becoming a trusted partner in co-developing cross-border finance and enhance regional competitiveness by linking Hainan’s vast duty-free ecosystem with Hong Kong’s high-end services, encouraging international travelers to visit both destinations. This initiative promises to offer unique insights and foster substantial mutual success for both regions within China's national economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, 22, has been taken into custody for the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Kirk, 31, was killed during an outdoor debate, in what officials describe as a "targeted attack." Robinson faces charges including aggravated murder, with his first court appearance expected soon, as the Utah County Attorney reviews evidence. The investigation, which involved tracking Robinson's movements via video and recovering the rifle, suggests he acted alone, with no information currently leading to additional arrests. Messages on Discord, potentially from Robinson, referenced the weapon and bullet engravings, though a definitive motive remains officially undisclosed by authorities.</p>

          <p>Earl Richardson, former president of Morgan State University, has died at 81, leaving a profound legacy of fighting for equitable funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). He spearheaded a 15-year lawsuit against the state of Maryland that ultimately resulted in a historic $577 million settlement for four HBCUs, addressing decades of historical underfunding and programmatic disadvantages. Richardson's visionary leadership, which included subtly guiding student protests and leveraging his deep institutional knowledge, led to Morgan State's "Renaissance," doubling enrollment and expanding its campus with new schools. His impactful work brought national attention to the persistent funding disparities faced by HBCUs across the country, advocating for their crucial mission in educating talented Black students and those who might not otherwise consider college.</p>

          <p>Georgia Tech secured a dramatic 24-21 upset victory over No. 12 Clemson with a thrilling 55-yard field goal by kicker Aidan Birr as time expired. Despite having no timeouts and rushing onto the field for the career-long attempt, Birr drilled the kick, which initially looked wide right before curling through the uprights, sparking a field-storming celebration. Quarterback Haynes King was outstanding for the Yellow Jackets, delivering strong passing and rushing performances, while Clemson's Cade Klubnik struggled with an interception and a crucial fumble. This stunning loss marks Clemson's second of the season, dropping the Tigers to 1-2, while Georgia Tech improved to a surprising 3-0 with the decisive score.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is embarking on major investments in new infrastructure to mitigate the severe drought impacts that have recently paralyzed vessel transits and threatened global trade. Facing a future of low water levels, projects include a comprehensive land bridge featuring a natural gas pipeline and new port terminals to move natural gas liquids without relying on the canal's water, aiming to attract more LNG traffic. Additionally, the Rio Indo dam project, estimated at $1.6 billion and set for completion by 2032, will supply supplemental fresh water to Lake Gatun, which feeds the canal's operations. These ambitious initiatives seek to ensure the canal's long-term reliability and crucial role in global trade, despite concerns from local communities about displacement and the projects' long timelines.</p>

His timely goal alleviated concerns following Alexander Isak's recent departure to Liverpool and fellow new signing Yoane Wissa's injury, which is expected to sideline him until October. Despite his 6ft 6in frame, Woltemade demonstrated creative playmaking abilities in addition to his classic number nine's goal, earning a standing ovation and his own chant from the raucous St James' Park crowd. Manager Eddie Howe acknowledged there's still work to do on his physical game but praised Woltemade's determination and positive start, offering significant hope for Newcastle's attacking options.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent supported the move, emphasizing the need for a unified effort to cut off revenues funding Russia's war machine at its source.

Thousands of spectators watched as participants were tested on precision tram operating skills through quirky challenges, including "tram curling," where drivers pushed a bicycle trolley to a specific spot, and "tram bowling," using a giant ball to knock down inflatable pins.

          <p>Congressional Democrats are making health care a key, non-negotiable demand in ongoing negotiations to avert a government shutdown, which is currently set to expire on September 30. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries have firmly stated they will not support any GOP-backed legislation to keep the government funded unless it includes an extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits. If these credits disappear, average premiums could soar by approximately 75%, impacting a vast majority of Americans with ACA marketplace plans. Republicans, including President Trump and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have dismissed these demands, accusing Democrats of "clamoring" for a shutdown, signaling a bitter policy fight. With both sides entrenched, lawmakers are likely to pursue a stopgap measure, but even that temporary solution faces an uphill battle.</p>

The team's poor start to the season includes two defeats, eight goals conceded, and just one goal scored on home soil, raising significant concerns about his future despite five summer signings. Critics, including former goalkeeper Shay Given, point to a lack of improvement since Potter's appointment and persistent defensive vulnerabilities, particularly from set-pieces. While the club's ownership typically avoids knee-jerk reactions, heavy home defeats to fierce rivals and slipping into the bottom three are alarming. Upcoming matches against unbeaten Crystal Palace and Everton will be crucial in determining if Potter is given more time to turn the tide.</p>

          <p>AAA's comprehensive 2023 study on Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) across 11 diverse vehicles found them to be largely reliable, with most models showing minimal deviation (1.2% to 1.5%) from actual tire pressure readings. The Tesla Model 3 performed exceptionally well, displaying no deviation, while the Cadillac Escalade and Ford F-250 were the least accurate; notably, the F-250's warning light failed to activate even when tire pressure fell to 65% of the recommended standard. While generally encouraged by the findings, AAA advises drivers to periodically use a handheld gauge for verification, physically inspect their tires for wear or damage, and actively monitor individual tire pressures on the instrument cluster, as the warning light only activates at a 75% threshold.

Caracas views this as a "direct provocation" through excessive military means, aimed at justifying an escalation of conflict for "regime change" in the country, and has demanded that the U.S. immediately cease such actions that endanger regional security and peace.

This crucial move comes as U.S. humanitarian aid cuts, which previously made the U.S. the largest funder of food aid, exacerbated the crisis for these displaced people, further compounded by an influx of new refugees from Myanmar's raging civil war. The UN Refugee Agency and various aid groups have lauded the decision as a "turning point" for refugee self-sufficiency and economic participation, potentially setting a regional benchmark for rights-based solutions. The policy also strategically helps address Thailand's recent sharp decline in its migrant labor force, allowing refugees to fill so-called "3D jobs" in agriculture and services.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Ukrainian children, including 14-year-old Sasha from Mariupol, remain in Russia after being forcibly taken from occupied territories since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted Sasha's story, separated from his mother in a "filtration camp" and taken to occupied Donetsk, underscoring that his case is not isolated. Russia denies abducting children, claiming they were "rescued," despite mounting international pressure from 38 countries, the Council of Europe, and the European Union, and an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for President Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova for war crimes. Efforts by NGOs like Save Ukraine are helping repatriate children, though the process is complex due to Russian citizenship grants and strict adoption laws, making verification and return a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Russia and Belarus have commenced their joint "Zapad 2025" military exercises, simulating conflict scenarios and involving heavy armored vehicles, helicopters, and ships, alongside drones, electronic warfare technology, and artificial intelligence. These large-scale drills, held every four years, are taking place primarily in Belarus, which borders several EU and NATO members—Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania—as well as Ukraine, and include rehearsals for the use of Russian nuclear-capable Oreshnik missiles. Neighboring nations are on high alert due to concerns that Zapad could precede further Russian aggression, as was seen before the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Poland has responded by closing its border to Belarus and launching its own "Iron Defender" military exercises involving 30,000 troops, further escalating regional tensions.</p>

The July 10 raid, which targeted over 300 suspected undocumented workers at Glass House Farms, a prominent cannabis producer, resulted in the death of one worker who fell three stories while trying to evade capture. Hundreds of protesters converged at the site, clashing with immigration agents who used less-than-lethal force, leading to multiple injuries. The FBI emphasizes that while it does not investigate First Amendment activities, assaulting federal law enforcement officers is a federal crime, and they continue to seek the armed individual involved.</p>

This incident, which saw Poland shoot down the drones, marks the first time a NATO member fired on Russian targets during Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, raising significant concerns across the alliance. NATO has already announced plans to beef up the defense of Europe’s eastern flank in response to the escalating tensions. Poland, for its part, rejected President Trump’s suggestion that the incursions could have been a mistake, hoping for Washington to take action to show solidarity with Warsaw, while Rubio emphasized gathering all facts and consulting allies before making definitive determinations on Russia's intent.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Police Department is actively seeking the public's help in identifying two persons of interest connected to a deadly shooting that occurred earlier this week in Ocean Beach. The incident took place on Wednesday night in the 5000 block of Newport Avenue, where officers responded to reports of gunfire in a parking lot and found a man fatally shot in his upper body. Homicide detectives determined the victim was involved in a confrontation with two other men prior to the shooting, after which the suspects fled the scene on foot and remain at large. Authorities consider the individuals armed and dangerous, and the firearm used in the homicide has not yet been recovered. Officials are urging anyone who recognizes the suspects or has information about their whereabouts to contact the SDPD’s Homicide Unit or Crime Stoppers immediately.</p>

          <p>Lawyers and advocates are expressing grave concerns that approximately 1,000 Central American children, including dozens in California, face imminent deportation to dangerous home countries before their immigration court cases conclude. This follows a federal judge's emergency order that blocked a recent attempt to deport 76 Guatemalan children from shelters in Arizona and Texas, many of whom feared gang violence and abuse upon return. The U.S. government is reportedly expanding its list to include children from Honduras and El Salvador, with lawyers for some minors seeing their scheduled hearings disappear from court calendars. Critics, including the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, argue these actions violate children's rights and expose them to significant danger, while the government has stated there are "no immediate plans" for mass removal of children from other countries.</p>

          <p>Before appointing Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer explicitly questioned him about his links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, following initial vetting that flagged the relationship. Starmer's chief of staff sent Mandelson three specific questions, inquiring about continued contact post-conviction, alleged stays at Epstein's Manhattan apartment while the financier was imprisoned, and association with an Epstein-backed charity. Mandelson's answers were initially deemed sufficient for his appointment, leading to a second vetting process. However, new information from leaked emails this week, including supportive messages Mandelson sent after Epstein pleaded guilty, prompted Sir Keir to read the emails and ultimately led to Mandelson's sacking, raising questions about the thoroughness of the vetting process and the Prime Minister's judgment.</p>

The FAA also specifically cited an instance where a Boeing employee allegedly pressured a member of Boeing's ODA unit, tasked with performing inspections on the FAA's behalf, to sign off on a 737 Max airplane that did not comply with applicable standards to meet delivery schedules. Boeing is currently reviewing the proposed civil penalty, stating that the company is actively working to strengthen its safety culture and improve quality assurance across its operations, following previous issues with the 737 Max fleet.</p>

          <p>Wall Street enjoyed a stellar week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each hitting multiple record highs, driven by speculation surrounding the Federal Reserve's upcoming highly anticipated interest rate decision. Oracle's blowout fiscal 2026 first-quarter earnings report, which saw its remaining performance obligations skyrocket 359%, significantly boosted tech stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom. Mixed economic data, including a better-than-expected fall in the Producer Price Index and weekly jobless claims reaching their highest level in almost four years, fueled investor hopes for more aggressive rate cuts by the Fed. The Investing Club capitalized on these market movements with five trades, including initiating and adding to a position in Boeing, trimming Goldman Sachs, and buying more Texas Roadhouse and Honeywell, amidst a dynamic market environment influenced by economic indicators and corporate performance.
