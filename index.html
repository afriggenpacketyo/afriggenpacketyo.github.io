          <p>Storm Amy has struck the United Kingdom, bringing powerful winds and torrential rain that have caused significant disruption and power outages for tens of thousands of homes. An amber wind warning remains active for northern Scotland, with gusts reaching up to 96mph, and transport services, including rail and ferries, have faced widespread cancellations. The storm set a new record for the lowest atmospheric pressure in the UK for October. One weather-related death was reported in the Republic of Ireland as authorities continue to manage the storm's impact.</p>

          <p>Israel has reportedly paused its offensive military operations in the Gaza Strip to create an opportunity for Hamas to organize the release of hostages. An Israeli official clarified this is not a formal ceasefire or the beginning of a withdrawal, but a tactical adjustment to protect troops and allow negotiations to proceed. This development comes as U.S. envoys travel to Egypt to finalize details of a peace deal proposed by President Trump, with indirect talks between Israel and Hamas expected to begin Sunday. The pause is intended to test Hamas's readiness to accept the proposed terms.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has formally installed Reverend Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop. This marks a significant milestone for the predominantly white denomination, which has seen declining membership in recent years. Curry, who previously served as a regional bishop in Chicago, aims to foster a more connected and welcoming church, addressing challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations. His installation is viewed as a hopeful step toward greater diversity and representation within American Lutheranism.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have arrested 355 individuals in central London during a demonstration supporting Palestine Action, a group proscribed by the government in July. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, proceeded despite calls from police and political figures to postpone it following a recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. The majority of arrests were for the offense of supporting a banned organization. Organizers defended the decision to protest, stating that canceling would be "letting terror win" and that it's possible to grieve multiple tragedies simultaneously.</p>

          <p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has demanded that Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones end his campaign following the emergence of text messages from 2022. In the texts, Jones wrote that a former Republican House Speaker, Todd Gilbert, should get "two bullets to the head." Youngkin described the rhetoric as "violent" and "disgusting," stating Jones lacks the morality and character for public office. Jones has since issued a public apology, expressing shame and embarrassment for his words and stating he has taken full responsibility.</p>

          <h2>Democrats Counter Republican Claims Linking Government Shutdown to Immigrant Healthcare</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, Democrats are actively refuting Republican assertions that the funding impasse is due to a Democratic push for "free healthcare for illegals." Democratic leaders emphasize that federal law already prohibits the use of programs like Medicaid and the ACA for undocumented immigrants, and their proposals do not change this. The Democratic funding plan aims to reverse cuts affecting lawfully present noncitizens, such as refugees and asylum seekers, and extend popular ACA subsidies. Analysts suggest Republicans are framing the debate around immigration to shift focus from the healthcare cuts their policies would enact.</p>

          <p>The populist ANO party, led by billionaire former Prime Minister Andrej Babis, has won the parliamentary election in the Czech Republic with just under 35% of the vote. However, the party fell short of securing an overall majority, meaning Babis must now form a coalition government to regain power. He is expected to initiate talks with two smaller right-wing, eurosceptic parties that crossed the 5% electoral threshold. Key policy alignments, particularly regarding EU climate goals, exist with the "Motorists for Themselves" party, but forming a stable majority remains a challenge.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has been suggested for a leading role in the "Board of Peace" that would oversee a new technocratic government in Gaza, as outlined in President Trump's recently unveiled peace plan. This potential appointment has drawn criticism due to Blair's controversial history in the Middle East, including his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion and his previous tenure as a Middle East envoy. Critics, including Palestinian officials and a UN special rapporteur, have expressed strong opposition, citing his perceived pro-Israel bias and past actions. Blair himself has described the Trump plan as "bold and intelligent" but has not commented on his potential involvement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the prosecution of Salvadoran national Kilmar Ábrego García on human-smuggling charges may constitute illegal retaliation from the Trump administration. The judge granted a hearing to examine evidence of vindictive prosecution, citing "remarkable statements" by a deputy attorney general that seemed to link the charges to Ábrego García's successful lawsuit against his own wrongful deportation. The Department of Homeland Security reopened its investigation into him just days after the Supreme Court ordered the administration to facilitate his return to the U.S., raising concerns about the government's motives.</p>

          <p>The luxury department store Harrods has set aside more than £60 million to compensate individuals who allege they suffered historical abuse by its former owner, the late Mohamed Al Fayed. The redress scheme, open until March 2026, is expected to handle claims from over 100 former employees, with potential individual payouts up to £385,000. Multiple women have accused Fayed of sexual assault, and the Metropolitan Police are investigating reports from 146 people. The significant financial provision for the scheme contributed to Harrods recording a £34.3 million loss in its latest fiscal year.</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which left at least 10 people dead, were sparked by demands for cheaper wheat, reduced electricity tariffs, and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. The regional government has agreed to the protesters' demands, prompting the alliance's leader to ask demonstrators to disperse. The breakthrough came after Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif sent a delegation to negotiate with the protest leaders.</p>

          <p>A journal associated with the Chinese military has detailed new unmanned underwater systems that are described as "disruptive" and highly intelligent. According to the article, these systems can operate below 90 decibels, making them difficult for enemy sonar to detect. The technology can be integrated with submarine-launched missiles and smart mines to create a "multilayered strike network." This report comes as the PLA Navy has recently displayed a range of new unmanned submersibles and surface vessels, signaling a significant advancement in its naval capabilities.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has thrown the national park system into a state of limbo, with thousands of employees furloughed and visitor access inconsistent across the country. While some parks like Mesa Verde are completely closed, others such as Yosemite and Grand Canyon remain partially open with skeleton crews, leading to confusion for visitors and concerns about safety and environmental damage. Park advocates worry about the impact on understaffed parks, recalling the vandalism and sanitation issues that plagued parks during the 2018 shutdown. The situation also harms local gateway communities that depend on tourism revenue.</p>

          <p>Small college towns across the United States are facing economic strain due to a significant drop in international student enrollment, a trend exacerbated by the Trump administration's immigration policies. Universities like Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, have seen their international student populations plummet, resulting in potential revenue losses of over $140 million. The decline is attributed to factors including stricter visa screening processes, fears of deportation, and lingering effects of the pandemic. This loss of tuition-paying students threatens not only the universities but also the local businesses and economies that depend on them.</p>

Jon Godfread, North Dakota's Republican insurance commissioner, stated the "window is rapidly closing" and that failure to act will cause premiums to skyrocket for millions of Americans, potentially pricing them out of the market. If the subsidies expire, a family paying $800 a month could see their premium jump to $3,000. The issue is a central point of contention in the ongoing government shutdown negotiations.
