          <p>Nicholas Burns, the former U.S. ambassador to China, stated that Washington and Beijing are on a "creeping path" toward a trade deal, citing strong economic self-interest on both sides. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Burns offered rare praise for President Trump's tariff strategy, arguing it provides leverage in negotiations. He asserted that the symbiotic relationship, with thousands of American companies in China and the U.S. as a top export market, will logically guide both nations toward an agreement.</p>

          <p>A court in South Korea is retrying Kim Jae-gyu, the spy chief who assassinated President Park Chung-hee in 1979, to determine if his actions constituted treason or a patriotic act to restore democracy. Kim, who was executed, remains a polarizing figure, seen by some as a power-hungry killer and by others as a hero who ended a dictatorship. The retrial, initiated by his family, re-examines a pivotal moment in South Korean history and the complex legacy of both the assassin and the authoritarian president he killed.</p>

          <p>After initially failing to pass a procedural vote, a package of cryptocurrency regulation bills is now set to advance in the House. President Trump announced that a group of 11 Republican holdouts agreed to support the legislation following a meeting at the White House. The bills, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, had been unexpectedly blocked earlier, but the reversal underscores the president's influence over the party conference and provides new momentum for establishing clearer rules for the digital asset industry.</p>

          <p>Congress is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill designed to create a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation aims to establish clear rules and consumer protections for stablecoin issuers, such as banks and fintech companies, potentially paving the way for their wider use in the financial system. This bill is a key part of a broader legislative push to bring clarity to the digital asset market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into Brazil's trade policies, which it claims are "unreasonable or discriminatory" and harm U.S. commerce. The probe will focus on Brazil's digital trade policies, preferential tariffs granted to other countries, and what the U.S. calls "anti-corruption interference." This action escalates trade tensions between the two nations and follows President Trump's recent threat to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports.</p>

          <p>A study conducted by the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles has found that many of the Mexican citizens detained in recent federal immigration raids are not recent arrivals. The data showed that over half of those interviewed had lived in the U.S. for at least ten years, and more than a third had been in the country for over two decades. These findings highlight the human cost of the enforcement actions, as they often impact individuals and families deeply integrated into American society.</p>

          <p>An article in the Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, is urging local governments across China to more effectively use their legislative powers to stimulate economic and social development. The piece suggests that creating tailored local laws can establish a stable, predictable, and open system for market entities to operate within the rule of law. This represents a strategic shift from relying solely on top-down administrative orders to fostering growth through localized legal frameworks.</p>

The data breach and the subsequent relocation program were concealed from the public by a super-injunction, which a High Court judge has now lifted. The leak exposed individuals who had applied for UK assistance following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, putting them at significant risk.</p>
