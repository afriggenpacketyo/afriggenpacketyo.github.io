        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as the first-ever vice president of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a move seen as an effort to designate a successor and assuage international doubts about Palestinian leadership. Al-Sheikh, a veteran leader of Abbas's Fatah movement, is now the frontrunner to succeed the 89-year-old Abbas, who has faced pressure to reform the Palestinian Authority. While this appointment doesn't guarantee al-Sheikh the presidency, it marks a significant step in Palestinian succession planning amidst ongoing regional instability and questions about the future of Palestinian governance. The PLO, founded in 1964, has the power to negotiate and sign international treaties on behalf of the Palestinian people, while the PA is responsible for governance in parts of the Palestinian territories.</p>

          <p>Geoffrey Hinton, known as the "Godfather of AI," expresses growing concerns about the rapid development of artificial intelligence, estimating a 10% to 20% risk that AI could eventually take control from humans.

          <p>With Canada's election approaching, polls indicate a tightening race between Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. Despite a narrowing lead, the Liberal Party is still projected to win, benefiting from the distribution of votes across the country. Pollsters suggest that even a tied national vote could result in the Liberals securing more seats in the House of Commons, allowing them to form a government. This election will determine whether Carney secures a full term as prime minister.</p>

Moffett also anticipates backlash against Apple in China due to U.S. tariffs, potentially impacting iPhone sales. Moffett cut his Apple price target on Monday to $141 from $184 a share.
