          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new record high, driven by positive momentum, optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued institutional interest. The price increase occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, indicating investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a notable bitcoin skeptic, announced the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency, adding to the positive sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House Rules Committee advanced President Trump's tax bill, sending it to the House floor for a vote despite unanimous Democratic opposition and some conservative holdouts. The bill, which aims to meet a Memorial Day deadline set by Speaker Mike Johnson, has sparked concerns about its potential impact on federal deficits and long-term fiscal health, causing markets to tumble. White House officials maintain the bill is crucial for the country's economic prosperity, but analysts worry about the implications of increased government borrowing.

          <p>Two Israeli Embassy employees were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., with a suspect taken into custody.

Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, expressed shock and condemned the killings, while U.S. officials, including President Trump and D.C.

Trump presented a video montage of anti-white chants and equated the circumstances of white South Africans to the atrocities of apartheid. Ramaphosa's efforts to address the footage were drowned out, leaving South Africa facing potential tariffs and a missed opportunity to correct false accusations of racism. Despite the contentious meeting, Ramaphosa claimed success in securing further trade discussions and Trump's indication of attending the G20 summit in Johannesburg.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that higher-than-expected UK borrowing figures have increased the likelihood of Chancellor Rachel Reeves raising taxes in the autumn. Government borrowing in April was £20.2bn, exceeding expectations and potentially hindering Reeves' ability to meet spending and borrowing rules. Analysts cite weaker economic growth forecasts and increased spending pressures, including potential reinstatement of winter fuel payments, as factors contributing to the need for tax increases. The article highlights the challenges faced by the chancellor in balancing spending needs with economic stability.</p>

Greek swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev purportedly set a new 50-meters freestyle record, but it was not recognized by official bodies due to lack of independent adjudication, non-standard equipment, and absence of doping control. Critics have condemned the Enhanced Games as a circus sacrificing athletes' health for entertainment, while organizers argue it's a safer method to make sport a fair, level, transparent field so that innovation can be illustrated in a very public way to support technological progress.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is exploring the possibility of reusing soil removed from areas surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at the prime minister's office and other government facilities in Tokyo. This initiative aims to establish a precedent for soil recycling outside Fukushima Prefecture, as previous demonstration projects faced local opposition. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry, would likely be used for flowerbeds and other landscaping purposes. The move is part of Japan's efforts to reduce the total amount of contaminated soil requiring disposal following the 2011 nuclear disaster.</p>

The J League prioritized player development and strong local relationships, while MLS focused on business interests and attracting global stars. The J League has successfully rebuilt its crowds despite the lack of a replacement superstar – something Nonomura chalks up to increased media investments that have seen domestic exposure quadruple in the post-Iniesta era.

The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was taken into custody after shouting pro-Palestinian slogans, leading authorities to investigate the incident as a potential act of targeted violence. The victims were identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, who were about to be engaged. U.S. and Israeli officials condemned the attacks, with some Israeli officials linking the shooting to rising antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are pushing to strip President Trump of authority over the U.S. Marshals Service, aiming to transfer control to the court system due to rising threats against federal judges. Senator Cory Booker argues this change would insulate the Marshals from political interference, citing concerns about Trump's public denouncements of judges and attempts to undermine the courts. The legislation proposes a U.S. Marshals Board, including the chief justice of the Supreme Court, to oversee the agency. The article highlights the escalating tensions between the executive branch and the judiciary, as well as the increasing dangers faced by federal judges.</p>

The California Public Utilities Commission is considering Edison's request to raise rates by 10% to cover wildfire mitigation and operational costs. Consumer advocates argue that Edison customers already pay high bills, and the timing of the request is insensitive given the company's potential liability for the Eaton fire.</p>

The review highlights the book's exploration of how these artists negotiated the liminal space between belief and non-belief, creating thought-provoking works that challenged the status quo.</p>
