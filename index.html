          <p>UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell, speaking on "Face the Nation," confirmed Gaza City is facing a man-made famine, with conditions expected to spread, and estimated 18,000 children have died since October 7th. She strongly refuted Israeli government claims denying the famine, emphasizing the independent technical assessment by the IPC and the severe deprivation observed by UNICEF staff. Russell also detailed the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Sudan, citing it as the world's largest displacement crisis with cholera outbreaks and widespread sexual violence. She urged the United States to increase its leadership in providing aid, stressing the urgent need to address these crises where food and assistance are deliberately obstructed.</p>

          <p>The Manchester Originals women's team experienced a significant setback in their quest for The Hundred knockout stages, suffering a 16-run loss to the Birmingham Phoenix. Despite Phoenix being already eliminated, they posted a challenging 111-3, largely thanks to an unbeaten 94-run partnership between Ellyse Perry and Sterre Kalis, who capitalized on early dropped catches. In response, the Originals' batting lineup faltered dramatically, losing four powerplay wickets and ultimately being bowled out for 95. This defeat drops Manchester to fourth place, complicating their path to a top-three finish as they face Northern Superchargers next.</p>

          <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are reportedly waiving defensive back Shilo Sanders, son of NFL legend Deion Sanders, following his ejection from a preseason game against the Buffalo Bills. Sanders was removed for throwing a punch at Bills tight end Zach Davidson, an action Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles deemed "inexcusable." This decision, coming as the team finalizes its 53-player roster, significantly impacts Sanders' NFL future, as he was competing for a safety spot. The article highlights the swift consequences for such conduct in professional football, despite Sanders previously having a good chance to make the team.</p>

          <p>Germany's army chief, Lieutenant General Alfons Mais, has warned that the Bundeswehr may face conflict before it is fully prepared, despite significant modernization investments. While acknowledging "great progress" in equipping troops, Mais expressed concern about soldiers' mental readiness to defend national values. Separately, Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil reiterated support for a ban on the far-right AfD party, citing its anti-constitutional policies, while Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for social welfare reform. The article also notes the renaming of Berlin's Mohrenstrasse due to racist history and a commemoration for a Solingen attack anniversary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new sentencing legislation next month, allowing courts to impose pub, travel, and driving bans as part of community sentences. This overhaul, inspired by David Gauke's independent review, also aims to restrict short prison sentences to alleviate overcrowding and introduce early release schemes for well-behaved inmates. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood confirmed serious offenders would not be eligible for early release. The proposals face concerns from critics about funding, enforcement, and potential burdens on businesses, alongside pressure on probation services, despite plans for new technology and increased recruitment.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to overhaul the asylum appeals system, with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announcing plans for a new body of independent adjudicators to expedite decisions. This move aims to tackle "unacceptable delays" in processing 51,000 pending appeals and reduce the significant reliance on taxpayer-funded asylum hotels. However, the Refugee Council contends that improving the accuracy of initial asylum decisions is crucial, as approximately half are overturned on appeal. The reforms are introduced amidst growing public protests and arrests linked to frustrations over asylum seeker housing across various UK locations.</p>

          <p>Emine Erdogan, wife of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has appealed to US First Lady Melania Trump to advocate for children in Gaza and urge Israel to end the humanitarian crisis. This appeal follows Melania Trump's earlier outreach to Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning the protection of children in Ukraine. Erdogan's letter, published by Turkey's Anadolu news agency, expressed faith that Trump would extend her compassion to Gaza, where thousands of children have died and many more suffer deep psychological trauma. The missive asked Trump to write to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the crisis.</p>

          <p>A new online database provides detailed profiles of 16,000 victims of Nazi forced medical research and human experiments, exposing the horrific atrocities committed against persecuted groups. This systematic access reveals names, experiments, and institutions involved, with many perpetrators escaping accountability after WWII. Disturbingly, some data from these inhumane studies, such as on cold tolerance and chemical weapons, were adopted without reflection and cited in medical journals for decades. The article highlights the ethical imperative for critical examination of medicine's past and the need for ongoing awareness of data origins, even as the "scientific value" of such studies is now limited.</p>

          <p>American universities face an existential crisis, battling "cancel culture" from the left and political control from the right, with federal funding and academic integrity at stake. The article argues that universities, through "feckless administrators" and faculty lacking intellectual curiosity, have failed to articulate their core values, leading to plummeting public trust. To regain credibility, universities must reclaim academic freedom and adopt institutional neutrality, focusing exclusively on fostering an environment for research and learning. This approach means protecting all speech, even offensive views, and avoiding partisan stances to restore healthy debate and the university's unique role in society.</p>

          <p>Renewable energy executives warn that President Trump's proposed ban on solar and wind projects, along with existing tariffs, threatens to increase consumer electricity prices and strain the electric grid. Trump's administration has intensified its campaign against renewables, with the Interior Department now controlling permit approvals, a move criticized as "obstruction." Developers like Arevon, Avantus, and Engie North America report rising costs and investment uncertainty, with Engie slashing US investment by 50%.

The article argues that economic pragmatism is confronted by an "immovable priority" of foundational security, preventing meaningful political shifts towards Beijing. Even with substantial EU-China trade and climate deals, allies instinctively safeguard US intelligence-sharing and defense commitments. Their discontent manifests in diplomatic appeals for restraint rather than support for China-led confrontation, highlighting an unbridgeable gap between Beijing's global ambitions and geopolitical realities, as security concerns remain paramount.</p>

A study by the Senior Citizens League found that average Social Security benefits have lost 20% of their purchasing power since 2010.

Despite multiple accusations of sexual assault and psychological reports describing him as "very sick," Dickerson maintained support from some superiors.
