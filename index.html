          <p>After years of crises, Boeing is showing signs of recovery under CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over a year ago. The company's stock is up, production has increased, and it anticipates generating cash in the latter half of the year, with analysts predicting a return to profitability. However, challenges remain, including FAA production caps following a January door-plug incident and persistent issues within its defense unit. The article notes that while customer confidence is returning, the company still has a long way to go to fully resolve its quality control and production problems.</p>

          <p>A high-level European Union delegation, including President Ursula von der Leyen, has arrived in Scotland for critical trade talks with U.S. President Donald Trump. The meeting aims to avert an escalating trade war, as Trump has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on all EU imports by an August 1 deadline. While hopes for a deal are rising, Trump has stated the chances are "50/50," leaving global investors on edge. The negotiations are the culmination of months of discussions over a potential €1.4 trillion annual trade relationship.</p>

          <p>A persistent scam in Bogotá, Colombia involves "pinchallantas," or tire-puncturers, who deliberately spread sharp objects on roads to disable vehicles. These individuals, often on motorcycles, then guide the stranded drivers to complicit mechanics who overcharge for repairs, sometimes creating additional damage to inflate the bill. The practice has seen a recent surge in complaints, prompting city officials and police to crack down on the suspected repair shops. This article highlights the creative and frustrating methods criminals use to exploit unsuspecting motorists in the city.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a daily "tactical pause" in military operations in three areas of Gaza, including Gaza City, to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid. The 10-hour daily suspension of activities is intended to help address the worsening malnutrition crisis, following international pressure. In addition to the pause, Israel stated it would open secure aid corridors and has begun airdropping food parcels. Hamas officials have reacted skeptically, suggesting the move is more about improving Israel's international image than providing meaningful relief.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is using billboards in rural areas of Missouri, Indiana, Oklahoma, and Montana to blame President Trump for the potential closure of local hospitals. The campaign highlights the impact of a major legislative act which cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid, a key funding source for many rural healthcare facilities. While Republicans included a $50 billion "rural health transformation fund" in the bill, analyses suggest it will not cover the long-term losses. The billboards represent a new Democratic tactic to connect Trump's policies directly to the decline of essential services in GOP-leaning states.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the perceived failures and cronyism of the Trump administration have fueled a resurgence of interest in socialism among younger Americans. The author contrasts the historical reality of socialism's economic failures with its modern appeal as an alternative to a system seen as favoring insiders. The piece contends that to counter this trend, proponents of market economics must address the corruption and inequality that have become prominent. It suggests that the current debate is less about genuine socialist policy and more a reaction to widespread economic dissatisfaction.</p>

The shift to algorithm-driven social media and click-based journalism has created a feedback loop that promotes already popular artists, starving emerging talent of visibility.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the origins of the tipping system in the United States, tracing it back to the post-Civil War era. The practice was adopted from Europe but persisted in the U.S. as a way for employers, particularly in the restaurant and service industries, to avoid paying wages to newly freed Black workers. The system is sustained by the "tipped minimum wage," a federal law allowing employers to pay as little as $2.13 per hour with the expectation that tips will cover the difference. This context reveals that tipping is less a reward for good service and more a direct payment of a worker's wages.</p>

          <p>In the jungles of northern Guatemala, environmental groups have set up artificial watering holes to help wildlife cope with extreme heat and drought, which have become more common due to climate change. Motion-activated cameras placed near these water sources have captured incredible footage of a wide array of species, including elusive jaguars and tapirs. The project not only provides a vital lifeline for animals but also offers researchers valuable insights into their behavior. This initiative serves as a simple yet effective example of how humans can assist wildlife in adapting to a changing planet.</p>

          <p>This article details the significant challenges faced by community organizers trying to open freestanding birth centers in the U.S., particularly in "maternity deserts" like Augusta, Georgia. Despite high maternal mortality rates and a growing demand for alternatives to hospital births, advocates encounter resistance from hospitals, which are often reluctant to establish transfer agreements due to financial competition and malpractice liability concerns. The story highlights the struggle to provide more birthing options, especially for Black women, who face disproportionately high risks and often seek more attentive, holistic care.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are observing an increase in the formation of sinkholes globally and are linking the trend to climate change. Sinkholes form when water erodes underlying bedrock, and this process is being accelerated by more frequent extreme weather events. Periods of drought lower the water table, weakening the ground, which can then collapse under the weight of sudden, intense rainfall. This article explains the science behind these geological hazards, identifies global hotspots like Florida and Turkey, and discusses potential mitigation strategies.</p>

          <p>This article addresses the importance of using sunscreen to prevent skin cancer while also navigating the complex conversation around product safety. It explains the two main types of sunscreen—organic (chemical) and physical (mineral)—and how they protect skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays. While health authorities stress the necessity of sun protection, some long-approved chemical ingredients are under scrutiny for being absorbed into the bloodstream. Scientists emphasize that the proven danger of sun exposure far outweighs the current, unproven risks from sunscreen ingredients, and warn against ineffective DIY alternatives.</p>

          <p>While some prominent right-wing figures have criticized the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, interviews with supporters across the U.S. reveal a more complex response. Many voters remain loyal, dismissing the issue as a distraction or a "bunch of bullshit," and prioritizing what they see as the administration's successes on the economy and border security. Others express disappointment with the lack of transparency but are willing to give the president the benefit of the doubt.

The other columnist contends that in the face of a potential threat to democracy, such a move could be a necessary form of "peaceful resistance" to check authoritarian tendencies.

          <p>President Trump's hardline immigration policies have dramatically altered the U.S.-Mexico border region, leading to a plunge in migrant crossings and widespread fear. An asylum ban, a mass deportation campaign, and the militarization of the border have emptied migrant shelters in Mexico and prompted some migrants already in the U.S. to "self-deport." The article details the human impact of these changes, from stranded families to factory layoffs in Juárez caused by tariff uncertainty.

Your FRA is the age at which you are eligible for your full, unreduced benefit amount, and it serves as the baseline for all calculations. Claiming benefits before your FRA results in a permanent reduction in monthly payments, while delaying them past your FRA leads to a significant increase.
