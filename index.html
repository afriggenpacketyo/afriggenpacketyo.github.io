          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 22:12:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SK Hynix reported a substantial increase in quarterly revenue and operating profit, driven by robust demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. Revenue rose approximately 42% year-on-year, with operating profit surging 158%. The company, a major supplier to Nvidia, has captured a significant share of the HBM market, surpassing Samsung in DRAM market share for the first time. However, SK Hynix cautioned about potential demand volatility in the latter half of the year due to macroeconomic uncertainties and U.S. tariff policies, though they anticipate a limited impact on AI server demand.

          <p>A fossil discovery in northeastern China revealed a unique dinosaur-mammal food chain from 125 million years ago. The fossilized remains of Huadanosaurus sinensis, a newly identified theropod dinosaur, contained two small mammals in its stomach cavity. One of the mammals was a gobiconodontid, known to prey on small dinosaurs. This discovery highlights a complex predator-prey dynamic between dinosaurs and mammals, showcasing a reversal of roles where a dinosaur preyed on a mammal predator.</p>

          <p>A bill in California, AB 942, proposed by Assemblymember Lisa Calderon, is facing intense opposition for seeking to reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels installed before April 15, 2023. Protesters argue that the bill favors large utilities like Southern California Edison, Calderon's former employer, at the expense of solar users and environmental goals. The bill aims to address equity concerns, claiming that non-solar ratepayers are subsidizing solar customers, while opponents argue it undermines the state's commitment to renewable energy and benefits utility profits.</p>

          <p>A coalition of twelve U.S. states, led by New York, has filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's tariffs, arguing that he lacks the constitutional authority to impose them without congressional approval. The lawsuit questions Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact the levies. The White House defended the tariffs as necessary to address national emergencies, including illegal migration and trade deficits.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed executive orders targeting universities as part of his administration's efforts to reshape higher-education institutions and crack down on diversity and inclusion initiatives. The actions address foreign gifts to universities and college accreditation, which the president has referred to as his “secret weapon” to upend US universities. The administration alleges that accreditors have imposed “discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-based standards”, which it describes as a violation of federal law and an abuse of their authority.</p>

          <h2>RFK Jr. is moving to phase out synthetic food dyes. Are they safe?</h2>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight synthetic food dyes in the American food supply. Studies have linked dyes to behavioral changes as well as to cancer in animals, suggesting this may extend to humans. The FDA is looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and to work with food manufacturers to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in foods such as cereal, snacks, ice creams and yogurts. Some experts are divided on the issue, but agree it is best to limit artificial food coloring consumption when possible.</p>

          <h2>Hegseth orders makeup studio installed at Pentagon</h2>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered modifications to a room next to the Pentagon press briefing room to retrofit it with a makeup studio. The price tag for the project was several thousand dollars, at a time when the administration is searching for cost-cutting measures. The renovation that was initially planned was estimated to cost more than $40,000, but the ideas were scaled back. Hegseth is doing his own makeup ahead of TV appearances, not paying for a makeup artist.</p>
