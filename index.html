        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly condemned the Reform UK party, stating their policies will "tear this country apart." Speaking before the Labour party conference in Liverpool, Starmer highlighted Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants as particularly divisive and shocking. He positioned the Labour conference as an opportunity to present a positive alternative of "patriotic national renewal" against what he described as Reform's politics of "toxic divide and decline." The criticism comes as Labour faces pressure from opinion polls showing them trailing Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced his intention to send troops to Portland, Oregon, to address what he terms "domestic terrorists." In a statement, he directed the Secretary of War to provide necessary forces to protect federal facilities, such as those for ICE, from groups like Antifa, authorizing the use of "full force if necessary." This move follows similar deployments in Los Angeles and Washington D.C. aimed at confronting political violence. Portland's mayor, Keith Wilson, has previously stated that the city has not requested and does not need federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Actor Rob Lowe revealed the simple yet effective advice he gave his son, John Owen Lowe, who decided to pursue an acting career after graduating from Stanford. Lowe encouraged his son to be a "content creator," a strategy that has proven successful as John recently sold a new show to Apple TV+. Lowe emphasized that in today's environment, there are more opportunities for aspiring actors to create their own material compared to when he started his career. He also expressed pride in both his sons and shared anecdotes about his long-term sobriety and friendship with Charlie Sheen.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that his military has received a U.S.-made Patriot anti-aircraft system from Israel, which has been operational for a month. This development is notable given Israel's previous reluctance to provide military aid to Ukraine and its complex relationship with Russia. The transfer may signal a shift in Israel's foreign policy as Russia strengthens its ties with Iran. In other news, Ukrainian long-range drones reportedly struck a key Russian oil pumping station, causing a fire and operational suspension, further targeting Russia's economic infrastructure supporting the war.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Enduring Impact and Power of Teen Novels</h2>

          <p>This article reflects on the unique and lasting power of novels discovered during adolescence, using Judy Blume's "Forever," published 50 years ago, as a prime example. It highlights how such books provided a rare depiction of female sexuality and served as a rite of passage for many young readers, allowing them to see their own desires and anxieties validated. Teen novels offer a crucial space for young people to imagine future possibilities and feel understood in their most private thoughts.

          <p>Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth has ordered hundreds of generals and admirals from around the globe to an unusual and abrupt meeting in Virginia, causing unease within the military. The gathering is expected to feature an address by Hegseth on military standards and the "warrior ethos," which some officials believe is a move to reshape the military's leadership and culture under the Trump administration. This event follows Hegseth's recent dismissal of over a dozen senior officials and orders to reduce the number of high-ranking officers, leading to speculation that more firings or demotions could be imminent.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has suggested that certain sources are actively trying to undermine his reconciliation with his father, King Charles. In a statement, his spokesperson described recent media reports about their September 10 meeting as "categorically false" and "pure invention." The reports had characterized the reunion as more formal than familial, which the Prince's office refutes, attributing the claims to individuals "intent on sabotaging any reconciliation." This development adds another layer of complexity to the strained relationship within the Royal Family, even as Prince Harry has publicly expressed a desire to reconcile.</p>

          <p>This opinion article criticizes former President Donald Trump's recent comments linking prenatal Tylenol (acetaminophen) use to autism and advising pregnant women to "tough it out" instead of taking the pain reliever. The author argues this guidance is irresponsible, lacks scientific evidence, and perpetuates the harmful tendency to dismiss or ignore women's pain. The piece contends that the focus on Tylenol is another form of "mom-shaming," placing undue blame on women for health outcomes while ignoring other contributing factors. The author concludes that this is not about genuine health concerns but is another attempt to control women's bodies.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a warning about foreign attempts to illegally smuggle key strategic minerals, such as antimony, out of the country. The ministry stated that certain foreign nations are trying to bypass China's export controls to build their own reserves of these rare resources, posing a threat to national security. The announcement detailed two recent cases, including one involving a family-run criminal network that smuggled high-purity antimony ingots. This highlights the growing global competition for control over critical materials essential for various high-tech and military applications.</p>

          <p>Major players in the online dating industry, including Bumble and Match Group, are incorporating advanced AI to combat user swipe fatigue and create more meaningful connections. The new approach aims to function like a traditional matchmaker, using AI to analyze user responses about values and life goals rather than just superficial profile details. Companies are working with psychologists to train these AI systems to identify deeper compatibility. However, critics question whether algorithms can truly predict human chemistry, as past experiments have shown that the suggestion of compatibility can be more influential than actual shared traits.</p>

          <p>Despite leading the Labour Party to a significant election victory, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing growing criticism from within his own party regarding his leadership effectiveness. An analysis based on conversations with 30 government and party insiders reveals concerns about his slow decision-making, flawed judgment on personnel, and an inability to communicate a clear, passionate vision for the country. While some allies defend his steady leadership and foreign policy successes, many feel the government lacks a defined narrative, leaving it vulnerable. Starmer's upcoming party conference is seen as a crucial opportunity to reassert his authority and clarify his government's purpose.</p>

The standoff began after the companies pulled the show in response to pressure from the FCC over Kimmel's comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a move ABC initially followed by suspending the show. However, when ABC reinstated Kimmel, the station groups continued their boycott, a decision that proved economically unsustainable as their replacement programming drew far fewer viewers.

          <p>This opinion piece revisits the landmark 1977 case involving a neo-Nazi group's plan to march in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb with many Holocaust survivors. The legal battle, championed by the ACLU, ignited a national debate on whether the First Amendment protects hateful and offensive speech. The author recalls conversations with a survivor who feared the march and the ACLU lawyer who, despite being Jewish, defended the group's right to speak to protect the principle for everyone. The article concludes that the case's central lesson—that free speech must be defended even when we disagree with the content—remains profoundly relevant in today's divided society.</p>
