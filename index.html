          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei has enacted stricter immigration policies, requiring immigrants to reside in Argentina for two years or make a substantial investment to gain citizenship. The decree also mandates proof of income and clean criminal records for residency applicants. The government can now deport migrants more easily for illegal entry, document falsification, or minor offenses. Furthermore, foreigners will be charged for public healthcare and education, requiring all travelers to have health insurance, a move which has drawn criticism from left-leaning populists. \n</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom due to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications like Wegovy and Ozempic. The IMF anticipates a moderation in Denmark's economic growth from 3.7% in 2024 to 2.9% this year and 1.8% in 2026, yet potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports are not expected to significantly impact the country. Most Danish drug products are neither produced nor pass through customs within Denmark, limiting the direct impact of U.S. trade policies. The Danish drugmakers rely on a merchanting and processing system that allows them to contract manufacturers in other countries to produce and ship the products. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling its release of stockpiled rice to stabilize rising prices, which have neared record highs. This action involves potentially releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice monthly for three months, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The decision follows a poor harvest in 2023 due to high temperatures and increased rice consumption from a surge in foreign tourists. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions. </p>

The investigation suggests the mother may be facing restraints or health issues, and experts believe she knows the local area well, avoiding CCTV cameras while ensuring the babies were found quickly.

          <p>W.J. Hennigan reports for the New York Times on the recent India-Pakistan crisis, where escalating airstrikes and drone attacks pushed the nuclear-armed nations toward potential war before a tenuous cease-fire was brokered. The conflict was triggered by alleged Pakistan-based terrorist attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, leading to retaliatory strikes that reached deeper into Pakistani territory than in previous conflicts. Intervention from the Trump administration, particularly Vice President Vance, was reportedly crucial in de-escalating the situation and averting a potentially catastrophic nuclear exchange. The article emphasizes the urgent need for renewed diplomacy to prevent future escalations and miscalculations between the two countries. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Independent Schools Council reports a 22.6% increase in private school fees following the introduction of VAT, surpassing government estimates. This rise is attributed to a combination of VAT, national insurance changes, and the end of charitable business rates relief. The ISC anticipates a decline in private school enrollment due to the increased costs, with some parents already withdrawing their children. The government, however, maintains that the fee increases are not solely due to VAT. </p>

          <p>A Texas mother, Ashley Pardo, has been arrested and charged with aiding in the commission of terrorism after allegedly buying ammunition and tactical gear for her son, who investigators say was planning "mass targeted violence" at a San Antonio school.

Two British academics, David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, made the discovery after analyzing digitized images of the document. The manuscript, acquired for just $27.50 in 1946, is now considered one of the world's most valuable documents. The professors believe it originated from Appleby, Cumbria, and its authenticity was confirmed through handwriting analysis, spectral imaging, and textual comparison with other known originals. </p>

Key elements include singing about personal liberation, preferably in English, and alluding to folk music without submitting a pure folk song.
