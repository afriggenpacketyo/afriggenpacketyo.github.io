          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has formed off the coast of South Carolina, prompting storm warnings for coastal regions of both North and South Carolina. The National Hurricane Center predicts the storm will make landfall early Sunday, bringing heavy rainfall of two to four inches, with localized amounts potentially reaching six inches. While some slight strengthening is possible before it reaches the coast, Chantal is expected to weaken rapidly after moving inland. Authorities are advising residents to prepare for potential flash flooding and gusty winds through Monday.</p>

          <p>A family vacation in the Bahamas turned tragic when a 42-year-old Texas man was struck by a boat propeller while snorkeling just feet from the shore. The man, a former Army Ranger, suffered life-threatening injuries to his lower body and was airlifted to a hospital in Miami for intensive care. The boat that hit him reportedly fled the scene, and his family is now seeking to identify the individuals responsible. The incident highlights the potential dangers in tourist areas and the importance of having travel medical insurance for international trips.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara threw the ceremonial first pitch at a Chicago Cubs game, but his initial attempt went far wide of the plate. Visibly displeased with his performance, Kamara requested and was granted a do-over by the team's mascot. His second throw was significantly better, reaching the catcher on the fly and earning a cheer from the crowd. Kamara, a key player for the Saints, celebrated the successful second pitch with a hug for the mascot before the game against the St. Louis Cardinals commenced.</p>

          <p>Authorities searching for Brian Tarrence, a New Yorker who went missing while on vacation in Turks and Caicos, have discovered a deceased male in a decomposed state. Tarrence was last seen on surveillance footage leaving his hotel on June 25. While the body has not yet been positively identified, the discovery was made in the Grace Bay area during an organized search. A private investigator involved in the case noted that there has been no evidence to suggest any criminality, such as robbery, was involved in Tarrence's disappearance.</p>

          <p>An executive order by President Donald Trump aims to ground Chinese-made drones, reflecting a persistent effort by Washington to counter China's dominance in the drone industry. However, industry insiders and analysts express skepticism about the feasibility of removing these drones from U.S. supply chains. China's firms are world leaders, and there are few non-Chinese alternatives, leading to concerns that a ban would significantly raise costs for commercial operators. One industry professional views the executive order more as a negotiation tactic than a practical policy, given the economic realities of the global drone market.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for an email claiming that President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal income taxes for most beneficiaries. Critics, including former SSA officials, have labeled the statement "blatant misinformation" and a "lie," pointing out the bill only provides a temporary tax deduction, not a full elimination of taxes. The move has been condemned as a partisan politicization of a traditionally apolitical agency. The legislation provides a temporary deduction that phases out for higher-income seniors, rather than a permanent structural change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas have stated they were caught off guard by the deadly flash floods that killed at least 32 people on July 4th. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly explained that while the region frequently experiences floods, they had "no reason to believe" the event would be so catastrophic. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night while many residents were asleep. The rapid and extreme nature of the flooding, which surpassed a 1987 record, left little time for warnings or evacuations.</p>

          <p>Newport Beach lifeguards performed 350 rescues on July 4th as dangerous surf conditions created powerful rip currents. In one dramatic incident, a "monster rip current" pulled more than 10 swimmers far from shore, requiring a large-scale rescue effort involving lifeboats and aerial support from a police helicopter. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for strong rip currents and high surf for coastal areas across Southern California through the holiday weekend. Officials continue to urge beachgoers to exercise extreme caution due to the hazardous swimming conditions.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted raids in Southern California on July 4th, continuing an operation that has resulted in over 1,600 arrests.

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly halted a shipment of military aid to Ukraine, including crucial air defense missiles, for the third time. The decision was allegedly based on concerns that US weapons stockpiles are too low, a claim that Democratic members of the House Armed Services Committee say is unsubstantiated by data. The move, which surprised Congress and European allies, comes as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukrainian cities. The White House defended the pause as a necessary review to align military assistance with America's defense priorities.</p>

          <p>Human rights organizations report a severe humanitarian crisis in the Bialowieza National Park on the Polish-Belarusian border. Migrants, encouraged by Belarus to cross into the EU, face a five-meter steel fence that causes serious injuries like broken bones and deep cuts. Activist groups like Grupa Granica provide essential aid but report that Polish border guards often push injured asylum-seekers back into Belarus, a practice enabled by Poland's suspension of asylum rights at that border. The situation leaves migrants trapped, injured, and without legal recourse in the remote forest.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police arrested 29 people in London on suspicion of terrorism offenses during a protest in support of Palestine Action. The demonstration occurred on the same day the group was officially proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. This designation makes expressing support for Palestine Action a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The ban followed an incident where the group claimed responsibility for causing millions in damages to military aircraft. Protesters held placards reading "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action."</p>
