          <p>Authorities are investigating a shooting incident at the ABC10 news station in Sacramento, California, where gunfire struck the building on Friday afternoon while employees were working inside. Reports indicate at least three bullet holes in a window, with shots fired from a vehicle that quickly fled the scene. Fortunately, no injuries were sustained by anyone in the building, though the event caused significant alarm. This incident follows a protest outside the station the previous day, concerning ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel over comments about a conservative activist's assassination. Police have not yet released details on a motive or suspects, but the context points to heightened tensions around media outlets.</p>

          <p>Estonia has formally requested urgent consultations with NATO members after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes on Friday. Estonia's foreign ministry condemned the incursion as "brazen" and a "clear provocation," noting the jets lacked flight plans, had transponders off, and did not communicate with air traffic control. NATO responded immediately, intercepting the aircraft and calling it "reckless Russian behavior," while Russia denied any violation. This serious incident, following recent incursions into Polish and Romanian airspace, has significantly escalated tensions between the alliance and Russia, prompting calls for a united and strong response and further military asset deployment to NATO's eastern flank.</p>

Amidst heightened cross-strait tensions, the exhibition highlights the island's proactive efforts to deter Beijing's growing military pressure. The Chiang-Kong system is designed to intercept enemy ballistic missiles at medium altitudes, significantly boosting Taiwan's layered missile defense from its current lower-tier coverage and marking a crucial advancement in its national security posture.</p>

National issues, particularly the Trump administration's sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, are taking center stage, given Virginia's substantial federal employee population. The campaign's final stretch is also unfolding less than two weeks after the fatal assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an event that has heightened fears about political violence and prompted increased security for candidates.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Friday that the Republican Party plans to hold a national convention for the 2026 midterm elections, a gathering typically reserved for presidential election years. Shared via Truth Social, this initiative signals the party's intent to strategically mobilize and maintain its narrow control of Congress. The announcement comes amidst an escalating national battle over congressional redistricting, a process that could significantly determine which party secures the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Trump emphasized that the convention would be both "fun and very productive," underscoring a proactive effort to consolidate support and shape the legislative agenda for the upcoming electoral cycle.</p>

          <p>Yale School of Management Senior Associate Dean Jeff Sonnenfeld has controversially labeled Tesla as "the biggest meme stock we've ever seen," citing its price-to-earnings ratio exceeding 200, which he describes as "crazy" when compared to other major tech companies. Sonnenfeld attributes this valuation to "too much emphasis on the magic wand of Musk," criticizing the board's "foolish" compensation plan for Elon Musk. He also highlighted Tesla's declining market share in Europe and China, advocating for a clear succession plan for the company's leadership. Despite these strong criticisms regarding valuation, Sonnenfeld advised against shorting the stock due to its historical unpredictability. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump stated that the strike killed three "narcoterrorists" and released video footage showing the vessel exploding in flames. This incident marks the third such strike in recent weeks, targeting alleged drug traffickers within the US Southern Command's area of responsibility. The administration justifies these actions by categorizing drug cartels as terrorist organizations, paving the way for military force.

The state transportation department confirmed the company's permit application from June, outlining plans to test its robotaxis within the Phoenix Metro area using safety drivers. This significant development follows Tesla's earlier limited test of its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, which involved a small fleet, a select group of passengers, and strict restrictions. CEO Elon Musk had previously articulated an ambitious goal to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service to approximately half of the U.S. population by the end of this year, making this Arizona approval a crucial advancement toward that objective.</p>

The probe identified at least 43 vendors using stolen business identities, and former employees reported pressure to approve seller applications, even with concerns. While Walmart has since tightened vetting for some categories, critics argue its historically lax policies, compared to Amazon, have made it a "dumping ground" for bad actors, severely risking consumer safety and eroding trust in the platform.</p>

          <p>This article clarifies the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) role and its authority to regulate broadcast licenses, amidst President Trump's recent suggestions that television networks critical of him should have their licenses revoked. The FCC, established in 1934, primarily regulates local TV and radio stations, requiring them to operate in the "public interest, convenience and necessity." While it does not directly oversee national networks, it can significantly influence them, particularly through its approval of corporate mergers and acquisitions. Experts emphasize that while the FCC possesses broad regulatory leeway, the process of revoking a license is intricate and would likely face legal challenges. The current controversy surrounding Jimmy Kimmel's suspension has brought these rarely invoked regulatory powers into sharp public focus.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the US Supreme Court for a second time to intervene and terminate deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans residing in the United States. The Justice Department filed an emergency application seeking to overturn a federal judge's ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Venezuelans. This action is consistent with President Trump's broader agenda to tighten immigration policies and expand the pool of individuals eligible for deportation. Critics underscore the humanitarian implications of rescinding TPS, a designation specifically intended for countries afflicted by war, natural disaster, or other severe catastrophes, emphasizing the vulnerability of those affected.</p>

          <p>A trade fair in the southern Chinese city of Nanning is serving as a crucial testing ground for Chinese exporters aiming to shift their focus towards Southeast Asian markets. Faced with slowing demand in Western countries, many Chinese companies perceive the region's fast-growing economies and young consumer base as a significant and attractive opportunity. This strategic pivot is intended to expand their overseas footprints and cultivate new international buyers. The article highlights a manager from an electric scooter manufacturer, who explicitly noted that while Western markets are nearing saturation, Southeast Asia offers "huge potential," signaling a broader and intentional reorientation of Chinese export strategies in response to global economic shifts.</p>

          <p>A US federal judge dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, criticizing the complaint's language as "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge ruled that the 85-page lawsuit was excessively long and contained "tedious and burdensome" language that bore no relevance to the legal merits of the complaint. Trump's legal team has been granted 28 days to refile an amended complaint, with strict instructions that it must be presented "in a professional and dignified manner" and not exceed 40 pages. This lawsuit, part of a broader pattern of legal actions against media organizations critical of him, alleged that the newspaper's articles and a book aimed to undermine his 2024 presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner publicly defended Jimmy Kimmel after ABC, owned by Disney, indefinitely suspended the late-night host from his show. Eisner sharply criticized the network's decision as "out-of-control intimidation," directly linking it to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's aggressive threats of regulatory action against ABC. He questioned the absence of leadership willing to defend the First Amendment against such pressures, implicitly suggesting a "cowardly corporate capitulation" by the network. Eisner, who led Disney for over two decades, expressed his strong disagreement with ABC's move, praising Kimmel as "very talented and funny," and highlighting the broader implications for free speech and the independence of media organizations.</p>

          <p>Extensive federal security measures are being implemented for the memorial service of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, anticipated to draw over 100,000 attendees to State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. With President Trump and Vice President JD Vance expected to be present, the event has received a Special Event Assessment Rating Level 1 (SEAR-1), comparable to the Super Bowl. Federal law enforcement agencies are actively tracking "several threats of unknown credibility" against those planning to attend, although no verified or credible plot has been identified. Local police, bolstered by federal assistance, are deploying uniformed and plain-clothes officers, drones, 300 surveillance cameras, and counterterrorism sniper teams to ensure the safety and security of all participants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent threats to revoke broadcast station licenses for networks he perceives as "against" him, echoed by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, are bringing the government's significant power over media into sharp focus. This article explains that major networks like ABC require over-the-air spectrum licenses from the federal government, which obligates them to operate in the "public interest, convenience and necessity." While the FCC has the authority to regulate content and approve corporate mergers, revoking a license is a complex and legally challenging process. The ongoing controversy, particularly involving Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, underscores the unprecedented nature of these politically motivated threats and their broader implications for free speech and media independence.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning songwriter Brett James, widely celebrated for co-writing Carrie Underwood's iconic hit "Jesus, Take the Wheel," tragically died at 57 in a single-engine plane crash in North Carolina. All three individuals aboard the Cirrus SR22T perished when the aircraft went down "under unknown circumstances" in a wooded area near Macon County Airport. Carrie Underwood expressed profound sorrow, calling his death "unfathomable" and praising his genuine faith, which was often reflected in their collaborative songs. James, an inductee into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, also penned numerous hits for artists including Taylor Swift and Jason Aldean. The National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation into the cause of this tragic accident.</p>

          <p>Remnants of Tropical Storm Mario unleashed inches of rain, triggering severe mudslides that battered several San Bernardino Mountain communities in Southern California. Residents in areas like Forest Falls reported extensive mud debris pouring into backyards, submerging vehicles, and toppling residential propane tanks, causing gas leaks. One resident vividly described his neighbor "barely hung on" as mud blasted through his home, destroying a deck and garage. The intense downpours followed recent wildfires, which left the landscape particularly vulnerable to such events. Despite the widespread destruction and trauma, a heartwarming moment of relief occurred when a missing pitbull, Daisy, was found alive and successfully reunited with her owner amidst the recovery efforts.</p>
