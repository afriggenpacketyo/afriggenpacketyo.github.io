          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been characterized by swift and sweeping changes, sparking both support and criticism. Key turning points include aggressive budget cuts led by Elon Musk's "Department of Government Efficiency," resulting in agency shutdowns and public outcry. The administration's immigration crackdown, including deportations to El Salvador, has raised legal concerns, while conflicts with academic, media, and corporate worlds have intensified. Trump's approach to diversity initiatives has led to their rollback, raising questions about the long-term impact on American society.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly accused Ronen Bar, the head of Israel's domestic security agency, Shin Bet, of lying to the country's Supreme Court. The accusation is part of a legal dispute over Netanyahu's attempt to remove Bar from his position, citing a lack of trust. The conflict involves dueling affidavits, with Bar alleging that Netanyahu's decision stemmed from a desire for personal loyalty rather than professional considerations.</p>
