          <p>World-leading battery scientist Guo Zaiping has left her post in Australia to join City University of Hong Kong as a chair professor of energy materials. After a two-decade career at the University of Adelaide, her move marks a significant talent acquisition for Hong Kong's top-ranked materials science program. Guo is celebrated for her groundbreaking work in advanced energy storage materials, which has the potential to significantly improve the performance and range of electric vehicle batteries. Her appointment is seen as a major boost for the university's research capabilities in a critical technological field.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Plans Reforms to Protect Pubs and Music Venues from Noise Complaints</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 03:16:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing changes to licensing rules to shield pubs and music venues from noise complaints, aiming to revitalize struggling town centers. The reforms would require developers building near existing venues to soundproof new properties and would fast-track permissions for new businesses in designated areas. This initiative seeks to promote outdoor dining and reverse the decline in the pub industry, which has seen numerous closures. While the government touts the plan as cutting red tape, the opposition criticizes it as hypocritical, citing other tax policies they claim have harmed the hospitality sector.</p>

          <p>A stampede at the Mansa Devi temple in Haridwar, northern India, has resulted in the deaths of at least six people and left more than 30 others injured. The tragic incident occurred when a high-voltage electric wire fell onto a crowded path, causing widespread panic among the thousands of devotees gathered at the popular Hindu pilgrimage site. This event is the latest in a series of deadly crowd crushes in India this year, highlighting ongoing safety challenges at large religious gatherings. Authorities have since brought the situation under control and are conducting relief and rescue operations.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian President John Mahama has introduced a plan to establish a "24-hour economy" by having key industries operate in three eight-hour shifts daily. The initiative aims to diversify the nation's economy, create up to 1.7 million jobs, and shift Ghana from an import-based model to self-sufficiency. However, economists raise concerns about its feasibility, pointing to a required $4 billion investment, existing national debt, and infrastructural challenges like an unreliable power supply. While the policy is seen as innovative, its success hinges on securing funding and overcoming practical hurdles to transform the country's economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

In response, the Indian government has acknowledged the problem and is implementing measures to provide psychological support.

          <p>A senior official in China's Jilin province has called for a clearer presentation of the history of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region, raising potential diplomatic tensions with South Korea. The official referred to the Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai kingdoms by their Chinese names, which are known internationally by their Korean names: Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae. This contested history has long been a sensitive issue, as both nations lay claim to the heritage of these kingdoms. The call to frame this history within China's "century of humiliation" narrative risks reigniting historical disputes.</p>

          <h2>China's Censorship of Deadly Mass Attacks Sparks Online Complaints</h2>

          <p>The Chinese government is increasingly suppressing news coverage of mass attacks, such as incidents where drivers strike pedestrians, leading to public complaints online about the lack of information. Since a particularly deadly attack in November, authorities have tightened control, often scrubbing photos and reports from the internet or releasing vague police statements that omit key details. This information control, a hallmark of Xi Jinping's rule, is seen as a way to prevent copycat crimes and unrest. However, the censorship has prompted some citizens to push back, demanding transparency from local governments.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that threatens to permanently fracture the war-torn country. The new administration, with RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as president, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government. This development stokes fears of escalating the 27-month civil war, which has already displaced millions and killed an estimated 150,000 people. UN officials warned that the formation of a parallel government risks further fragmenting Sudan and undermining diplomatic efforts to resolve the devastating conflict.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced he had spoken with the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia, pressing them for an immediate ceasefire following deadly border clashes. Both nations thanked him for his efforts and expressed a willingness to de-escalate, with Cambodia agreeing to the ceasefire and Thailand stressing the need for dialogue first. However, shelling reportedly continued along the border after the calls. The U.S. president's intervention comes just before new U.S. tariffs on both countries are set to take effect, with Trump stating that trade talks cannot resume until the fighting stops.</p>

          <p>A new, non-peer-reviewed research paper has controversially hypothesized that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS could be a piece of hostile alien technology. The paper, co-authored by Harvard astronomer Abraham Loeb, suggests the object's anomalous characteristics could be consistent with an extraterrestrial intelligence probe. The authors perform a "pedagogical exercise" exploring this possibility, noting the object's trajectory offers optimal access to Earth, with a potential arrival in late 2025. However, other experts have dismissed these claims as "nonsense," believing the object is simply a large, natural comet.</p>

          <p>Turkey has recorded its highest-ever temperature, hitting 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 Fahrenheit) in the southeastern town of Silopi. This new record comes as the country, along with much of the eastern Mediterranean, endures a severe and prolonged heatwave. The extreme heat, exacerbated by strong winds and dry conditions, has fueled dozens of disastrous wildfires across the nation, forcing evacuations in several provinces, including near the popular resort city of Antalya. President Erdogan has described the situation as a "great disaster," with thousands of personnel battling the widespread blazes.</p>

          <p>The Boston Red Sox defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2, with Red Sox pitcher Garrett Crochet overcoming a rocky start to stifle the Dodgers' offense. Despite giving up two home runs in the first inning, Crochet settled in to strike out 10 batters over six innings, preventing further damage. Dodgers veteran Clayton Kershaw struggled to hold the early lead, giving up three runs in the second inning and another in the fifth. The Dodgers' attempts to manufacture runs were thwarted by aggressive but unsuccessful baserunning and key strikeouts, including a final out by pinch-hitter Mookie Betts.</p>

          <p>Greece is fighting five major wildfires across the country, prompting evacuations in a region just north of Athens as a severe heatwave continues. High winds and temperatures forecast to reach 44°C (111°F) are fanning the flames, which have destroyed homes and forest areas. The government has requested assistance from the European Union for additional firefighting aircraft to combat the blazes in Attica, the island of Evia, and other regions.

          <p>China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security has officially recognized "drone flight planner" as one of 17 new occupations. This move reflects the rapid growth of the country's "low-altitude economy," which encompasses activities up to 1,000 meters and is considered a strategic emerging industry by Beijing. The new role involves planning flight paths for multiple drones, developing mission plans, and managing on-site operations. The designation is expected to attract tech-savvy young people and help create jobs as China aims to stimulate economic growth through innovation in this sector.</p>
