          <p>The UK is set to bolster its defense capabilities with a £1.5 billion investment in bomb factories and a commitment to purchasing 7,000 long-range weapons, according to the Sunday Telegraph. The Sunday Times reports that British fighter jets will carry nuclear bombs as part of the biggest defense expansion since the Cold War. Other headlines include concerns about junior doctors' strikes and political commentary on Prime Minister Starmer's handling of border control, as well as celebrity news about Dani Dyer's wedding and a businessman accused of spying for China.

          <p>A viral TikTok trend suggests that a "McMigraine Meal" consisting of a full-fat coke and salty fries can alleviate migraine symptoms, though medical experts remain skeptical. While some individuals report that the caffeine and sugar in coke, or the salt in fries, may provide temporary relief, experts warn against relying on this method. Dr. Kay Kennis notes that caffeine can disrupt nerve activity, but excessive caffeine can also trigger migraines. Neurologist Peter Goadsby emphasizes the importance of lifestyle changes and listening to one's body, rather than relying on social media trends, for migraine management. </p>

The actions are attributed to concerns about antisemitism and a perceived lack of conservative viewpoints at the university. While some see this as an effort to reshape universities in a more conservative image, others fear it undermines academic independence.

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League victory marks a significant achievement for Qatar Sports Investments, which has heavily invested in the club since 2011. Despite past near misses and player departures, PSG's 5-0 win against Inter Milan showcases the success of Qatar's strategy. However, the victory also raises questions about state ownership in football, as PSG's Qatari connections have faced criticism. While Paris celebrates, the win underscores the growing influence of Qatari investment in European football. </p>

          <h2>IFS Warns of Tough Choices Ahead in UK Spending Review</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for key sectors. The level of NHS funding will significantly impact potential cuts to other unprotected areas like schools and the criminal justice system. The government's decision to front-load spending earlier in the term means future spending increases will slow down. With the Chancellor ruling out further borrowing and tax increases, spending cuts are likely, potentially affecting plans to increase police numbers and cap bus fares. </p>

          <p>The ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has come into force across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. While shops can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices, the ban targets disposable vapes, which are seen as a key driver in the rise of youth vaping. Retailers violating the ban face fines. Vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, but long-term risks are still unknown, and health experts emphasize the need for further regulation. </p>

          <p>A Singapore-based scientist has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be hacked due to tiny delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could be exploited by eavesdroppers in an attack. Quantum communication, which relies on quantum physics-based cryptography, is theoretically unhackable, but flaws in experimental implementation can create vulnerabilities. The researcher, Alexander Miller, analyzed data from Micius and found time delays between lasers on the quantum transmitter, indicating insecurity in the distribution of quantum keys. </p>
