          <p>Authorities in Tennessee have arrested three individuals for allegedly assisting a suspect wanted in the murders of four relatives of an infant who was found abandoned but safe. The primary suspect, Austin Robert Drummond, remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous, with a combined reward of up to $32,500 offered for information leading to his capture. Investigators believe the attack was targeted, as Drummond had a relationship with the family. The infant is now in state care while the extensive manhunt for the main perpetrator continues across the region.</p>

          <p>A growing Legionnaires’ disease outbreak in the Harlem area of New York City has resulted in two deaths and at least 58 confirmed cases of illness. Health officials are urging residents, especially those over 50 or with compromised immune systems, to seek immediate medical care if they experience flu-like symptoms. The disease, a type of pneumonia, is caused by Legionella bacteria found in warm water sources like cooling towers and is not transmissible from person to person. Authorities are working to identify the source of the cluster and emphasize that early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are effective.</p>

          <p>A city in China is now requiring individuals purchasing medication for chikungunya fever to provide personal information, a measure previously used during the COVID-19 pandemic to track potential unreported cases. This policy comes in response to a local outbreak of the mosquito-borne viral disease. Chikungunya, which is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and not person-to-person, causes debilitating symptoms but is rarely fatal. The registration system aims to help public health authorities monitor the spread of the illness by identifying individuals with relevant symptoms or recent mosquito bites.</p>

Clean-up and restoration efforts are underway, but authorities warn the recovery will take time.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a drop in second-quarter revenue, attributing the decline to lower prices for crude oil and refined chemical products. Despite the decrease, the company's net income still surpassed analyst expectations, and it anticipates a significant increase in oil demand for the second half of the year. The state-owned oil giant is set to boost its output as OPEC+ members unwind voluntary production cuts. Aramco also declared its base and performance-linked dividends, maintaining its commitment to shareholder returns even as its debt-to-equity ratio slightly increased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, President Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, claiming without evidence that the numbers were "rigged." The move has drawn widespread criticism for potentially undermining the credibility of essential economic data, with experts noting that the commissioner does not personally compile the figures. This action occurred alongside directives for criminal investigations into former officials like James Comey and John Brennan, as well as Barack Obama, regarding the 2016 Russia probe.

          <p>Recent scientific research is investigating the connection between psychological stress and the molecular signs of aging within human DNA. A new hypothesis suggests that specific "zombie-like" cells, which stop dividing but remain active, could play a key role in how the brain ages and responds to stress. Scientists are exploring whether managing or eliminating these senescent cells could offer a new pathway to mitigate the negative effects of stress on the body. This emerging field of study could potentially lead to novel interventions for age-related decline and stress-induced cellular damage.</p>

New Delhi asserted its oil imports were a "vital national compulsion" for energy security and were even encouraged by the U.S. to stabilize global markets.

          <p>Thirty years after Croatia's "Operation Storm," the military offensive that effectively ended its war of independence, the event is remembered with deeply divided perspectives. In Croatia, it is celebrated as a heroic victory and a day of national thanksgiving, marked by a large military parade in Zagreb. Conversely, Serbia views it as a tragic "pogrom" that led to the mass expulsion and murder of Serbian civilians, commemorating it with solemn ceremonies. The starkly different interpretations highlight the persistent and unresolved ethnic tensions and historical grievances that continue to shape political discourse in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Representatives from over 170 nations are meeting again to attempt to finalize a legally binding global treaty aimed at addressing the plastic pollution crisis. After two years of negotiations, key disagreements remain, particularly over whether to cap plastic production levels. A coalition of nearly 100 countries supports production limits, but oil-producing nations are resisting, favoring a focus on recycling instead. The treaty also seeks to ban harmful chemicals, establish universal design standards to improve recycling, and create a financing mechanism to support the transition, as plastic waste continues to pose a severe threat to ecosystems and human health.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Poland's Recent Election Results Signal a Potential Return to Populist Rule</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Poland is sliding back towards right-wing populism less than two years after a liberal democratic coalition ousted the Law and Justice party. The victory of a populist-backed presidential candidate and declining support for Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government suggest the liberal win may have been a brief "intermezzo." The author contends that post-populist governments often get bogged down in reversing their predecessors' actions and fail to offer a compelling future vision. The piece warns that without an imaginative and forward-thinking agenda, liberal democrats globally risk losing ground to populist forces.</p>

          <p>China is advancing its airborne surveillance capabilities with the development of a new early warning and control (AWACS) aircraft, designated the KJ-3000. The new plane is based on a modified Y-20B transport aircraft, distinguished by a large, rotating radar dome on its fuselage designed to house an array of advanced sensors. Recent footage of a prototype suggests Beijing remains committed to this type of airborne command post, even as some other militaries have shifted strategies. The KJ-3000 represents the next generation of China's AWACS fleet, intended to enhance its long-range detection and battlefield management capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced a new plan to support its domestic cattle industry in response to falling prices and strong competition from imported beef. The policy aims to increase local production and introduce a quality-grading system to encourage consumption of higher-quality domestic meat. This initiative is part of a broader government strategy to bolster key agricultural sectors and enhance the appeal of local products. Officials noted that there is significant room for growth in high-quality protein consumption among Chinese residents as part of a more balanced diet.</p>

          <p>A new report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas identifies artificial intelligence as a growing factor in U.S. job losses, accounting for over 10,000 cuts in the first seven months of 2025. The technology sector has been most affected, with layoffs increasing significantly compared to the previous year. The report also notes a decline in entry-level corporate job listings, suggesting AI is beginning to reshape the labor market for new graduates. While other factors like federal budget cuts currently have a larger impact, the data indicates AI's role in workforce reductions is becoming more prominent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City police arrested more than 40 demonstrators at a protest organized by the Jewish-American group IfNotNow to demand an end to the war in Gaza. Hundreds gathered to call on the Trump administration to pressure Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into the territory amid reports of starvation. Protesters, including prominent community figures, held signs reading "stop ethnic cleansing" and "not in our name" before marching to the Trump International hotel, where the arrests occurred for blocking traffic. The mobilization was described as one of the broadest Jewish community coalitions to protest the atrocities in Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a federal appeals court ruling, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order that partially limited the ban, stating it could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. This directive means that for now, migrants will be processed under existing U.S. immigration law rather than the emergency proclamation. The development marks a significant legal setback for the administration's hardline immigration policies, which have faced numerous challenges in court.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire, named the Gifford fire, is burning out of control in central California's Los Padres National Forest, having scorched over 72,000 acres and threatening more than 450 structures.
