            <p>The United States is considering ending its efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine due to a lack of progress, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Rubio indicated that a decision on whether a truce can be reached needs to be made within days, as the US has "other priorities to focus on". This announcement comes as Ukraine and the US signed a memorandum of intent to establish an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction, aiming to finalize the deal by April 26. The US has resisted providing Kyiv with security guarantees to support any future ceasefire.</p>

            <p>U.S. airstrikes targeting the Ras Isa oil port controlled by Yemen's Houthi rebels resulted in dozens of deaths and injuries, according to Houthi sources. Central Command stated the strikes aimed to eliminate a fuel source for the Houthis, denying them revenue used to fund regional activities. The Houthis and Iran condemned the attack as a violation of Yemen's sovereignty. The U.S. also accused a Chinese satellite company of supporting Houthi attacks, further internationalizing the conflict.</p>

            <p>Climate scientist argues that the climate crisis is not merely a problem of physics but a crisis of justice, deeply intertwined with inequality and colonial structures. The impact of extreme weather events varies based on local economic, social, and political conditions, highlighting the role of vulnerability and exposure in turning weather into a disaster. Colonialism and inequality contribute to infrastructure deficits and exacerbate the effects of climate change, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities.

The party doubled the minimum wage, expanded social programs, and clamped down on worker outsourcing. However, progressives should note that Morena also made expedient moves to the right, cutting deals with big business and avoiding tax reform.</p>

            <p>The author expresses concern over President Trump's trade policies, which are causing uncertainty and disrupting global trade. The chaos surrounding Trump's executive orders related to tariffs is freezing business activity. The author questions why voices in defense of rules-based multilateralism are not speaking out more forcefully. Many believe the US legal system may yet bring the president down from the clouds. The uncertainty alone is inflicting harm. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The NHL's current playoff format, implemented in 2014, is facing criticism for creating predictable matchups and failing to foster intense rivalries. The format, which prioritizes divisional standings, often results in the same teams facing each other repeatedly in the first round. Some suggest overhauling the regular-season points system to incentivize regulation wins and shift the overall standings. However, Commissioner Gary Bettman defends the current format.</p>

Analysts suggest this disruption could exacerbate price volatility and force China to diversify its sources of rare earth elements. Myanmar is a key supplier of dysprosium and terbium, essential for high-temperature magnets.</p>
