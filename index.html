          <p>President Trump authorized the deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to violent clashes between protesters and authorities over immigration enforcement operations conducted by ICE. California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that approximately 300 National Guard troops are on the ground, fewer than the 2,000 authorized by the Trump administration. House Speaker Mike Johnson voiced his support for the president's decision, while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized California's Democratic leaders for allegedly failing to protect their citizens. The Los Angeles Police Department reported eleven arrests during Saturday's protests, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department clarified their role was limited to traffic and crowd control.</p>

          <p>Enrique Anaya, a constitutional lawyer and vocal critic of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, was arrested on charges of money laundering, prompting concerns from human rights organizations about the silencing of government critics.

Anaya, who recently described Bukele as a dictator, was arrested at his home in Santa Tecla.

          <p>Ezra Klein's book, "Abundance," has sparked debate within the Democratic Party, with some viewing it as a potential savior and others as a threat to anti-corporate populist ideals. The book critiques how Democrats have governed in areas where they hold power, focusing on the question of what is preventing the acquisition of more essential resources. Some on the populist left object to this focus, arguing that concentrated power, not bottlenecks, is the primary problem. This divide highlights the ongoing reimagining of the Democratic Party following recent electoral losses.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has ignited tensions. Despite the LAPD's assertion that protests were largely peaceful, the Trump administration cited injuries to immigration agents and slow local law enforcement response as justification. Over California Governor Gavin Newsom's objections, Trump federalized 2,000 California National Guard soldiers, with the possibility of deploying active duty Marines, a move criticized as an infringement on states' rights and an escalation of tensions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, common arguments often stem from tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. Contempt, signaled through tone, is a significant predictor of divorce, highlighting the importance of respectful communication. Arguments about family often reflect unmet needs and value clashes, requiring reassurance and mutual support. Uneven distribution of household labor, including the often-unacknowledged 'invisible load,' is another frequent source of conflict, which can be addressed by openly acknowledging and redistributing tasks. Navigating communication styles requires strategies like the 'five second rule' to prevent escalation and promote understanding.</p>

The administration's unwillingness to defer to local law enforcement and the rapid escalation of federal involvement have prompted fury among Democratic officials.

          <p>President Trump deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles amidst protests against ICE raids, a move critics view as an authoritarian flex to crush dissent.

Senator Chris Murphy criticized Trump's intent to inflame and divide, accusing his movement of lacking belief in democracy or protest. In contrast to 2020, where Trump failed to activate the National Guard during the Capitol siege, this deployment targets California, a Democrat-dominated state.</p>

          <p>Despite Germany's 2-0 defeat to France in the Nations League third-placed playoff, goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen's performance was a bright spot, as he repelled several French counterattacks. Coach Julian Nagelsmann has designated Ter Stegen as the team's first-choice goalkeeper following Manuel Neuer's retirement. However, Ter Stegen's lack of playing time at Barcelona, where he has been largely ignored in favor of Wojciech Szczesny, raises concerns about his rhythm. Reports suggest he is determined to fight for his place at the club.</p>
