        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department is set to withdraw from police reform agreements with Louisville and Minneapolis, which were established after the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, respectively. The DOJ's Civil Rights Division also intends to conclude investigations into police departments in Phoenix, Trenton, Memphis, Mount Vernon, Oklahoma City, and the Louisiana State Police. This decision reflects a shift away from federal oversight of local policing, with Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon arguing that such decrees transfer control to unelected bureaucrats. This move signals a significant change in the approach to police reform under the current administration.</p>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require vaccine makers to conduct clinical trials before approving them for broader use. This decision, outlined by FDA officials in The New England Journal of Medicine, aims to balance access for vulnerable populations with the need for more evidence for the general population. Vaccine manufacturers are urged to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials for healthy individuals between 6 months and 64 years old. Dr. Céline Gounder notes that this change may limit booster access for those under 65, while Pfizer and Moderna have expressed commitment to working with the FDA.</p>

          <p>Tax cuts promoted by the Trump administration are intensifying worries about debt and deficits among bond investors, influencing interest rates. The bond market is reacting negatively to the proposed tax cuts, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising above 4.5% and the 30-year yield jumping above 5%. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, cautioned that Treasury market volatility could increase economic uncertainty.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is moving to end federal oversight of police departments in Minneapolis, Louisville, and other cities with histories of civil rights violations. This decision reverses Biden-era efforts to implement consent decrees, which mandate federal supervision of police reforms. Harmeet K. Dhillon, head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, argues that these decrees undermine local control and are factually unjustified. While Minneapolis officials plan to proceed with reforms regardless, critics warn that federal oversight is crucial for lasting change.</p>
