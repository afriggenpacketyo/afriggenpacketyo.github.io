          <p>Amid uncertainty over US commitments and the ongoing threat from Russia, Germany is deepening its security and defense cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a new "E3" alliance. Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, focusing on mutual assistance and arms cooperation. This strategic pivot reflects a European effort to build greater self-reliance in defense, although officials acknowledge that replacing the US security guarantee entirely is currently unrealistic. The move also comes as Germany navigates strained relations with other partners like Poland over border control issues.</p>

          <p>Andy Byron, the CEO of data technology company Astronomer, has resigned following a viral video controversy. Byron was filmed at a Coldplay concert embracing the company's chief people officer, leading to public speculation of an affair, which was fueled when the concert's lead singer commented on the moment. The company, which recently secured a $93 million investment round, launched a formal investigation and placed Byron on leave. In a statement, Astronomer emphasized that its leaders are expected to meet high standards of conduct and accountability.</p>

          <p>During the third round of The Open championship, golfer Rory McIlroy experienced a highly unusual moment on the 11th hole. While hitting his ball from the rough, his swing unearthed a second, previously hidden golf ball that was buried directly underneath his own. The bizarre incident, which McIlroy called the "most weird, ridiculous thing," was caught on camera and left him in disbelief. Despite the strange event and a bogey on that hole, McIlroy had a strong round, finishing 5-under par for the day.</p>

          <p>Reports from Ukraine indicate that individuals with serious pre-existing mental and physical health conditions are being drafted into the military. Cases include a man with a long-standing psychiatric disorder and others with severe physical ailments who were deemed fit for service, often due to outdated or incomplete medical records. Human rights officials have received thousands of complaints, acknowledging that while some are unfounded, systemic issues in the conscription medical examination process exist. This situation raises concerns about the well-being of the recruits and the operational effectiveness and safety of their units.</p>

          <p>This week marks the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler.

The conspirators were quickly executed, but the event has become a powerful symbol of German resistance to the Nazi regime.

The article explores the challenges and strategies of promoting this message in an era of shifting sexual norms and the pervasive influence of social media. The activists attempt to reframe chastity not merely as abstinence, but as a "countercultural" path to deeper, more meaningful relationships, arguing it offers an alternative to the perceived superficiality and pressures of modern dating. Their approach focuses on a broader concept of dignity and self-worth.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upcoming upper house election, far-right political parties are capitalizing on growing public concern over immigration and tourism to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are echoing nationalist sentiments, blaming foreigners for crime and social disruption, and opposing reliance on foreign labor despite Japan's severe worker shortages. This political strategy, inspired by movements like Donald Trump's in the US, aims to resonate with voters who feel their economic struggles and cultural norms are threatened by outside influences.</p>

          <p>A government report has concluded that the 2024 building collapse in George, South Africa, which killed 34 construction workers, was "entirely preventable." The investigation revealed that multiple red flags, including the use of substandard materials and visible structural cracks, were ignored for up to a year before the tragedy. A health and safety officer had even resigned in protest, yet work continued. Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson called for criminal accountability for the negligence, as survivors and victims' families continue to deal with trauma and financial hardship.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise more quickly than initially anticipated. Muncy, who was injured in a slide on July 2, has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings, reporting that his knee feels great. Doctors informed him that a slight difference in the timing of the impact could have resulted in a season-ending surgery. While no firm timeline is set for his return, the team is optimistic it will be "a lot sooner than anticipated," providing a potential boost for the struggling Dodgers offense.</p>

          <p>Russia launched another large-scale overnight air assault on Ukraine, utilizing over 340 drones and 35 missiles, resulting in at least three deaths and multiple injuries. The attacks targeted ten different regions, with significant strikes reported in Odesa, where a residential building was hit, and the eastern city of Pavlohrad. President Zelenskyy stated that critical infrastructure was damaged in the northeastern Sumy region, causing power outages. This bombardment is part of an intensified Russian campaign, and Ukraine continues to appeal for more advanced air defense systems from its allies.</p>

          <p>In an escalation of a diplomatic dispute, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked the US visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court judges. This action is part of the White House's campaign to support former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for an alleged coup attempt. Rubio described the prosecution as a "political witch hunt." The move has been denounced by Brazil's current president, Lula da Silva, as an unacceptable infringement on his country's judicial system and national sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The second-quarter earnings season is underway, with early results from major financial and healthcare companies presenting a mixed but generally manageable picture. While some firms like Wells Fargo and Abbott Labs faced stock pullbacks due to conservative outlooks, underlying business metrics showed areas of strength, such as BlackRock's organic growth. The reports indicate that companies are navigating a complex economic environment shaped by inflation and potential tariffs. This article suggests that initial negative market reactions may be short-sighted, as deeper analysis often reveals a more resilient corporate landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's brain-implant company, Neuralink, registered itself as a "small disadvantaged business" (SDB) in an April federal filing. This designation is intended to help businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals gain preferential access to government contracts. The filing occurred shortly before a funding round valued the company at $9 billion and while Musk was leading a government efficiency initiative. A Neuralink spokesperson stated the box on the form was checked erroneously and has since been corrected, and that the company never applied for or received any federal benefits.</p>

The river, known as the Brahmaputra in India, is a vital water source for the region, and the dam could have major geopolitical and environmental implications.</p>
