          <p>A 61-year-old man from Birmingham has been found guilty of stalking television and radio presenter Myleene Klass and her Classic FM colleague Katie Breathwick. The court heard that Peter Windsor sent numerous unwanted and alarming items to the women between 2020 and 2024, including a gun, handcuffs, and a DIY will-writing kit. Ms. Klass testified about the "sheer terror" she experienced upon learning of the disturbing gifts sent to her London studio workplace. The verdict concludes a trial where Windsor had denied two counts of stalking causing serious alarm or distress.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals surged over 220% in premarket trading after the White House announced it was taking a 10% stake in the company. The $35.6 million investment is part of a U.S. initiative to develop domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper and cobalt, focusing on Alaska's Ambler mining district. This move reverses a Biden-era rejection of the Ambler Road project, with the company praising the decision for its potential to bolster national security. However, the project remains controversial due to environmental concerns about its impact on the Alaskan wilderness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their groundbreaking work in quantum mechanics. Their research demonstrated macroscopic quantum tunneling and energy quantization in electrical circuits, phenomena previously considered largely theoretical. This discovery has been fundamental to the development of modern quantum technologies, including the superconducting qubits that form the basis of quantum computers. The laureates' work underpins many advanced technologies used today and is paving the way for a new generation of extremely powerful computing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strategically prolonged the war in Gaza to maintain his grip on power amid numerous political and legal challenges. Facing a potential government collapse, a corruption trial, and an inquiry into the October 7 security failures, a continued state of war has allowed him to delay a political reckoning. The recent U.S.-brokered peace plan, while seemingly pressuring him, may offer a political victory regardless of its success, allowing him to campaign as the leader who defeated Hamas or blame them if it fails. This strategy appears to have successfully navigated him through another period of intense political vulnerability.</p>

          <p>Across Germany, various events were held to mark the second anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, reflecting the country's staunch support for Israel rooted in its historical responsibility. In Berlin, the names of victims were read at the Brandenburg Gate, where 1,000 empty chairs were placed as a memorial. German political leaders, including Chancellor Friedrich Merz, spoke out against a rising wave of antisemitism in the country since the conflict began, calling for solidarity with Jewish communities.

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where she is expected to face questions about the Trump administration's recent actions. Lawmakers are anticipated to probe the indictment of former FBI director James Comey, the legal basis for military strikes on suspected drug boats, and the controversial deployment of National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities like Chicago. The hearing occurs as the administration faces legal challenges from states over the troop deployments and a partial government shutdown continues. Bondi's testimony provides a key moment for congressional oversight of the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>Following devastating Israeli and U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities and the imposition of crippling "snapback" sanctions, Iran is left with a set of poor strategic options. The article explores potential paths, including surrendering its nuclear ambitions, accelerating its program to build a bomb like North Korea, or expanding its ballistic missile and drone capabilities. It also examines the limitations of relying on allies like Russia and China, who have proven unreliable, or seeking a historic compromise that would end its revolutionary project. Each path carries significant risks, leaving Tehran in a desperate position with no clear way to regain its standing or security.</p>

          <p>This article argues that rising anti-Semitic violence in the West, committed in the name of the Palestinian cause, is profoundly damaging to the movement itself. It contends that supporters must unequivocally condemn such acts and be cautious with rhetoric, like "From the river to the sea," that can be misinterpreted as calls for violence or the erasure of Israel. The author asserts that failing to denounce anti-Semitism allows critics to conflate the entire movement with hate, alienates potential allies, and ultimately undermines the goal of achieving a just resolution for Palestinians. The piece calls for a clear separation between legitimate criticism of Israeli policy and anti-Jewish bigotry.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has publicly called on students to not participate in pro-Palestinian protests scheduled for the second anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack. Citing "rising antisemitism," Starmer described holding protests on this specific day as "un-British" and disrespectful, stating that some have used the conflict as a "despicable excuse to attack British Jews." His comments come amid heightened security for Jewish communities following a recent synagogue attack in Manchester. University leaders have also urged protesters to be mindful of the timing, while critics continue to plan demonstrations in several major cities.</p>

The conflict has broadened with Israeli military actions in Lebanon, Syria, and Iran, supported by U.S. intelligence and weapons.

          <h2>Opinion: It is Time to Tell Trump Supporters 'I Told You So' as Policies Fail</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as the negative economic and social consequences of the Trump administration's policies become undeniable, it is not only appropriate but necessary to tell his supporters, "I told you so." The author rejects the notion that this would be counterproductive, stating that years of attempting respectful dialogue have been met with bad faith. Instead, directly confronting the failure of Trump's promises treats his voters as responsible adults rather than victims of "economic anxiety." The piece contends that in an era of rising authoritarianism and historical revisionism, clearly stating this simple truth is a vital act of sanity.</p>

          <h2>Raoul Peck's New Documentary Uses George Orwell's Own Words to Warn About Today's Political Climate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Filmmaker Raoul Peck's new documentary, "Orwell: 2+2=5," uses the writings of George Orwell, voiced by actor Damian Lewis, to create an urgent commentary on contemporary society. The film avoids traditional documentary formats, instead weaving Orwell's insights on power, propaganda, and language with a barrage of modern imagery, from authoritarian leaders to AI-generated content. Peck, known for "I Am Not Your Negro," connects his own experience growing up under a dictatorship to Orwell's warnings about the corruption of truth. The film functions as a powerful essay on how Orwell's dystopian visions are increasingly reflected in the current global political landscape.</p>

          <p>The family of David Adler, a 33-year-old activist from Southern California, is expressing fear and frustration after he was detained by Israeli forces and sent to a desert prison. Adler was part of the Gaza Sumud Flotilla, a convoy of boats attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, which was intercepted by the Israeli navy in international waters. While many European activists have been deported, Adler and other U.S. citizens remain in custody, prompting California congressional members to urge the State Department to secure their immediate release. His family has had no direct contact with him and is relying on foreign government reports for updates.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in a rural part of San Diego County conducted an unusual rescue, freeing a goat that had become tightly wedged between two minivan-sized boulders. The Cal Fire team used specialized pressurized air bags, capable of lifting up to 160,000 pounds, to gently push one of the rocks and create enough space for the animal to be coaxed out. The goat, a beloved member of a family farm, took a tumble from its favorite napping spot but emerged from the ordeal with only a minor injury. The successful rescue was celebrated by the farm's children, who were overjoyed to have their goat returned safely.</p>

          <p>California has become a primary legal challenger to the Trump administration, filing dozens of lawsuits and achieving a high success rate in court. Attorney General Rob Bonta has secured key victories, including a recent ruling that blocked the president from deploying the California National Guard to Portland, Oregon. These legal wins have reportedly restored billions in federal funding for the state and slowed or halted administration policies on immigration and civil rights. Bonta notes that the administration has so far complied with the court orders, affirming the role of the judicial system as a check on executive power.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have approved a plan to remove hundreds of wild horses from the area surrounding Mono Lake in California. The horse population has grown to more than three times the sustainable level, leading to significant environmental damage to the unique landscape, including bird habitats and iconic tufa formations. While environmentalists and ranchers support the roundup to protect the ecosystem, the plan is opposed by animal welfare advocates and local tribes.

          <p>A recent deal announced by President Trump and Pfizer, touted as a major win for American consumers, appears to be more advantageous for the pharmaceutical giant. The agreement, which promises discounts on drugs, largely directs patients to existing cash-discount programs that are impractical for most and still leave many expensive drugs unaffordable. In exchange for these modest price cuts, Pfizer will receive a three-year exemption from potentially costly tariffs on imported drugs. Critics argue the deal lacks transparency and is designed more for political optics than for providing meaningful relief from high prescription drug costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California has enacted a new law requiring streaming services to ensure their commercial advertisements are not significantly louder than the programs they accompany. The legislation, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, extends the principles of the federal CALM Act, which already regulates broadcast and cable TV, to platforms like Netflix and Hulu. The law was championed by a State Senator who was inspired by the common frustration of parents whose sleeping babies are awakened by jarringly loud ads. This move aims to create a more consistent and less disruptive viewing experience for consumers within the state by mandating volume moderation.</p>

          <p>Online shoppers in the U.S. are being hit with surprise bills for hundreds of dollars in tariffs on imported goods following the Trump administration's reversal of the "de minimis" rule. This long-standing policy had allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the country duty-free, but its elimination now means consumers are sometimes responsible for paying the import taxes upon delivery. The change has caused confusion and frustration, with delivery companies like UPS and FedEx scrambling to manage customer complaints and explain the new costs. While large retailers have adapted, smaller overseas businesses often fail to properly bill for or warn about the extra charges.</p>

Speakers called the compact an unconstitutional attack on academic freedom, a "Trojan horse," and antithetical to the university's principles. The proposal demands shifts on issues like diversity, free speech, and gender identity, and has been offered to eight other prominent universities. Interim President Beong-Soo Kim stated that no decision has been made, but he faced a unified faculty urging him to reject any negotiation with the administration.</p>

          <p>A recent after-action report on the catastrophic January firestorms in Los Angeles County has found failures in coordination, training, and evacuation protocols that mirror the findings of a similar report from the 2018 Woolsey fire. Despite previous recommendations, the county's emergency response was again hampered by an ineffective operations center, unclear chains of command, and delayed evacuation warnings that likely contributed to deaths. Experts argue these recurring issues point to a larger, systemic failure to learn from disasters, with responsibility spread too thin across agencies. County officials acknowledge capacity challenges but point to a need for more resources.</p>
