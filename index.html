            <p>Treasury yields experienced a sharp decline on Monday as investors reacted to volatility stemming from global trade uncertainties. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped approximately 11 basis points to 4.382%, while the 2-year Treasury yield decreased by over 10 basis points to 3.849%. These fluctuations followed President Trump's announcement of tariff exemptions on electronic devices, creating uncertainty in the bond market, with some traders speculating whether foreign investors might reduce their Treasury holdings. This article highlights the sensitivity of the bond market to ongoing trade developments. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Four Republican justices on the North Carolina Supreme Court are facing criticism for attempting to overturn the recent reelection of Democratic Justice Allison Riggs. The justices ordered the disenfranchisement of over 5,000 voters in counties that favor Democrats, potentially altering the election outcome where Riggs won by a narrow margin. This move mirrors the constitutional violation seen in Bush v. Gore, where non-uniform election rules were applied after the election, raising concerns about partisan interference in the judicial process. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the certification of the election results, pending further litigation.</p>

            <p>A group of small U.S. businesses has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, seeking to block tariffs imposed on foreign imports. The lawsuit argues that Trump has illegally assumed Congress' power to levy tariffs by claiming trade deficits constitute an emergency. The businesses assert that trade deficits, which have existed for decades, do not represent an unusual or extraordinary threat, and that the tariffs are harming small businesses across the country. The Liberty Justice Center represents the businesses in this legal challenge.</p>

            <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a landmark antitrust trial where the FTC is challenging Meta's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing it gives the company excessive control of the social media market.

Meta defends its acquisitions, arguing the apps have thrived under its ownership and that it faces strong competition from platforms like TikTok and YouTube. The outcome of the trial could significantly impact Meta's revenue and its position in the social media landscape.</p>

            <p>President Trump suggested he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs to allow carmakers time to relocate production to the U.S. He acknowledged the complexity of automakers' supply chains, making it difficult to manufacture vehicles entirely within the United States. Experts predict that the 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars would likely increase car prices significantly. This potential pause reflects the administration's effort to balance reshoring manufacturing with the practical challenges faced by the auto industry.</p>

            <h2>Trump Administration Proposes Deep Cuts to State Department Budget</h2>

            <p>The Trump administration is considering a proposal to slash the State Department budget by nearly half, potentially reducing U.S. international spending significantly. An internal memo outlines a reduction of $27 billion, or 48%, from the budget approved by Congress for 2025. The cuts would drastically decrease funding for humanitarian assistance, global health, and international organizations. The proposal also suggests eliminating support for international organizations like NATO and the UN, and would significantly reduce the State Department workforce.</p>

            <p>U.S. crude oil prices remained steady on Monday after OPEC reduced its demand growth forecast due to President Trump's tariffs. U.S. crude oil rose slightly to $61.53 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent gained 12 cents to settle at $64.88 per barrel. OPEC now projects demand for crude to grow by 1.3 million barrels per day this year and next, a decrease of 150,000 barrels per day from previous estimates. The oil market is facing pressure from both Trump's tariffs and OPEC+'s decision to accelerate production. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Apple's stock jumped after President Trump exempted smartphones and other electronics from tariffs, pushing its market cap back over $3 trillion. Jim Cramer suggests investors should "sell some, keep a lot" of Apple shares, emphasizing the need for optionality given the volatility of trade policies. Despite the recent gains, Apple is still down for the year, and concerns remain about its exposure to China and potential economic impacts from a global trade war. JPMorgan analysts lowered their price target for Apple, citing ongoing economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
