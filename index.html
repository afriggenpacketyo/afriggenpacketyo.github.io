          <p>General He Weidong, a high-ranking official in China's Central Military Commission, has been absent from recent key political events, fueling speculation about his current status. While Beijing has not provided an official explanation for his absence, analysts suggest it is unlikely to significantly impact China's political stability. He Weidong's last public appearance was on March 11, and his absence from a Politburo study session presided over by President Xi Jinping has further intensified scrutiny. This absence comes amid a renewed crackdown on graft in China, as highlighted by a recent anti-corruption series aired on state television.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major companies, including mining giants and energy majors, are increasingly interested in natural hydrogen, also known as white, gold, or geologic hydrogen, as a potential clean energy source. Natural hydrogen is found beneath the Earth's surface, contains no carbon, and produces only water when burned, leading to optimism about its potential to reshape the energy landscape. Exploratory efforts are underway globally, with Canada and the U.S. leading the way, however, critics cite environmental concerns and distribution challenges, while the IEA warns that the resource may be too scattered for economically viable capture. Breakthrough Energy's CTO, Eric Toone, believes hydrogen can be used to make metals, fuels, and even food with fewer emissions.</p>

          <p>A Jewish student at the University of Florida, Tess Segal, was arrested and later banned from campus for participating in a protest advocating for divestment from weapons manufacturers and a boycott of Israeli academic institutions.

          <p>President Trump's policies aimed at protecting the U.S. auto industry through tariffs are being criticized for potentially isolating American automakers and hindering innovation. While tariffs are intended to shield the industry from foreign competition, domestic policies risk cutting it off from advancements in electrification, digitization, and automation. China's significant strides in producing next-generation vehicles, supported by state subsidies, pose a risk to the U.S. auto industry's competitiveness and could impact the nation's capacity to manufacture vital technologies and military equipment.</p>

          <p>Planned changes to school uniform policy in England will affect over four million pupils, with the government aiming to reduce the number of compulsory branded items. The new rule, part of the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, intends to limit branded items to three, plus a tie for secondary students, potentially saving families money. While the government claims parents will save around £50 per child, uniform retailers warn that the changes might increase costs due to the need to replace lower-quality generic garments more frequently.</p>
