          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aiming to dismantle the Department of Education. While Congress alone can abolish the department, this action could severely limit its resources and functions, impacting student loans, funding for low-income students, and civil rights enforcement. Critics argue this decision harms students and families by weakening public education and prioritizing corporate interests.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing Elon Musk's "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE) from accessing Social Security Administration data.  The judge's scathing ruling criticized DOGE's actions as a "fishing expedition" and highlighted concerns about privacy violations affecting millions of Americans. The order mandates the deletion of any non-anonymized personal information already obtained.</p>

          <p>A federal judge deemed the Trump administration's response to his orders regarding deportation flights "woefully insufficient." The administration failed to provide sufficient details about the flights, prompting the judge to set new deadlines and question the government's use of the state-secrets doctrine. The judge's actions follow earlier calls for his impeachment by President Trump.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the deportation of a Georgetown University researcher detained by ICE.
