          <p>Ukrainian drones have targeted Moscow for two consecutive nights, disrupting preparations for Victory Day celebrations, which are expected to be attended by several world leaders. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reported that at least 19 drones were shot down en route to the capital, with debris falling on a major highway, and Russian aviation authorities suspended flights at four airports. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed Putin's proposed ceasefire as a theatrical performance and warned about security risks for attendees of the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow. The article reports that Russian strikes into Ukraine continued, injuring 11 people in Kharkiv, and Ukraine's air force reported shooting down 54 of 136 drones launched by Russia overnight, with 70 lost in flight without causing damage.</p>

          <p>The UK government is providing £102 million to modernize approximately 1,000 GP practice buildings in England, aiming to improve facilities and expand services. This investment, described as the biggest in five years, seeks to address record-low satisfaction levels with GP services and infrastructure issues.

          <p>A new UN report indicates that global development slowed in 2024, raising concerns about the erosion of recent gains due to stalled life expectancy, income growth, and rising conflicts. The report warns that cuts to international aid, particularly by the United States under President Donald Trump, will exacerbate the situation. It also acknowledges the potential of artificial intelligence to revitalize development but cautions that unequal access could widen existing divides. The Human Development Index ranks Iceland and Norway at the top, while Germany and Sweden share fifth place, with South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa showing the least development.</p>

          <p>A New York Times guest essay discusses President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials, including leaders of the Rocket Force and Gen. He Weidong, which casts doubt on China's stated goal of being prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027. The dismissals, potentially related to corruption or ideological differences, raise questions about the competence and reliability of Xi's military commanders. While China's military has grown in size and capability, the internal turmoil and lack of battlefield experience among officers may weaken Xi's appetite for war.
