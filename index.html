          <p>Universal and DreamWorks Animation are releasing "Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie," transitioning the popular Netflix children's series to the big screen. This move reflects a broader media industry trend of leveraging successful streaming content to build comprehensive franchises, including theatrical releases, merchandise, and theme park attractions. The strategy aims to deepen fan engagement and create multiple revenue streams, following successful models like Paramount's "Paw Patrol." By expanding the world of "Gabby's Dollhouse," the studios hope to capitalize on its existing fanbase and solidify its position as a major player in the lucrative children's entertainment market, which serves as a key driver for both streaming subscriptions and box office sales.</p>

          <p>Portland and Oregon state officials have strongly condemned President Trump's directive to send federal troops to the city, arguing there is no need for such intervention. In an open letter, 110 community leaders, along with Governor Tina Kotek and other elected officials, stated that a federal deployment would be counterproductive to the city's economic recovery and public safety efforts. They cited a decrease in local gun violence as evidence that current strategies are working and drew parallels to the 2020 federal presence, which they claim exacerbated tensions. The officials urged the administration to provide constructive support, such as engineers or outreach workers, instead of a show of force they deem unwanted and un-American.</p>

          <p>The German government is initiating direct negotiations with the Taliban to establish a formal agreement for deporting Afghan nationals convicted of crimes or considered security threats. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that ministry officials will travel to Kabul in October to facilitate regular deportations via commercial flights. This policy shift is part of a broader effort to manage immigration, as Germany is also seeking a similar repatriation deal with Syria for criminals and individuals without legal residency. These moves have drawn criticism from human rights organizations, who argue that both Afghanistan and Syria remain unsafe for returnees, highlighting the complex balance between national security and humanitarian concerns.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely monitoring upcoming U.S. jobs data, including the JOLTS report and the September nonfarm payrolls report, to gauge the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates. The labor market's strength or weakness will heavily influence expectations for rate cuts at the Fed's final two meetings of the year. Concurrently, the performance of the Treasury market is a major focus, as rising yields on longer-term bonds could impact economic activity, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors like housing. With a quiet earnings calendar, these economic indicators, alongside negotiations to avert a potential government shutdown, are poised to be the primary drivers of stock market performance in the week ahead.

          <p>UK Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has condemned Reform UK's proposal to scrap indefinite leave to remain as both "racist" and "immoral." The policy, championed by Nigel Farage, would require legal migrants to reapply for visas under stricter rules and could lead to the deportation of individuals lawfully settled in the country. Speaking at the Labour conference, Starmer clarified that he believes Reform supporters are not racist but are frustrated with years of Conservative government failures. He argued that targeting people who are integrated into British society would "rip this country apart," drawing a clear distinction between removing illegal migrants and revoking the rights of legal residents.</p>

          <p>A Florida family is facing a significant financial loss after the Toyota RAV4 they purchased for their daughter in a private sale was seized by the sheriff's office because it was a stolen vehicle. Despite losing the car, the family remains responsible for the $17,000 loan they took out for the purchase. This incident serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of buying used cars from independent sellers, who are not subject to the same consumer protection laws as licensed dealerships. Experts advise buyers to take protective steps such as verifying the vehicle's title with the DMV, running a comprehensive vehicle history report, and using secure payment methods to avoid similar scams involving outstanding liens or stolen vehicles.</p>

However, the album gradually gained a cult following and is now considered a rock classic, culminating in the band's induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

          <p>Amid public skepticism about official government inflation statistics, this article explores alternative data sources that provide a more nuanced view of the economy. While the widely cited Consumer Price Index (CPI) has faced criticism for potentially outdated methodology, other indicators offer different perspectives. These include the Truflation Price Index, which uses real-time data from numerous partners, and the Institute for Supply Management's Price Index, which tracks costs paid by businesses. Data from sources like Adobe, Zillow, and the National Federation of Independent Businesses also contribute to a fuller picture, suggesting that while some consumer prices may be lower than reported, rising business costs indicate future inflationary pressures.

          <p>China is pioneering a new industrial manufacturing model, termed a "pull" system, designed to mass-produce rockets, satellites, and other space systems with automotive-style efficiency. This approach aims to enhance quality, reduce costs, and increase flexibility in response to the exponentially growing global demand for space launches. Unlike traditional "push" systems that rely on forecasts, the pull model has final assembly stages draw components from suppliers only as they are needed. This just-in-time methodology is intended to prevent production bottlenecks and inventory issues, positioning China to dominate the future of space manufacturing as orbital payloads are projected to increase dramatically by 2045.</p>

          <p>According to communications expert Dr. Kate Mason, professionals often undermine their own credibility and importance by using self-deprecating or "minimizing" language at work. She identifies three specific phrases to avoid: "It'll just take a second," which sets unrealistic expectations; "No worries if not," which signals a request is low-priority; and "I'm not an expert, but...," which immediately reduces one's authority. Mason argues that these habits, which she terms "imposing syndrome," are particularly common among women and can negatively impact their professional standing. She suggests using more direct, confident, and specific language to communicate value and ensure that requests and contributions are taken seriously.</p>

The narrative is told from the perspective of a veteran teacher who uses unconventional, theatrical methods to engage his high school students, viewing his role as a guide through the often-unpleasant truths of history and life. His classroom dynamic is challenged by a student named Ornella Zanni, who insists on changing her name daily as an act of rebellion against being defined. The teacher's attempts to playfully engage with her game eventually lead to a confrontation where she labels him a "diseducator," forcing him to re-evaluate his methods and his relationship with his students.</p>

          <p>An increase in vacancies at U.S. shopping centers, driven by the failure of national chain stores, is creating new opportunities for small and local businesses. With the national vacancy rate rising, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents to keep their properties occupied. This shift is allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to secure prime real estate that was previously unaffordable. While overall rental rates are still rising, the pace of growth has slowed, creating a market recalibration that benefits entrepreneurs looking to establish a physical presence without the prohibitive costs and long-term commitments once required for such locations.</p>

          <p>Financial coach Andrea Ewalefo advises that automation is the most effective money management strategy for neurodivergent individuals, who may face challenges like executive dysfunction and decision fatigue. She suggests automating bill payments, savings, and investments to align with paydays, which reduces the mental energy required for financial tasks. By setting up systems where financial obligations are handled automatically upon receiving income, individuals can preserve their cognitive resources, or "spoons," for other priorities. This approach also provides the freedom to spend the remaining money without the stress of potentially missing a payment, thereby creating a more sustainable and less overwhelming financial plan that accommodates neurodivergent traits.</p>

Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced that a taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as promising initial sites. This initiative is central to Labour's ambitious goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The plan emulates the post-war Labour government's new town developments and aims not just to build houses but to create entire communities, though it faces challenges from rising industry costs and record-low planning approvals.</p>

          <p>The comedian hired as the master of ceremonies for the Ryder Cup has stepped down and apologized after being recorded leading a profane chant against European player Rory McIlroy. The incident occurred on the first tee Saturday morning, contributing to what was described as a toxic atmosphere where McIlroy was repeatedly targeted with personal abuse from spectators. The crowd's hostility grew so intense that state and park police were brought in to escort McIlroy's group during their round. McIlroy, who won both his matches despite the challenging environment, had at one point directly told the crowd to be quiet during his swing.</p>

          <p>A trapeze artist died tragically after falling approximately five meters during a circus performance in Bautzen, Germany. The incident occurred on Saturday night in front of an audience of nearly 100 people, which included many children. The performer was pronounced dead at the scene, and a crisis intervention team was deployed to support the shocked audience members and circus staff. Police are investigating the death as a workplace accident, noting there is currently no evidence of third-party negligence. An industry association head called it a tragic accident, suggesting the artist must have been very unlucky to suffer a fatal injury from such a height.</p>

          <p>A California proposal to redraw the state's congressional map, aimed at creating five new Democratic seats in response to gerrymandering in Texas, is fueling a fierce political fight in the state's conservative first district. The plan, which voters will decide on in a special election, could unseat seven-term Republican incumbent Doug LaMalfa, a staunch Trump ally. Democrats see the proposition as a crucial opportunity to counter a potential authoritarian agenda and retake the House, while local Republicans argue it unfairly dilutes their representation by merging rural areas with more liberal urban centers. Both parties are now intensely mobilizing voters ahead of the November vote, which could have national implications.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats are leveraging an impending government funding deadline to fight against Republican-led cuts to healthcare programs. With government funding set to expire on Tuesday, Democrats have refused to support a short-term spending bill unless it reverses recent cuts to Medicaid and extends subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This stance creates a high-stakes standoff that could lead to a government shutdown. Democrats believe that by focusing on the popular issue of healthcare, they have found rare leverage against the Trump administration and can rally voters ahead of the midterm elections, framing any potential shutdown as a consequence of Republican policies.</p>

Goodwin, whose own journey included a previous business venture that did not succeed, argues that individuals who feel energized by overcoming obstacles are well-suited for the entrepreneurial path.

          <p>An expert who helps Americans move abroad has identified six common misconceptions about expatriate life. Contrary to popular belief, living abroad is not as cheap as many think, with housing costs rising globally. The idea that Americans are unwelcome is also largely false; anti-tourism sentiment is typically aimed at its impact on housing, not individuals who integrate. Other myths include the fear of loneliness, as expat communities form quickly, and the illusion that life abroad is perfect, as bureaucracy and personal challenges still exist. Finally, she advises that the first move doesn't have to be permanent and that it is never too late in life to make the leap.</p>
