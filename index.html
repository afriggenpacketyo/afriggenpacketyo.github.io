          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 04:24:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fast-fashion giant Shein has reportedly filed confidentially for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, a move seen as an attempt to pressure UK regulators who have delayed its London listing. The company has faced significant hurdles gaining approval in London, primarily due to disagreements with both UK and Chinese regulators over risk disclosures related to its supply chain. This strategic pivot to Hong Kong comes after Shein also abandoned a New York listing due to pushback from U.S. lawmakers and faces ongoing scrutiny in the EU over its commercial practices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States will resume sending weapons to Ukraine, reversing a recent decision to pause some critical arms shipments to Kyiv. The announcement came after days of intense Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, with the White House stating the move was made to ensure Ukrainians can defend themselves. This decision provides relief to the Ukrainian government, which had warned that the halt in aid, particularly for air defense systems like the Patriot missiles, would impede its ability to counter escalating Russian aggression on the front lines.</p>

          <p>England manager Sarina Wiegman believes teenage forward Michelle Agyemang can provide a unique spark for the national team during the Euro 2025 tournament. Despite limited playing time, the 19-year-old has made a significant impression, scoring just 41 seconds into her debut and showing dynamic potential in a recent match against France. Praised by teammates for her strength and on-pitch intensity, Agyemang is seen as a wildcard player who can change the course of a game, providing hope for England as they face a crucial upcoming match against the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>Lord Norman Tebbit, a prominent and influential cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, has passed away at the age of 94. A staunch Thatcher ally, he was known for his tough political stance, particularly in curbing the power of trade unions during his time as employment secretary. Lord Tebbit and his wife survived the 1984 IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, an event that highlighted his personal courage. He was a significant figure in 1980s British politics, remembered for his unapologetic, self-made background and controversial 'cricket test' for immigrant loyalty.</p>

          <p>The world may be on the verge of its first commercial deep-sea mining operation in international waters, as The Metals Company (TMC) awaits a US regulatory decision. The move, fast-tracked by a presidential executive order, is framed as a matter of national security to compete with China for critical minerals used in green technology. However, scientists and legal experts warn of irreversible damage to fragile ocean ecosystems, citing studies showing a lack of recovery in previously tested mining sites. Critics also point to the checkered past of TMC's CEO, whose previous seabed mining venture ended in bankruptcy and significant public losses for Papua New Guinea.</p>

          <p>A counterterrorism expert has raised concerns that Iranian sleeper cells may be hiding in the United States, potentially targeting less-protected rural areas. Following recent U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin about a heightened risk of retaliatory violence. Former FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam suggested that current border policies have created vulnerabilities, allowing individuals to enter the country without sufficient vetting. In response to the perceived threat, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has reportedly increased enforcement efforts targeting Iranian nationals in the country.</p>

          <p>The initial phase of NBA free agency has seen several teams make significant moves, with the Atlanta Hawks and Houston Rockets emerging as early winners. The Hawks bolstered their roster around Trae Young by acquiring Kristaps Porzingis and other key role players, positioning themselves as a deeper team in the Eastern Conference. Meanwhile, the Rockets executed a major trade to land superstar Kevin Durant, adding a much-needed offensive closer to their young and promising squad. In contrast, the analysis suggests the Lakers have stalled, failing to make urgent win-now moves to support superstars LeBron James and Luka Dončić.</p>

          <p>The Children's Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, has warned that some children are living in "Dickensian" levels of poverty, with reports of homes infested with rats and a lack of basic necessities. In a new report, she described being shocked by how much worse the situation has become and strongly advocated for the government to scrap the two-child benefit cap. This policy prevents families from claiming certain benefits for any third or subsequent child, and its removal is estimated to lift half a million children out of poverty. The government stated it is determined to reduce child poverty and will publish a new strategy later this year.</p>

The move has been championed by campaigners for years, who argue that NDAs have been abused to protect powerful individuals and silence victims.

Costco's management has indicated that with the widespread availability of fractional-share purchasing, a split is not currently considered necessary to make its stock accessible to everyday investors. For Netflix, the primary obstacle is that the vast majority of its shares are held by institutional investors who have no need for a lower nominal share price. While stock splits have historically been followed by strong market performance, these underlying factors make both companies unlikely candidates for a split in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Public records show that local officials in Kerr County, Texas, had spent years discussing the need for an improved flood warning system long before last week's deadly floods. As early as 2016, county commissioners acknowledged the area was highly flood-prone and that existing infrastructure was antiquated and unreliable. A 2016 study recommended a nearly $1 million project to enhance flood monitoring, but the project did not move forward. Just this April, the Upper Guadalupe River Authority was again in discussions to develop a new warning system, highlighting a long-recognized vulnerability in the region that ultimately saw a tragic loss of life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beijing's recent implementation of export controls on rare earth minerals has triggered a wave of international activity aimed at diversifying supply chains and reducing reliance on China. In response to China's control over these critical materials, companies from the US and Australia are launching new exploration and development projects in countries like Kazakhstan and Brazil. These efforts highlight a growing global pushback against China's long-standing dominance in the rare earths market. Analysts note that while these initiatives are underway, Beijing still holds a very strong hand in the strategic sector.</p>

          <p>Japan and other key Asian allies have responded with concern to renewed US threats of steep import tariffs, while expressing hope that negotiations can lead to favorable outcomes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yorkshire Water has declared the first hosepipe ban in the UK for 2025, affecting over five million customers starting this Friday. The restriction follows the region's driest and warmest spring on record, which has left reservoir levels at a historic low of just over 50% capacity. The ban prohibits activities like watering gardens, washing cars, or filling paddling pools with a hosepipe, with potential fines of up to £3,000 for violations. Officials state the measures are necessary to preserve essential water supplies and protect the local environment, and they may remain in place for months until significant rainfall replenishes stocks.</p>

          <p>The first malaria treatment specifically designed and approved for babies and very young children is expected to be rolled out in African countries within weeks. Until now, infants under 4.5kg were treated with adjusted doses of medicines formulated for older children, which carried a risk of overdose due to their developing livers. Developed by Novartis in collaboration with the Medicines for Malaria Venture, the new drug, Coartem Baby, fills a critical treatment gap for the most vulnerable population. This breakthrough is seen as a major public health achievement in the fight against a disease that kills hundreds of thousands of children annually.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has confirmed to United Nations investigators that the US administration maintains legal responsibility and control over the Venezuelan migrants it deported to a high-security Salvadoran prison. This admission contradicts public statements from both governments and is a key piece of evidence in a legal challenge brought by the migrants' lawyers. The US has argued it is powerless to act because the men are outside its jurisdiction, but the new information suggests otherwise. The case challenges a controversial deal where the US paid El Salvador to house the migrants, who were removed under a rarely used wartime law.</p>

Families of the victims have expressed their hope that the intense public scrutiny will lead to "real change" and prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.</p>

          <p>China has issued a stern warning to the US administration against restoring tariffs on its goods, threatening to retaliate against any nations that strike deals with Washington to exclude China from their supply chains. The commentary in the official People's Daily newspaper described the US tariff policy as "bullying" and stated that dialogue and cooperation are the only correct paths forward. This response comes as the US has begun notifying partners of new tariffs effective August 1, with China facing an August 12 deadline to reach an agreement. The remarks set a confrontational tone, suggesting another round of the trade war is possible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US administration has officially delayed the imposition of higher, sweeping tariffs on imports but has set a new August 1 deadline for 14 specific countries, including allies Japan and South Korea. The White House released letters detailing the tariff rates these nations will face if new trade agreements are not reached, renewing the threat of a 25% tax on Japanese and South Korean goods. This move extends a 90-day pause that was set to expire, providing more time for negotiations. While the extension offers a temporary reprieve, it maintains pressure on key trading partners to strike deals that align with US trade objectives.</p>
