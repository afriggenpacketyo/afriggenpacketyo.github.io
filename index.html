          <p>Convicted Australian murderer Erin Patterson allegedly made multiple attempts to poison her estranged husband before the fatal mushroom incident that killed three relatives. A court heard testimony that she used various tainted foods, including cookies supposedly baked by their daughter, in a years-long campaign to kill him. These details, previously suppressed to ensure a fair trial, were revealed after she was found guilty of murdering three people with a poisoned beef Wellington. The husband's suspicions led him to document the incidents and warn his family members of the potential danger.</p>

Analysts suggest that the unpredictability of US policy and the economic pressure from these duties could create an opportunity for China to increase its influence in the region. The full impact remains uncertain, as details regarding exemptions for companies with a US manufacturing presence are yet to be specified. This move is part of the administration's broader "America first" economic strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys star pass rusher Micah Parsons is intensifying speculation about a potential move to the Los Angeles Rams amid his ongoing contract dispute. The situation escalated after retired Rams legend Aaron Donald playfully suggested he might return to the NFL if Parsons joined the team, a comment Parsons seemed to welcome. Parsons, who has one year left on his rookie contract and is seeking an extension, has been present at training camp but not participating in team drills. The Cowboys organization has noted a lack of recent communication with the player regarding his trade request.</p>

          <p>The Orleans Parish Sheriff attributes a recent brazen escape of ten inmates to a combination of critical failures, including poor facility design and chronic understaffing. In an interview, Sheriff Susan Hutson described the ten-year-old jail as having major design flaws, such as faulty locks, that she had repeatedly warned city officials about. The May 16th breakout, which the sheriff believes was an "inside job," was facilitated by these vulnerabilities and a staffing level of only 60%. An investigation is ongoing to determine the full extent of internal assistance provided to the escapees.</p>

          <p>Australian politician Gareth Ward has resigned from the New South Wales parliament after being convicted of sexually assaulting two young men. Ward, who is in custody awaiting sentencing, submitted his resignation just before a parliamentary vote to expel him was scheduled to take place. His last-minute legal challenge to prevent his expulsion, which argued the move was an "affront to democracy," was dismissed by the court. Ward had served as the independent member for Kiama since 2011 and has stated his intention to appeal the guilty verdict.</p>

          <p>For the first time on record, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species native to Southern Europe, has been spotted in the United Kingdom. A volunteer photographed the female butterfly at the Landguard Nature Reserve in Suffolk, confirming its presence. Experts at the charity Butterfly Conservation have been tracking the species' rapid northward expansion, which has seen it move across Europe at a rate of about 100 kilometers per year. While a warming climate is considered a factor, the butterfly's food source is not widely planted in the UK, making its long-term establishment uncertain.</p>

The program, part of the Biden administration's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, had aimed to benefit over 900,000 households and create numerous jobs.

          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Commerce to develop a census that excludes undocumented immigrants from its population count, a move with significant constitutional and political implications. The Constitution mandates a decennial count of all persons for the purpose of apportioning congressional seats, a process that has historically included non-citizens. This directive revives a contentious issue from Trump's first term, when an attempt to add a citizenship question was blocked by the Supreme Court. Such a change could dramatically alter congressional representation and federal funding distribution across the country.</p>

Ultra-processed foods are defined as being energy-dense, low in fiber, and high in salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order that could pave the way for alternative assets like cryptocurrency and private equity to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. The order directs federal agencies, including the Labor Department, to rewrite regulations governing qualified retirement plan investments. While the process could take months, the move is seen as a major victory for the private equity and crypto industries, which have long sought access to the trillions of dollars in American retirement accounts. Proponents argue it will broaden investment choices, while critics point to the higher risks associated with these assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is demanding regulatory and legislative action after State Farm announced an average 27% increase in homeowners insurance rates in the state. The governor expressed deep concern, suggesting the rate hike is unfair and based on inconsistent catastrophe loss data. Pritzker's statement implies that State Farm may be shifting costs from other states onto Illinois homeowners. The insurance giant has justified the increase by citing rising costs, including a surge in hail damage claims, which are becoming more frequent due to severe weather events.

          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse announced mixed second-quarter financial results, with strong sales growth offset by declining profitability due to high beef prices. The company's revenue of $1.51 billion surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a 5.8% increase in same-store sales and higher customer traffic. However, earnings per share fell short of forecasts as elevated beef costs squeezed margins, a headwind expected to worsen in the next quarter. To counteract this, the company plans a modest menu price increase later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration argues that these restrictions severely hamper its ability to enforce immigration laws in the nation's most populous judicial district.

The assessment is based partly on customs data showing that China has been successfully diversifying its chip exports to countries in Southeast Asia.
