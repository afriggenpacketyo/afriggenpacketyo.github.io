            <p>The Metropolitan Police are investigating the felling of an ancient oak tree in Whitewebbs Park, Enfield, sparking outrage from local residents and conservation groups. The tree, estimated to be up to 500 years old, was a nationally significant pedunculate oak and listed on the Woodland Trust's national ancient tree inventory. Council officials have imposed an emergency tree preservation order on the stump and are treating the incident as criminal damage. The Woodland Trust is urging anyone with information to come forward and is advocating for legally protected status for heritage trees, an issue highlighted by the destruction of the Sycamore Gap tree in 2023.</p>

            <p>Former President Barack Obama praised Harvard University for rejecting the Trump administration's demands, which Obama characterized as an unlawful attempt to stifle academic freedom. This comes after the Trump administration announced a multibillion-dollar freeze on funding to the university over alleged inaction on antisemitism. Obama, a Harvard Law School alumnus, called on other higher education institutions to follow Harvard's example and resist intimidation. Trump responded by suggesting Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status, claiming the university is not acting in the public interest.</p>

            <p>A high-level international conference convened in London, co-hosted by the UK, EU, and African Union, to address the escalating humanitarian crisis in Sudan. The UK pledged an additional Â£120m in aid as charities report 30 million Sudanese people are in desperate need due to the ongoing civil war. The conference aims to unite international partners in finding a pathway to peace, but neither of Sudan's main warring parties were invited. The conflict has displaced over 12 million people and resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, including reports of genocide in Darfur and widespread sexual violence.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status after the university refused to comply with demands from his administration. These demands included changes to hiring, admissions, and teaching practices aimed at combating antisemitism on campus. This action follows the White House's decision to freeze over $2 billion in federal funds for the institution. Harvard President Alan Garber defended the university's independence and constitutional rights, arguing that the demands represent governmental regulation of intellectual conditions.</p>

            <p>A columnist reflects on a photograph of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in the Oval Office during a controversial moment involving President Trump, using it as a metaphor for Democratic dysfunction. The author suggests Democrats are perceived as the party of urban elites and proposes several options for the party to improve its standing, including focusing on efficient delivery of public services or simply staying out of the spotlight while Trump's policies face scrutiny. The wisest course in the short term is to keep their heads down and let Trump self-immolate. The current political climate is broken because both parties have given up on the idea of being majority parties.</p>

            <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton argues that President Trump's tariff policies are strategically flawed, as they alienate allies and inadvertently benefit China. Bolton contends that the U.S. should have collaborated with its allies to address China's trade practices, rather than imposing sweeping tariffs that hit both allies and rivals. He believes that Trump's actions are not only an economic blunder but also a strategic one that will cost the United States dearly.</p>

This shift reflects a growing concern about the health impacts of sugary drinks and a desire to reform the welfare state. While some argue that SNAP restrictions are a cover for broader cuts to the program, others see it as a way to promote healthier choices. The USDA is expected to approve state requests to experiment with SNAP soda bans.</p>
