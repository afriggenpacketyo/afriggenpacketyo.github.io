          <p>Senior Trump administration officials provided contradictory information regarding the president's global tariffs. While some officials stated the tariffs were permanent and intended to "reset global trade," others suggested negotiations were ongoing and deals were possible. The conflicting messages followed significant market turmoil and criticism from Republicans and Democrats. Analysts are increasingly warning of a potential recession, and economists estimate a substantial cost to US consumers. The administration maintains that the tariffs are necessary to protect American workers.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's reposting of a video suggesting he is intentionally crashing the stock market, his top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, denied such a strategy. Hassett stated that the administration's goal is to create a golden age for the American worker. The denial came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested Trump's tariff policy would increase prices and slow economic growth. Trump has criticized Powell and claimed that political considerations have influenced the Fed's interest-rate policy.</p>
