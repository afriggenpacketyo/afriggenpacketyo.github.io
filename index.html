          <p>A woman and three children died in a house fire in Brent, north-west London, prompting a murder investigation after a 41-year-old man was arrested at the scene. Emergency services responded to the blaze in Tillett Close, Stonebridge, where they found the victims, including a 43-year-old woman, a 15-year-old girl, and two boys aged eight and four. Two terraced three-story homes were severely damaged by the fire, and neighbors reported hearing a crashing sound before discovering the building next door was ablaze. A woman in her 70s and a teenage girl were also hospitalized, and authorities are working to determine the cause of the fire.</p>

          <p>A major power outage impacted southeastern France, causing traffic disruptions and briefly halting activities at the Cannes Film Festival as the event prepared for its closing ceremony. Approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department lost electricity due to a fallen high-voltage line, which occurred hours after a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes had already weakened the power grid. The festival organizers confirmed that the Palais des Festivals switched to an independent power supply, ensuring all scheduled events proceeded as planned, though screenings at a satellite venue were temporarily suspended. Traffic lights in Cannes and Antibes stopped working, causing traffic jams, and most shops along the Croisette remained closed.</p>

Since assuming office, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have advocated for significant changes to military academies, leading to the disbanding of several student clubs, including the National Society of Black Engineers and the Society of Women Engineers. These changes align with recent Presidential Executive Orders and Department of Defense guidance. Additionally, hundreds of books addressing diversity, race, and gender issues were removed from U.S. Naval Academy libraries, although most have since been returned.</p>

          <p>Audio has been released of a 911 call detailing a medical emergency involving Gregg Popovich at a San Antonio restaurant last month, where he reportedly fainted. The caller indicated that Popovich was initially "not responding" but later "barely responding" after passing out briefly. Popovich, who had been recovering from a stroke earlier in the season, reportedly did not suffer any life-threatening injuries and was alert by the time he entered the ambulance. Shortly after the incident, Popovich stepped down as head coach, transitioning to president of basketball operations after a nearly three-decade run that included five NBA Championships.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the House rushed President Trump's agenda through Congress, mirroring and even exceeding the procedural actions they previously criticized Democrats for. The final text of a 1,100-page bill was released shortly before a party-line vote, with a pivotal hearing scheduled at 1 a.m. and rules meant to allow lawmakers time to review legislation being waived. This aggressive drive to pass Trump's agenda fits a pattern of Republicans using past transgressions as justification to go even further. Despite some internal misgivings, the GOP ultimately united to push the bill forward, aiming for Trump to sign it into law by July 4.</p>

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US are experiencing a significant decline, reversing the spike observed during the pandemic. The FBI's 2023 crime report indicated a nearly 12% decrease in murders year-over-year, with further reductions in 2024, reaching levels comparable to pre-pandemic figures. Early data for 2025 suggest a continuation of this trend, potentially leading to the lowest murder rate in US history. Factors contributing to the decline include the easing of pandemic-related stressors, government initiatives to reduce violence, and the stabilization of police forces.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking home lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control. This move has garnered support from investors like Bill Ackman, who believes it could benefit taxpayers and generate significant revenue for the government. However, critics such as Senator Elizabeth Warren warn that privatization could disrupt the mortgage market and increase housing prices. The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to facilitate homeownership by buying mortgages from lenders and bundling them into mortgage-backed securities.</p>

Concerns center on the US's "twin deficit" position and the potential for Trump's policies to stoke inflation and trigger a recession.
