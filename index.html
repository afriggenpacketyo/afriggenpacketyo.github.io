        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cassie Ventura testified in the trial of her ex-boyfriend Sean "Diddy" Combs, stating she would return her $20 million settlement to avoid participating in drug-fueled sex parties she described as "freak-offs." Ventura detailed her decade-long relationship with Combs, including allegations of physical violence and coercion into sexual encounters. The defense attempted to highlight financial incentives behind Ventura's accusations, suggesting she was in financial hardship before filing her lawsuit. Ventura refuted this, stating she would trade the money for a life free of the "freak offs," which she said caused her physical injuries and stifled her career. </p>

          <p>Leaked audio from Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur reveals that Biden admitted to keeping a classified document related to Afghanistan after his vice presidency, purportedly "for posterity's sake." Biden initially claimed he didn't recall why he had the document but later suggested it was related to his views on Afghanistan and technological changes. The audio also contains instances where Biden appeared confused about dates, including his son's death and the end of his vice presidency. The audio's release follows congressional demands for access amid concerns about Biden's memory and mental acuity.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts. This decision follows the automaker's announcement of shutting down seven vehicle plants and cutting 20,000 jobs globally after reporting a significant net loss for fiscal year 2024. The potential closures involve Nissan's main Oppama plant and the Shonan plant of its unit Nissan Shatai Co., collectively accounting for about 30% of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The company has yet to engage in discussions with labor unions, parts makers, or local municipalities regarding these potential closures.</p>

          <p>Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner criticized Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government as he stepped down as chairman of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). Lindner stated that voters wanted less state intervention and more freedom, but the new government is delivering the opposite with increased state control and debt. He warned that the government's fiscal policy, which includes a €500 billion fund for infrastructure and eased borrowing rules for defense spending, would backfire economically if not accompanied by reforms.

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, only the second in its history. The storm, driven by 60 to 70 mph winds, significantly reduced visibility, causing ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports and prompting reports of "mud rain" as showers and storms coincided with the dust. The National Weather Service noted reduced visibility on major interstates, and some schools closed due to power outages from previous severe weather.</p>

          <p>A new New York Times opinion piece discusses the Democratic Party's reckoning with Joe Biden's declining health and the "cover-up" surrounding his condition. The author reflects on initial defenses of Biden's fitness for office and the subsequent realization of his infirmity. The piece argues that the party's tendency toward groupthink and risk aversion contributed to the disastrous decision to support Biden's re-election. It calls for honesty and self-reflection to rebuild trust and avoid similar missteps in the future.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders' ability to sue the company for breach of fiduciary duties. The new bylaw requires shareholders to hold at least 3% of Tesla's issued and outstanding shares to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding. This change takes advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders. The move follows Tesla's relocation of its site of incorporation to Texas after a court decision in Delaware.</p>
