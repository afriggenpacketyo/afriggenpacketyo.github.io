            <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with terminating 16,000 probationary federal workers across multiple agencies, reversing a lower court order. The court determined that the labor unions and non-profit groups challenging the firings lacked standing in the matter. This decision allows the administration to continue its workforce reduction efforts, although the legal battle is not entirely over as the unions have vowed to continue fighting the terminations. The affected employees work at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior, and Treasury. (not investment advice)</p>

These changes, which include stricter eligibility for disability payments, are aimed at saving money and encouraging more people to enter the workforce.

            <p>Colossal Biosciences, a biotech company, claims to have bred three pups with key physical features of the extinct dire wolf using novel gene-editing technology on gray wolf DNA. The company extracted dire wolf DNA from fossils and made 20 edits to the gray wolf genome to create animals with larger bodies and thicker coats. Critics, however, argue that these pups are not true dire wolves but rather genetically modified gray wolves that superficially resemble them. The company says its goal is to restore the functional traits and ecological role of lost species, not to create a perfect genetic replica. (not investment advice)</p>
