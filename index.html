          <p>Following immigration raids by ICE, Los Angeles has experienced widespread protests, leading to a surge of misinformation on social media. One viral video falsely claimed to show illegal aliens setting a Jeep on fire, but it was actually footage from a street takeover in March 2024. Another claim alleged that photos of National Guard personnel sleeping on the ground were taken in Afghanistan in 2021, which was debunked by the San Francisco Chronicle. These examples highlight the importance of verifying information during times of unrest to avoid spreading false narratives.</p>

          <p>Researchers have analyzed gold coins recovered from the San Jose galleon, a Spanish ship that sank off the coast of Colombia in 1708 while laden with treasure. The coins, featuring depictions of castles, lions, and crosses, confirm their origin from the San Jose. Analysis of high-resolution images shows the coins have an average diameter of 32.5 millimeters and weigh approximately 27 grams, with some bearing the Latin motto "Plus Ultra." The Colombian government plans to begin extractions from the shipwreck, which has been declared a protected archeological area.</p>

The NHS will receive a 3% annual funding increase, while defense and housing will also see boosts. Other departments, including the Home Office and the Foreign Office, will experience budget cuts. The review details funding for schools, transport, and social housing, with analysis from BBC correspondents on the potential impact of these decisions on key public services.</p>

          <p>Brian Wilson, the creative genius behind The Beach Boys, has passed away at the age of 82, leaving behind a legacy of iconic songs and innovative musical arrangements. Wilson's complex melodies, intricate harmonies, and avant-garde themes transformed popular music, but the pressures of fame and drug dependence took a toll on his mental health. Despite his struggles, Wilson made a remarkable comeback in the new millennium, delighting fans with re-workings of Beach Boys classics and the revival of the long-lost "Smile" album. His impact on music remains profound.</p>

          <p>Traditional allies of the United States, including Japan, Britain, Canada, and France, are reportedly working more closely together to build an alliance system without the U.S. This shift is attributed to President Trump's policies on trade and aid, which have led these nations to seek stronger ties among themselves. Recent deals, such as a $170 billion defense agreement between Canada, Britain, and the EU, and sanctions placed on Israeli cabinet members by Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Norway, demonstrate the erosion of U.S. diplomatic influence.</p>

          <p>Entering romantic relationships can often lead to a decline in friendships, as society prioritizes romantic bonds over platonic ones. This hierarchy of connection can result in friends feeling neglected or replaced, particularly when couples retreat into coupledom. Historically, friendships held a more significant role, with deep connections and emotional support often found in platonic relationships. To maintain friendships, it's important to prioritize both love and friendship, making time for friends and recognizing their individual roles in your life. Jealousy can be a signal to value and be intentional about maintaining those relationships.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump's legal team is seeking to move the appeal of his New York hush money conviction to federal court, arguing that the case involves "official acts" undertaken while he was president. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit heard arguments on whether the case should be removed from state appellate courts. Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts related to hush money payments made during the 2016 presidential election, and his attorneys claim that the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity should prevent the conviction. The Manhattan district attorney's office argues that it's too late to move the case and that the evidence involves actions before Trump became president.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has echoed President Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve, stating that the Fed's refusal to cut interest rates is "monetary malpractice." Vance's statement follows a report showing that tariffs have not exerted substantial upward pressure on inflation. Both Trump and Vance are urging the Fed to ease monetary policy, despite concerns about the longer-term impacts of tariffs on prices. The FOMC is expected to release its interest rate decision next week, with markets assigning zero probability of a rate cut.</p>
