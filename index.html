          <p>A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab can eliminate tumors in some early-stage cancer patients, potentially allowing them to avoid surgery. In the study, 82 out of 103 participants responded so well to the drug that they no longer needed an operation. The study focused on patients with tumors having a "mismatch repair defect," a genetic issue making them more responsive to immunotherapy. The researchers are continuing the trial to expand the study outside of Memorial Sloan Kettering with more patients so that they can offer this therapy as a standard of care.</p>

          <p>The UK government is consulting on proposals to extend the sugar tax to milkshakes and other milk-based drinks, aiming to tackle obesity. The consultation includes reducing the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy, from 5g to 4g per 100ml. The Treasury argues that milk-based drinks contribute minimally to calcium intake, making the exemption unjustified due to the harms of excess sugar. The sugar tax, officially known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), has raised £1.9 billion since its introduction in 2018.</p>

          <p>Amnesty International's annual report highlights a concerning trend of global human rights being at risk, citing increasing violence against civilians, particularly minorities, in war zones and elsewhere. The report criticizes states for failing to take action to counter this crisis, especially those previously committed to universal human rights. The report focuses on the war in Gaza and accuses Israel of committing "genocide" against Palestinians. The organization also raises concerns about the rights of immigrants and refugees in Germany, condemning the excessive use of force in policing protests.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed the scientists and experts compiling the National Climate Assessment, the federal government’s flagship report on global warming's effects on the country. This move jeopardizes the future of the report, which is required by Congress and provides crucial information for state and local governments and private companies to prepare for climate-related disasters. Researchers were informed that the scope of the report is being re-evaluated, signaling a potential shift in the government's approach to addressing climate change.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes that continued strong job growth could help ward off a recession, despite concerns about President Trump's tariff hikes. Cramer argues that recessions revolve around employment, and the abundance of job openings suggests that companies are hesitant to lay off employees. While tariffs may lead to higher prices and shortages, Cramer anticipates that consumers will adapt and that retailers like Costco and Walmart can negotiate lower prices with suppliers. He views tariffs as a government-mandated supply shock but doesn't necessarily equate them to a recession.</p>
