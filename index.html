        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Japanese high court has overturned a previous ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for their failure to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined that it was difficult for TEPCO's management at the time to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus reversing the 2022 court decision. The focus of the trial was whether the management's inaction regarding tsunami countermeasures was acceptable after a TEPCO unit estimated in 2008 that a tsunami of up to 15.7 meters could hit the plant. The lawyer for the shareholders seeking damages criticized the ruling as "fundamentally flawed" and expressed the intention to appeal the latest decision, despite TEPCO apologizing for the incident.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight boxer Fabio Wardley is preparing for a challenging fight against undefeated Australian contender Justis Huni at Ipswich Town Football Club. Wardley is also anticipating the birth of his first child, which is due just a week after the fight. At 30 years old, Wardley started boxing relatively late, having worked in recruitment until the age of 19, but a victory over Huni could propel him closer to a world-title shot as early as 2026. Wardley's dedication and determination in boxing reflect the mindset he hopes to bring to fatherhood, embracing the journey with a hunger to learn and adapt to the new challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new radar technology that allows aircraft to track moving targets without emitting radio signals. The innovation, called a ‚Äúspace-time decoupling two-channel clutter cancellation method,‚Äù was unveiled in China‚Äôs Journal of Radars and enables silent detection of moving vehicles even in cluttered environments. This technology uses a bistatic airborne radar system where one aircraft emits radar signals while another passively gathers echoes, enabling the silent aircraft to detect moving targets with clarity. The advancement addresses the challenge of detecting moving targets due to clutter caused by reflections from land, sea, or buildings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce regulations mandating that most new build homes in England must be fitted with solar panels. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that the move is "just common sense" and could save households an average of ¬£500 annually on energy bills. The Home Builders Federation supports the initiative but cautions against overly burdensome paperwork that could hinder the government's goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The rules will be part of the Future Homes Standard, detailing plans for energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions, with the government aiming for near-universal solar panel installation to meet its net-zero target by 2050.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector, coupled with weak domestic demand, is leading to steep discounts on exports, potentially triggering another 'China shock' in global markets. While steep tariffs are deterring Chinese exports to the U.S., the production overdrive is rippling through global markets, causing anxiety in Asia about a flood of cheap imports squeezing local industries. However, economists suggest that the influx of low-cost Chinese goods could ease inflationary pressures for inflation-worn economies. This could pave the way for more rate cuts across Asia as central banks seek to revive growth amidst rising trade tensions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A call between U.S. and Chinese presidents has not resolved a global shortage of rare earth exports, which could halt production of cars and other industrial parts. China's restrictions on rare earth elements, used in weapons and high-tech products, have surprised many in Washington despite a recent trade agreement. The American Chamber of Commerce in China reports that 75% of affected members expect their supplies to run out within three months, impacting sectors like research and development, resources, and tech. The situation extends beyond the U.S., with European auto parts companies already halting production, indicating a need for further trade talks to ease restrictions.</p>

The damaged vessel will be moved to a dry dock in a different shipyard for repairs, with leader Kim Jong Un calling for swift action to repair the ship before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workers‚Äô Party. Analysts were surprised by the quick refloating, which apparently involved using aerostatic balloons attached to the ship‚Äôs hull.
