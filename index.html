          <p>Investors are increasingly favoring short-term Treasury bills, mirroring Warren Buffett's strategy, due to concerns about market volatility and stable yields.

          <p>Poland's presidential runoff election pits Rafal Trzaskowski, a pro-European liberal backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's Civic Coalition, against Karol Nawrocki, a staunch nationalist endorsed by outgoing President Andrzej Duda.

The election outcome could significantly impact Poland's political trajectory, influencing Tusk's reformist agenda and the opposition Law and Justice party's influence.

          <p>Ukraine reportedly launched a large-scale drone attack on four Russian military airfields, allegedly damaging over 40 aircraft used in nightly bombings of Ukrainian cities, according to an SBU source. The operation, planned over a year and a half, involved drones concealed in mobile houses. Simultaneously, explosions caused railway bridge collapses and train derailments in Russia's Bryansk and Kursk regions, resulting in casualties, while Ukraine disputes involvement. As these events unfolded, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy announced a delegation would attend peace talks in Istanbul, prioritizing a ceasefire and prisoner exchange, as Russia prepares to discuss its position on ending the war.

          <p>An Israeli attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of more than 30 Palestinians and left scores wounded, according to Gaza health officials and witnesses. Eyewitnesses reported that Israeli forces fired upon crowds waiting to receive aid near Rafah, though the Israeli army stated it was unaware of injuries caused by its fire within the aid distribution site. The incident occurred as Israel and Hamas traded blame for the stalled ceasefire negotiations, with Hamas seeking amendments to a U.S.-backed proposal deemed unacceptable by President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East. The U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to work with the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, risking yet more mass displacement in the territory.</p>
