            <p>During last month's E3 Saxo Bank Classic, Dutch cyclist Mathieu van der Poel, who ultimately won the race, was spat upon by a spectator while leading solo with about 30km remaining. Belgian police have identified the individual responsible, who has admitted to the act. The East Flanders public prosecutor's office confirmed that the culprit will be fined up to £300 (350 euros), and the case will not be pursued further. This incident highlights the occasional challenges and disrespectful behavior that athletes can face from spectators during competitions.</p>

            <p>Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, has continued her attacks against President Donald Trump, using terms like "buffoon" and "orange" in a recent post on X. She defended her remarks by sharing a video in which investor Ray Dalio expressed concerns about a potential economic downturn. Crockett also contrasted her personal finances with Trump's, alluding to insider trading allegations and shady donations. Trump responded by calling Crockett a "very low-IQ person and a lowlife" and suggesting she won't go far in politics, escalating the feud between the two.</p>

            <p>Amazon is contacting third-party merchants to assess how President Donald Trump's tariffs are affecting their businesses, particularly concerning sourcing, pricing, and logistics. The email asks sellers to share their experiences and strategies in light of the "current U.S. tariff situation." Trump's recent executive order imposed a 10% rate for all trade partners except China, which faces tariffs of 125%. Some sellers plan to maintain prices to stay competitive but fear the tariffs could force them out of business. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy suggests some sellers may pass the costs to consumers. </p>

They advise maintaining a flexible cash position, typically between 5% and 10%, to capitalize on opportunities. For portfolios with appreciating stocks and low dividends, they suggest focusing on total shareholder return and occasionally booking profits by selling shares. The summary also notes that dividends are nice, but shouldn't be the only factor in investment decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield edged lower to 4.316% after a volatile week in the bond market driven by President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Despite an initial dip following a 90-day tariff pause, the yield rebounded to above 4.5% before settling lower. Concerns about who is selling off Treasurys have risen, with China, the second-largest foreign creditor, being a point of speculation. Debt concerns and hedge fund selling may have also contributed to the sell-off, increasing market stress.</p>

The U.S. is particularly vulnerable because it lacks heavy rare earths separation capabilities, despite efforts by the Department of Defense to develop a domestic supply chain by 2027.</p>

            <p>Former President Barack Obama praised Harvard University for rejecting President Donald Trump's demands, calling the administration's attempt to stifle academic freedom "unlawful and ham-handed." Obama's remarks followed Harvard's refusal to comply with a series of demands from the Trump administration. Trump, in turn, called for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status. Obama expressed concern about the White House's moves against universities and urged them not to give in to intimidation.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is considering cutting funding for NPR and PBS, alleging that the outlets are left-leaning and a "waste" of taxpayer money. The White House released a memo citing examples of reporting it deemed biased. NPR responded by stating that eliminating funding would have a devastating impact on American communities that rely on public radio for trusted news and information. This move underscores the administration's ongoing efforts to target media outlets it views as critical.</p>

Overly optimistic market return projections, benign inflation expectations, and reliance on working past age 65 are common pitfalls.

Experts recommend prudent financial planning and realistic expectations to secure a comfortable retirement. (not investment advice)</p>
