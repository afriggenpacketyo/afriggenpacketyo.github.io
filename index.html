          <p>Graham Linehan, known for "Father Ted," is currently on trial in London, facing charges of harassment and criminal damage against Sophia Brooks, an 18-year-old transgender activist. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard allegations that Linehan "relentlessly" published offensive posts on social media, labeling Brooks a "deeply disturbed sociopath" and "domestic terrorist." The prosecution detailed how these posts were "oppressive and unacceptable," crossing into harassment, and also alleged Linehan "deliberately whacked" Brooks' phone during a public encounter last October. Linehan has entered a plea of not guilty to both charges, with the legal proceedings ongoing to determine the outcome.</p>

          <p>Harrowing accounts from eyewitnesses detail the fatal Lisbon funicular crash, where a carriage "lost control" and careened into a building, resulting in at least 17 deaths and 20 injuries. Helen Chow, at the base of the hill, described a sound like a bomb, followed by "complete scary silence" and black smoke, with people frantic and crying. Another witness recounted running for safety as the upper carriage descended "out of control" and struck the building with "brutal force," collapsing like a cardboard box. The 140-year-old electric funicular's rapid descent and impact have led to speculation of brake failure as the cause.</p>

          <p>Russia's Foreign Ministry has issued a stern warning that it will not tolerate the presence of any Western troops in Ukraine, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with top European leaders in Paris. Spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated that such intervention is "unacceptable" and views Ukraine as a "testing ground" for Western military developments, rejecting proposals for security guarantees involving foreign forces. The European leaders, part of a "Coalition of the Willing," will also virtually consult with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss potential peace deals and security assurances for Kyiv, despite Moscow's consistent rebuffs of such deployments.</p>

His legal team highlighted significant difficulties in gaining access to their client and digital evidence while in prison.

          <p>U.S. companies have announced approximately 892,000 job cuts in the first eight months of the year, a 66% increase from the previous year and already surpassing 2024's total. This significant rise is primarily attributed to government cost-cutting initiatives, particularly the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), alongside broader economic uncertainty and the growing influence of artificial intelligence. California and the tech industry have been hit hardest, with the retail sector also facing substantial layoffs due to tariffs, inflation, and consumer spending constraints. Experts warn that the approaching holiday season could see fewer seasonal hires and continued high layoffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India has announced a significant reduction in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on solar photovoltaic modules and wind turbine generators, dropping from 12% to 5%. This strategic move aims to decrease the capital cost for new renewable energy projects by approximately 5%, according to industry experts. The government's decision is expected to accelerate India's ambitious goal of expanding its non-fossil fuel capacity to 500 GW by 2030, potentially unlocking numerous stalled projects. While some existing power supply contracts may require renegotiation, the lower tax rate is anticipated to lead to more competitive tariffs for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

Furthermore, critics warn that this measure might incentivize employers to reclassify more roles into tipped categories, thereby making workers' incomes less stable and predictable.

          <p>Streameast, identified as the world's largest illegal live sports streaming site, has been successfully shut down by Egyptian police in collaboration with the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE). The platform, which garnered over 1.6 billion visits in the past year, provided pirated streams of major sporting events including Premier League football and Formula One races. Two individuals were arrested, and authorities seized equipment and evidence of money laundering operations. While this marks a significant victory for intellectual property rights and legal broadcasters, experts caution that the high costs of legal sports content will continue to fuel the persistent "whack-a-mole" challenge of online piracy.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner is facing the prospect of a significant fine from tax authorities, in addition to owing an estimated £40,000 in underpaid stamp duty. Tax experts indicate she is at "significant risk" of a penalty, typically 20% or 30% of the underpaid tax, due to her declaration during the purchase of an £800,000 flat. The dispute centers on whether she was "careless" in her tax affairs, particularly concerning property ownership involving a trust for her son. Her defense of being misinformed by lawyers may not suffice, potentially leading to political repercussions given her past criticisms of tax avoidance.</p>

          <p>Challenging conventional wisdom, some experts advocate for introducing smartphones to toddlers as young as three, emphasizing a highly intentional and guided parental approach. This strategy, viewed as "training wheels" for technology, involves gradually allowing access to curated features like photo albums, cameras, and selected media, aiming to cultivate digital literacy from an early age. Proponents argue that since smartphones are an undeniable part of modern life, teaching safe and responsible tech use early can better equip children to navigate the digital world, identify misinformation, and foster open communication with parents, rather than making devices a forbidden allure.</p>

Critics argue this move betrays the "unspoken covenant of fandom" and will restrict attendance to only the wealthiest supporters, confirming FIFA's singular focus as a proprietor maximizing returns rather than a custodian dedicated to the sport's broader interests.
