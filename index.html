          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, with 6 to 10 becoming hurricanes and 3 to 5 reaching major hurricane status. The forecast considers factors like neutral El Ni√±o conditions, warmer ocean temperatures, and a potentially active West African Monsoon. Officials emphasize the importance of preparedness, urging communities in storm-prone areas to develop plans and gather supplies before the season begins on June 1st. The forecast is intended to provide a framework for communities to prepare, given the increasing intensity of storms due to climate change.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has launched a nationwide effort to arrest illegal immigrants at their immigration and asylum hearings, targeting those in the U.S. for fewer than two years. The strategy involves dropping the migrants' immigration cases to place them into expedited deportation proceedings, which cannot occur while a case is pending. This new policy is expected to increase deportations of migrants who have not committed crimes beyond illegal border crossing. The policy shift comes amid ongoing court battles regarding the Department of Homeland Security's deportation efforts, signaling a stricter approach to immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a preliminary injunction blocking President Trump‚Äôs executive order aimed at dismantling the Education Department, ordering the reinstatement of thousands of fired employees. Judge Myong J. Joun ruled that the executive actions equated to an illegal shutdown of the agency, a power reserved for Congress. The Trump administration plans to challenge the decision, arguing that the president and the Secretary of Education have the authority to reorganize the agency. This ruling marks a temporary setback for the administration's efforts to streamline the department.</p>

          <p>Community groups in Louisiana have filed a federal lawsuit challenging a state law that regulates air pollution monitoring, arguing it violates their constitutional rights. The law places new requirements on community testing activities, including using federally-approved equipment and restrictions on data analysis and sharing. Plaintiffs claim the law's restrictions impede their ability to detect and report toxic pollution from refineries and chemical plants, especially in areas like Cancer Alley.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees, citing the department's need to fulfill its obligations. The ruling follows the Education Department's announcement of a significant reduction in force, which would have halved the agency's staff. This decision comes after multiple lawsuits, including one from 21 states, challenging the Trump administration's staff cuts at the Education Department. The court's order marks a legal setback to the administration's plans to streamline the agency.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed President Donald Trump's tax bill, with every Democrat and two Republicans voting against it. The bill's passage represents a major victory for Republican leaders, who crafted the legislation with last-minute changes to win over both moderates and conservatives. The bill, however, faces a complicated path through the Senate, where several Republican senators have already indicated they will require significant changes before agreeing to vote for it. Democrats vehemently oppose the bill's steep cuts to the social safety net to pay for tax cuts.</p>
