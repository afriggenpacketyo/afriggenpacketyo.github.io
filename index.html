          <p>The 2025 Met Gala, themed "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," showcased celebrities in tailored suits and dramatic gowns, highlighting the influence of the "black dandy" on fashion. Zendaya donned a cream Louis Vuitton suit, while Kim Kardashian opted for an all-black leather ensemble. Demi Moore interpreted the theme literally with a Thom Browne gown resembling a men's tie, and Bad Bunny paid homage to his Puerto Rican heritage with a brown Prada suit. Rihanna debuted her pregnancy with A$AP Rocky in Marc Jacobs, and Diana Ross wore a show-stopping white ensemble with feathers and a long train. Lewis Hamilton and Sydney Sweeney also made memorable appearances, with Hamilton wearing a cream suit by Grace Wales Bonner and Sweeney honoring Kim Novak in Miu Miu.</p>

          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods, experts believe that Temu and Shein are likely to remain competitive in the U.S. e-commerce market. The companies are adapting by onboarding American sellers and shifting to local warehouses to mitigate the impact of tariffs. While prices on the platforms have been increasing, they are still expected to be competitive compared to other e-commerce sites. The success of Shein and Temu is attributed to their agile supply chains and ability to adapt quickly to consumer trends, allowing them to offer products at competitive prices.

          <p>Japan's former Emperor Akihito, 91, was admitted to a Tokyo hospital for a thorough medical examination after an earlier checkup revealed signs of myocardial ischemia. The Imperial Household Agency reported that the former emperor is not currently experiencing any symptoms related to the condition, which reduces blood flow to the heart muscles. This hospitalization follows a coronary-artery bypass surgery in 2012 and treatment for heart failure in 2022. Akihito abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in approximately two centuries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article suggests that President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials in China casts doubt on the country's readiness for a potential invasion of Taiwan. The removal of two defense ministers and several senior officers, including leaders of the Rocket Force, raises questions about the competence and reliability of Xi's commanders. Corruption and political interference within the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army are significant issues, potentially weakening China's appetite for war. The article argues that Taiwan and the United States should use this time to strengthen their defenses, recognizing that Xi may be reluctant to risk a military failure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In recent years, a shift has occurred in China, where the children of senior officials are increasingly seeking positions in the public sector, reversing a previous trend of pursuing lucrative business careers. This change is attributed to the ruling Communist Party's tightening of regulations around officials and their families as part of its anti-corruption efforts, as well as a slowing economy. Government jobs are now seen as a more secure and stable option, despite being lower-paid and more demanding than private sector roles.</p>

          <p>The European Union plans to present a roadmap to eliminate all Russian gas deliveries, both current and future, to the bloc by 2027. This decision follows Russia's aggression against Ukraine, an EU aspirant nation. The EU, once heavily reliant on Russian gas, seeks to enable companies to withdraw from existing contracts, though potential penalties and arbitration challenges exist. Currently, the EU imports approximately 19% of its gas from Russia, a significant decrease from 40% in 2022. Unanimous support among EU members is required for sanctioning imports, but Hungary and Slovakia have opposed the plan.</p>

          <p>Tourists visiting Alcatraz Island expressed disbelief and dismay at President Trump's proposal to reopen the former prison. Visitors described the idea as "insane" and a "stunt," citing the island's deteriorated condition and high operating costs. Some acknowledged the island's symbolism of justice but favored its current role as a national monument and site of Indigenous resistance. Local officials and historians also criticized the proposal, highlighting Alcatraz's historical significance and impracticality as a modern penitentiary.</p>

The DOJ said that Credit Suisse AG Singapore held undeclared accounts for U.S. persons with assets valued at over $2 billion between 2014 and June 2023. This plea follows a 2014 guilty plea for similar conduct, with the firm now admitting to new crimes and breaching its previous agreement.

The majority of foreign visitors were from countries participating in Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative, which accounted for over 60% of the total transaction volume.

          <p>President Trump's decision to close a tariff loophole is expected to significantly reduce the volume of low-value shipments from China to the U.S., impacting delivery companies like UPS and FedEx. The move, which ends the de minimis exemption, could lead to a 25% decline in revenue for UPS's China-to-U.S. business. While delivery companies are seeking to adapt, the broader trade war may limit their ability to compensate for lost sales. The closure could also affect airlines, particularly cargo carriers, and may prompt Chinese businesses to focus on other markets.</p>
