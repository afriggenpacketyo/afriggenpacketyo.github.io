          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied allegations that its H20 AI chips, designed for the Chinese market, contain "backdoors" for remote access or control. The statement follows a meeting where Chinese regulators, specifically the Cyberspace Administration of China, raised national security concerns about the chips' potential vulnerabilities. This scrutiny comes as Nvidia prepares to resume shipments to the lucrative Chinese market, navigating complex geopolitical tensions and U.S. legislative proposals for mandatory tracking features on advanced semiconductors. The company faces pressure from both Washington's security policies and Beijing's regulatory demands.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the 2005 death of Becky Zerlentes, a 34-year-old professor who became the first female boxer to die in a sanctioned U.S. fight. It details the fight, the "glancing blow" that caused fatal brain damage, and the profound impact on her husband, Stephan Weiler. The piece also connects her story with another boxing tragedy and explores the lack of support for families from governing bodies. Weiler, now an advocate for awareness, discusses the inherent dangers of combat sports and the long-term risks like CTE.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global space industry is increasingly viewing the Moon as a stepping stone to the more ambitious goal of colonizing Mars. While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance lunar missions, including plans for a human habitat, the long-term strategic focus for major players like the U.S. and China is pivoting to the red planet. This shift is creating a new space race, with national agencies targeting manned Mars missions in the 2030s and 2040s. Consequently, lunar projects may increasingly become the domain of private companies filling the void left by government agencies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered a widespread black market of unlicensed and dangerously overcrowded house-shares, or HMOs, in London. Tenants, often vulnerable, are living in unsanitary conditions with rats, mould, and extreme overcrowding, which has led to fatal consequences like a fire caused by an e-bike battery. Despite laws requiring licenses for large house-shares, data suggests illegal properties far outnumber legal ones in some boroughs, with enforcement appearing overstretched. The report highlights the exploitation of tenants and the urgent need for better regulation and oversight.</p>

A significant new measure includes a 40% tariff on all goods found to be transshipped through other countries to evade duties, a move seen as targeting China. While some Asian nations received lower rates than initially proposed, others like Switzerland and South Africa face steep increases. The executive order solidifies the administration's aggressive trade policy, creating continued uncertainty for global markets and trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>El Salvador's parliament, dominated by President Nayib Bukele's New Ideas party, has approved constitutional amendments that remove presidential term limits and extend the term to six years. The changes, which also eliminate the need for a second-round runoff in elections, effectively allow Bukele to run for office indefinitely. This move solidifies his control over the nation's institutions, which he has steadily consolidated since taking office in 2019. Opposition lawmakers have condemned the reforms as the death of democracy in the country.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old woman has been arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle fentanyl into a Los Angeles juvenile facility while visiting her child. The suspect, Jeny Morenoparra, was initially detained in 2023 after a probation officer reportedly found her with over 30 fentanyl-laced pills at the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall. After being released pending review, the District Attorney's office reopened the case and issued an arrest warrant. Officials emphasized the extreme danger of introducing such a potent narcotic into a secure youth facility, undermining both safety and rehabilitation efforts.</p>

          <p>An office cleaner who has worked at 345 Park Avenue for 27 years has described her harrowing encounter with the gunman who killed four people in the Manhattan high-rise. Sebije Nelovic said the shooter, Shane Devon Tamura, entered the 33rd floor, shattered a glass door, and pointed his AR-15-style rifle directly at her. She identified herself as a cleaning lady and ran to hide in a closet, where she prayed for hours as the attack continued. The gunman was reportedly targeting the NFL headquarters but went to the wrong floor, where he killed an employee before taking his own life.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died earlier this year, stated that she wanted the sealed documents related to his sex trafficking network to be made public. In an interview, her siblings expressed hope for "transparency and justice" and urged President Trump not to pardon Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's convicted accomplice. They also reacted to Trump's recent comment that Epstein had "stolen" Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club, stating that she was a person who was actively recruited by Maxwell, not an object to be stolen.</p>

          <p>An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has sentenced 108 members of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), to prison. The convictions, including a 10-year term for opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan, are related to their involvement in the violent protests of May 2023 that followed Khan's arrest. The PTI has denounced the rulings as politically motivated and a "black day for democracy," vowing to appeal the decision. This mass sentencing is a major blow to the opposition party, which continues to face a severe crackdown from authorities.</p>

          <p>Annual undergraduate tuition fees in England and Wales have risen by 3% to £9,535, the first increase since they were frozen in 2017. Maintenance loans for student living costs have also been increased slightly to align with inflation. The change comes after universities warned of significant funding pressures due to the freeze and high inflation, which eroded the real-terms value of the fees. The increase aims to provide financial relief to institutions, but adds to the debt burden for a new cohort of students.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels chose to be modest buyers at the trade deadline, acquiring veteran help rather than selling off assets, despite having long odds to make the playoffs. General Manager Perry Minasian explained the decision was about fostering a competitive environment for the team's young core, believing that playing meaningful games in August and September is crucial for their development. This strategy, however, contrasts with that of other teams in a similar position who opted to trade current players for future prospects. The move reflects owner Arte Moreno's resistance to a full rebuild.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to construct a new, 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the White House grounds, with a projected cost of $200 million. President Trump stated the new venue, which will replace the current East Wing, is a long-needed improvement for hosting large-scale events that currently require tents on the South Lawn. According to the White House, the project will be funded by President Trump himself and other "patriot donors" as a "gift to the country." This marks the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma made a stunning debut on the stock market, with its share price soaring 250% on the first day of trading, resulting in a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion. The successful IPO has created massive paper gains for its early venture capital backers, including firms like Index Ventures and Sequoia, who collectively hold stock worth around $24 billion. The blockbuster offering is a significant positive signal for the tech IPO market, which has been largely dormant for several years. The outcome is particularly notable as Figma's planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was blocked by regulators last year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has raised tariffs on most Canadian goods to 35%, up from 25%, with the new rate taking effect immediately. This targeted increase for the major U.S. trading partner came as a broader deadline for dozens of other nations passed, with new global tariff rates set to be implemented on August 7. The White House cited Canada's "continued inaction and retaliation" as the reason for the hike, which excludes goods covered under the USMCA trade pact. The move is part of the administration's aggressive and often unpredictable approach to international trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>
