          <p>Novelist Robert Harris, author of 'Conclave,' suggests the process of selecting a new Pope mirrors the dynamics of the TV show 'The Traitors,' where contestants identify 'traitors' among them. Harris notes the surprising and unpredictable nature of both conclaves and the show. He also reflects on the exclusion of women from the Catholic priesthood and papal elections, questioning its relevance in modern times. Harris shares his experience of researching his novel, including a Vatican visit facilitated by Pope Francis's office, which allowed him access to restricted areas.</p>

          <p>Reform achieved significant gains in recent local council elections, securing the most votes and seats, indicating support beyond a mere protest. The party's success is attributed to its appeal among Brexit voters and those who supported Boris Johnson in 2019. Reform performed well in areas that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum and in working-class wards with fewer university graduates. The article notes that both Conservatives and Labour need to address the concerns of this segment of the population to recover from recent electoral setbacks.</p>

The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities can receive up to $30,000 per year.

This announcement signals a potential clash between the two leaders after months of cooperation on immigration and trade, as Trump has been pushing for increased U.S. military involvement in addressing drug cartels.</p>
