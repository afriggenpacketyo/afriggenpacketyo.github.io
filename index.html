        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) lost 1-0 at home to the Portland Timbers, extending a winless streak at their stadium just before their Leagues Cup tournament begins. A 45th-minute header from Christian Paredes secured the victory for Portland, moving them ahead of LAFC in the Western Conference standings. LAFC's coach, Steve Cherundolo, expressed disappointment over conceding on a set piece and highlighted the team's need to regroup and strengthen its roster during the transfer window. The loss marks another instance of dropped points at home for LAFC, which will next face Mazatlán in the Leagues Cup.</p>

          <p>London's Tate Modern has announced it will extend its opening hours until 9:00 PM on Fridays and Saturdays starting in September. The initiative aims to make the gallery more accessible, particularly to younger visitors and those wishing to attend after work. This change builds on the success of the Tate Modern Lates program, a series of curated evening events that have attracted over 750,000 people since 2016. The gallery director and London's mayor praised the move as a way to enhance the city's vibrant cultural and nightlife scene, with the popular Lates events set to continue alongside the new hours.</p>

          <h2>Generational Swimming Showdown Expected Between Summer McIntosh and Katie Ledecky at World Championships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 03:00:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming world swimming championships in Singapore are set to feature a major duel between Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh and American veteran Katie Ledecky. Their confrontation in the 800m freestyle is highly anticipated, as McIntosh is the only swimmer to have defeated Ledecky in that event in 15 years. McIntosh, who recently broke three world records, is attempting to win five individual gold medals, a feat only Michael Phelps has accomplished. While McIntosh is in dominant form, the 800m remains Ledecky's signature event, setting the stage for a potentially historic and defining race for the sport.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for international cooperation to establish a global consensus on the governance of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need to balance development with security. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Li criticized monopolistic control of AI and advocated for open access to prevent the technology from being dominated by a few nations. This call comes amid an intensifying tech competition with the United States, which has restricted China's access to high-end chips. Li announced a new Chinese-led body to promote global AI cooperation and ensure its benefits are widely shared.</p>

          <p>The Wales women's rugby team achieved its first win under head coach Sean Lynn by defeating Australia in Brisbane, providing a significant boost ahead of the Rugby World Cup. After an early Australian try, Wales responded with two tries from Nel Metcalfe to take the lead. Although Australia narrowed the gap before halftime, a strong defensive performance in the second half allowed Wales to hold on for the victory. The encouraging performance against a higher-ranked opponent on Australian soil marks a turning point for the team after a winless Six Nations campaign earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>The pro-life group 40 Days for Life is celebrating the impending closure of two Planned Parenthood facilities in Houston, Texas, including what it describes as the largest abortion facility in the Western Hemisphere. The organization's CEO, Shawn Carney, called the news a "tremendous victory" for the pro-life movement. Planned Parenthood cited rising costs, staffing shortages, and low reimbursement rates for the closures, which come amid political pressure and abortion restrictions in Texas following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The closures are seen by activists as evidence that the pro-life movement is gaining ground at the state and grassroots levels.</p>

          <p>The ongoing deadly border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia involves a significant military imbalance, pitting a well-equipped, US-allied Thai military against Cambodia's smaller, China-backed armed forces. Thailand possesses superior numbers in personnel, modern aircraft, and advanced weaponry, largely due to its long-standing status as a major non-NATO ally of the United States. In contrast, Cambodia's younger military relies heavily on support and equipment from China, which has also developed a naval base in the country. While Thailand has a clear advantage in firepower, analysts note that the terrain along the disputed border may favor Cambodian forces.</p>

          <p>The recovery of the luxury market is showing a mixed picture, with several key challenges weighing on company forecasts despite some positive signs. A major headwind is the weakness in Japan, where a decline in the yen that previously spurred tourist spending has reversed, causing sales to drop for brands like Richemont and Burberry. Conversely, sales in the U.S. have shown signs of strengthening, though it is unclear if this is temporary buying ahead of potential tariffs. Many European luxury houses anticipate raising prices to offset these tariffs, while performance continues to diverge significantly between product categories like jewelry and leather goods.

The outcome of these elections could potentially shift the balance of power in the legislature, where the ruling Democratic Progressive Party currently lacks a majority.

Families reported being torn apart by these changes, with many patients and doctors apparently unaware of the severity of the risks.

          <p>A shooting at a University of New Mexico dormitory has resulted in the death of a 14-year-old and left a 19-year-old hospitalized with gunshot wounds. The incident occurred early Friday morning when an 18-year-old suspect allegedly opened fire on three other people in a dorm room. The suspect was taken into custody later that day, and police are continuing their investigation. The university closed its central campus for the day as a precaution and is providing counseling services to students and staff.

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Tunisia's capital to denounce what they call the authoritarian rule of President Kais Saied. The demonstration marked the fourth anniversary of Saied's move to dissolve parliament and rule by decree, an act his critics label a coup. Protesters chanted for the fall of the regime and the release of jailed opposition leaders, journalists, and activists, claiming the country has become an "open-air prison." Since 2021, Saied has consolidated power, dissolved judicial bodies, and overseen the arrest of numerous opponents, leading to widespread criticism from human rights groups and political figures.</p>

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing more than 20% of its total workforce, have applied to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program. This potential exodus would shrink NASA's civil servant personnel from approximately 18,000 to 14,000. The buyout program was introduced by the Trump administration to reduce the size and cost of the federal government. The news comes amid a proposed 25% budget cut for the agency for fiscal year 2026 and a recent leadership crisis, adding to concerns about the agency's ability to pursue its ambitious exploration goals.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. After a slow start to the month, the team has now scored five or more runs in seven of its last ten games. Key contributions came from Teoscar Hernández, who hit a crucial two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who continued his recent hot streak with a double and a single. The improved hitting provided enough support for pitcher Emmet Sheehan and the bullpen, which recorded its first scoreless effort in weeks, signaling a positive turn for the team.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier scientific and engineering talent, partly due to challenges faced by international PhD students in the United States. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are seizing the opportunity to hire candidates affected by US university funding cuts and stricter visa policies, offering competitive salaries to attract them. This influx of brainpower is crucial for the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector, which is increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence. The trend highlights a shift in the global competition for elite talent, with Chinese firms benefiting from the current US academic and political climate.</p>
