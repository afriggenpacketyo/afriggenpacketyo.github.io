          <p>President Trump will undertake a full state visit to the UK later this year, following scheduling conflicts that prevented an earlier meeting with King Charles.  The visit, likely in September, will include formal events and is considered a significant diplomatic event.  The announcement contrasts with the tradition of not offering second-term presidents a state visit.  This visit signifies the continued strong relationship between the US and the UK.</p>

          <p>Pauline Shanks Kaurin resigned from her position at the Naval War College in protest against President Trump's executive order restricting academic freedom.
