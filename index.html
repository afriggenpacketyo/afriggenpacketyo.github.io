          <p>US stock markets experienced another significant decline, extending the previous day's losses caused by President Trump's new tariffs.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 1,400 points, exacerbating concerns about the global economic impact of the tariffs.  China responded with retaliatory tariffs, further intensifying the trade war.  Economists warn of higher prices and slower growth, with some predicting a potential recession.  The situation reflects widespread anxiety among investors and businesses.</p>

          <h2>China's Strong Retaliation to Trump Tariffs Raises Doubts About Future Talks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's swift and strong response to President Trump's tariffs, including imposing 34% tariffs on all US goods, suggests a diminished hope for meaningful negotiations.  This contrasts with China's previous approach of phased concessions.  Experts attribute the change in strategy to shifts in trade dynamics and the disruption caused by Trump's policies.  The decisive countermeasures signal a potential escalation in the trade conflict and raise concerns about the future of US-China relations.</p>
