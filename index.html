          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Democrats argue the legislation will siphon funds from already underfunded public schools, primarily benefiting wealthier students. Supporters, including President Trump, praise the bill as a victory for parental choice and educational freedom.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's vision for Starbase, a city dominated by SpaceX in South Texas, is nearing reality with a local election likely to approve its incorporation. Most of the eligible voters are SpaceX employees, and the new municipality would have power over planning and taxation. However, nearby residents have voiced opposition, citing environmental concerns. The new city could gain control over highway closures and access to Boca Chica Beach during rocket launches, potentially leading to conflicts with county officials.</p>

          <p>The remains of U.S. Army Air Corps Sgt. James Swartz, a survivor of the Bataan Death March during World War II who died in a Japanese prisoner of war camp, were interred in Williamston Township, Michigan, 80 years after his death. Swartz's remains were identified in August 2024 and returned to his family for burial. He was captured during the surrender of U.S. forces in Bataan and died at the Cabanatuan POW Camp in September 1942 at the age of 21. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency exhumed remains from Common Grave 434 in 2019, leading to the identification through dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a law allocating $1 billion for school vouchers, making over 5 million students eligible to use state funds for private schools. This is a major win for conservatives seeking to reshape public education, with Texas becoming the 16th state to offer universal school choice. While advocates claim it empowers parents, opponents argue it drains money from public schools, benefiting mostly wealthier families. The law provides up to $10,000 per student annually and requires private schools to administer standardized tests.</p>

Advocates estimate that 100 to 200 people had been living in the encampment near Bend, a town facing a housing crisis due to an influx of wealthy newcomers. With limited shelter options, the eviction has been criticized as merely displacing the problem rather than solving it. The U.S. Forest Service cited the need to reduce wildfire risk and address unsanitary conditions as reasons for the removal.</p>

After taking the lead against Bournemouth, they failed to score, and experts express doubt about their chances against a strong PSG side.
