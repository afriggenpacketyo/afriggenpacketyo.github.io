          <p>Donald Trump appointed Fox News host and former New York prosecutor Jeanine Pirro as interim US attorney for Washington DC, after withdrawing his initial pick. Pirro, a staunch Trump ally, has made false statements about the 2020 election, previously defended Trump, and has a history of being a vocal supporter of Trump's policies. Her appointment, replacing Ed Martin, raises legal questions about bypassing Senate confirmation and could face challenges. Martin will remain at the US Justice Department as director of the "weaponization working group", which looks into officials who investigated Trump.</p>

Dr. Means, who trained as a surgeon but transitioned to functional medicine, has faced scrutiny for her holistic approach and past advocacy for alternative remedies.

          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer announced a new trade deal between the US and UK, but analysts suggest the substantive benefits are limited. While the UK secured some rollback of tariffs on cars and steel, a 10% import tax on most UK goods remains in place. In exchange, the US will see expanded opportunities for sales of American beef, ethanol, and other agricultural products in the UK. The deal is seen as a political victory for Trump, who is eager to showcase trade agreements, but its overall economic impact is expected to be narrow.</p>

          <p>A massive health fraud scheme involving at least 119 Amtrak employees and doctors resulted in $12 million in losses for the railroad company.

          <h2>Trump Seeks Tax Hike on Wealthy in Fiscal Package</h2>

          <p>President Trump has asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax hike on wealthy Americans in the fiscal package, proposing a new top income bracket for those earning over $2.5 million per year, taxed at 39.6%. This proposal would roll back a portion of the 2017 tax cuts and is aimed at offsetting the cost of continuing those cuts while protecting Medicaid. Republicans are considering other tax hikes with a populist flavor, including raising a tax on stock buybacks and further limiting companies‚Äô abilities to deduct compensation for highly paid employees.</p>

          <p>India appears ready to negotiate a trade deal with the U.S., potentially offering zero tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals. This shift comes after Trump's tariff announcements and could significantly impact India's domestic manufacturing ambitions. While some experts believe certain sectors won't be significantly harmed, others suggest that a deal could lead to a flood of U.S. goods into India. Financials, materials, and healthcare are expected to be the most sensitive to trade headlines.</p>
