          <h2>Netflix Announces First-Time Use of Generative AI in Original Production to Reduce Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 04:54:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has confirmed using generative artificial intelligence for visual effects in its Argentine sci-fi series, "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos stated the technology enabled the creation of a complex building collapse sequence at a fraction of the typical time and cost, making high-end effects accessible for smaller budgets. This move comes amid ongoing industry debate over AI's role, with unions and creators expressing concerns about job displacement and the use of copyrighted material for training AI models. The announcement coincided with Netflix reporting a 16% revenue increase, partly driven by the success of "Squid Game."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Grant Shapps, the former UK defence secretary, has defended the government's decision to conceal a significant data breach that exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had worked with British forces. In an interview, Shapps argued that a super-injunction was necessary to prevent the information from leading to the murder of those on the list by the Taliban. The breach, which also included data on over 100 British officials, prompted a covert resettlement scheme costing an estimated £850 million. The Ministry of Defence has not disclosed how many individuals may have been harmed as a result of the leak.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's Interior Minister, Alexander Dobrindt, is meeting with counterparts from several EU nations to push for a more stringent approach to migration policy across the bloc. The summit, held at the Zugspitze mountain, focuses on topics such as deportations to third countries, enhancing border security, and combating human trafficking. This meeting occurs as Germany carries out its second deportation flight of 81 Afghan nationals since the Taliban's return to power. Critics have labeled the event the "isolation summit," highlighting the controversial nature of the proposed tougher measures on asylum seekers and migrants.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has reported a 60% rise in serious water pollution incidents in England during 2024, reaching a record high of 2,801 total incidents. Of these, 75 were classified as causing "serious or persistent" harm, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water being the primary offenders. A parliamentary committee described the situation as "woeful," attributing the problem to regulatory failure and inadequate infrastructure maintenance by water companies. The report highlights a significant failure to meet pollution reduction targets, with levels now nearly 50% higher than in 2016.</p>

          <p>South East Water has enacted a temporary hosepipe and sprinkler ban affecting over 1.4 million customers in Kent and Sussex due to record-high demand for drinking water. The restriction follows extended periods of warm, dry weather and several heatwaves that have strained the water supply system. The measure prohibits using hosepipes for activities like watering gardens and washing cars, with potential fines up to £1,000 for violations. This action is part of a broader trend, with other water companies in the UK also implementing or planning similar bans amid drought conditions.</p>

Abbott stated it is "obvious" the current Labour leadership wants her out of the party.

          <p>A recent crackdown by India's market regulator on high-frequency trading firm Jane Street has brought the complex distinction between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation into focus. Arbitrage involves exploiting price differences across markets, while manipulation involves intentionally distorting prices for unfair gain. Experts suggest the key difference lies in intent, or "mens rea," and whether a trader is creating an artificial price discrepancy rather than just capitalizing on an existing one. The case against Jane Street alleges the firm deliberately influenced a less liquid stock market to profit from its larger positions in the more liquid options market. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision to step out of his comfort zone and build a career in his father's homeland has now paid off with his selection for the national team. Coaches praise his composure, toughness, and tactical kicking ability, marking him as ready for the international stage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has requested that sheriff's departments in California, including Los Angeles County, provide lists of all non-citizen inmates, their crimes, and their release dates. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna stated his department cannot comply with the request as they do not inquire about immigration status, and California's sanctuary laws prohibit sharing such information without a warrant. Luna described receiving "threatening letters" from the federal government regarding cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. The request highlights the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration's immigration policies and state-level sanctuary laws.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Martin Hemmings has publicly accused Raynor Winn, author of the bestselling memoir "The Salt Path," of stealing approximately £64,000 from their business in the early 2000s. They claim this alleged theft, not a bad business deal as depicted in the book, was the true reason for the financial difficulties that led to Winn and her husband losing their home. The accusations follow an investigation that questioned the narrative of the book, which has been adapted into a major film. Winn has acknowledged making "mistakes" but maintains the book's account of how they became homeless is accurate.</p>

          <p>Syrian government forces have largely withdrawn from the southern province of Sweida following a U.S. and Turkey-mediated ceasefire, ending days of deadly clashes with local Druze militias. The conflict, which killed nearly 600 people, had escalated to include Israeli airstrikes in defense of the Druze community. Under the new truce, local Druze factions will be responsible for maintaining security in the province. The fighting, which was reportedly triggered by kidnappings between Druze and local Bedouin tribes, highlights the fragile and complex sectarian dynamics in post-war Syria.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal has reported on the existence of a lewd birthday letter allegedly sent by Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which was part of a collection compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell. The letter reportedly included a raunchy dialogue printed inside a hand-drawn outline of a naked woman. President Trump has vehemently denied the report, calling it a "fake story" and threatening to sue the newspaper and its owner, Rupert Murdoch. This revelation comes amid increasing pressure on the Trump administration to release Justice Department files related to the deceased sex offender.</p>

The report also found that 130 inmates had been held too long over a six-month period and noted shockingly poor oversight of prisoners on suicide watch.

          <p>Amid growing pressure from his supporters, President Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek court approval for the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein. This move follows days of controversy over the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein files and a recent report about a lewd letter Trump allegedly sent to Epstein. The Attorney General confirmed she is prepared to petition the court to unseal the transcripts. The action is seen as an attempt to quell a political firestorm within Trump's base, which has been demanding greater transparency on the case.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in previously approved federal funding, which now heads to President Trump for his signature. The package includes the elimination of $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, effectively cutting all federal support for NPR and PBS, as well as about $7 billion in foreign aid. The move has been condemned by public media executives, who warn it will force many local stations, particularly in rural areas, to shut down.

          <p>A key index tracking China's progress toward a market-based economy has shown a decline, prompting calls from economists for renewed pro-market reforms. The report, from the National Economic Research Institute, revealed that the overall marketization level fell in 2023, with the largest deterioration seen in the relationship between the government and the market. This sub-index measures the extent of government intervention in the economy. Economists argue that reversing this trend is crucial for tackling economic imbalances and fostering healthier competition within industries. (not investment advice)</p>
