A unilateral ceasefire was announced by Russia, coinciding with the 80th anniversary event, though Ukraine dismissed it as a theatrical performance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. indicates that tariffs, particularly a 10% baseline, are likely to persist under a Trump administration. While the U.K. secured exemptions for 100,000 vehicles annually and tariff-free exports for steel and aluminum, most other goods remain subject to the 10% tariff. Analysts suggest this deal sets a precedent for future trade agreements, with limited exceptions and a focus on sector-specific concessions. The article notes that the deal may disproportionately benefit automakers assembling vehicles in the U.S. and could hinder the market share of British automakers like Jaguar Land Rover.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is collaborating with Israel on a plan to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, aiming to end Israel's two-month blockade. The proposed system involves establishing distribution zones managed by aid workers, with the Israeli military stationed outside. However, the United Nations has expressed reservations, citing concerns about reduced distribution points, increased risks for civilians, and potential forced displacement. Aid agencies worry that the plan may not effectively address the rising hunger crisis in Gaza and could further destabilize the region.</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned that the U.K. faces ongoing economic uncertainty, despite securing a trade agreement with the U.S. under President Trump's tariff regime. Bailey noted that the tariff and trade situation has injected more uncertainty into the global economy. While the U.K.-U.S. trade agreement is welcomed, the impact of tariffs from other countries and trading blocs will continue to affect the U.K.'s open economy. The Governor expressed hope for more trade agreements but acknowledged that overall tariff levels are likely to remain higher than before.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration patterns, with rising temperatures and extreme weather events impacting their journeys. Changes in coastal habitats, ocean acidification, and extreme weather threaten migratory birds' food sources and survival. Warmer temperatures can also lead to shorter migration routes or abandonment of original habitats, causing conflicts with resident animals. Conservation efforts, such as expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly environments, are crucial to helping migratory birds adapt to these challenges.</p>
