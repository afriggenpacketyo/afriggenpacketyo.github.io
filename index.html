          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, seizing a seat previously held by the Labour Party, this victory underscores Reform's potential to become a significant force in British politics. The party also anticipated gains in mayoral and local council elections, potentially accelerating the country's shift toward a more polarized, multiparty system. The New York Times article notes that the victory highlights voter frustration with the economy and tensions over immigration, which Reform has capitalized on, particularly by focusing on a local hotel housing migrants. The article also notes the win could increase pressure on Labour's economic policies and potentially make the Conservatives more vulnerable.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS, alleging left-wing bias in their news coverage. The executive order could face legal challenges, as federal funding for NPR and PBS is appropriated by Congress. NPR's President and CEO Katherine Maher defended the coverage and emphasized the importance of public media remaining relevant, while PBS's Paula Kerger addressed concerns about a video involving a drag performer. The CPB's budget is approved by Congress on a two-year cycle to insulate it from political pressures, and it has been fully funded through Sept 30, 2027.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration ended the 'de minimis' tariff loophole, which allowed low-value goods to enter the U.S. without import fees, in an effort to combat unfair competition and stem the flow of illicit drugs. The White House accused Chinese sellers of exploiting the loophole through deceptive shipping practices, and U.S. industry associations have long complained about unfair competition. The move is expected to increase prices for consumers, with retailers like Shein and Temu already raising prices on some goods. China has criticized the decision, arguing that it will harm American consumers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals, ruling that the White House's use of the statute was illegal.

While the ruling applies only to Venezuelan immigrants in the Southern District of Texas, it could influence other cases involving the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act. The judge found that the president's claims about the activities of a Venezuelan street gang did not align with the act's language.</p>

          <p>Marvel's 'Thunderbolts*' features two end-credits scenes that tease future developments in the MCU. The mid-credits scene shows the team enjoying their newfound status as heroes, while the post-credits scene reveals a conflict with Captain America over the 'Avengers' name and introduces a mysterious Fantastic Four spaceship. This sets up potential tensions between the two Avengers squads and hints at the introduction of the Fantastic Four in the upcoming 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' film. The Fantastic Four are also slated to appear in 'Avengers: Doomsday,' marking the return of Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom.</p>

          <p>Toyota, Honda, and other Japanese carmakers saw a combined 11.8% increase in U.S. sales in April due to customers rushing to buy vehicles before prices rise from additional tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump implemented a 25% tariff on cars produced outside the United States on April 3, leading customers to purchase hybrid and SUV models in particular. While sales surged, the auto market outlook remains uncertain as the last-minute buying is expected to impact future demand.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the 2025 graduates of the University of Alabama, delivering a speech that mixed campaign rally material with traditional commencement advice.

The audience, largely receptive, cheered at the scattershot injection of political issues, reflecting an era where even graduation speeches are politicized.

          <p>Apple is reportedly shifting production of iPhones and other devices bound for the U.S. away from China due to tariffs imposed by President Trump.

Apple estimates that U.S. import taxes could add about $900 million to its costs, despite electronics being spared from the new tariffs.
