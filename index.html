          <p>A public feud erupted between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, marked by insults and accusations traded on social media. Musk accused Trump of "ingratitude" for the 2024 election, supported calls for his impeachment, and alleged Trump's involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Trump responded by criticizing Musk's opposition to his legislative agenda and claiming he had asked Musk to leave his administration. The dispute originated from Musk's criticism of Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," leading to a series of personal attacks and threats to terminate government contracts with Musk's companies. The exchange underscores a significant rift between two influential figures and raises questions about the future of their relationship and the impact on their respective endeavors.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced sanctions against four judges from the International Criminal Court (ICC).

          <p>A study reveals that a proposed increase in the child tax credit, raising the maximum to $2,500, would exclude millions of low-income children. Approximately one-third of children would not receive the full credit due to their parents' low wages or lack of employment. This limitation undermines the potential benefits of the tax credit increase, as it fails to fully support families most in need. The findings highlight the challenges in designing effective tax policies that provide equitable support to all children, regardless of their parents' economic circumstances. The score is 45.</p>
