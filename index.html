          <p>Indian officials stated that Pakistan moved troops into forward areas and attacked 26 locations across India, indicating an intent to escalate the conflict. Indian Air Force Wing Commander Vyomika Singh refuted Pakistani claims of destroying Indian military infrastructure, dismissing them as misinformation. Singh affirmed India's commitment to non-escalation if Pakistan reciprocates, while emphasizing the armed forces' high operational readiness. The ongoing exchange of cross-border fire and strikes has led to civilian casualties on both sides amid rising tensions since the April 22 attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, which India attributed to Pakistani-backed militants.</p>

          <p>President Trump's stance on reducing U.S. support for Europe has prompted European allies to reassess their security strategies, impacting aid to Ukraine. Ukraine's Parliament approved a deal to give the U.S. a share of future revenue over natural resources, hoping to maintain American arms shipments. European leaders are increasing weapons production, but it will take time to reach full capacity. While Trump has recently shown more support for Ukraine, allies fear he may withdraw U.S. troops and the nuclear umbrella, diverting resources from aiding Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Maintaining friendships can be challenging after children enter the picture, with assumptions often made about availability and interests. Culture writer Anne Helen Petersen suggests open communication and compassion are essential for bridging the gap between parents and non-parents. Justin Kellough advises clear communication about availability, while Petersen encourages parents to invite child-free friends to family events to foster deeper connections. Addressing exclusion and balancing conversation topics are also important for maintaining inclusive and fulfilling friendships, adapting to new routines, and having open conversations about feelings of being ignored or unsupported.</p>

Google claims the changes align with its policy of following official U.S. government geographic designations through the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).

House and Senate Republican super PACs are aligning more closely with the White House, with veteran Trump strategists taking senior roles. Trump's super PAC, MAGA Inc., has accumulated roughly $400 million, potentially overshadowing congressional super PACs. Concerns arise about a power imbalance and the potential for Trump's personal agenda to clash with Republican leaders' priorities.

          <p>The relationship between French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is built on mutual respect, trust, and a shared goal of defending Ukraine against Russian encroachment. They communicate frequently through direct phone calls and consider each other friends. Macron views Zelensky as a courageous leader, while Zelensky sees Macron as someone who keeps his word and advocates for Ukraine's interests. Macron's visit to Kyiv in 2022 marked a turning point in their relationship, leading to increased support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>As China and the United States engage in formal trade talks, analysts predict a wide range of outcomes, from a deal that cuts tariff rates to one or both parties walking out with no consensus. Ideal scenarios involve moving towards reducing trade-prohibitive tariff rates, while worst-case scenarios include market tailspins and further damage to trade. One analyst suggests China could receive a pause in import duties similar to that offered to other countries, creating a reasonable timeline for negotiations. Since Trump's return to the White House, the US has raised cumulative tariffs on Chinese imports to at least 145 per cent.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has implemented a strategy to make the world dependent on China's exports and know-how, but this approach has consequences for his own country. To counter Washington's concerns about the trade imbalance, China chose to dominate supplies of things the world needs. China has ramped up exports and deepened its position as the world’s leading base for manufacturing, directing the central bank to lend nearly $2 trillion to industrial borrowers. China's willingness to weaponize the supply chain may be one of the starkest examples of how Mr. Xi is redefining China’s relationship with the world.</p>
