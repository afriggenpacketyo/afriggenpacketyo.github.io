          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in over 104 deaths, with many victims being children from a summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed due to a combination of factors, including moisture from a tropical system and the region's natural flood-prone geography. This article details the timeline of the disaster, the massive search and rescue efforts, and the growing scrutiny faced by local officials over the adequacy and timing of emergency warnings. The tragedy has prompted calls for improved flood alert systems, as the community grapples with immense loss and a monumental cleanup effort ahead.</p>

          <h2>Samsung Forecasts 56% Plunge in Second-Quarter Profit Amid AI Chip Struggles</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a significant 56% drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling well short of market expectations. The decline is largely attributed to the company's difficulties in the advanced memory chip sector, particularly in supplying high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips for artificial intelligence applications, where competitors like SK Hynix have gained a lead with key partners like Nvidia. The company's foundry business also faces challenges from weak orders and intense competition. This forecast highlights Samsung's struggle to capitalize on the booming AI market, despite its dominant position in smartphones and standard memory chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House, presenting a united front following recent joint military strikes against Iran. While both leaders hailed the strikes as a success, the meeting was underscored by the ongoing war in Gaza and President Trump's desire to broker a ceasefire deal. Discussions focused on a U.S.-backed proposal for a 60-day pause in fighting in exchange for hostage releases, though the ultimate goal of ending the war remains a point of contention. The meeting also touched upon broader regional ambitions, including normalizing relations with other Arab nations, which hinges on resolving the Gaza conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The catastrophic flooding in central Texas was fueled by extreme rainfall, with some areas receiving upwards of 20 inches over the holiday weekend. This article provides specific data from the National Weather Service, showing immense precipitation in locations like Bertram and Liberty Hill, which far exceeded initial forecasts. The deluge caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes, a rapid surge exacerbated by the region's topography that prevents quick soil absorption. With more rain forecasted, the area remains under a high threat of further flash flooding, compounding the ongoing recovery and rescue operations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed the implementation of higher tariffs on imports from 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, pushing the deadline to August 1. President Trump renewed threats of significant levies, such as a 25% tax on Japanese and South Korean goods, in a series of letters to world leaders. The delay extends a 90-day pause on some of the administration's most aggressive trade actions, originally announced in April. Economists express concern that these tariffs, if enacted, could lead to higher consumer prices in the U.S. and disrupt global trade, while the administration maintains they will protect American businesses.

The ruling freezes a key provision of the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which targeted federal funding for organizations that provide abortion services. Planned Parenthood argued in its lawsuit that the law unconstitutionally singled out the organization and would devastate access to its non-abortion healthcare services for millions of patients who rely on Medicaid. The 14-day order ensures funding continues while the legal challenge proceeds, setting up a significant clash over healthcare and abortion access.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Questions Who is in Control of U.S. Defense and Foreign Policy</h2>

          <p>This analysis piece from The Atlantic argues that U.S. foreign and defense policy under the Trump administration is suffering from a lack of clear leadership and a coherent process. With President Trump's interest being capricious and key cabinet positions filled by figures with little power or experience, critical decisions are seemingly being driven by lower-level, unelected officials like Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby. The article suggests this dysfunction creates a policy void where actions, such as halting arms to Ukraine or striking Iran, are pursued without a guiding strategy. This creates an unpredictable and potentially dangerous situation on the world stage.</p>

          <p>A brush fire ignited in a hilly residential area of Laguna Beach, prompting evacuation orders for several hundred homes. Officials suspect that fireworks were the cause of the blaze, which grew to three acres. Firefighting efforts, involving multiple helicopters, aircraft, and ground crews, were aided by the city's recent proactive fire mitigation work, including vegetation thinning and the installation of a high-capacity water tank for aerial drops. While no homes were immediately reported damaged, the fire caused significant traffic congestion as residents evacuated and key roads, including a stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway, were closed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who served as physician to former President Joe Biden, has requested a delay in his scheduled testimony before the House Oversight Committee. His lawyer cited the need to establish an agreement that protects doctor-patient confidentiality, as the Republican-led committee investigates Biden's health and mental fitness during his time in office. The committee has rejected the delay, stating that privilege can be asserted on a question-by-question basis but cannot be used to decline a subpoena. The dispute is part of a broader, politically charged inquiry into the former president's capacity while serving in the White House.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed a United Nations working group that the United States holds legal jurisdiction and responsibility for over 200 migrants sent to its CECOT mega-prison. This claim, made in a court filing, appears to contradict the Trump administration's position that it cannot retrieve the migrants because they are under Salvadoran authority. The migrants were deported under the Alien Enemies Act, with the U.S. paying El Salvador to house them. The ACLU, representing the migrants, accuses the U.S. government of withholding this information and argues it confirms the U.S. controls the fate of the individuals sent there without due process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British Members of Parliament may soon vote on a proposal to make at least 10 Premier League soccer matches available on free-to-air television each season. The Liberal Democrats have tabled an amendment to the Football Governance Bill that would require the new independent regulator to ensure these games are accessible without expensive subscriptions. The proposal aims to tear down the "paywall" around the country's top football league, making it more accessible to the general public. The move is part of a broader effort to widen public access to major sporting events, though it faces resistance from those concerned about its impact on broadcasting rights revenue.</p>

          <p>As part of its strategy to navigate the ongoing trade war and bolster national security, China is focusing on developing its interior provinces, with Guizhou emerging as a key player. Long one of the country's poorest regions, Guizhou is now being positioned as a "strategic hinterland" under the nation's 2026-2030 development plan. Provincial leaders are aiming to leverage the area's comparative advantages to serve the national strategy, likely focusing on industries like big data, for which the region is already known. This shift represents a broader effort to create a more resilient and self-sufficient economy in the face of external pressures and geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>World number one Jannik Sinner advanced to the Wimbledon quarterfinals in an emotional match that ended when his opponent, Grigor Dimitrov, was forced to retire due to injury. Dimitrov was leading by two sets when he collapsed in pain, clutching his pectoral muscle, and was unable to continue. A concerned Sinner, who assisted his friend off the court, stated he could not accept the outcome "as a win," expressing his sadness for Dimitrov, who has been plagued by injuries at recent Grand Slam tournaments. The unfortunate conclusion overshadowed Sinner's achievement of reaching his seventh consecutive Grand Slam quarter-final.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it will ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will render such confidentiality clauses void, preventing companies from covering up inappropriate or criminal behavior. The move follows years of campaigning by activists like Zelda Perkins, Harvey Weinstein's former assistant, who broke her own NDA. The change aims to end the "appalling practice" of misusing NDAs, bringing the UK in line with other countries that have enacted similar protections for workers.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors marched in Mexico City to voice their anger over rising rents and gentrification, which they attribute to an influx of foreigners, particularly Americans, working remotely. The march, held on U.S. Independence Day, included signs like "gringo go home" and saw some participants vandalize storefronts. The demonstrations highlight growing tensions over the rising cost of living and the transformation of historic neighborhoods, where local shops are being replaced by businesses catering to expatriates. While Mexican leaders condemned the xenophobic tone and vandalism, they acknowledged that the underlying issue of housing affordability needs to be addressed.</p>
