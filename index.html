          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for high-risk groups like seniors and those with underlying conditions, but will require vaccine makers to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials before approving them for wider use. This decision, outlined by Dr. Vinay Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary, means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA is urging vaccine makers to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. The agency aims to strike a balance between rapid access for vulnerable populations and evidence-based approval for average-risk individuals.</p>

The memes, which resurfaced after being reported by the targeted sailor, have led to non-judicial punishment and punitive letters for the involved SEALs, potentially ending their careers. Platoon and team leaders are also facing administrative actions for not adequately addressing the sailor's concerns about racist behavior and for a flawed decision to revoke his qualifications.

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has strongly condemned Israel's bombing of Gaza, describing it as "morally unjustifiable" and signaling a "dark new phase" in the conflict. The UK has suspended talks over a new trade deal with Israel and is drawing up plans with other countries to impose sanctions on Israeli officials. Lammy accused Israel of "cruel and monstrous extremism" and warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

          <p>Japan's export growth slowed for the second consecutive month in April, rising by only 2%, as the country grapples with the impact of U.S. tariffs. This marks the slowest export growth since October of the previous year. Meanwhile, imports shrank by 2.2%, less than anticipated. The slowdown in exports is contributing to concerns about Japan's economic growth, with the country's GDP having contracted in the first quarter of the year. The United States currently levies a 25% tariff on Japanese auto, steel, and aluminum exports.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has opened a criminal investigation into Andrew M. Cuomo, a front-runner in the New York City mayoral race, after Republicans accused him of lying to Congress about decisions he made during the coronavirus pandemic as governor. This inquiry follows the Justice Department's dismissal of corruption charges against current Mayor Eric Adams, creating a politically charged situation. The investigation stems from a referral by Representative James Comer, who alleges that Cuomo lied about his involvement in editing a New York State Health Department report on nursing home deaths during the pandemic. The investigation is led by Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host who has publicly criticized Cuomo.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a first-of-its-kind waiver for Nebraska to ban purchases of soda and energy drinks through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known as food stamps, starting next year. This decision marks a shift in nutrition policy, potentially paving the way for more state waivers seeking to restrict unhealthy purchases. Nebraska will survey participants to evaluate changes in spending habits and provide technical assistance to retailers. The prohibition adds to existing limits on SNAP benefits, which already exclude hot foods, nonfood items, alcohol, and tobacco products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis reveals that red meat studies with industry links are more likely to report favorable cardiovascular results compared to independently funded studies. The review of 44 clinical trials found that industry-funded studies often neglected to compare red meat to heart-healthy plant-based protein sources, instead comparing it to other animal proteins or carbohydrates. This raises concerns about how financial interests can shape public understanding of the health consequences of food. Experts emphasize the need for more independent nutrition research to ensure unbiased information.</p>

          <p>The US and China have reached a 90-day tariff truce, providing a temporary reprieve from a potentially damaging trade decoupling. While the prospect of a comprehensive agreement by the August deadline remains uncertain, the truce indicates that neither side is willing to completely sever economic ties. Tariffs on Chinese goods have been scaled back from 145% to around 50%, still casting a shadow over bilateral trade. However, some expect tariffs on Chinese goods to either hold steady or decrease further once the 90-day period lapses.</p>

          <p>The UK has suspended talks on a trade deal with Israel, summoned the country's ambassador, and imposed fresh sanctions on West Bank settlers in response to the military escalation in Gaza. Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the military escalation in Gaza "morally unjustifiable". The move follows warnings of starvation in Gaza after Israel launched a new military operation over the weekend. The Israeli government has already been warned it must end its "egregious" military expansion and "immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza" in a joint statement from the leaders of the UK, Canada and France on Monday.</p>

The National Crime Agency (NCA) has told BBC News the group is a key part of its ongoing investigation to find the culprits. The wave of attacks, which began at Easter, have resulted in empty shelves in stores, the suspension of online ordering, and millions of people's private data being stolen. The attacks have been carried out using DragonForce, a platform that gives criminals the tools to carry out ransomware attacks.</p>
