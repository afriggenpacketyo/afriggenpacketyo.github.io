          <p>A special tribunal has been established to prosecute Russia's crimes in Ukraine, but faces numerous obstacles. While the tribunal can investigate Russian leadership, including Putin, Mishustin, and Lavrov, they are immune from prosecution while in office. Oleksandra Matviichuk criticizes this absurdity, emphasizing the need to hold those responsible for atrocities accountable since the war began in 2014, not just after the full-scale invasion in 2022.

          <p>A massive explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port in Iran resulted in deaths and injuries, with initial reports suggesting a chemical blast involving containers storing flammable materials. The explosion, felt up to 50km away, caused widespread damage and prompted investigations, with some analysts suggesting the fire was caused by improper handling of solid fuel for ballistic missiles. The incident occurred amid ongoing nuclear talks between Iranian and US officials in Oman, although Iranian officials stated that the explosion was unrelated to the country's oil refineries.</p>
