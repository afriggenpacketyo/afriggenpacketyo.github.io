          <p>The idea for Trump's military parade originated from an Army live-action show.  The Army saw the event as a way to reintroduce the Army to the American people.  The parade's high cost and association with authoritarian regimes have drawn criticism.  Despite criticism, the parade proceeded as planned, including a flyover by the Air Force Thunderbirds.</p>

          <p>The US's revocation of student visas for Chinese nationals has a less significant impact than initially perceived.
