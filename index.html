          <p>OpenAI has inaugurated the first site of its ambitious $500 billion Stargate project in Abilene, Texas, marking a significant step in securing the vast computing power required for future artificial intelligence. This flagship data center, leased by Oracle and equipped with Nvidia chips, is designed to scale past a gigawatt of capacity, enough to power 750,000 U.S. homes. OpenAI, alongside partners like Oracle and SoftBank, plans five additional Stargate sites across the U.S., aiming for nearly 7 gigawatts and over $400 billion in investment within three years. The project underscores a global "compute crunch" and the unprecedented demand for AI infrastructure, with construction efforts accelerating to deploy next-generation chips by 2026.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump on his West Palm Beach golf course, was found guilty on all five counts. Following the verdict, Routh reportedly tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen, leading to his forceful removal from the courtroom, though he sustained no serious injury. His daughter, present in court, expressed defiance, claiming the trial was rigged. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon later allowed Routh back, informing him of his December 18 sentencing, where he faces up to life in prison. Prosecutors argued Routh methodically planned the attack, despite his defense that he lacked the intent or capacity to kill.</p>

          <p>Actor Marlon Wayans has taken to social media to defend his latest film, "HIM," which received negative critical reviews, currently standing at a 29% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Wayans urged his followers to form their own opinions, emphasizing that critical reception doesn't always reflect audience appreciation or a film's eventual classic status. He highlighted past projects like "White Chicks" and "Scary Movie," which were initially criticized but later found widespread popularity. This article notes that while critics remain largely unimpressed, the film has achieved a more favorable 58% audience score, suggesting a disconnect between professional reviews and public sentiment.</p>

          <p>A wave of anti-corruption protests, largely driven by Generation Z, has swept across Asia, leading to significant political upheaval and even the resignation of Nepal's prime minister. Young activists in countries like Nepal, Indonesia, and the Philippines are leveraging social media and AI tools to mobilize against perceived endemic corruption and social inequality, often targeting "nepo kids" who symbolize the unfair system. Despite government bans on social media and instances of violence, including deaths, protesters view these movements as a powerful new era of activism. While some governments have conceded to demands, the challenge remains for these leaderless, digitally-driven movements to translate into lasting systemic change.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced that her administration has successfully averted all planned layoffs for city workers this year, a significant achievement given an initial $1 billion budget shortfall that threatened over 1,600 positions. This outcome resulted from months of negotiations and agreements with various city unions, which included voluntary unpaid holidays and other cost-cutting measures. Scaling back hiring in departments like the LAPD and fire department also played a crucial role in preserving jobs. While celebrating this immediate success, city officials emphasized the ongoing need for long-term fiscal strategies to address persistent budget challenges and safeguard the city's workforce and services.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle intensified into a Category 4 major hurricane, marking the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season. Although it is expected to track farther out into the Atlantic, a hurricane watch has been issued for the Azores, and the powerful storm is generating life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coasts of Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast, from North Carolina to Canada. Forecasters anticipate Gabrielle will approach and move across the Azores from Thursday night into Friday. Despite initial predictions for a busier-than-average season, hurricane activity has been somewhat quieter than anticipated this year, with only one named storm making U.S. landfall prior to Gabrielle.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly shifted his position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, now suggesting that Ukraine can win back all its territory seized by Russia. This reversal comes after his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the U.N. General Assembly, contrasting his previous stance that Kyiv might need to cede some land. Trump, who earlier expressed frustration with Putin, indicated that Russia appears like a "paper tiger" due to the prolonged war. He also supported NATO members shooting down Russian aircraft if they violate airspace and urged European nations to stop buying Russian energy, though he has resisted tougher sanctions himself.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will implement an automated ball-strike (ABS) challenge system starting in the 2026 season, allowing players to dispute umpire calls on balls and strikes. This new system, tested extensively in the minor leagues and in spring training, aims to balance the umpire's role with correcting missed calls in high-leverage situations, without significantly slowing down the game. Each team will receive two challenges per game, retaining a challenge if the call is overturned. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred stated the system strikes the right balance, preserving the human element while leveraging technology for accuracy, a change largely favored by players over a fully automated strike zone.</p>

          <p>FCC Chair Brendan Carr has issued threats against TV networks, including ABC's parent company Disney, suggesting license revocations over Jimmy Kimmel's controversial comments. This article argues that such threats are antithetical to the FCC's mission of free expression and are legally difficult to enforce, as license revocations are rare and subject to extensive appeals. Former FCC Chair Alfred Sikes also criticized Carr's stance, viewing it as opposing free speech. The article suggests Carr's actions are aimed at pleasing President Trump and leveraging the FCC's power over mergers and acquisitions, as demonstrated by previous settlements with media companies and preemptions by affiliates like Nexstar and Sinclair.</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially classified the Antifa movement as a domestic terrorist organization, signing a decree to investigate and dismantle its operations and funding. This move follows Trump's repeated allegations that the "radical left" was responsible for the assassination of Charlie Kirk. However, this article highlights that legal experts and agencies like the FBI have previously stated it's difficult to classify Antifa as a terrorist organization due to its lack of formal structure. Concerns remain high regarding the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech and assembly, making a terrorist classification potentially seen as an attempt to criminalize political expressions of opinion.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, the strongest storm of 2025, has caused a mountain lake in eastern Taiwan to burst its banks, leading to two deaths and scores missing or trapped. The typhoon, equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane, brought nearly 60cm of rain to Taiwan, washing away a bridge and submerging cars. Now, Ragasa is barreling towards China's southern coast, particularly Guangdong province, where 370,000 people have been evacuated and Hong Kong has issued its maximum typhoon warning. This article notes that while the region is accustomed to typhoons, the "dirty side" of Ragasa, combined with climate change impacts, could worsen its destructive potential.</p>
