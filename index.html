          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut to address a slowing labor market, marking the first reduction of the year. The Federal Open Market Committee's projections, known as the "dot plot," indicate the possibility of two additional cuts before the end of 2025. This decision comes amidst significant political pressure from the White House and internal debate, with one governor dissenting in favor of a larger reduction. The Fed's statement highlighted rising downside risks to employment while acknowledging that inflation remains somewhat elevated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Director-General of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has offered a positive perspective on the trade disruptions caused by President Trump's unilateral tariffs. She framed the challenges as an opportunity to rebalance supply chains, open new markets, and foster a new era of “reglobalisation.” Despite the ongoing tariff battles, Okonjo-Iweala asserted that the WTO remains relevant, with nearly three-quarters of global commerce still operating under its rules. She acknowledged the system has been heavily disrupted but expressed excitement about the potential for positive change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Yale University researchers details an extensive and growing network of facilities where Russia is systematically reeducating and providing military training to thousands of Ukrainian children. The investigation identified 210 sites across Russia and occupied territories where children as young as eight are stripped of their cultural identity and taught combat skills, including grenade throwing. This network, which investigators estimate could hold up to 35,000 children, is seen as a potential war crime, prompting international concern and underscoring a systematic effort to militarize Ukrainian youth.</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has not commented on a recent incident in Dearborn where the city's mayor, Abdullah Hammoud, told a resident he was "not welcome" in the city. The confrontation occurred after the resident, Ted Barham, objected to the city honoring a newspaper publisher with past statements viewed as sympathetic to terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas. Mayor Hammoud accused Barham of not believing in coexistence and suggested he should move if he was unhappy. The publisher, Osama Siblani, claimed his past comments were taken out of context.</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle has publicly pushed back against United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby's assertion that the ultra-low-cost carrier model is dead. Biffle countered that the U.S. airline industry is currently facing an oversupply issue, not a problem with the discount model itself. His comments followed Kirby's prediction that rival Spirit Airlines would fail, calling Frontier the "last man standing on a sinking ship." Biffle defended his airline's lower operating costs and its role in serving budget-conscious travelers who might otherwise not fly.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Rhode Island, alleging that a student loan forgiveness program in the Providence Public School District is racially discriminatory. The program offers up to $25,000 in debt relief to new teachers who identify as Black, Hispanic, Asian, or American Indian, but excludes white teachers. This legal action is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to challenge diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies nationwide.

After the incident, National Park Service medics escorted the injured man out of the backcountry, and he was subsequently flown to a hospital.

By securing a multi-year CD now, savers can protect their earnings against further market changes and an unpredictable economic climate.

          <p>Doctors have diagnosed former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro with an early-stage skin cancer after removing and testing two skin lesions. The diagnosis was announced following his discharge from a hospital where he was treated for separate issues, including dizziness and low blood pressure. Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest after being convicted of plotting a coup, will require regular monitoring to ensure the removals were complete and to check for new lesions. He was taken to the hospital from his home after reporting that he felt unwell.</p>

          <p>In a late-stage clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral diabetes pill, orforglipron, demonstrated superior performance in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's approved oral drug, Rybelsus. The study found that the highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill reduced hemoglobin A1c levels by 2.2% and led to an average weight loss of 9.2%, outperforming the results from Novo Nordisk's medication. These results move Eli Lilly closer to introducing a new, convenient, needle-free alternative in the highly competitive market for GLP-1 diabetes and obesity treatments.</p>

          <p>Former UFC champion B.J. Penn was arrested in Hawaii for violating a restraining order filed by his mother, Lorraine Shin. This marks his fifth arrest since late May, all stemming from a dispute where Penn has publicly claimed his family members were murdered and replaced by imposters. Shin obtained the protection order after alleging domestic and psychological abuse, stating that her son may suffer from Capgras syndrome, a rare delusional disorder. Penn, who has posted bail, faces multiple trials in the coming months related to these ongoing incidents.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama stated that the U.S. is at an "inflection point" regarding political violence, commenting on the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Speaking in Pennsylvania, Obama condemned the rush by President Trump and others to "identify an enemy" before all facts were known, arguing this approach deepens national divisions. He contrasted this with his own and George W. Bush's efforts to unite the country after tragedies. Obama mourned Kirk's death but stressed the need for honest debate over ideas without resorting to violence or silencing opponents.</p>
