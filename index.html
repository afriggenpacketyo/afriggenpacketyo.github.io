          <p>Tesla's board is seeking shareholder approval for a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, potentially valued at over $1 trillion over the next decade. The plan involves awarding Musk a significant number of shares contingent on the company achieving ambitious market capitalization, production, and profitability milestones. To fully vest, Tesla's market cap would need to reach $8.5 trillion, and the company would have to meet specific targets for vehicle deliveries, robotaxi production, and humanoid robot manufacturing. This proposal follows a previous $56 billion pay package that was voided by a Delaware judge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a press conference in São Paulo, Brazil, ahead of the Kansas City Chiefs' season opener, tight end Travis Kelce engaged in some lighthearted banter with his teammate, quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Kelce answered a question from the media by perfectly mimicking Mahomes' distinctive raspy voice, causing laughter in the room. He explained the impersonation was playful revenge for Mahomes previously joking that Kelce couldn't locate Brazil on a map. The interaction highlighted the team's positive morale as they prepared to face the Los Angeles Chargers to start their season.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is undertaking a significant renovation project, aiming to "uplift" approximately 1,000 of its U.S. locations by the end of 2026 to create more inclusive and welcoming spaces. The redesigns will feature cozier elements like more seating and dark wood paneling, along with accessibility improvements such as less harsh lighting for customers with light sensitivity. This initiative is part of a broader strategy under CEO Brian Niccol to restore the cafes' reputation as a "third place" for customers, reversing previous decisions that discouraged lingering. The company plans to invest around $150,000 per location for these makeovers.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the friendly match between the U.S. and South Korean men's national soccer teams, several key narratives surround the visiting squad. A major point of interest is the evolving role of star player Son Heung-min, whose captaincy is under review by coach Hong Myung-bo. The team also features Jens Castrop, the first player to switch national allegiance to play for South Korea, potentially setting a new trend.

          <p>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council has stated it will not legally penalize a former official for attending a Victory Day military parade in Beijing. Deputy Minister Liang Wen-chieh explained that the former position falls outside the scope of laws restricting retired officials from attending such events. However, the council expressed "deep regret" over the action, stating it "failed to actively uphold governmental dignity and defied public expectations." The decision comes after Taipei had issued repeated warnings to retired officials and generals against attending the ceremony in mainland China.</p>

Pichai expressed his gladness that the long process was over and pivoted to discussing collaboration on artificial intelligence, praising the administration's AI action plan.

          <p>The full correspondence regarding Angela Rayner's resignation as UK Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary has been made public, detailing the circumstances of her departure. In her letter to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Rayner accepts responsibility for an error in stamp duty payment, citing the toll of media scrutiny on her family as a key reason for stepping down. The reply from the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards, Sir Laurie Magnus, concludes that while she acted with integrity, her failure to pay the correct tax meant she did not meet the "highest possible standards of proper conduct," constituting a breach of the ministerial code.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques the recent advocacy for free speech by Donald Trump and Nigel Farage, arguing their positions are hypocritical. It highlights Trump's admiration for authoritarian leaders like Kim Jong-un and his administration's efforts to influence historical narratives at institutions like the Smithsonian. The article also points to a contradiction involving Farage's Reform UK party, where a council leader in Nottinghamshire attempted to ban councillors from speaking to local press. The author suggests that both figures champion free speech for themselves while simultaneously acting in ways that undermine it for others.</p>

          <p>The once-strong "bromance" between U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has significantly frayed, reflecting broader tensions in the U.S.-India relationship. Key factors contributing to the split include punishing U.S. tariffs on Indian goods and geopolitical maneuvering involving India's rival, Pakistan. The situation was exacerbated when Trump took credit for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, an act that embarrassed Modi. This breakdown in personal diplomacy has led to economic consequences and a strategic shift, with India now making a more urgent priority of mending its relationship with China.</p>

The resulting persistent hum in the stadiums, amplified by the roof structures, muffles the sounds of the game.

          <p>German automaker BMW is launching a new generation of software-centric electric vehicles, branded "Neue Klasse," to better compete with rivals like Tesla and emerging Chinese manufacturers. CEO Oliver Zipse highlighted that the new platform represents the company's largest single investment and features a centralized "superbrain" computer system with significantly more processing power. This focus on digital architecture aims to enhance automated driving and infotainment capabilities. Amid fierce price competition, especially in China, Zipse stated that BMW will rely on its brand's reputation for quality and technology to maintain its market position.</p>

          <p>Portuguese police have confirmed that three British nationals—an 82-year-old man, a 44-year-old man, and a 36-year-old woman—were among the 16 people killed in the Glória funicular crash in Lisbon. The popular tourist attraction derailed and crashed into a building, also injuring more than 20 people. Victims from several other countries, including Portugal, South Korea, and the United States, have also been identified. The public transport operator has launched an independent investigation into the cause of the derailment, which Prime Minister Luís Montenegro called one of the nation's biggest recent human tragedies.</p>

          <p>Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, has passed away at the age of 92, leaving behind a legacy as a uniquely independent member of the Royal Family. While known publicly for presenting trophies at Wimbledon, she quietly carved her own path, notably becoming the first royal to convert to Catholicism in over 300 years. Seeking a more private life driven by her passions for music and children, she stepped back from royal duties and stopped using her HRH title to work as a music teacher at a primary school in Hull, where she was known simply as "Mrs Kent."</p>

          <p>A report from the Chinese Academy of Sciences asserts that China has achieved a strategic military advantage over the United States through its mature gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor technology. This dominance has allowed China to deploy advanced phased array radar systems at a scale and pace the U.S. cannot match. The article suggests that China's export controls on critical materials like gallium are acting as a "silent sanction" on the U.S. defense industry. This move exploits China's near-monopoly on these raw materials, creating a widening "weapons generation gap" between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 people on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat marks a significant escalation in the "war on drugs," blending tactics from the "war on terror." The Trump administration has designated several Latin American criminal groups, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, as terrorist organizations, providing a potential legal framework for military action. This move follows President Trump's long-stated desire to use military force against cartels. The new approach raises legal questions and suggests a more interventionist U.S. policy in Latin America, with some officials hinting at the possibility of regime change in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Researchers have determined that solar flares, powerful eruptions from the sun's surface, could reach temperatures as high as 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. This is more than six times hotter than previous estimates, which were based on measuring the temperature of electrons within the flares. New calculations and simulations suggest that ions, another type of particle in the flares, heat up significantly more than electrons, a difference that was previously overlooked. A better understanding of these extreme temperatures could help scientists protect satellites and astronauts from the dangerous effects of these solar events.</p>

          <p>A deadly funicular crash in Lisbon, Portugal, has resulted in the deaths of 16 people, with victims identified from at least seven different countries, including the United States, the U.K., and South Korea. The popular "Elevador da Gloria" tourist attraction derailed and crashed into a building after reportedly hurtling uncontrollably down a steep hill. More than 20 others were injured in the incident. Investigators are examining the possibility that a snapped steel cable was the cause, which would have rendered the braking systems ineffective against the momentum of the 20-ton carriage.</p>

          <p>Manchester City defender John Stones has been withdrawn from the England national football squad ahead of upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia. England manager Thomas Tuchel confirmed that Stones arrived at the training camp with a muscular issue that has not resolved, and the decision was made not to take any risks. This is a setback for Tuchel, who has yet to have the experienced defender available during his tenure and views him as a key player with unique qualities. The injury leaves Marc Guehi, Dan Burn, Ezri Konsa, and Jarell Quansah as the remaining centre-back options for the two matches.</p>

          <p>A French couple who illegally kept a black panther in their apartment, which later roamed onto a rooftop, have been handed suspended jail sentences. The owners protested that they viewed the animal, named Louise, as their affectionate baby. The incident in 2019 in Armentieres, France, required a significant police and rescue operation to safely capture the feline without any injuries. The court convicted the couple for illegally keeping a wild animal, with one owner barred from keeping animals for five years. The panther, now renamed Akilla, is reportedly doing well at a big cat sanctuary in the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>In a notable turn in the New York City mayoral race, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Donald Trump to a debate. The challenge came after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for debates with only Mamdani, urging other candidates to drop out. Mamdani responded by suggesting he would rather debate Trump directly than his "puppet," referencing reports that the White House is exploring ways to consolidate the field against him. The four-way race has become increasingly contentious, with incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa both insisting they will not withdraw from the election.</p>

The poll, conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Center, found that U.S. economic competition and potential conflict over Taiwan are perceived as the top two threats to China. Despite these concerns, 61% of respondents favor a policy that combines cooperation with limiting U.S. power where necessary.

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom rose by 0.6% in July, a stronger-than-expected increase attributed to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 football tournament. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), clothing, footwear, and online stores saw particularly strong growth. The release of this data was delayed by two weeks due to concerns over statistical quality, for which the ONS apologized, admitting to errors in its seasonal adjustments. While the monthly figure was positive, sales over the three-month period to July were down compared to the previous quarter. (not investment advice)</p>
