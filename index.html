            <p>Ukrainian tennis player Lesia Tsurenko is taking legal action against the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), claiming she suffered "moral abuse" from the organization. Tsurenko alleges she experienced panic attacks due to the WTA's decision to "protect" a senior official following an attack on her. She says the WTA's indifference and injustice led to a prolonged moral decline, causing pain, fear, and harassment. The WTA expressed sympathy for Tsurenko's challenges but stated its disappointment with her decision to pursue legal action.</p>

            <p>Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns that President Trump's tariff policies are creating opportunities for corruption and self-dealing within the administration. In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, 47 House and Senate members demanded details on plans to prevent the misuse of tariffs for personal enrichment. The letter, spearheaded by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Judy Chu and Linda SÃ¡nchez, underscores the Democrats' focus on Trump's economic management as they oppose his second term.</p>

            <p>American pastor Josh Sullivan was rescued in South Africa following a shootout between police and his captors, resulting in the death of three suspects. Sullivan, originally from Tennessee, was abducted at gunpoint from his church during a prayer meeting. Police said Sullivan was found unharmed in the same vehicle as the suspects. Investigations suggest the abduction was likely financially motivated, as kidnappings for ransom have increased in South Africa. Sullivan had been serving at Fellowship Baptist Church since 2018, aiming to establish a church for the Xhosa-speaking community.</p>

Despite warnings in academic literature about the damaging effects of school interruptions, health officials ignored these consequences. Closures were implemented at state and local levels due to public fears and teachers' unions' campaigning, leading to disproportionate harm for lower-income families and children with special needs. The lack of a clear plan for reopening and the failure to acknowledge the harms of closures led to a disastrous outcome for many.</p>

            <p>Home equity loans and HELOCs offer homeowners access to funds, but rates fluctuate with federal adjustments. Comparing quotes from multiple lenders is crucial for securing the best rate. Choosing a shorter loan term can result in lower interest rates, but requires careful budget consideration. Improving credit scores is essential, as higher scores lead to more favorable rates. Home equity products are attractive financing options due to rates typically being better than credit cards or personal loans. (not investment advice)</p>

The spot price of gold is influenced by factors such as supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events, and central bank policies. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge, making it a smart bet for many investors, though short-term price fluctuations should be expected. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The chairwoman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) stated that the NHS will face legal action if it fails to update its gender policies to align with a recent Supreme Court ruling. The ruling defines "woman" as biological sex under equalities law. The NHS's current guidance, which accommodates trans people based on their dress, names, and pronouns, would need to be revised. The EHRC expects its updated guidance to be in place by the summer and will pursue the NHS if changes are not made.</p>
