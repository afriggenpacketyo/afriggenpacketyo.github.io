            <p>Mikal Mahdi, convicted of two separate murders in 2004, was executed by firing squad in South Carolina after his final appeals were rejected by state and federal courts. Mahdi was sentenced to death for killing an off-duty police officer and to life in prison for the murder of a convenience store clerk. He chose the firing squad as his method of execution and did not make a final statement. The execution marks the second time in five weeks that South Carolina has used a firing squad and the fifth execution overall in the state in the past eight months.</p>

            <p>Alaska lawmakers are grappling with budget uncertainties due to market volatility stemming from fluctuating oil prices and President Trump's tariff policies. The state's budget, heavily reliant on oil revenue, faces challenges as lawmakers debate how to allocate funds between the oil-wealth fund dividend for residents and essential services like education. Some hope that Trump's tariffs could incentivize countries to invest in Alaska's proposed liquefied natural gas project, but overall, the economic climate is creating tension and difficult choices for policymakers.

Luna's efforts, initially met with resistance from her own party, led to a compromise involving vote-pairing to accommodate absent members. The conflict highlighted the challenges of adapting congressional procedures to modern family needs and the evolving roles of women in Congress, prompting a broader discussion about accommodating working parents in the legislative process.</p>

This decision comes despite federal threats to cut billions in education funding if the state does not comply, reflecting a growing tension between state and federal policies.</p>

The US is a major exporter of albumin to China, and the tariffs are expected to increase costs for foreign exporters, potentially boosting domestic manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>
