          <p>A driver injured at least 30 people after deliberately plowing into a crowd outside The Vermont, a music venue in East Hollywood. The incident occurred after the individual was reportedly ejected from the club for being intoxicated and disruptive. Seven people are in critical condition, and in the chaotic aftermath, bystanders pulled the driver from the car, and an unknown assailant shot him. The driver is now in the hospital and will face charges, while the police are searching for the person who fired the weapon.</p>

          <p>English golfer John Parry made a spectacular shot, scoring the first hole-in-one of this year's Open Championship at Royal Portrush. The ace occurred on the 192-yard 13th hole during the third round, with Parry using an 8-iron. This marks the 31st hole-in-one recorded at The Open since 1981 and what Parry estimates is the tenth of his career, though he called it "definitely the best one." The achievement was a highlight of a strong round for Parry, who shot a four-under-par 67.</p>

          <p>A tourist boat named Wonder Seas, carrying 53 people, capsized in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay during a sudden and severe storm, resulting in at least 34 deaths. Most of the passengers were Vietnamese families from Hanoi, and at least eight of the deceased were children. Rescue efforts have been hampered by heavy rain but have so far saved 11 people, including a 10-year-old boy found in an air pocket. The Vietnamese government has offered condolences and promised a full investigation into the tragic accident.</p>

Deauville has issued a voluntary recall for more than 67,000 cases of its Power Stick brand roll-on antiperspirant deodorant, affecting products sold at major retailers like Walmart, Amazon, and Dollar Tree.

Instead of focusing on abstinence, they frame chastity as a "countercultural" way to reclaim personal dignity and build deeper connections.

          <p>The early phase of the earnings season, combined with moderating inflation data, has provided support for the market, though individual company results have been varied. Reports from financial giants like Wells Fargo and BlackRock initially caused stock dips but saw recoveries as investors looked past headline numbers to underlying strengths. Goldman Sachs delivered strong results, while Abbott Labs saw its stock fall after a disappointing outlook. This article suggests that despite some initial negative reactions, many companies are navigating the complex economic environment effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that unsealing the grand jury transcripts from the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases would fail to satisfy his critics. In a social media post, he wrote that even with full court approval, "nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics," suggesting the pressure campaign against him would persist. This statement followed a Department of Justice request, prompted by Trump himself, to unseal the documents. The move comes amid growing calls for transparency regarding the files connected to the notorious sex offender.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's neurotechnology company, Neuralink, was registered as a "small disadvantaged business" (SDB) in a federal filing with the Small Business Administration. This designation is typically for firms majority-owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and can provide preferential access to federal contracts. The filing was made shortly before a funding round valued the company at $9 billion. A Neuralink spokesperson later stated the box on the form was "erroneously checked" and has since been corrected, asserting the company has never sought or received federal benefits.</p>

The hydroelectric facility, expected to be the world's largest, has raised significant concerns in neighboring India and Bangladesh, as the river flows downstream to become their vital Brahmaputra River. Beijing first revealed plans for the dam in 2020 as part of its five-year plan to harness the hydropower potential of the region.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 100 days into President Trump's sweeping tariff policy, economists offer a mixed assessment of its impact. The tariffs have generated higher-than-expected tax revenue and prompted some companies to pledge new investments in U.S. manufacturing. However, critics caution that these investment promises are long-term and could be abandoned as policy fluctuates. They also warn that the levies, which have raised the effective tariff rate to its highest since 1910, are starting to increase consumer prices for some goods, risking inflation and an economic slowdown.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the significant legal and economic turmoil that could ensue if President Trump attempts to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Legally, removing a Fed chair requires "cause," a high bar that would likely trigger a protracted court battle and create unprecedented uncertainty. Economically, such a move could undermine the Fed's independence, spook financial markets, and potentially lead to higher inflation and interest rates if investors lose faith in the central bank's credibility. The situation raises questions about whether the attacks are a genuine prelude to removal or a political strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to bestselling author and NYU professor Scott Galloway, "follow your passion" is the worst career advice, often given by those who are already wealthy. Instead of blindly pursuing a passion, Galloway advises finding an intersection between what you are good at and what can be profitable. He emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and being willing to pivot. This sentiment is echoed by other leaders, like Mastercard's CEO, who suggest focusing on your unique strengths and finding where they align with market needs.</p>

          <p>Tanning is experiencing a resurgence, moving beyond a simple aesthetic choice to become an ideological statement for some. This article notes the trend's visibility among political figures and in alternative-health circles, where sun exposure is promoted and the risks of sunscreen are amplified. Figures nominated by the Trump administration, like potential surgeon general Casey Means, argue for the health benefits of sunlight, framing sun avoidance as a mistake promoted by the establishment. This new "sun worship" aligns with a broader skepticism of mainstream science, despite well-documented cancer risks.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration has announced it is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD) and cutting its workforce by nearly 23%, or over 3,700 employees. The ORD has historically provided the core scientific research for the agency's regulations. The administration claims the move will save nearly $750 million and allow science to be better integrated into program offices. Critics and union leaders argue the move will "devastate public health" by dismantling the agency's scientific foundation and firing thousands of expert scientists.</p>
