          <p>At the 2025 ESPY Awards, both model Brooks Nader and former Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn experienced wardrobe malfunctions on the red carpet. Nader's silk dress shifted, causing a brief exposure, which she handled with composure. Vonn’s dress was caught by a gust of wind, revealing more than intended before her sister assisted in managing the garment. Both celebrities are known for their bold fashion choices and have previously discussed navigating the risks of daring red carpet looks, with Nader citing her experience with Sports Illustrated as a major confidence booster.</p>

          <p>Netflix reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst expectations, with revenue increasing by 16% to $11.08 billion and earnings per share reaching $7.19. The company has raised its full-year revenue forecast, attributing the positive outlook to healthy membership growth, increased advertising sales, and favorable currency exchange rates. This marks the second quarter that Netflix has opted not to release specific subscriber data, instead focusing on metrics like revenue and operating margin, which improved to 34.1%. The company does caution that margins may be lower in the second half of the year due to higher content and marketing costs.</p>

          <p>Greek police have arrested five individuals, including his ex-wife, in connection with the murder of University of California, Berkeley professor Przemyslaw Jeziorski. The 43-year-old was fatally shot in Athens on July 4 while in the country for a custody and property dispute hearing regarding his 10-year-old twin children. According to the victim's brother, the ex-wife allegedly orchestrated the crime, and her boyfriend has confessed to being the shooter, with three others acting as accomplices. The professor's children are now in the care of Greek authorities as the five suspects await further court proceedings.</p>

          <p>Following public speculation over swollen ankles and bruised hands, the White House announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described the condition as benign and common for his age, stating that a comprehensive medical exam found no evidence of more serious illnesses like deep vein thrombosis. The bruising on his hands was attributed to frequent handshaking combined with his use of aspirin for cardiovascular prevention. An echocardiogram and blood tests were all within normal limits, with the White House maintaining that the president remains in excellent health.</p>

The leak, which occurred in February 2022 but was only discovered in August 2023, put many Afghans at risk of reprisal from the Taliban. Details were kept secret by a court injunction until recently. The government has since established a covert resettlement route for those affected, costing an estimated £850 million, and has apologized for the "serious departmental error."</p>

Attorneys for Taylor's family condemned the recommendation as an "insult," arguing it sends a message that officers can violate Black Americans' civil rights with impunity.

          <p>NBCUniversal is increasing the monthly price of its Peacock streaming service by $3 for most subscribers, effective July 23. The ad-supported Peacock Premium tier will rise to $10.99 per month, while the ad-free Premium Plus option will increase to $16.99. This move follows a trend among streaming companies raising fees to offset escalating programming costs and transition from legacy media business models. While Peacock has invested heavily in content like "Sunday Night Football" and the Olympics, it continues to lag behind competitors in subscriber numbers, and the price hike comes amid broader consumer concerns about inflation.</p>

The reform, part of a broader package to modernize democracy, would enfranchise approximately 1.6 million teenagers and is expected to pass in Parliament. While Scotland and Wales already allow 16-year-olds to vote in some local elections, this would apply nationally. Proponents argue that tax-paying 16-year-olds deserve a say, while critics question their maturity and suggest the move is politically motivated to favor liberal parties.</p>

These rulings align with the "unitary executive theory," which posits the president has broad control over the executive branch, including the authority to fire officials in independent agencies. Critics argue the court is enabling a "constitutional coup" without providing full legal explanations for its brief orders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is rescinding $4 billion in federal funding previously allocated to California's high-speed rail project, citing a lack of a viable path forward. The Department of Transportation pointed to missed deadlines, budget shortfalls, and the state's failure to secure an additional $7 billion needed for the initial segment. The project, intended to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles, has seen its estimated cost balloon from $33 billion to over $128 billion. California officials strongly disagree with the decision, but Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the project a "boondoggle" and expressed confidence in defeating any legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in New York and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, was abruptly fired by the Department of Justice. The dismissal is widely seen as politically motivated by President Trump's long-standing animosity towards her father, whom he also fired. Maurene Comey was a key prosecutor in high-profile cases, including those against Ghislaine Maxwell and Sean "Diddy" Combs. In an email to colleagues, she urged them not to let fear, which she called "the tool of a tyrant," influence their work, warning that firing a career prosecutor without cause could suppress independent thought.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a "major disaster" under the Stafford Act, which would allow communities to receive federal emergency funding. Currently, extreme heat is not explicitly listed, preventing states from accessing FEMA aid for heat-related crises, such as the deadly June heat dome that broke temperature records across the U.S. Proponents argue the funding is needed for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and adaptation projects. However, some, including a former FEMA administrator, argue that heat is already eligible and that existing hazard mitigation grants are the more appropriate funding mechanism.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has suspended veteran Member of Parliament Diane Abbott pending an investigation into her recent comments about racism. In a BBC interview, Abbott reiterated controversial views she had previously expressed, suggesting that racism experienced by Jewish and Traveller people is different from that experienced by Black people because it is not based on visible skin color. Abbott, who was previously suspended for similar remarks in 2023, now loses the party whip and will sit as an independent MP. The comments were criticized by party leadership, though some colleagues have defended her.</p>

          <p>An Iranian citizen and chiropractor, Mahdi Khanbabazadeh, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the parking lot of his child's preschool in Beaverton, Oregon. ICE stated that Khanbabazadeh, who had overstayed his visa, resisted arrest after being allowed to drop off his child. According to an immigration attorney, the man is married to a U.S. citizen and was in the process of applying for a green card. The incident, which took place at a "sensitive location," reflects a shift in policy under the Trump administration, which has been criticized for its widespread immigration enforcement actions.</p>

The advance sale reflects the immense anticipation for the film, an adaptation of Homer's epic starring Matt Damon and Charlize Theron, and the powerful box office draw of the premium Imax format.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has reportedly secured an agreement allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to access a national Medicaid database. The agreement, which officials defended as a tool to combat fraud, grants ICE access to personal information of millions of low-income Americans, including addresses and social security numbers, to locate individuals for immigration enforcement. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and privacy advocates, have condemned the move as a "weaponization of data" and a betrayal of trust, warning it could deter eligible people from seeking necessary medical care for fear of reprisal.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria, including attacks on government buildings in Damascus, reflect an escalation of Israel's military campaign in the country. While Israel officially stated the strikes were to protect the Druze minority during sectarian clashes, analysts suggest broader strategic goals are at play. These objectives may include carving out an informal buffer zone in southern Syria and ensuring the nation remains a weak state, unable to pose a threat. The timing of the attacks also coincides with domestic political pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, leading to speculation that the conflict is being used to deflect from issues at home.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police plans to close half of its station front counters to save money, reducing the number of 24/7 public-facing desks from 32 to just eight across the capital. This move breaks a previous pledge to maintain a 24/7 counter in every London borough, a commitment made to rebuild public trust. The Met stated that with a significant budget shortfall and shrinking force, keeping all counters open is no longer sustainable. They noted that only 5% of crimes are reported at front counters, but this still amounts to nearly 50,000 reports annually that will be displaced.</p>
