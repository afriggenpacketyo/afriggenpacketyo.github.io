        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has declared that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, with the announcement planned for the UN General Assembly. He stressed the immediate need for a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, and a massive increase in humanitarian aid. While Palestinian officials praised the decision as a commitment to international law and self-determination, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the move, arguing that it rewards terrorism following the October 7th attack. This positions France with over 140 other UN member states that already recognize Palestine.</p>

          <p>A 41-year-old employee at a Chuck E. Cheese in Tallahassee, Florida, was arrested while in his full mouse mascot costume for allegedly stealing a customer's debit card. The arrest occurred after the victim conducted her own investigation, obtaining security footage of the suspect using her card and identifying him as an employee. Police confronted the man during his shift, leading to a brief struggle before he was handcuffed and escorted out of the restaurant in front of patrons. The stolen debit card was reportedly found in his pocket, and he faces felony charges for its theft and fraudulent use.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a rare presidential visit to the Federal Reserve, President Donald Trump and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell engaged in a tense, public dispute over the costs of the central bank's building renovations. Trump claimed the project was significantly over budget, producing a document to support his assertion, which Powell promptly dismissed as inaccurate. The confrontation is the latest in Trump's ongoing campaign of pressure against Powell, whom he has criticized for not lowering interest rates more quickly. This personal clash highlights the political pressure being exerted on the traditionally independent institution.</p>

          <p>An Arizona woman, Christina Marie Chapman, has been sentenced to 102 months in federal prison for her role in a sophisticated fraud scheme that helped North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at hundreds of U.S. companies. Chapman used the stolen identities of 68 Americans to help the workers pose as U.S. citizens, generating over $17 million for herself and the North Korean government. She managed company-issued laptops from her home, forwarding them to associates, thereby allowing the regime to fund its programs by defrauding American businesses. The Department of Justice highlighted the case as an example of North Korea posing an internal threat.</p>

          <p>Erick Hernandez-Rodriguez, a DACA recipient, is facing expedited deportation after he says he made a wrong turn while working as a rideshare driver and accidentally crossed into Mexico from San Diego. Upon attempting to immediately re-enter the U.S., he was detained by border officials who claimed he had "self-deported." His attorney states he was in Mexico for less than 30 minutes and that officials are showing no leniency, despite his legal authorization to work in the U.S. The case underscores the precarious situation for DACA recipients under the current administration's stringent immigration policies.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major technology companies are not overspending on artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, and reduced investment implies a lack of belief in one's ability to win. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditures for AI infrastructure, Cramer suggests that these investments are both urgent and necessary to secure a potential market monopoly. He believes the company that develops the most accurate chatbot will dominate the field, similar to how Google won the search engine market. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks the character's first appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and foreshadows the plot of the upcoming film "Avengers: Doomsday," where Robert Downey Jr. is slated to portray the character.

          <p>This article explores the reasons why the full Jeffrey Epstein files were not released during the Biden administration, despite their potential political implications for Donald Trump. The primary obstacle is the legal secrecy of grand jury testimony, which constitutes a significant portion of the files and can only be unsealed by a judge under exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, the FBI rarely releases evidence unrelated to criminal charges to protect privacy and ongoing investigations. Even if the Biden administration had sought their release, it is not certain a court would have granted the request, a legal hurdle the Trump administration is now also facing.</p>

          <p>Federal regulators have approved the $8 billion merger of Skydance Media and Paramount Global, a deal surrounded by significant political maneuvering. The approval by the FCC, led by a Trump appointee, followed Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by President Trump against its subsidiary, CBS. Skydance also made commitments to eliminate DEI programs and install a news ombudsman to address bias complaints. The deal, bankrolled by Trump ally Larry Ellison, has been criticized by opponents, including the FCC's lone Democrat, as an erosion of press freedom resulting from political pressure.

          <p>Kristin Cabot, the chief people officer for the tech company Astronomer, has resigned from her position. Her departure follows the resignation of the company's CEO, Andy Byron, last week.

The incident gained widespread media attention and led the company to launch an internal investigation, which resulted in both individuals leaving the firm amidst the public fallout.</p>

The new menu will include items like a Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew and a Popping Tropic Refresher. This strategy shifts from operating standalone beverage stores to integrating a popular, curated drink platform directly into existing McDonald's locations to capitalize on growing customer demand.</p>

The photo, which resurfaced on social media in mid-July 2025, was taken in 1996 at the Mar-a-Lago estate during a concert, according to its caption on Getty Images. It is not digitally manipulated or AI-generated. The image has been shared for years, often by critics, alongside other photos of the pair, and its recent circulation follows renewed public interest in files related to Jeffrey Epstein, though the photo itself is unrelated to that case.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of charges of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. In her ruling, the judge stated that she did not find the complainant's testimony to be "credible or reliable," and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case. The players had been accused of assaulting the woman after a Hockey Canada gala. The defense argued the encounter was consensual, and the judge noted that video evidence, while not establishing legal consent, showed the woman did not appear to be in distress.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have successfully manufactured the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a key component for developing ultra-high-power laser weapons. This synthetic crystal, measuring 60 millimeters in diameter, is crucial for converting lasers into frequencies that can travel long distances through the atmosphere. More importantly, it can withstand immense power levels, potentially solving the long-standing issue of self-damage that has limited the effectiveness of laser systems. This breakthrough could enable the creation of ground-based lasers powerful enough to disable satellites in orbit, marking a significant advancement in military technology.</p>
