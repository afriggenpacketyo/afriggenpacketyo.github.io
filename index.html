          <p>Democratic-backed Susan Crawford secured a decisive win in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race, defeating Republican Brad Schimel.  The election, the most expensive judicial race in US history, was heavily influenced by millions in spending from Elon Musk supporting Schimel and became a proxy battleground for broader political issues. Crawford's victory maintains the court's liberal majority, setting the stage for key decisions on abortion access and redistricting.</p>
