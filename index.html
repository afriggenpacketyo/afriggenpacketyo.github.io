          <p>The Trump administration has revoked the U.S. visa for Colombian President Gustavo Petro, citing his "reckless and incendiary actions" in New York City. The State Department's announcement followed a speech where Petro allegedly encouraged U.S. soldiers to disobey orders during a protest against Israel. This action escalates existing tensions between the two leaders, which have previously included disputes over deportation flights and Petro's criticism of U.S. anti-drug operations. The move underscores a significantly strained diplomatic relationship between the United States and Colombia's first leftist president.</p>

          <p>South Korea is facing a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate, one of the lowest in the world, threatens to undermine decades of economic progress. Projections from the Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Institute warn that the nation's economy could enter a downturn and potentially contract by the 2040s due to a shrinking workforce. Despite the government spending over $270 billion on incentives to encourage childbirth, these measures have had little effect. While some experts remain hopeful that technological innovation can offset the decline, the demographic trend poses a significant long-term challenge to the nation's prosperity.

          <p>Startup founders are sharing their experiences of recovering from business failure, a common but challenging aspect of entrepreneurship. The article highlights the emotional and professional toll of shutting down a company, including disappointing investors, laying off employees, and facing a personal identity crisis. Founders who transition back to corporate life can face an "entrepreneurship penalty" from recruiters but often bring valuable, wide-ranging skills. Ultimately, many entrepreneurs find that reframing their definitions of success and failure, and focusing on a mission with a deep sense of purpose, is key to building resilience and moving forward.</p>

          <p>To boost its tourism sector, China has expanded its visa-free entry policies, providing several new options for foreign visitors to enter the country without extensive paperwork. The country now allows passport holders from 55 nations to stay for up to 10 days without a visa while transiting through major cities. Recently, Beijing also extended a 30-day visa-free stay for Russian citizens, adding to a growing list of nationalities that can benefit from relaxed entry requirements. These measures are part of a broader effort by the Chinese government to make travel more accessible and attract more international visitors.</p>

          <p>Public discourse in Hungary is becoming increasingly aggressive and polarized in the lead-up to the next parliamentary election, fueled by government-funded propaganda and hate speech. Recently, tens of thousands protested in Budapest against the acrimonious political climate, which has seen Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party target various groups and political opponents through state-controlled media. Media experts warn that Fidesz dominates the media landscape, exerting significant political and economic pressure on independent outlets.

          <p>The United Nations is set to reimpose comprehensive economic and military sanctions on Iran after the UK, France, and Germany triggered a dispute mechanism within the 2015 nuclear deal. The European powers accused Iran of failing to meet its commitments, as the country has increased its banned nuclear activities since the U.S. withdrew from the agreement in 2016. Despite last-minute efforts by China and Russia to delay the move, the sanctions, which include an arms embargo and a ban on uranium enrichment, will snap back into place. Iranian officials have condemned the action as illegal and warned it could jeopardize future cooperation with international nuclear inspectors.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada represents more than just a championship match; it's a clash between two vastly different funding models for the sport. England, the world's best-funded team with 32 full-time professional players, stands in stark contrast to Canada, whose players earn a fraction of their English counterparts and rely on fundraising to cover costs. Despite this financial gap, Canada has proven to be a formidable opponent, leveraging players' experience in England's top league. A Canadian victory could challenge the narrative that massive investment is the only path to success, potentially influencing how other nations approach funding for women's rugby.</p>

          <p>In his second term, President Trump is actively pursuing a campaign of "retribution" against his perceived political enemies, raising concerns about the expansion of presidential power and the erosion of democratic norms. This includes publicly urging his attorney general to prosecute political opponents like former FBI Director James Comey and suggesting the revocation of TV licenses for critical media outlets. Supporters justify these actions as a response to the investigations and perceived bias Trump faced during the Biden administration. However, critics argue these moves represent an unprecedented weaponization of government authority, pushing the U.S. toward authoritarianism.</p>

This move reveals deep tensions within public media, exacerbated by the Trump administration's successful effort to eliminate all federal funding for public broadcasting. NPR, which has managed the satellite distribution system for over four decades, alleges the CPB's decision to exclude it from the new contract is an unconstitutional submission to political pressure from the White House.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with its freeze on over $4 billion in foreign aid that had been approved by Congress. In a 6-3 decision, the conservative majority issued an emergency order stating that the potential harm to the president's conduct of foreign affairs outweighed the harm to aid recipients. The court's three liberal justices dissented, arguing the decision undermines Congress's constitutional "power of the purse" and conflicts with the separation of powers. This ruling allows the administration to continue its policy of significantly downsizing U.S. foreign aid operations while the case proceeds in lower courts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giants Huawei and AI startup DeepSeek are spearheading China's efforts to develop a world-class artificial intelligence industry independent of U.S. technology. In response to U.S. trade restrictions, Huawei has unveiled its latest Ascend series chips and a hardware road map designed to compete with Nvidia's processors. Simultaneously, DeepSeek, which has developed powerful AI models, is shifting to support these domestically produced chips. This trend, encouraged by Beijing, signals a growing confidence in China's home-grown tech capabilities and represents a significant step in the nation's drive for technological self-reliance amid the ongoing tech rivalry with Washington.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed the election technology company Smartmatic by repeatedly making false statements that its machines rigged the 2020 presidential election. The judge identified 51 specific instances where Lindell falsely claimed Smartmatic interfered with results in Los Angeles County. While the ruling establishes the statements were defamatory, the court deferred a decision on whether Lindell acted with "actual malice," which Smartmatic must prove to be awarded damages. Lindell, a prominent ally of President Trump, has vowed to continue his fight against voting machine companies.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is facing criticism for his strategic decisions after Europe took a commanding 5 ½ to 2 ½ lead on the opening day of the tournament. Questions were raised about his choice to reunite Collin Morikawa and Harris English for the Saturday foursomes, despite their heavy defeat to the same European pair, Rory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood, on Friday. Bradley defended his choices, stating the team will not panic and will stick to its original plan, emphasizing that the players were eager for a chance at redemption. The U.S. team struggled on the greens, adding to the pressure they face on day two.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has warned consumers about certain ready-to-eat pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's that may be contaminated with listeria. The alert covers Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs and Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo. This contamination is potentially linked to the same listeria strain from an earlier deadly outbreak tied to pre-made chicken alfredo meals that killed four people. While no new illnesses have been reported, consumers are urged to discard the products, which were distributed by FreshRealm and may still be in refrigerators.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen has suffered a significant blow with the news that relief pitcher Brock Stewart will miss the rest of the season due to a shoulder injury requiring surgery. Stewart was the team's only major acquisition at the trade deadline aimed at strengthening their struggling relief corps. His absence creates uncertainty in the team's right-handed pitching hierarchy as they head into the postseason. While the team hopes the debridement procedure will allow him to return for most of next season, his loss adds to the injury concerns the Dodgers are managing as they prepare for their playoff run.</p>

          <p>The 79-year-old owner of a Van Nuys car wash has filed a $50 million claim against the Department of Homeland Security, alleging that federal immigration agents used excessive force during a raid on his business. Rafie Ollah Shouhed, a U.S. citizen, claims he was body-slammed by an agent while trying to inform them that his employees were authorized to work. Surveillance footage appears to show the violent takedown, which his attorney says left Shouhed with multiple injuries, including busted ribs. The claim accuses agents of violating his civil rights and showing indifference to his serious medical condition after the incident.</p>
