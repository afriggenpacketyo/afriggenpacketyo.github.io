          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 10:22:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Block's stock experienced a significant drop after a disappointing quarterly report revealed concerns about Cash App's stagnant user growth and reduced consumer spending. Several analysts downgraded the stock, citing worries about the app's network density and the impact of a soft macro environment on monetization. CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledged the company's lack of focus on network growth and emphasized the need to deepen customer engagement through banking services. Despite efforts to position Cash App as a full-fledged banking alternative, monthly active users remained flat, and inflows saw only a modest increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is carefully assessing the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on economic growth and inflation. A strong labor market has allowed the Fed to maintain stable interest rates, but the uncertainty caused by tariffs is raising concerns among businesses and consumers. Officials are debating whether the expected rise in consumer prices will be temporary or lead to sustained inflation, and they are prepared to act if their goals for a healthy labor market and stable prices come into conflict. The latest jobs report offered some reassurance, but traders have reduced their expectations for interest rate cuts this year.</p>

          <p>Hugh Dugan, a former National Security Council official, has criticized the United Nations' UN80 Task Force's proposed reforms as inadequate and overdue. Dugan argues that the UN suffers from inefficiencies, overlapping mandates, and inconsistent service delivery, and he suggests that Secretary-General Guterres should step down to allow for a more comprehensive overhaul. The task force's document outlines potential improvements, such as reducing high-level posts and consolidating various UN entities, but Dugan believes it lacks concrete measures for improving human resources and performance metrics. A spokesperson for Guterres defended the reform efforts as part of an ongoing initiative to strengthen the UN's effectiveness and transparency.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has lost his legal challenge to reinstate his automatic right to state-funded police protection when visiting the United Kingdom. A judge ruled that the government's decision to assess his security needs on a case-by-case basis was reasonable. Harry's lawyers argued that he faces significant security risks, but the court found that his sense of grievance did not justify overturning the government's decision. The ruling means Harry will continue to receive police protection only when deemed necessary by the relevant authorities.</p>

          <p>Chevron plans to reduce the pace of its share buybacks due to declining crude oil prices, which have impacted the company's first-quarter profit. U.S. crude prices have fallen due to concerns that President Trump's tariffs will reduce demand, while OPEC+ plans to increase supply. Despite the slowdown in buybacks, Chevron is maintaining its overall guidance for shareholder returns.

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in recent local elections, securing control of several councils and winning a key by-election.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has renewed his call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates after a better-than-expected jobs report for April. He asserted that there is no inflation and that the Fed should ease monetary policy to stimulate growth. This continues his pattern of attempting to influence the central bank's decision-making, despite its independence. While Trump has softened his criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he maintains that he knows more about interest rates than Powell does. The president's remarks contrast with his earlier blaming of former President Biden for a recent economic contraction.</p>
