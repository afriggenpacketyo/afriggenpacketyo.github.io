          <p>Tesla has applied to operate its robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, aiming to compete directly with Alphabet's Waymo, which has been established there since 2020. The move follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, that has faced some operational issues and regulatory scrutiny. Tesla also intends to expand its service to the San Francisco Bay Area, although it has not yet filed for the necessary state approvals. The company's approach relies heavily on cameras rather than more expensive lidar sensors used by rivals.</p>

          <p>Julia Hahn, a senior official at the Treasury Department, is leaving the Trump administration to enter the private sector, reportedly to start her own public affairs firm. Hahn, who began her White House career under Stephen Bannon, has recently been involved in trade, sanctions, and tax cut matters. Colleagues, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, praised her contributions and passion. Her departure comes at a time of intensifying trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Tensions flared in Southern California as federal agents clashed with protesters during an immigration raid at a farm in Ventura County, resulting in at least one detention. The incident is part of a broader increase in immigration enforcement operations in the region, including another raid in Carpinteria and a recent large-scale operation in Los Angeles' MacArthur Park. These actions follow President Trump's directive for a mass deportation program, which has drawn criticism from local officials like LA Mayor Karen Bass for provoking fear.</p>

The study, published in Nature Geoscience, highlights the urgent need for faster adaptation strategies, especially as the most extreme heat events are changing most rapidly.</p>

          <p>A senior ICE official testified in federal court that the agency has not yet determined a destination for Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he is released from detention. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year and returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges. His case highlights significant legal and logistical challenges, as a judge expressed frustration over the government's lack of a clear plan and the risk he could be "spirited away again" without due process.</p>

          <p>The premier of Manitoba, Wab Kinew, has accused a group of U.S. lawmakers of "trivializing" Canada's severe wildfire situation after they sent a letter complaining that smoke was disrupting American summer activities. Kinew made the comments as his province declared a state of emergency for the second time this summer, with over 100 active fires forcing community evacuations. He contrasted the lawmakers' complaints with the actions of American firefighters who are on the ground in Manitoba assisting with the crisis, calling the letter a political stunt.</p>

          <p>Many of President Trump's supporters are expressing feelings of betrayal after the FBI announced it found no "client list" in its Jeffrey Epstein files and would not be releasing more documents. This contradicts long-held beliefs in online MAGA circles that Trump's return to power would unmask a secret cabal of elites involved with Epstein. The reversal has caused a splintering among his base, with some now directing their anger at administration officials and creating new conspiracy theories to explain the perceived cover-up.</p>

          <p>Data from the CDC shows that emergency room visits for tick bites in the U.S. have surged to their highest levels since 2019, with the Northeast experiencing a particularly sharp increase. Experts attribute the spike to record-high tick populations and a longer active season for the insects, both of which are driven by warming temperatures from climate change. Health officials are urging the public to be vigilant about prevention, as ticks can transmit numerous serious illnesses, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, and Powassan virus disease.</p>

          <p>Kerr County, Texas, the epicenter of the recent catastrophic flooding that killed at least 96 people, was ironically scheduled to begin developing a centralized flood monitoring system in mid-July. After years of unsuccessful efforts, the local river authority had finally approved funding and hired a contractor to create a dashboard to help emergency managers better respond to flood risks. The tragic timing highlights the region's long-standing vulnerability and the absence of a robust public alert network in an area notoriously known as "flash flood alley."</p>

The rapid nuclear buildups in neighboring China and North Korea are causing a shift in public and political opinion within Japan. There is growing concern that a "dangerous proliferation cascade" could begin in the region, potentially starting with South Korea acquiring nuclear weapons, which would likely compel Japan to follow suit, undermining decades of nonproliferation efforts.</p>
