          <p>Senator Chuck Grassley has released an April 2022 Justice Department memo, co-signed by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland, then-Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, and then-FBI Director Christopher Wray. The document authorized an FBI investigation into alleged efforts by Trump campaign associates to obstruct the certification of the 2020 election, specifically regarding "fake electors." Grassley asserts this memo demonstrates "unchecked government power" used at the highest levels against Trump's associates, vowing to continue his oversight of the matter. The investigation, referred to as "Arctic Frost," later became a focus of Special Counsel Jack Smith's probe, which included subpoenas for phone records of Republican senators.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. states, including Texas, California, Missouri, North Carolina, and Utah, are undertaking mid-decade redistricting efforts that could significantly impact upcoming congressional elections. Initiated by a call from President Trump for Texas Republicans to create more GOP-friendly seats, this push has led to partisan redrawing of maps. While Republicans aim to expand their slim majority, Democrats in states like California are also attempting to counter these moves. Legal challenges are underway in multiple states, with civil rights groups alleging racial bias in the new maps, highlighting the contentious nature of these rare, off-census-year redistricting battles.</p>

President Trump will travel to Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, with the meeting with Xi Jinping set for next Thursday after the APEC CEO Summit. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices climbed, while South Korea's Kospi also saw a significant jump. This positive market reaction reflects investor optimism surrounding potential diplomatic progress between the two economic powers, despite ongoing currency volatility in some regions like South Korea.</p>

          <p>All Alaska Airlines flights across the United States were temporarily grounded Thursday evening due to a widespread IT outage affecting operations. The airline, which also operates Hawaiian Airlines and Horizon Air, issued a ground stop, though the specific cause and expected duration of the technical issue remain unclear. This incident highlights ongoing stresses in U.S. air travel, which has recently experienced delays due to air traffic controller shortages exacerbated by a government shutdown. The airline serves 140 destinations globally, with a primary focus on the West Coast, and is working to resolve the disruption.</p>

          <p>A semi-truck driver, Jashanpreet Singh, 21, was arrested for driving under the influence following a deadly eight-vehicle collision on the 10 Freeway in Ontario, California, that killed three people.

Despite his undocumented status, California transportation officials state he received federal Employment Authorization Documents, allowing him to obtain a federal REAL ID and a commercial driver's license. This incident follows a similar deadly crash in Florida involving another undocumented driver with a California CDL, prompting a lawsuit against California and Washington for alleged failures in license issuance.</p>

Autumn, who was bullied at school and online, was found to have been on her phone just before her death. New research from Virginia Tech links nighttime screen use and easy access to over-the-counter medicines to teen suicide attempts, with many incidents occurring after 8 p.m. and involving screen use immediately prior. Experts recommend keeping phones out of bedrooms and reducing access to medications to mitigate risks.</p>

          <p>China's long-term energy strategy, driven by political stability, is rapidly accelerating its green energy transition, contrasting with some Western nations' pivot back to fossil fuels. The article highlights China's impressive infrastructure, such as ultra-high-voltage power lines transferring clean energy from remote regions to populous areas. Since 2021, China has increased renewable energy's share in its total installed power generation capacity from 40% to about 60%, aligning with its commitment to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This consistent, strategic approach positions China as a global leader in clean energy adoption.</p>

This case has intensified calls for stricter regulations on convicted fraudsters and the building industry, with fears that the current system is failing victims.

          <p>President Donald Trump has pardoned Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of Binance, who previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering at the cryptocurrency exchange. The pardon follows reports of a partnership between the Trump family's crypto venture and a Binance-administered trading platform, raising conflict-of-interest concerns. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the pardon, calling Zhao's prosecution by the Biden administration a "war on cryptocurrency." Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the move as "corruption," noting Zhao's guilty plea and subsequent lobbying efforts. Trump stated he pardoned Zhao at the request of "very good people" who believed he was innocent.</p>

          <p>Walt Disney Co. is alerting viewers that its channels, including ABC, ESPN, and FX, could go dark on YouTube TV due to ongoing contract negotiations. The dispute centers on Disney's proposed economic terms, which YouTube TV claims would raise prices for its approximately 10 million subscribers and benefit Disney's own live TV products. This marks the latest in a series of content disputes involving YouTube TV, following similar complaints from Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal. If an agreement is not reached by October 30, customers risk losing access to popular sports and entertainment programming during peak viewing seasons.</p>

Hamilton, drawing from his intense 2021 battle with Verstappen, stressed the high pressure involved and the need for consistency. Both McLaren drivers acknowledge Verstappen's improved form but remain focused on their own performances, aiming to leverage their car's strength to secure the championship.

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed Justice Department superiors that there is insufficient evidence to criminally charge Senator Adam Schiff of California with mortgage fraud.

Hayes, an experienced federal prosecutor, conveyed her assessment to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, though sources indicate a senior Justice Department official is pressing to keep the investigation active. Schiff's lawyer stated that career prosecutors found the politically motivated allegations baseless, urging an end to the matter.</p>

          <p>A five-week shutdown of Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) factories following a cyber attack led to a 27% slump in UK car production in September, the lowest figure for that month since 1952. JLR's global manufacturing operations, including its three UK plants, were halted, with no vehicles produced by the company last month. The cyber attack is estimated to be the most economically damaging in UK history, costing £1.9 billion and affecting 5,000 businesses. While JLR production is gradually resuming, the incident highlights the vulnerability of industries to cyber threats and puts the government's ambition to boost domestic car production in doubt.</p>
