          <p>A study reveals the genetic adaptations that enable the Haenyeo, all-female free divers of Jeju Island, to withstand extreme diving conditions.  The research compared Haenyeo to non-diving women on the island and women from elsewhere, finding genetic variations related to cold tolerance and blood pressure regulation.  The article highlights the potential implications of these findings for understanding human physiological adaptation and developing therapies for conditions like stroke.</p>
