          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple, alleging antitrust violations concerning the App Store. He claims Apple is unfairly preventing his AI chatbot, Grok, from reaching the top ranking, favoring its partner OpenAI's ChatGPT. Musk highlighted that Grok is the fifth top free app while questioning why it and X are not in Apple's "Must-Have" section. This legal threat adds to Apple's existing antitrust challenges, including a major lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its iPhone ecosystem monopoly.</p>

          <h2>Western Australian Reefs Suffer Most Severe Coral Bleaching Event on Record</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along the coast of Western Australia have experienced their worst bleaching event ever recorded, spanning a 1,500km area. The damage was caused by the state's "longest, largest and most intense" marine heatwave, which subjected the reefs to prolonged heat stress. This event is part of a two-year global coral bleaching crisis driven by record-high ocean temperatures. Areas previously considered resilient, such as the Rowley Shoals and Ningaloo reef, have been severely impacted for the first time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, delaying the implementation of significantly higher tariffs that were set to take effect. The agreement keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports at 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods at 10%, providing more time for negotiations. The White House stated the extension aims to address trade imbalances and unfair practices, while China called for the U.S. to lift "unreasonable" restrictions. Despite the truce, trade flows between the two nations have already seen a significant decline this year. (not investment advice)</p>

Ohtani was brought in to endorse the project and was slated to be its first resident. The plaintiffs claim Balelo became a "disruptive force," ultimately demanding their termination from the deal, and are suing for tortious interference and unjust enrichment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination follows the president's firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a jobs report showed slower-than-expected hiring. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and data quality, and his appointment is seen by the administration as a way to ensure the agency's data is "HONEST and ACCURATE."

The meltwater unexpectedly burst upwards through a 300-foot-thick ice sheet, a phenomenon never before observed. This discovery challenges existing models of how meltwater moves under ice sheets, which assumed it only flowed outwards to the sea. The finding highlights gaps in understanding Greenland's complex hydrological system and the unpredictable ways its rapidly melting ice sheet may respond to a warming planet.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's military has announced that a joint air and ground operation in the northwestern state of Zamfara resulted in the deaths of more than 100 armed gang members. The operation was launched after intelligence indicated that a large group of so-called "bandits" was preparing to attack a village. These armed groups have been responsible for widespread terror, including kidnappings for ransom and attacks on communities across the region. According to the Nigerian Air Force, the preemptive strike successfully killed several notorious leaders and their foot soldiers.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Federal Takeover of D.C. Police Criticized as an Authoritarian Move</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to federalize the Washington, D.C. police force and deploy the National Guard is being analyzed as a significant assertion of executive power. Critics argue the move is based on misleading crime statistics, as recent data shows a notable decrease in violent crime, contrary to the administration's narrative of a city in chaos. The action is seen by some as a political stunt intended to project an image of strength, setting a precedent for federal intervention in other cities. This has sparked a debate about authoritarianism and the use of military forces for domestic policing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, allowing them to sell certain advanced chips to China. In exchange, the companies will give 15% of their revenue from these sales directly to the U.S. Treasury. This arrangement follows previous government efforts to restrict such exports due to national security concerns. Some analysts view the deal as a novel form of tariff, effectively allowing the government to profit from the trade it regulates, while others see it as a pragmatic solution to a complex trade issue.

          <p>Colorado is battling two large wildfires, with more than 1,000 firefighters deployed to combat the blazes amid dry, windy conditions. The Lee fire has become the fifth-largest single fire in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres with minimal containment due to extreme drought and volatile fuels. Another major blaze, the Elk fire, is also active in the region. The challenging conditions have prompted disaster emergency declarations and evacuations in several mountain communities, contributing to an already explosive fire season across North America.</p>

          <p>President Trump's justification for federalizing the D.C. police force is based on claims of rampant crime that are contradicted by recent official data. While the president cited 2023 statistics showing a spike in homicides, violent crime in Washington D.C. has fallen significantly in 2024 and is now at a 30-year low. This narrative mirrors a previous instance where the administration portrayed Los Angeles as being overrun by violent mobs to justify deploying the National Guard. Critics argue the president is using a false narrative to justify federal intervention in cities with Democratic leadership.</p>

          <p>Employees at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned that the organization is at risk of collapse. In a whistleblowing complaint, staff raised concerns about a government threat to withdraw funding unless the institute pivots its focus to defense research. The complaint accuses the leadership of misusing public funds and fostering a "toxic internal culture." Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has been clear that he wants the institute to provide "real value for money," signaling a major overhaul in its mission and leadership.</p>

          <p>The three-year mystery of a missing cyclist in Scotland was solved after the killer's new girlfriend led police to his body. Alexander McKellar confessed to his girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he had fatally struck cyclist Tony Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried his body. When McKellar showed her the remote burial site, Muirhead secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker and later contacted police. This crucial act allowed investigators to recover Parsons' remains, leading to the conviction of McKellar and his twin brother.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed he will hold a bilateral summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, explicitly ruling out a trilateral meeting that would include Ukraine's President Zelenskyy. Trump characterized the meeting as a low-stakes opportunity to "feel out" the potential for a deal to end the war, reiterating his belief that a land-swapping agreement is possible. The exclusion of Ukraine from the direct talks has drawn attention, positioning the summit as a direct power play between the U.S. and Russian leaders to shape the future of the conflict.</p>
