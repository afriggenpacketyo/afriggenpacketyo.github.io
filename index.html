          <p>Israel launched a series of strikes across Iran, targeting what it described as the "heart" of Iran's nuclear program, resulting in the deaths of senior military figures, nuclear scientists, and civilians, according to Iranian state media. The Israeli military stated it struck dozens of military targets, including nuclear sites, while Iran responded by launching over 100 drones toward Israel, which were reportedly intercepted. International reactions have been varied, with some countries condemning the strikes and others urging de-escalation, while the IAEA confirmed that the Natanz nuclear facility was hit but reported no increase in radiation levels. The strikes have heightened tensions in the region and raised concerns about a potential wider conflict. </p>

However, India currently lacks advanced separation and refining technology, specialized technical expertise, and adequate infrastructure in mining regions, requiring significant public and private investment to realize its potential. </p>

          <h2>Canadian Border Bill Draws Criticism for MAGA-Inspired Policies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The newly elected Mark Carney government in Canada is facing criticism for tabling a border bill that critics say aligns with MAGA-inspired policies from the United States. Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act, grants law enforcement sweeping powers to obtain citizen's data and aligns Canada's refugee policies with those of the US, raising concerns about privacy and immigrant rights. Critics argue the bill infringes on due process and could disproportionately affect vulnerable groups. The legislation is seen as a step towards a surveillance state, allowing police to access subscriber information without a warrant under broad circumstances. </p>

          <p>Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated that Japan "strongly condemns" Israel's attack on nuclear and military sites in Iran, viewing it as an "escalating situation." He expressed regret that Israel took military action despite ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran, urging both countries to exercise "utmost restraint." Japan, heavily reliant on Middle Eastern crude oil, traditionally maintains friendly relations with both Iran and Israel. The government is taking measures to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals in the region. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel has launched attacks on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and assassinating key personnel, claiming that Iran was in a late-stage rush to assemble a nuclear weapon. The decision to attack now stems from a perceived shift in Iran's calculus, as its deterrent power weakened due to repeated Israeli attacks. With a diminished Axis of Resistance, Iran's ability to bargain or threaten has decreased, making it more likely to pursue nuclear statehood. The attacks carry risks of retaliation, but Israel may have deemed them less significant with Iran at its weakest. </p>
