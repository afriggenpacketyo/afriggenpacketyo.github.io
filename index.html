Contempt, often expressed through tone, is a significant predictor of divorce. Arguments about family often reflect unmet needs, while those about chores stem from an uneven distribution of labor. Ineffective communication can escalate conflicts, and the psychologist recommends strategies like naming the effect, reassuring one another, and using a designated time-out phrase to navigate these common issues.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is reminding travelers that a Costco membership card is not an acceptable form of identification at airport security checkpoints. This clarification comes as travelers prepare for summer travel, and the TSA aims to ensure that passengers are aware of valid identification requirements. The agency humorously stated, “Can’t fly on hot dogs and hope,” emphasizing the need for official identification documents such as a driver's license or passport.</p>

Curfews and screen time limits are already available through parental controls on Apple and Google devices, but adoption rates remain low.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles is analyzed as a deliberate attempt to provoke conflict and undermine democratic norms. The author argues that Trump is seeking to create a scenario where he can justify the use of armed force against American citizens. By federalizing the National Guard, Trump aims to set neighbor against neighbor and undermine the authority of local leaders. The author urges restraint and advises against engaging in violent protests, as it would provide Trump with the pretext he desires.</p>
