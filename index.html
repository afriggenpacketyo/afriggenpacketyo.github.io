          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump shared ten key takeaways in an exclusive interview with Sean Hannity. Trump emphasized that no final deal was reached to end the war in Ukraine, stating, "there’s no deal until there’s a deal," but noted that significant progress had been made. He suggested the next steps are up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European nations, and expressed his willingness to participate in a trilateral meeting to finalize an agreement. Trump rated the meeting a "10" for rapport and claimed that Russia now respects the United States more than it did under the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has intensified into a Category 2 storm over the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the first hurricane of the 2025 season. Forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict it will strengthen further into a major hurricane over the weekend, potentially reaching Category 4 strength early next week. While not currently projected to impact the United States mainland, the storm is expected to pass just north of the Caribbean islands, including the Leewards, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Residents in these areas are urged to monitor the storm's progress, as it could bring heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a proposal to give their party a potential five-seat advantage in the U.S. House by redrawing the state's congressional district lines. The plan, a direct response to a similar Republican effort in Texas, would require a state constitutional amendment approved by voters in a special election. It aims to make five of the state's nine GOP-held districts more favorable to Democrats by reshaping boundaries to increase the party's voter registration advantage. The move sets up a high-stakes battle over gerrymandering, with supporters framing it as a necessary defense against Republican tactics and opponents calling it a partisan power grab.</p>

          <p>The personal data of up to 3,700 Afghans who were relocated to the United Kingdom has been potentially compromised following a cyber-security incident at a Ministry of Defence sub-contractor. The breach occurred at Inflite The Jet Centre, a ground-handling service at London Stansted airport, and may have exposed names, passport details, and information related to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap). This incident follows a separate major data breach in 2022 that affected nearly 19,000 Afghan applicants. The government stated there is no evidence the data has been released publicly and that the breach posed no threat to individuals' safety.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin concluded in Alaska with no tangible agreement to end the war in Ukraine, leaving allies and observers questioning its purpose. Despite a stage-managed welcome, Trump offered few details about the discussions and took no questions, conceding that "there’s no deal until there’s a deal." Analysts noted that Putin appeared to gain a symbolic victory by securing a high-profile meeting on U.S. soil without making any clear concessions on his core demands regarding Ukrainian territory. The meeting's ambiguity leaves Ukraine and European nations uncertain about the future of the conflict and U.S. diplomatic strategy.</p>

Following a lawsuit filed by the city, the deal ensures that Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, rather than being replaced by the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. The agreement came after a U.S. district judge signaled she would likely grant the city's request for a temporary restraining order against the full takeover. However, the revised directive still allows the administration to use MPD officers for federal purposes, including assisting with federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections reveals that Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," spent six months meticulously planning his escape from a state prison. Hardin stated that lax security in the prison kitchen, where he worked, allowed him to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform using markers and a can lid for a badge. The report details how he walked out of a gate after a tower guard unlocked it without verifying his identity, highlighting significant procedural failures. Two employees have been fired, and Hardin, who was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault, has since been recaptured.</p>

          <p>The summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a ceasefire or any tangible agreements, leaving analysts to interpret the vague pronouncements from both leaders. From the U.S. perspective, Trump's failure to secure a deal on his self-proclaimed peacemaking mission may be viewed as a setback, despite his claims of "great progress." For Russia, the meeting itself was a geopolitical victory, granting Putin a prestigious platform alongside a U.S. president on American soil without requiring him to concede on his war aims in Ukraine. The lack of clear next steps or consequences, such as threatened sanctions, leaves the future of the conflict as uncertain as before the talks began.</p>

ADUs, often called granny flats or in-law units, are seen as a key strategy to address California's housing crisis by increasing density in existing neighborhoods. Officials hope this new model of for-sale ADUs will serve as a template for other cities and provide a new type of starter home for residents.</p>

The plaintiff alleges this practice violates federal and state privacy and wiretap laws.

Putin spoke first, emphasizing the historical ties between the U.S. and Russia through Alaska and stating his interest in ending the "tragedy" in Ukraine, provided Russia's security concerns are met. Trump followed with shorter remarks, describing the meeting as "very productive" but confirming no final deal was reached, with "a couple of big ones" still unresolved.

          <p>A new report from the Pacific Institute suggests that dust from the exposed shoreline of the Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects at the shrinking lake have been the primary focus of efforts to combat high rates of asthma and respiratory illness in the region. The study indicates that other sources, such as agricultural chemicals, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads, are larger contributors. Researchers now suggest that policy should pivot from source control to exposure control, such as improving indoor air filtration in homes and schools to better protect public health.</p>

The research found that consuming mangoes in controlled portions, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like white bread, could actually improve blood sugar levels and other metabolic health markers. One study showed that three popular Indian mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response than white bread. Another eight-week trial revealed improvements in fasting glucose and insulin resistance among type 2 diabetics who replaced their breakfast bread with 250g of mango.

          <p>The iconic fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback, with confirmed plans to reopen standalone stores on the UK High Street and host its first catwalk show in seven years. The brand, which was a cultural touchstone for a generation of shoppers in the 2000s, collapsed in 2020 when its parent company, Arcadia, went into administration. After being purchased by online retailer Asos, the brand is now banking on a wave of nostalgia and its signature "London girl" aesthetic to attract both its former core audience and a new generation of shoppers. Industry experts note the brand will face challenges in a competitive market, particularly regarding its price point.</p>

          <p>Liverpool began their Premier League title defense with a dramatic 4-2 victory against Bournemouth at Anfield, a match filled with emotional tributes and on-field drama. New £70 million signing Hugo Ekitike made an immediate impact, scoring one goal and assisting another, quickly winning over the home crowd. However, the win also highlighted Liverpool's defensive vulnerabilities, as Bournemouth twice exposed gaps to level the score, with Antoine Semenyo scoring a notable equalizer. Late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah ultimately secured the three points for the reigning champions in a chaotic but thrilling start to the season.</p>

          <p>The global bubble tea market, driven by rapidly expanding Chinese chains, is projected to grow into a multi-billion dollar industry, with several companies recently launching successful IPOs in Hong Kong. Chains like Mixue Group, which now has more outlets than McDonald's, are leveraging a franchise-heavy, low-cost model to fuel aggressive growth both domestically and internationally. However, the industry faces significant challenges, including market saturation, intense price wars, and the difficulty of maintaining quality control across thousands of franchised stores. The long-term success of these brands will depend on their ability to prove they are a sustainable business model rather than a passing fad. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, have unveiled a proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps in a strategic move to counter similar efforts by Republicans in states like Texas. The plan, which would require voter approval via a special election in November, could potentially shift five Republican-held seats to Democrats, significantly impacting the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives. This would override the state's independent redistricting commission, a system voters approved in 2010 to prevent partisan gerrymandering. The proposal targets several GOP incumbents by reconfiguring their districts to include more Democratic-leaning voters.</p>

          <p>The opening Premier League match between Liverpool and Bournemouth was temporarily halted after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator in the crowd. The referee, Anthony Taylor, stopped play for four minutes in the first half to address the situation with both managers and team captains. Despite the incident, Semenyo went on to score two goals in the second half. After the match, which Liverpool won 4-2, Semenyo posted about receiving further racist abuse online, and the incident was widely condemned by both clubs and the Football Association.

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression was censored after drawing complaints from the Chinese government. The show, "Constellation of Complicity," featured works by exiled artists from China, Russia, and Iran, including pieces related to Tibet, Hong Kong, and the Uyghur people. According to the curator, Chinese embassy officials demanded the show be shut down, leading to a compromise where sensitive artworks and descriptions were removed or covered up. The Burmese curator and his wife have since fled Thailand for the UK, fearing for their safety. The incident has been condemned by human rights advocates as an example of China's transnational repression.</p>

The base model of the Slate Truck is a compact, two-seat vehicle with a minimalist design, which the company says will keep manufacturing costs low and allow for a much lower sticker price than the current EV average. The company plans to offer over 100 accessories and an "open source" model for third-party add-ons, allowing owners to customize their vehicle. However, with the rollback of federal EV tax credits, the truck's price point may be less competitive against existing budget-friendly vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

After confirming the offer was legitimate, McCreadie flew to New York to record music for the film, which features his track "Stony Gate."
