          <p>Hamas has announced it will release US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander as a goodwill gesture in efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. Alexander, a 21-year-old soldier, is the last known living hostage with US nationality being held in the territory. The release is intended to facilitate negotiations on further hostages, though Israel insists negotiations will continue amid ongoing military operations. This development comes as President Trump is scheduled to visit the Middle East, with hopes that Alexander's release will mark the beginning of a comprehensive agreement to free all remaining hostages.</p>
