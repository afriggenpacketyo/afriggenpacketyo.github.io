          <p>The article details the substantial challenge of paying off a $40,000 credit card balance, particularly with current high interest rates. It outlines various repayment scenarios, showing that minimum payments could take over 40 years, while more aggressive monthly contributions can clear the debt in under three years. The text also explores alternative relief strategies such as debt settlement, consolidation loans, balance transfers, and, as a last resort, bankruptcy. It emphasizes that proactive planning is crucial to avoid decades of interest payments and financial burden. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Airlines has significantly reduced its 2025 profit outlook and provided a third-quarter forecast that did not meet analyst expectations, causing its shares to drop. CEO Robert Isom attributed the downturn to weaker domestic consumer demand, stagnant corporate travel, and operational issues from storms. While international travel remains a strong point, the airline is scaling back its capacity growth in response to the challenging domestic market. The revised forecast follows similar adjustments by competitors like Delta and United, signaling broader industry pressures.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has addressed reports that at least $1 billion worth of its AI chips were illegally smuggled into China, circumventing U.S. export restrictions. The company stated that data centers built with such unauthorized products represent a "losing proposition" both technically and economically, as they do not receive official service or support. This situation highlights the intense demand for advanced U.S. technology in China amid geopolitical competition over AI leadership. The U.S. government has restricted these sales due to national security concerns, though Nvidia recently received approval to resume some sales.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reversed its decision to phase out paper checks for beneficiaries, following concerns raised by lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren. The agency will now continue issuing paper checks to recipients who lack other means of payment, while still promoting the benefits of electronic deposits. The initial plan, aimed at saving costs and increasing security, faced criticism for potentially harming vulnerable populations, including the elderly and unbanked individuals. The SSA also committed to an independent audit to assess and improve its customer service performance.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a new anti-corruption bill after a previous version sparked widespread protests and criticism from the European Union. The initial legislation was seen as undermining the independence of anti-corruption bodies, a move that critics feared was a step back for the country's rule of law. The reversal comes as Ukraine continues to pursue EU membership, a goal for which tackling corruption is a critical requirement. The new bill aims to reaffirm Ukraine's commitment to strengthening its legal framework and maintaining trust with international partners.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has formed a "strike force" to investigate allegations that the Obama administration manipulated intelligence to suggest Russian interference in the 2016 election.

While Trump has embraced the claims, some critics and intelligence veterans have expressed concern over the politicization of intelligence.

AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton argues that once AI surpasses human intelligence, its power of persuasion will be its primary tool, making control a matter of aligning its goals with humanity's. Other experts note that AI's decentralized nature across global data centers makes a physical shutdown nearly impossible without causing a catastrophic collapse of civilization's infrastructure. The focus, they argue, must be on building benevolent systems and robust governance rather than relying on a failsafe.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly refuted claims that he intends to harm Elon Musk's businesses, such as Tesla and SpaceX, by eliminating their government subsidies. In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated he wants Musk and all American businesses to "THRIVE like never before," asserting that their success is beneficial for the country. This declaration comes amid a public war of words between the two influential figures, which has included disagreements over policy and personal attacks. The statement appears aimed at quelling speculation about potential political retribution against Musk's corporate empire.</p>

          <p>An inquest into the death of 19-year-old Jay Slater in Tenerife heard testimony from one of the last people to speak with him. His friend, Bradley Geoghegan, stated that Slater did not sound fearful or under duress during their final phone call, suggesting he had likely "sobered up and decided to come back" from a remote Airbnb. The court heard that Slater, who had taken drugs and alcohol, faced a 14-hour walk home. His body was later found in a ravine, with a pathologist concluding his death was caused by head injuries consistent with a fall.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California, seeking to dismantle a portion of Proposition 12, a state law requiring cage-free conditions for farm animals. The administration claims the law's rules for egg-laying hens are responsible for high egg prices nationwide, an assertion that agricultural economists largely attribute to recent avian flu outbreaks instead. Critics suggest the lawsuit is a political maneuver to support the pork industry, which has long opposed the law's similar provisions for pigs. The move is seen as an effort to advance a federal bill that would nullify such state-level animal welfare standards.</p>

The investigation, which was commissioned by the NWSL, highlights systemic obstacles in reporting workplace sexual assault.

          <p>The article explores the psychological phenomenon of time seeming to accelerate with age, drawing on philosophy and neuroscience. It explains that our perception of time is subjective, influenced by age, circadian rhythms, and our current emotional state. To make life feel subjectively longer, the author suggests pursuing meaningful, emotionally evocative activities that create dense memories, rather than simple fun. Other strategies include savoring moments fully and avoiding routine to prevent being on "autopilot." Ultimately, the piece argues that how we use our time is more important than how long it feels.</p>
