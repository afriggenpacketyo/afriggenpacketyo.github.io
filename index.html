        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides guidance for individuals deciding between a do-it-yourself approach and hiring a professional for tax resolution. Experts suggest that taxpayers with debts under $10,000 and a straightforward situation can often handle it themselves by setting up an online payment plan with the IRS. However, for debts exceeding $10,000, complex situations like unfiled returns, or if the IRS has initiated collections, engaging a tax professional is highly recommended to navigate options like an Offer in Compromise and avoid severe financial consequences.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of copper for U.S. buyers has soared after a proposed 50% tariff on imports was announced, creating a significant price premium compared to the global market. This has caused U.S. copper futures to hit a record high, with analysts warning of negative consequences for the American economy, including increased costs for consumer goods and infrastructure projects. While the administration's goal is to boost domestic production, experts note this will require years of development and massive investment, raising concerns about potential demand destruction and a shift to cheaper alternatives like aluminum.

          <p>While the national average interest rate for savings accounts remains low, high-yield savings accounts are offering substantially higher returns, with top rates reaching between 4.11% and 4.30%. Financial experts recommend these accounts, often available through online banks with low overhead costs, as a superior option for growing an emergency fund. To secure the best rate, consumers are advised to compare different high-yield accounts, paying attention to both interest rates and any potential fees that could diminish their earnings over time.

          <p>The U.S. administration is leveraging sector-specific "Section 232" tariffs on products like cars, steel, aluminum, and now potentially copper and pharmaceuticals, to reshape the economy and pressure trading partners. These levies, justified under national security provisions, are causing significant price increases and market volatility, as seen with copper prices soaring after a 50% tariff was announced. Unlike broader reciprocal tariffs, these product-specific duties are considered more legally robust, suggesting they could have a lasting and significant impact on both domestic consumers and international supply chains.

The author contends that the massive increase in funding for agents, detention beds, and border security technology creates a powerful enforcement apparatus with a jurisdiction that could extend beyond immigration. The piece warns that this buildup, combined with a blurring of lines between military and civilian law enforcement, lays the groundwork for a more coherent police state.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated the ACT Brumbies 36-24 in Canberra, maintaining their winning streak in Australia but revealing some persistent flaws. The tourists overcame a slow start to score five tries, with notable performances from Ollie Chessum, Marcus Smith, and James Lowe. However, the Brumbies, despite missing key players, remained competitive throughout the match, scoring four tries of their own and exposing issues in the Lions' breakdown and defense. The victory was ultimately uncomfortable, highlighting areas for improvement ahead of more challenging fixtures.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in Texas have brought renewed attention to recent staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA. While experts state the NWS issued timely warnings for the storm, they caution that continued reductions in staff, including meteorologists and hydrologists, could compromise the agency's ability to handle future weather catastrophes. The San Antonio NWS office, which covers the affected area, has a significant vacancy rate, including the key role of a warning coordination meteorologist who liaises with local emergency responders.</p>

          <p>Rescue operations are ongoing in Central Texas after catastrophic flash floods resulted in at least 110 confirmed deaths and left over 170 people unaccounted for.

A significant tragedy occurred at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, where at least 27 campers and counselors died. President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration, enabling FEMA to support the challenging local rescue and recovery efforts amid ongoing storms.</p>

          <p>To combat a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in UK Crown Courts, former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended a series of radical reforms, including the use of judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud. The proposals aim to prevent a "total system collapse" by speeding up the justice process, which currently sees some victims and defendants waiting years for a trial. While some legal professionals and the government acknowledge the crisis, others argue that removing juries for any case erodes the fundamental right to be tried by one's peers.</p>

This move caters to a trend of office workers treating themselves on days they commute, but it also comes as many consumers remain concerned about the rising cost of living.</p>

          <p>Following a guilty verdict in an Australian murder case involving toxic mushrooms, this article explains the dangers of the death cap mushroom (Amanita phalloides). These fungi contain a highly stable toxin, alpha-Amanitin, which is not destroyed by cooking and causes catastrophic liver failure, often with delayed symptoms. Most poisonings result from misidentification, as death caps resemble many edible species. The article notes that commercial mushrooms are grown in controlled, treeless environments, making contamination from death caps, which grow symbiotically with oak and beech trees, extremely unlikely.</p>

          <p>This article explores the life of Joseph Kurihara, a Japanese American U.S. Army veteran of World War I who became a prominent dissident during the WWII incarceration of Japanese Americans. Witnessing the injustice of the forced removal, Kurihara's faith in American democracy eroded, leading him to fiercely oppose collaborationist leaders at the Manzanar camp. After being moved to a segregation center for "troublemakers," he renounced his U.S. citizenship and moved to Japan, never to return, embodying a story of resistance that contrasts with the more common narrative of stoic loyalty.</p>

          <p>A temporary dip in mortgage interest rates spurred a significant 9.4% increase in total mortgage application volume last week. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.77%, its lowest point in three months, encouraging a rise in both home purchase and refinancing applications. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the increase in homebuyer demand is also supported by growing housing inventory and more moderate price growth. However, rates have since begun to climb again, potentially tempering this recent surge in activity. (not investment advice)</p>
