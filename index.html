          <p>President Donald Trump has defended his decision to deploy National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration sweeps, claiming the city would be "burning" without federal intervention. California Governor Gavin Newsom is seeking a federal judge to quickly block the deployments, arguing they are unwarranted, stoke fear, and escalate civil unrest. Newsom's lawsuit alleges Trump broke the law by federalizing the California National Guard without the governor's consent, while Trump insists the scale of the protests necessitates the deployments. This article covers the escalating conflict between the federal government and California over immigration enforcement and the use of military force within the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film *Ballerina*, a spin-off "From the World of John Wick," expands the Wick canon rather than deepening its titular protagonist. The story follows Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas), who trains to be a killer after seeing her father gunned down by assassins. While initially appearing to be a *Wick* clone without the stylistic flair, the film succeeds by expanding the Wick universe, such as when Eve's journey leads her to a cultish mountain town in the Austrian Alps where every single inhabitant is out to kill her. The grim violence has a sense of humor and improvisation, harkening back to the Buster Keatonâ€“ and Looney Tunesâ€“inspired mayhem at the core of *John Wick*.</p>
