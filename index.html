            <p>A small plane crashed into the Platte River south of Fremont, Nebraska, resulting in the deaths of all three occupants on board. The Dodge County Sheriff's Office confirmed the recovery of the bodies and is withholding their identities pending notification of next of kin. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have taken over the investigation to determine the cause of the crash, urging the public to avoid the area during the investigation. This incident marks a tragic loss for the community and underscores the inherent risks associated with aviation. The investigation will hopefully shed light on the circumstances leading to the crash and prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

            <p>Gunmen disguised as soldiers opened fire at a cockfight in La Valencia, Ecuador, killing 12 people and wounding several others. The attackers, dressed in replica military uniforms, used automatic rifles, a tactic common among criminal gangs in the country. Police have detained four suspects believed to be part of the "Los R7" organized crime group, recovering weapons, cash, and discarded uniforms. Ecuador is currently facing a surge in violence due to transnational cartels vying for control over cocaine routes, leading President Daniel Noboa to declare a state of emergency in parts of the country. The incident highlights the escalating violence and the challenges faced by Ecuador in combating organized crime and drug trafficking.</p>

            <p>A judge has ruled that a former roommate of the University of Idaho students killed in 2022 can testify about seeing an intruder with "bushy eyebrows" around the time of the murders. Bryan Kohberger's defense attorneys had sought to bar the testimony, arguing it was unreliable and irrelevant. The judge disagreed, stating that the testimony can be used during Kohberger's trial on four murder charges, subject to cross-examination. The judge also ruled on the admissibility of Kohberger's medical diagnoses, stating they cannot be used to explain his courtroom demeanor unless he testifies.</p>

            <p>Scientists are claiming to have discovered a new color, referred to as 'olo', that is a saturated shade of blue-green, which cannot be seen without stimulation. The findings published in Science Advances involved laser pulses fired into the eyes of participants, stimulating specific cells in the retina. Professor Ren Ng from the University of California described the findings as "remarkable". Some experts are questioning the discovery while Professor Ng believes that the results could potentially further research into colour blindness.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to reclassify thousands of federal workers as "at-will" employees, stripping them of civil service protections. The proposed change would affect approximately 50,000 federal workers. The White House states that these workers must faithfully implement the administration's policies. The new rule requires an executive order from Trump after the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issues a final rule.</p>

            <p>The article argues that financial security, rather than poverty, is driving the rise of right-wing populism. Affluent baby boomers, protected by rising house prices and pensions, are supporting policies that benefit themselves while neglecting the less fortunate. This shift represents a new social contract where the wealthy are less concerned with the well-being of the poor. Academics have found that financial security reduces risk aversion, making people more tolerant of radical political choices.</p>
