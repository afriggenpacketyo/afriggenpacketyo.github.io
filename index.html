          <p>A new review estimates that assisted deaths in England and Wales could surpass 4,000 within ten years of the law's implementation, contingent on parliamentary approval. The official impact assessment, intended to inform MPs, anticipates a gradual increase from an initial 164-787 cases in the first half-year to 1,042-4,559 in the tenth year, assuming the policy starts in October 2029. Even at the upper estimate, assisted deaths would remain below 1% of all deaths, according to the assessment. The bill is scheduled to return to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote expected in mid-June, determining its fate. Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>Singapore held its general election, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong facing his first major test against a revitalized opposition. The election serves as an indicator of the People's Action Party's (PAP) popularity, which has governed since 1965, and Wong's leadership in his first year. Voters are concerned about rising living costs and housing availability, while the opposition Workers' Party (WP) argues the government hasn't addressed these issues adequately. The PAP emphasizes its efforts to help citizens cope with rising costs through various financial aid programs. A strong PAP showing would solidify Wong's leadership and the party's dominance in Singapore for the next decade. Optimism score: 75</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's economic policies are under scrutiny after the US GDP shrank in the first quarter, marking the first contraction in three years. Trump quickly blamed the "Biden Overhang" for the dismal numbers, while simultaneously taking credit for positive economic indicators like strong jobs reports. Growth was challenged by the administration's plans to overhaul the world economy, with US goods imports surging and consumer spending on durable goods falling. Experts anticipate that Trump's tariffs will have a greater impact on growth in the second quarter, potentially leading to a recession. Optimism score: 40</p>

This research could lead to a universal antivenom, addressing the 140,000 deaths and numerous disabilities caused by snakebites annually.

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Colorado, Denver, and local leaders over their "sanctuary" policies, according to CBS News. The suit claims these policies interfere with federal immigration enforcement and allowed a Venezuelan gang to seize control of an apartment complex. Local officials dispute Trump's claims about the gang's influence. The lawsuit seeks to invalidate laws blocking local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration authorities.

          <p>A 25% import tax on key car parts has taken effect in the US, increasing pressure on the automotive industry, according to a BBC article. While Donald Trump eased the measure, the tariff aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing. Analysts predict higher costs for businesses and consumers, despite a recent sales surge. General Motors warned of significant new costs due to the tariffs, while other companies withdrew financial guidance, citing extreme uncertainties. Optimism score: 45</p>

Now, the advertising bonanza might be coming to an end after the demise of the shipping loophole that spurred it.

          <p>The New York Times details how Ghana's national cathedral project, intended as a grand monument, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and a political battleground. The project, championed by former President Nana Akufo-Addo, has stalled after costing the country millions of dollars. Now that Mr. Akufo-Addo has left office, the project appears permanently doomed. The cathedral is now a major target of the new government’s anticorruption initiative, called Operation Recover All Loot.

This second round of duties on imported parts will have a broader impact because even cars made in the United States often have engines, transmissions, batteries or other components produced in other countries. The administration also said that imported auto parts would not be subjected to other levies, like the ones on aluminum and steel.
