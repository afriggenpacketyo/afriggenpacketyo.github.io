          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has announced plans to cover the educational expenses for 22 children from the Poonch district who were orphaned during the May military conflict between India and Pakistan. The region, located in India-administered Jammu and Kashmir, suffered numerous civilian casualties from shelling and drone attacks. According to the local Congress party, Gandhi's support will continue until the children complete their graduation, with the first financial installment scheduled for release this week. This philanthropic gesture comes as India's parliament debates the military actions taken in response to the preceding Pahalgam attack.</p>

The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas with a documented mental health history, used a high-powered rifle in the attack. Officer Islam, a four-year veteran and father of two with a third child on the way, was praised as a hero for his actions during the incident.

          <p>India's Home Minister Amit Shah has stated that three suspected militants, believed to be responsible for the deadly April attack on tourists in Pahalgam, were killed in a gunfight. The operation took place in the Dachigam area of India-administered Kashmir and was a joint effort by military, paramilitary, and police forces. Shah identified two of the men as members of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba and claimed all three were Pakistani nationals. The April attack, which killed 26 people, led to a severe military escalation between India and Pakistan in May.</p>

          <p>South Korean AI chip developer Rebellions has received a new investment from Samsung as it pursues a larger funding round of up to $200 million. The company, which merged with competitor Sapeon last year, is positioning itself as a rival to industry leader Nvidia, focusing on AI inferencing chips. Rebellions is collaborating with Samsung's foundry to manufacture its next-generation "Rebel" chip, a move that could strategically benefit Samsung's chipmaking division. The startup aims to go public after the current funding round, which is expected to increase its valuation above its previous $1 billion mark. (not investment advice)</p>

Medicines are the EU's largest export to the U.S., valued at around $120 billion in 2024, and even a 15% tariff could significantly impact the industry.

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve holding its key short-term interest rate steady throughout 2025, consumer borrowing costs have shown minimal fluctuation in the first half of the year. The federal funds rate, which influences what banks charge each other, has had a limited trickle-down effect on many consumer products. Average credit card rates have slightly decreased from their peak but remain high, while auto loan and 30-year mortgage rates have hovered within a narrow range. Experts note that a future Fed rate cut is not guaranteed to lower borrowing costs for consumers, as rates for products like mortgages are more closely tied to Treasury yields.

In response, Lebanon's central bank has banned dealings with a key Hezbollah-linked financial entity, and the government has increased security at ports of entry to intercept illicit cash flows.

The proposed strategy involves a renewed focus on partisan voter registration and developing messaging that connects with the economic concerns of working people, such as insurance costs and the cost of living.

          <p>The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the EU could inadvertently benefit the United Kingdom, according to some economic analysts. The deal imposes a 15% tariff on EU goods imported to the U.S., which is higher than the 10% rate the U.K. has separately agreed to. This 5% difference could make British exports relatively cheaper for U.S. importers and consumers, potentially boosting trade. Some experts suggest this tariff advantage might even incentivize EU-based manufacturers to shift production to the U.K. to avoid the higher levy on their goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, India has overtaken China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S. market, according to a report from Canalys. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from just 13% the previous year, with shipment volume soaring 240%. This shift is primarily driven by Apple's accelerated move to manufacture more of its products in India amid ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions. The data reflects a significant realignment of global manufacturing supply chains away from China. (not investment advice)</p>

The men, who were deported from the U.S. as part of an anti-immigration campaign, describe systematic physical and psychological abuse, including beatings and threats from guards. Detainees were held in crowded cells with no contact with the outside world, leading to such despair that some considered suicide. Their accounts offer a disturbing look into the human cost of El Salvador's harsh anti-gang crackdown and the controversial U.S. policy of deporting migrants to third countries.</p>

          <p>In Nigeria's northern Zamfara state, kidnappers have killed at least 35 of the 56 people they abducted from a village in March, even after ransoms were paid for their release. A local official reported that the gunmen, known locally as bandits, had demanded a significant ransom per captive. After receiving payment, they released 18 women and one boy but slaughtered the remaining hostages, most of whom were young people. The Zamfara government condemned the "barbaric and cowardly" act, highlighting the persistent and brutal nature of the region's kidnapping-for-ransom crisis.</p>

          <p>Food price inflation in the United Kingdom rose for the sixth straight month, with prices increasing by 4% in the year to July, according to the British Retail Consortium. The increase was largely driven by higher costs for staple goods like meat and tea, which have been affected by tighter global supplies and rising wholesale prices. This trend aligns with other research suggesting household grocery bills are set to rise significantly this year. While fresh food inflation remained steady, the price of ambient or cupboard goods saw a notable increase, adding pressure to household budgets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst expectations, and announced a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely driven by its investment banking division, which saw a 10% year-on-year increase in income to £3.3 billion. This boost was attributed to heightened market volatility, which increased net interest and trading income, offsetting a decline in advisory fees. The results indicate that the bank's strategic plan, which includes cost reductions and a focus on its investment unit, is on track. (not investment advice)</p>
