          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a powerful Category 3 storm, is intensifying over the Central Pacific and moving west-northnorthwest towards Hawaii, currently located about 900 miles east-southeast of Hilo. Forecasters anticipate life-threatening surf and rip currents reaching the islands by late weekend, with potential direct impacts like strong winds and heavy rainfall starting Monday, and the main threats forecast for Tuesday. Acting Hawaii Governor Sylvia Luke has declared a state of emergency, urging residents and visitors to monitor updates, follow official guidance, and prepare accordingly for the approaching weather system. The National Weather Service in Honolulu is closely monitoring Kiko's possible impacts, anticipating significant rainfall leading to potential flooding and high surf early next week as the hurricane's path continues to be tracked.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever star Sophie Cunningham reacted with "A sick joke" to a group photo featuring five of her teammates sidelined by season-ending injuries, including high-profile player Caitlin Clark. The team has been severely impacted by these numerous setbacks, all occurring within a two-month period, forcing them to play with a significantly depleted roster. Despite these formidable challenges, the Fever recently secured a win, which has helped to keep their playoff hopes alive. Cunningham, who suffered a season-ending MCL injury in late August, articulated the collective frustration and dismay over the widespread and unfortunate circumstances affecting the team's 2025 season.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special baseball treats, including an autographed bat from outfielder Harrison Bader, after a home run ball was controversially taken from him. Viral footage showed the ball landing in the stands, with the boy's father initially securing it for his son, only for a woman to demand it back, claiming it was hers. Both the Phillies and Marlins teams, recognizing the importance of such a moment for a young fan, stepped in to gift the boy with merchandise and a personal meeting with Bader. This gesture aimed to salvage the experience, providing a positive outcome for the fan amidst the dispute.</p>

The party's recent conference showcased rising figures like Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham, a lawyer and former Conservative defector, and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, highlighting efforts to broaden its appeal. Reform UK plans to field 5,000 vetted candidates for upcoming elections in London, Wales, and Scotland, viewing this as an essential building block towards a general election. Despite past challenges with candidate vetting, the party insists it has improved its system to ensure quality amidst its rapid expansion.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing her upcoming Budget, influenced by recent market instability and cabinet reshuffles, with the Budget date set for November 26. Despite initial bond market jitters, which saw long-term borrowing rates rise, Reeves maintained confidence, asserting that the fluctuations were global rather than UK-specific, a view later supported by the market's recovery. The Bank of England governor also downplayed the long-term gilt rate's direct impact on overall government debt. The Chancellor's team is expected to use this market rollercoaster to argue against increased borrowing, suggesting any fiscal gaps will necessitate higher taxes or reduced spending, with the Office for Budget Responsibility's productivity forecast being a key determinant of the required adjustment.

          <p>Davey Johnson, a revered figure in Major League Baseball, has died at the age of 82, as announced by the Mets' longtime public relations official, Jay Horwitz. Johnson was a four-time MLB All-Star infielder, winning two World Series titles with the Baltimore Orioles during his playing career in 1966 and 1970. He later achieved significant managerial success, famously leading the 1986 New York Mets to a World Series championship, and his 595-417 record remains the best of any manager in franchise history. Inducted into the Mets Hall of Fame in 2010, Johnson's extensive career also included managing the Cincinnati Reds, Orioles, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Washington Nationals.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who experienced mortar fire in Iraq, co-founded "Sisters in Service" to advocate for greater recognition and support for female military veterans. The community interest company, which has recruited 160 members across the UK, helps women who performed dangerous front-line roles and now work in healthcare, to support each other. Dr. Bennett highlights that many people still hold "very outdated ideas" that only men deploy to the front line, leading to unique challenges for women post-service, including feelings of isolation and misconceptions from the public. The group aims to provide a "cathartic" space for shared experiences, fostering connection and mutual support that traditional veteran spaces may not offer.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively using decoys, including inflatable tanks and flat-pack artillery, to deceive Russian forces and conserve valuable ammunition and resources. These full-scale models, ranging from British-made M777 howitzers to imitation drones, are designed to mimic real military equipment, drawing enemy fire and forcing Russia to waste expensive weaponry. Volunteers play a crucial role in supplying these cost-effective imitations, with plywood M777 decoys costing around $500-$600, often targeted by much more expensive Lancet kamikaze drones. The successful deployment of these decoys often involves faithfully recreating realistic positions, sometimes even fooling visiting commanders, demonstrating their effectiveness as a strategic tool in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Eleven people, including women, little girls, and an infant, are missing after a hippopotamus capsized their narrow, canoe-like boat on the Sassandra River in southwestern Ivory Coast. The tragic incident occurred near the town of Buyo on Friday, with only three people managing to survive and be rescued. Myss Belmonde Dogo, the nation's minister for national cohesion and solidarity, confirmed the event on social media and stated that a search operation is actively ongoing in the hope of finding the missing victims. Hippopotamuses are a significant threat in the region, with a 2022 study identifying them as the species most frequently involved in human deaths or injuries in the country.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has distanced itself from a conference speaker, Dr. Aseem Malhotra, who controversially suggested a link between Covid vaccines and the cancers of King Charles and the Princess of Wales. Malhotra, an adviser to US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also claimed that studies show mRNA vaccines could alter genes and that taking the Covid vaccine was more likely to cause harm than the virus itself. Health Secretary Wes Streeting criticized Reform for providing a platform for these "shockingly irresponsible" and "poisonous lies," which have been widely discredited by medical professionals and lack scientific evidence. Reform UK stated it does not endorse what Malhotra said but believes in free speech, amidst warnings of a resurgence of preventable diseases due to vaccine skepticism.</p>

          <p>Thousands of mourners gathered in Milan to pay their final respects to Giorgio Armani, Italy's most famous designer, who passed away this week at the age of 91. His wooden coffin, adorned with white roses, was displayed in the vast exhibition space at the company's headquarters for two days, surrounded by dozens of small lanterns, allowing the public to bid farewell. Among the first visitors were prominent figures like John Elkann of the Agnelli family and fellow fashion designer Donatella Versace, reflecting Armani's immense impact on the industry. Armani had struggled with health issues for months, forcing him to cancel participation in recent fashion shows. A private funeral is scheduled to follow the public viewing on Monday.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber on the FBI's most wanted list, faces extradition to the US after evading authorities for 21 years. He was found last year in an isolated cottage in north Wales, having used the alias Danny Webb. San Diego is the prime suspect for a series of bombings in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003, with his alleged actions linked to animal rights extremist groups. Former FBI agents revealed "missed opportunities" to arrest him earlier, including discovering a suspected "bomb-making factory" in his abandoned car after a 65-mile rush-hour chase. His five-day extradition hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court in London will determine his return to face federal charges.</p>

          <p>Over 425 people were arrested at a demonstration in London's Parliament Square protesting the government's proscription of the campaign group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act. The majority of arrests were for supporting a proscribed organization, with more than 25 individuals also arrested for assaults on police officers and other public order offenses. The Metropolitan Police reported "an exceptional level of abuse" and a "coordinated effort to prevent officers carrying out their duties," while organizers, Defend Our Juries, accused officers of violently assaulting peaceful protesters. The ban, which makes membership of or support for the group a criminal offense, has drawn strong criticism from human rights groups like Amnesty International, who describe the arrests for peaceful sign-holding as "genuinely shocking."</p>

          <p>Over 25 million people across the Northeast are under alert for strong to severe thunderstorms, with potential for flash flooding on Saturday afternoon and into the overnight hours. A severe thunderstorm watch has been issued for parts of the Northeast, stretching from Maryland to Maine, until 8 p.m. ET, encompassing much of the Interstate 95 corridor, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. The primary hazards from any severe thunderstorms that develop include strong, potentially damaging wind gusts, isolated large hail, and a slim risk of a few brief tornadoes, especially for locations in northern New England. Localized flash flooding is also a significant concern, particularly in urban, poor-drainage areas, due to multiple rounds of heavy rain. Cooler, fall-like air is expected to sweep in behind this front for the second half of the weekend.</p>

          <p>Chicago is bracing for potential federal intervention as President Trump again threatened to deploy National Guard troops for immigration enforcement and crime reduction, evoking an "Apocalypse Now" meme. This follows similar deployments in Los Angeles and Washington D.C., though a federal court recently ruled the LA deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act. Local officials, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, strongly oppose the move, calling it a threat to the Constitution and an attempt to occupy the city. While violent crime in Chicago has decreased, local community leaders argue that militarization is not the solution, advocating for community-led initiatives instead, amidst widespread anxiety over potential immigration raids, leading to the postponement of a Mexican Independence Day festival.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses secured their spot in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their impressive winning streak to 30 games. Despite the dominant scoreline, coach John Mitchell noted an "untidy" attacking performance and early struggles with their usually potent driving maul and set-piece, which were uncharacteristically scattergun in the first 30 minutes. Australia's intensity and tactical kicks unsettled England's defense, offering potential insights for stronger rivals like Canada and New Zealand in later stages. However, England's defense remained outstanding, keeping Australia scoreless in the second half for their third successive shut-out in the tournament. They now face Scotland in the quarter-finals, with Mitchell emphasizing the need for improved consistency in the upcoming knockout rugby matches.</p>

          <p>Jamie Borthwick, known for his 19-year portrayal of Jay Brown on the BBC soap EastEnders, has been axed from the show following a prior suspension. The actor was suspended earlier this year for using a slur against people with disabilities on the set of Strictly Come Dancing, an incident the BBC deemed "entirely unacceptable." A BBC Studios spokesperson confirmed his departure, stating that he will not be returning to EastEnders and they do not comment on individual matters. Borthwick had apologized for "any offence and upset" at the time, but disability charity Scope urged him to reflect on his words and educate himself. His exit marks the end of a long tenure, during which he won a British Soap Award for best dramatic performance from a young actor.</p>

An email sent to broadcasters specified that Trump would be shown on screen during the singing of the national anthem but explicitly requested that any "disruptions or reactions" in response to his attendance be refrained from being aired.

Executive Vice President Peter O’Reilly emphasized that this isn't a "one-and-done" event but a long-term commitment to year-round engagement, aiming to become a true global sport property. Despite soccer's dominance in Brazil, nearly 50,000 fans, overwhelmingly in Chiefs jerseys, attended the game, demonstrating the "pebble-in-the-pond effect" of building new fan bases. The league is investing in reach, streaming games free globally, and encouraging individual teams to engage with international markets, with Commissioner Roger Goodell noting 36 million fans in Brazil and seeing positive results in fan growth.

Thousands of fans left Villa Park well before the end, reflecting the "dire" and underwhelming display against the 174th-ranked side. Critics argue Tuchel has yet to stamp any clear identity on the team, which has shown a persistent lack of ideas, inspiration, and momentum since Sir Gareth Southgate's departure following Euro 2024. Despite progress towards World Cup qualification, the unconvincing win and static offensive statistics compared to previous games highlight the formidable challenges Tuchel faces ahead of a sterner test against Serbia, where improvement will be crucial.</p>

The brakeman attempted to apply emergency brakes, but the upper carriage was traveling at approximately 60km/h (37mph) when it crashed into a building. The 140-year-old Glória funicular is a vital transport link and popular tourist attraction.
