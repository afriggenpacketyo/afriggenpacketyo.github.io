          <p>Hurricane Erick, a Category 3 storm, made landfall on Mexico's Pacific Coast in the state of Oaxaca, bringing sustained winds of 125 mph and heavy rain. The hurricane, which had briefly intensified to a Category 4 storm before landfall, is expected to weaken as it moves inland. A hurricane warning is in effect from Acapulco to Puerto Angel, and authorities are assessing potential damage in coastal villages. The storm is expected to bring heavy rainfall to southeastern Guerrero and west-coastal Oaxaca, potentially causing life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides. The article notes that Erick is the first Pacific Category 3 hurricane on record to make landfall over Mexico in June. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration's renewed focus on workplace immigration enforcement could significantly impact industries reliant on undocumented workers, such as farming, hospitality, construction, and manufacturing. Industry leaders warn that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations and lead to inflated food prices, as these workers fill essential jobs that are difficult to replace with domestic labor. Research suggests that deportations can lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers and a decrease in U.S. GDP. The article details the share of undocumented workers in various industries and states, highlighting the potential economic consequences of the administration's policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old girl was injured by an alligator while swimming in Lake Waccamaw, North Carolina, prompting a response from local police and the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC). The alligator, a 12-foot male, made contact with the victim, causing lacerations and scratches on her legs; it was later euthanized according to NCWRC protocol. Authorities emphasized that such incidents are extremely rare and described the alligator's behavior as unusual and not predatory. Residents and visitors are reminded to remain vigilant and maintain a safe distance from alligators, respecting that these animals are not tame.</p>

          <p>Heavy rain, flooding, and a rock slide have once again closed a section of Interstate 40 through the Great Smoky Mountains, impacting a portion of the highway that was previously damaged by Hurricane Helene. The affected area, near the Tennessee-North Carolina state line, experienced significant rainfall, leading to crews working to clear the debris. The permanent repair to stabilize the road, which was heavily damaged in September, will take years and involve driving steel rods into the bedrock. The closure of I-40, a major cross-country route, forces detours of dozens of miles, with restrictions on trucks using alternate routes.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidance regarding the assessment of fresh applications for oil and gas projects in the North Sea. Operators must now conduct environmental impact assessments that consider emissions from burning oil and gas, not just those from production. This decision follows a Supreme Court ruling and will affect controversial projects like Rosebank and Jackdaw. Climate campaigners argue that these new developments will barely impact the UK's reliance on imported fossil fuels, and that the government should reject projects that are incompatible with climate commitments.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that offsetting the carbon emissions from the reserves held by the world's 200 largest oil and gas companies would require planting a forest the size of North America. The research highlights the significant land use and financial challenges associated with afforestation as a means of balancing CO2 emissions. Researchers suggest that the scale of afforestation needed is unrealistic and would displace infrastructure, agriculture, and habitats. The study emphasizes the need for reducing fossil fuel extraction and use, as offsetting alone is not a viable solution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The world is preparing for an escalating conflict in the Middle East as international calls for restraint go unheeded, with all eyes on President Trump's potential direct military strikes on Iran. The Kremlin has warned that U.S. intervention could trigger a terrible spiral of escalation, while Russia has stated the world is millimeters away from nuclear catastrophe. Germany's Chancellor commented that Israel was doing the dirty work for other countries by attacking Iran's nuclear sites. Leaders show no sign of stepping back from the brink as tensions continue to mount.</p>

          <p>Airbus has taken center stage at this year's Paris Air Show, securing substantial orders and showcasing new models, while Boeing maintains a low profile due to ongoing challenges. Airbus has accumulated nearly $21 billion in orders, including agreements with AviLease, ANA, and LOT, as Boeing has remained relatively quiet. This year marks another in which Boeing has refrained from flypasts and major promotional activities, as it focuses on addressing quality control issues and customer concerns. Industry demand remains strong, with both Boeing and Airbus having significant aircraft backlogs, though the overall environment is described as sombre.</p>

The holiday is celebrated with parades, parties, concerts, and cultural events, reflecting a joyful anniversary of independence and a remembrance of the country's foundation on slavery. Activist Opal Lee, known as the "Grandmother of Juneteenth," played a significant role in advocating for its federal recognition.
