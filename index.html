          <h2>Judge Temporarily Blocks Migrant Removals from Colorado Under Alien Enemies Act</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 18:56:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Denver issued a temporary restraining order preventing the removal of migrants from Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act, following arguments from the ACLU and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network. The lawyers argued that two Venezuelan men were at imminent risk of deportation to a prison in El Salvador, where 11 men from Colorado have already been sent. The judge's order requires 21 days' notice for individuals subject to deportation under the AEA, including information on the right to judicial review and consultation with an attorney. The Trump administration invoked the Act to detain or deport noncitizens deemed "dangerous," particularly those allegedly connected to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The last time this act was invoked was during World War II. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, with the FDA looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and work with the food industry to eliminate six others. While former President Biden's administration already started the process to ban Red No. 3, federal officials are taking steps to pull the authorization for two synthetic food colorings -- Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B -- within the coming months. The plan is contingent on an "understanding" with major food companies, and while some industry groups question the timeline, others indicate willingness to cooperate. Studies suggest the vibrant colors make food more appealing and could even increase appetite. </p>

          <p>David Marcus argues that Elon Musk deserves gratitude for his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the Trump administration, claiming Musk saved the federal government $106 billion by cutting wasteful spending. Marcus acknowledges the controversy surrounding Musk's role and the personal and economic costs he has faced, including damage to Tesla's reputation. Marcus notes that Musk's service at DOGE has made him a target of hatred, particularly from the far left, despite his efforts to challenge the status quo and make the government more efficient. Marcus also posits that Musk's work in challenging wasteful government spending is vital for the country's fiscal solvency.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in the 2019 killing of her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, in Arizona, with the jury reaching a verdict after beginning deliberations on Monday. Charles Vallow was fatally shot by Vallow Daybell's brother, Alex Cox, who claimed self-defense at the time; Cox later died of natural causes. Vallow Daybell is already serving life sentences in Idaho for the murders of her children and conspiring to murder Chad Daybell's wife, Tammy. Prosecutors argued that Vallow Daybell and Cox planned to kill Vallow to collect life insurance money and marry Daybell, while Vallow Daybell, representing herself, claimed Vallow's death was a tragedy, not a crime. </p>

          <p>Tesla's profit plunged 71% in the first quarter to $409 million, impacted by brand controversy stemming from Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration and looming tariffs. Revenue dropped 9% to $19.3 billion, and the stock has fallen nearly 40% this year amid declining sales and increased competition. Analysts point to Musk's deteriorating reputation and Trump's tariffs on auto imports as key factors. Tesla suspended imports of auto parts from China after Trump announced a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, potentially disrupting plans for the Cybercab. </p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is experiencing significant internal strife regarding its future direction and how to address current challenges under the Trump administration. The infighting revolves around whether to prioritize resistance to Trump's policies and defense of vulnerable communities or to appeal to disillusioned Trump voters by moving towards the center. Some Democrats, like Al Gore, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, advocate for strong opposition to Trump, while others focus on winning elections and securing majorities, even if it means potentially alienating loyal Democratic voters. Emerging leaders like David Hogg propose challenging older Democrats with fresh faces, further fueling the internal divisions.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, allege the Justice Department has failed to provide adequate responses to a judge's order for expedited discovery and questions about facilitating his return. The judge accused the DOJ of "continued mischaracterization of the Supreme Court's Order" and "willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations." The DOJ claims it is in discussions with the Salvadoran government, but Abrego Garcia's attorneys say the government is narrowing the scope of discovery to avoid compliance. A detail of Abrego Garcia's detention in El Salvador may prompt the judge to seek more information about what the Trump administration knew about his transfer from a supermax prison to another detention center.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes the recent stock surge could signal a genuine recovery, despite skepticism about its sustainability.

Cramer emphasizes that recoveries often begin as bear market rallies, and that a breakthrough in trade or economic policy could shift market sentiment. He cautions that Trump should be gracious in negotiations with China to avoid further conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

Investors are concerned about Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its impact on Tesla's performance. Musk announced plans to scale back his time spent on DOGE starting in May, allocating more time to Tesla while still dedicating one to two days a week to government issues.

          <p>The Veterans Affairs (VA) department is directing staff to report instances of "anti-Christian bias" to a newly established taskforce, as part of Donald Trump's effort to reshape government policy on religious expression. The VA Secretary Doug Collins said the department launched a taskforce to review the Biden administration’s “treatment of Christians”. The department is seeking instances of informal policies or understandings hostile to Christian views, adverse responses to religious exemption requests under previous vaccine mandates, and retaliatory actions in response to abstaining from certain procedures or treatments. Critics have condemned this as privileging evangelical Christianity over other religious minorities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from dismantling Voice of America (VOA), a government-funded broadcaster, issuing a preliminary injunction. The judge ordered the administration to reinstate VOA employees and contractors to their previous status before an executive order suspended their work. The order also covers Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks. The judge deemed the administration's decision to dismantle the agency "arbitrary and capricious" and potentially in violation of numerous federal laws.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced that he will scale back his work at the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) starting in May, allocating more time to Tesla. Tesla's sales have been negatively impacted by the association with the Trump administration, and the stock has plunged. Musk's decision comes as Tesla's first-quarter earnings fell short of expectations, with revenue tumbling and profit slumping. Some analysts believe that Musk's personal brand has been tarnished by his political activities, and exiting DOGE may not fully resolve the issues.</p>

The fund also revised down its UK economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1.1%, citing the global fallout from US trade tariffs.

The Times corrected the article less than 14 hours after publication, and the former editorial page editor apologized for the error.
