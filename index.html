          <p>President Trump stated that Elon Musk would face "serious consequences" if he supported Democratic candidates challenging Republicans backing his legislative agenda. Trump also indicated that his relationship with Musk is likely over, accusing Musk of disrespecting the office of the president. Trump claimed he had previously supported Musk's ventures during his first term in office. The remarks highlight the escalating feud between the two figures after Musk criticized Trump's policies, with Trump suggesting Musk's companies might face scrutiny regarding government contracts. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that Justice Clarence Thomas has significantly influenced the Supreme Court's stance against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs by advocating for individual rights over group rights. It highlights Thomas's long-standing belief, dating back to his time at the EEOC, that civil rights laws should protect individuals from discriminatory practices rather than favoring specific groups. The article cites examples from Thomas's judicial opinions, including his criticism of Brown v. Board of Education and his concurrence in the 2023 affirmative action decisions. The recent Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services decision, where the Court unanimously rejected a heightened evidentiary standard for majority-group plaintiffs in discrimination claims, is presented as evidence of Thomas's influence. </p>
