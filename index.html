          <p>A significant cyberattack has targeted Collins Aerospace, a major provider of airport software, causing widespread disruptions at several key European hubs, including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack on the company's Muse system, which manages passenger check-in and baggage handling, forced airlines to revert to manual processing, leading to long queues and numerous flight delays. Officials confirmed the "cyber-related disruption" and are working to resolve the issue, while national cybersecurity agencies are investigating the incident's full impact on air travel.</p>

The couple, who had lived in the country for decades running a charitable training program, were reunited with their family in Qatar before flying to London. While the Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws, no specific reason for their detention was ever disclosed, and their release was secured following negotiations brokered by Qatar.</p>

          <p>A massive overnight Russian aerial assault across Ukraine has resulted in at least three deaths and over thirty injuries, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The attacks, involving hundreds of drones and missiles, targeted multiple regions in what Zelensky described as a deliberate strategy to destroy infrastructure and intimidate civilians. In separate cross-border attacks, Ukraine claims to have successfully struck two major Russian oil refineries, while Russia reported civilian casualties from a Ukrainian drone strike in its Saratov region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, by exercising newly acquired "golden share" rights. These rights, a condition of the recent takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel, grant the White House veto power over major operational decisions like plant closures. After the company informed nearly 800 workers of the impending closure, the administration warned it would not be permitted, forcing U.S. Steel to reverse its decision and continue operations.

According to food industry analysts, three primary factors are driving this inflation: the Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods like coffee, the effects of climate change shifting agricultural production, and a domestic shortage of farm workers. These pressures lead to higher costs for producers, which are then passed on to consumers, sometimes through "shrinkflation," where package sizes are reduced while prices remain the same.

          <p>A 1,000-pound American bomb from World War II was discovered at a construction site in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay district, prompting the evacuation of thousands of residents from the densely populated area. Police bomb disposal experts worked for hours to safely defuse the nearly five-foot-long device. The discovery is a reminder of the city's history, as it was targeted by Allied air raids during the war when it was occupied by Japanese forces, and unexploded ordnance is still occasionally found.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic and unusual conclusion to the heptathlon at the World Championships in Tokyo, Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson shared the bronze medal with American Taliyah Brooks. Both athletes finished with an identical score of 6,581 points after the final 800m event, marking the first time a world medal has been split in the heptathlon. The emotional result continues a late-career resurgence for Johnson-Thompson, who secured her third consecutive major podium finish at the same stadium where she suffered a career-threatening injury during the Olympics four years ago.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will require companies to pay a new $100,000 annual fee for each H-1B visa applicant, a program for skilled foreign workers. The administration cited "abuse" of the program as the reason for the drastic fee increase, which is set to take effect imminently and will apply to new requests. The move has sparked concern among business groups and immigration lawyers, who argue it will price out small businesses and startups, hindering American competitiveness in attracting global talent.

          <p>This opinion column from the Los Angeles Times argues that the Trump administration's immigration policies, particularly widespread raids targeting laborers, have inadvertently strengthened the case for comprehensive immigration reform. The author contends that the economic disruption caused by these actions, such as labor shortages in agriculture and construction, demonstrates the country's reliance on immigrant workers. The piece notes that even some Republican lawmakers are now urging a shift in focus toward creating a functional work permit process rather than pursuing mass deportations.</p>
