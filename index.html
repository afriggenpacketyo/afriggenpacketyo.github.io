          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge during their Hong Kong trading debut, fueled by investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the burgeoning electric vehicle market. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, making it the largest global listing of 2025. CATL intends to allocate 90% of the raised funds to construct a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive giants like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen, reflecting Europe's pivotal role in CATL's global strategy given the slowing growth in China. The company faces increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, including potential tariffs and military watchlist designation, potentially complicating its U.S. operations.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has temporarily overshadowed internal Democratic discussions regarding the party's missteps during his presidency and the 2024 election. While many Democrats have expressed sympathy and support, the announcement has also ignited questions about the timing of the disclosure and the extent to which his health may have been concealed during his time in office. Former Representative Dean Phillips suggested that Biden strategically timed the announcement to deflect growing criticism from within the party, raising concerns about transparency and trust. The article delves into the complex reactions within the Democratic Party, highlighting the tension between genuine concern for Biden's health and lingering doubts about his leadership.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, faces charges of assaulting federal agents after a confrontation outside an immigration detention center in New Jersey. The charges stem from an incident where McIver and other Democratic members of the New Jersey congressional delegation visited the detention center. At the same time, charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested for trespassing during the same incident, were dropped. McIver has accused federal law enforcement of escalating the situation, calling the charges against her politically motivated and an attempt to criminalize legislative oversight. The article highlights the contrasting perspectives on the incident, with Democrats condemning the charges as an attempt to stifle opposition to the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>
