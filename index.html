          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and media personality Lauren SÃ¡nchez are celebrating their wedding in Venice, Italy, drawing a host of high-profile guests including Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, and Oprah Winfrey. The lavish festivities have reportedly included multiple events ahead of the main ceremony. However, the influx of celebrities and the extravagant nature of the event have sparked protests from some Venice locals. A campaign called "No Space for Bezos" has emerged, aligning with broader European sentiment against over-tourism and its impact on local costs and housing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court issued a significant 6-3 ruling that curtails the authority of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have frequently been used to block sweeping presidential policies. The decision stemmed from a case challenging former President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the citizenship order itself, the majority opinion, written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, concluded that such broad, universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable power that Congress has granted to the federal judiciary. In a sharp dissent, the court's liberal justices argued that the decision dangerously weakens judicial checks on executive overreach.</p>

          <p>A severe heatwave is gripping much of Europe, with temperatures expected to climb well above 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) in southern countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece. The extreme heat has exacerbated wildfires, particularly in Greece, where evacuations have been triggered south of Athens. Authorities across the continent have issued health warnings, advising residents to stay indoors during peak heat hours. Meteorologists note that such early and intense summer heatwaves are becoming more frequent, linking the trend to human-induced climate change, with statistics showing a significant increase in June heatwaves since 2000.</p>

          <p>A bison tragically died after stumbling and falling into the Grand Prismatic Spring at Yellowstone National Park in front of tourists. Witnesses reported that the animal appeared to step near the edge before the ground gave way, and it was unable to escape the scalding water, which reaches temperatures of around 192 degrees Fahrenheit. A park scientist noted that while such incidents are not unheard of, this one was unusual for happening in a highly touristed area during the day. The event serves as a stark reminder for visitors to stay on designated boardwalks and respect the park's wild nature.</p>

          <p>The effects of U.S. tariffs are becoming more apparent as distribution centers report an increase in re-ticketing products with higher prices and a reduction in overall inventory levels. According to ITS Logistics, price hikes of 8% to 15% are being applied to millions of units, from apparel to consumer goods, signaling growing inflation. Simultaneously, retailers are shrinking their inventory and SKU counts due to trade uncertainty and concerns about consumer spending. This caution is reflected in supply chain data, with warehouse levels down and forecasts for a milder holiday peak season. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sued Fox News for at least $787 million, alleging the network defamed him by falsely claiming he lied about a phone call with President Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware, centers on comments made by Fox News anchor Jesse Watters. Newsom's legal team stated the governor is willing to drop the suit if the network retracts the claim and issues a formal on-air apology. The requested damages mirror the amount Fox paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit. Fox News responded by calling the lawsuit a "frivolous publicity stunt designed to chill free speech."</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at $1.17 trillion, many households are exploring debt settlement as a relief option. This strategy involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than the total amount owed, but it becomes less effective for very large debts, typically over $100,000. For such high balances, creditors are more likely to pursue legal action, and the fees for settlement companies can become prohibitively expensive. The article suggests that debt settlement works best for unsecured debts between $7,500 and $75,000, and outlines alternatives like consolidation loans, credit counseling, and, in extreme cases, bankruptcy.

She believed that literature written for a specific community could still achieve universal appeal and greatness.

This shift marks a reversal from the post-pandemic "revenge spending" splurge, with consumers now focused on building emergency funds and cutting discretionary costs.

          <p>Marcus Monzo, 37, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 38 years for the murder of 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin in Hainault, east London. Monzo fatally attacked Anjorin with a samurai sword as the boy was walking to school and injured five other people during a 20-minute rampage in April of last year. During the trial, it was revealed that Monzo's actions were driven by psychosis induced by his long-term cannabis use. In a statement, Daniel's family said that while no sentence could bring back their son, they felt justice had been served.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated his government's welfare reforms have struck "the right balance" after making significant concessions following a rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The initial plan would have made it harder for individuals to claim Personal Independence Payment (Pip), but the stricter criteria will now only apply to new claimants. The government also reversed a planned freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit for existing recipients. Despite the changes, which are estimated to cost Â£3bn, some MPs on the left of the party still plan to vote against the bill.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, columnist Dave Schilling reflects on the necessity and fragility of rules in society, drawing a parallel between a pedestrian ignoring a crosswalk signal and international diplomacy. He argues that it is naive to expect actors, whether individuals or nations, to always follow established rules. Using the recent tensions between the U.S. and Iran as an example, he notes that the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal undermined the very framework meant to ensure stability. The author concludes that assuming the worst and expecting rules to be broken is a more realistic, if cynical, approach to navigating modern life.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has affirmed a Texas law requiring pornography websites to verify the age of their visitors, a decision with significant implications for online content regulation. In a 6-3 ruling, the court found the law constitutional, stating it serves the state's interest in protecting minors from sexually explicit material. The law requires sites with over one-third pornographic content to implement age-check systems using government-issued IDs or other transactional data. This ruling sets a precedent for similar laws in over a dozen other states, many of which have prompted major sites like Pornhub to block access in those regions.</p>

The data suggests that while inflation remains persistent, the full impact of the Trump administration's tariffs has not yet been felt across the economy. The report also revealed a 0.1% drop in consumer spending, the first decline since January, which economists attribute partly to consumers having purchased goods earlier to avoid tariffs.

          <p>The Supreme Court has announced it will postpone arguments regarding Louisiana's congressional redistricting plan until its next term, leaving the state's map in limbo. The case centers on whether the state's newly drawn map, which created a second majority-Black district, constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Louisiana's legislature redrew the map after lower courts found its previous one-Black-district plan likely violated the Voting Rights Act. However, a group of "non-African-American voters" challenged the new map, arguing race was an impermissibly dominant factor in its creation, leading to the current high-stakes legal battle.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of parents in Maryland who sought to opt their elementary school children out of instruction involving books with LGBTQ+ themes.

The ruling grants a preliminary injunction, requiring the school district to provide advance notice and allow students to be excused from these lessons.
