          <p>Rescue operations are ongoing in Central Texas following catastrophic flash floods that have claimed at least 121 lives. More than 170 people remain missing, with Kerr County being the most severely affected area. The disaster, which saw the Guadalupe River rise 26 feet in under an hour, devastated a girls' summer camp, resulting in numerous casualties among campers and staff. The federal government has declared a disaster, and scrutiny is growing over the adequacy of weather warnings and the potential impact of budget cuts to the National Weather Service.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media platform intentionally uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit its younger user base for commercial gain. This legal challenge is part of a broader trend where states are targeting the design and safety policies of tech companies rather than user-generated content. The ruling comes as TikTok's future in the U.S. remains uncertain amid a federal law requiring its parent company, ByteDance, to divest.</p>

The piece sardonically suggests that space exploration is no longer a national priority under the Trump administration, comparing the situation to undoing other achievements from the 1960s. The author questions whether a former reality-TV star is fit to lead the agency, while caustically noting that such leadership might be fitting for a NASA that is being systematically dismantled, leaving ambitious space travel to billionaires.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Philanthropist Bill Gates has condemned the Trump administration's decision to cut funding for international aid, calling the effects "devastating" but reversible. His comments follow the effective shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which was absorbed into the State Department, and reports of severe disruptions in the supply of critical medicines for HIV and other diseases in Africa. Gates, whose foundation has worked closely with USAID for years, emphasized that the abrupt cuts are interrupting life-saving programs. The administration has also signaled an end to its backing of the international vaccine group Gavi.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. As part of the plea deal, he admitted to running a major fentanyl trafficking operation within the Sinaloa cartel. In exchange for his plea, Guzman Lopez must provide "substantial assistance" to federal authorities, which could potentially lead to a sentence of less than life in prison. This cooperation may involve him testifying against other cartel members, including his own brother, who is also in U.S. custody.</p>

          <p>Prominent Los Angeles County leaders are pressuring the Whittier City Council to take immediate action in response to federal immigration raids that have heightened fear in the community. County Supervisor Janice Hahn, Assemblymember Lisa Calderón, and Congresswoman Linda Sánchez criticized the council for its delayed response to the enforcement actions. A proposed ordinance would require ICE agents to wear official identification and remove masks during operations in the city. However, the council has postponed a decision for a month to study the measure's feasibility, a delay that critics and residents argue fails to address the community's urgent concerns.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Noah Lyles secured a significant victory in the men's 200m at the Diamond League meet in Monaco, defeating reigning Olympic champion Letsile Tebogo of Botswana. Lyles, who had been recovering from COVID-19 when he placed third behind Tebogo at last year's Olympics, finished the race with a time of 19.88 seconds. The win was particularly impressive as it was Lyles' first 200m race of the season, and he faced Tebogo who had recently set a world-leading time. The result demonstrates that Lyles remains a top contender in the event.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods if President Trump proceeds with a threatened 50% tariff. Trump's threat was explicitly linked to the criminal trial of his political ally and former Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, which he labeled a "witch hunt." President Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will invoke its reciprocity law, escalating the risk of a trade war. The move by the U.S. has been criticized as an attempt to use trade policy to interfere in another nation's judicial and political affairs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has sharply criticized the Trump administration's Department of Justice for its conduct in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis stated that the government's evidence was "not credible" and accused it of stonewalling the court. The case centers on whether the government will attempt to deport Abrego Garcia again if he is released from criminal custody in Tennessee. The judge expressed "grave concerns" after a government witness admitted to having no personal knowledge of the case, despite a court order to produce an informed official.</p>

          <p>In an essay for The Atlantic, a writer reflects on the profound cultural significance of Camp Mystic, the Texas girls' camp devastated by recent floods, and the nature of faith in the face of tragedy. The 99-year-old Christian camp is described as a revered institution in Texas society, a place where generations of girls formed unbreakable bonds and felt free from worldly pressures. The author explores the deep sense of community and shared identity among "Mystic Girls," contrasting the camp's idyllic image with the horrific reality of the flood that claimed the lives of at least 27 campers and counselors, forcing a difficult confrontation with faith.</p>

Critics argue that these weapons are being used indiscriminately against peaceful crowds, contrary to regulations that restrict their use to situations involving immediate threats.

Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue the indiscriminate cuts will undermine U.S. national security and diplomatic efforts.
