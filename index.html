          <p>Junto Nakatani defeated Ryosuke Nishida by technical knockout in the seventh round of their bantamweight title unification bout at Tokyo's Ariake Colosseum, adding the IBF belt to his WBC title. Nishida dislocated his right shoulder, preventing him from continuing the match. Nakatani, who has been primarily based in the United States since junior high school, expressed happiness and confidence after unifying the titles. The victory improved Nakatani's professional record to 31-0, while Nishida suffered his first defeat, falling to 10-1. The two boxers had an intense exchange from the beginning, with Naoya "Monster" Inoue observing from ringside, and Inoue and Nakatani have verbally agreed to fight each other next spring in what would be one of the most intriguing all-Japanese matchups in boxing history. Earlier in the day, Tenshin Nasukawa, a former kickboxing star, won against Victor Santillan by unanimous decision, and Nasukawa now plans to compete for a world title in his subsequent match. The boxing match score is now final.</p>

          <p>Carla Hayden, former Librarian of Congress, shared details about her unexpected termination via email by the Trump administration after serving nearly ten years. Hayden, the first woman and first Black person in the role, stated she received no prior notification or subsequent communication from the White House regarding the decision. She speculates her firing might be linked to a broader effort by the Trump administration to reduce public access to information, particularly concerning diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Hayden's supporters held a town hall meeting to protest her dismissal, emphasizing the importance of the freedom to read and learn. She also highlighted that the Library of Congress primarily fulfills research requests from members of Congress, rather than serving as a public lending library.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to ongoing immigration protests, following clashes between demonstrators and federal agents. The White House cited attacks on ICE officers and federal agents as the reason for the deployment, while Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and unnecessary. Defense Secretary Hegseth threatened to mobilize U.S. Marines if the violence continues, escalating the situation. Trump praised the National Guard's actions on Truth Social before the troops officially arrived, and Newsom condemned the federal government's takeover of the California National Guard as a spectacle.</p>

          <p>The US National Guard, a component of the US Armed Forces Reserve, is typically deployed for disaster relief but can also be used for internal security and supporting military operations abroad. President Trump has deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles amidst protests against the deportation of illegal immigrants, overriding the authority of California Governor Newsom. The governor criticized the deployment, accusing the government of deliberately inflaming tensions. The National Guard consists of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, with approximately 419,000 reservists serving as of 2023, and the governor of a state usually assumes command when reservists are deployed inside the US states, while the US president is the commander-in-chief when deployed nationwide.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion piece criticizes CNN's airing of "Good Night and Good Luck," arguing that the network is portraying itself as heroic journalists fighting against a McCarthy-esque President Trump. The author accuses CNN and other liberal media outlets of fostering a fake Russian collusion story during Trump's first term and ignoring President Biden's unfitness for office. The piece also criticizes George Clooney for allegedly lying about Biden's fitness, claiming that any lie is justifiable to these people as long as it hurts Donald Trump. The author concludes that CNN has learned nothing from its past lies and remains an unreliable source of news.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that the Trump administration's deportation program receives positive net approval, particularly from Republicans, but views are divided based on the perceived targets of the program. Support is high among those who believe the program prioritizes dangerous criminals, but it drops significantly if people think it targets non-criminals. Half of Americans feel Trump is deporting more people than expected, and most in this group disapprove of the program, believing potential deportees deserve due process. While more Americans believe the program enhances safety, a larger share thinks it will weaken the economy, and the poll also shows that views on the economic impact are connected to broader opinions about immigrants and new tariffs in general remain net negative. The poll also suggests that most Americans think Trump is trying to help U.S. manufacturing and business with tariffs.</p>

          <p>The article critiques America's fascination with narratives of powerful men, arguing it leads to the acceptance of flawed figures and unjust systems. It references the WeWork and Fyre Festival scandals as examples of how the tech industry attracts con artists and rewards those who perpetuate myths of temperamental genius. The author critiques Aaron Sorkin's portrayals of figures like Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs, arguing they romanticize ruthlessness and downplay the negative consequences of their actions. The piece further connects this trend to American history, suggesting that the romanticized story of the founding fathers hinders progress and perpetuates inequality, and it also examines Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical Hamilton as a perpetuation of narratives by white men about white men.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has proposed four core principles as a framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea, aiming to transform the region into one of peace and cooperation. These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through rules-based co-management, achieving mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposing interference from external forces. China formally presented its cooperation blueprint in 2002 through an agreement with Asean, but its expansive claims over the waters are contested by several member states, including Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels have become more frequent since 2023, particularly near Scarborough Shoal, Second Thomas Shoal, and Sandy Cay coral reef.</p>

Peter Kyle stated that every sector of society is struggling and that while spending will increase for schools and scientific research, a squeeze on policing isn't ruled out. Conservative Chris Philp expressed concern over potential police number cuts and urged the government to protect their budget. Five police chiefs previously warned that years of cuts have left forces with outdated technology, and further cuts would bake in structural inefficiencies.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused John Swinney of running a "dishonest and disgraceful" campaign ahead of the Holyrood by-election, claiming the SNP pushed voters toward Reform UK. Swinney defended his "two-horse race" remark, citing Labour's vote share collapse and a surge for Reform in his party's data. Labour's Davy Russell won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse seat unexpectedly, defeating the SNP. Swinney indicated he would consider a cabinet reshuffle following the defeat, and Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice hailed the result as a "massive boost" for his party going into the May 2026 vote.</p>

This incident is the latest to occur near aid distribution points set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is supported by Israel and the US. The IDF stated they are aware of the reports of injuries but that the number does not align with their information. The Israeli army has declared that Palestinians should only move to and from the GHF distribution sites between 06:00 and 18:00 local time, considering it an "active combat zone" at all other times.</p>

          <p>California Governor Newsom has criticized the potential deployment of US Marines in his state as “deranged,” following a threat from the Secretary of Defense to use such troops amid immigration protests. The protests erupted after immigration raids in Los Angeles, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Trump promised to send in the National Guard, a move Newsom confirmed, stating the federal government was “moving to take over” the state’s National Guard. Newsom added that the mobilization was “purposefully inflammatory” and would “escalate tensions,” while Trump praised the National Guard's actions despite no evidence of their deployment.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on how China's historical fear of American conspiracies aimed at subverting the Communist Party through peaceful means has diminished under President Trump. The author recalls being taught from a young age to be vigilant against the dangers of "peaceful evolution," a strategy promoted by John Foster Dulles to undermine socialist countries by promoting Western values. Now, China has emerged as a major economic power, while the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts and lecturing other countries on governance. The author posits that Trump's policies have inadvertently reduced China's concerns about American subversion.</p>

          <p>The poem “Under a Supermoon” reflects on finding joy in the minutiae of life, such as the gold flare in cottonwood leaves and the smell of split piñon and juniper. The speaker contrasts these simple pleasures with the desire for grander experiences, such as twirling in space or exploring the Mariana Trench. The poem references Blake's idea that persistence in folly leads to wisdom, and it suggests that the speaker has persevered and caught a glimpse of how life has both exploded and given birth to stars within. The poem explores themes of contentment, perseverance, and the beauty of everyday existence.</p>

The advice emphasizes the importance of open communication and clearly stating one's desires, drawing on Erich Fromm's philosophy that love is an active striving for the other's flourishing, rooted in freedom. The column cautions against both masochistic and sadistic love, advising the reader not to pretend to be open to non-monogamy if it threatens her well-being. It suggests addressing insecurities within the current relationship and setting boundaries, such as asking the husband to cool it with the colleague he's attracted to, and working on interpersonal and intrapersonal skills before revisiting the topic.</p>

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, were forced to take a bus to their final destination after their plane was diverted to Rome because it was too large to land in Naples. The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was rerouted to Rome Fiumicino Airport due to operational limitations, and passengers were then bused to Naples, a three-hour journey. American Airlines apologized for the disruption, noting that they usually fly a smaller Boeing 787-8 to Naples. The incident caused inconvenience for travelers who had anticipated arriving directly at their destination.</p>

The book also criticizes George HW Bush and Mitt Romney, and it claims Trump sides with the legacies of Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and Gingrich himself. Gingrich expresses faux nostalgia for bipartisan reforms with Bill Clinton, and he also discusses differences with Trump on Iran and immigration.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's goal to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to hire skilled workers fast enough. The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic in the U.S. is 54, with 40% over 60, and the country will be short 25,000 technicians by 2028. Companies like GE Aerospace are ramping up hiring and offering on-the-job training, with base pay averaging between $80,000 and $90,000 a year, but hiring remains difficult. The impending worker shortages aren't just for those who repair aircraft and engines, as a shortfall of air traffic controllers has also stifled airline growth and raised safety concerns.</p>

          <p>The article explores the story of the Chongqing Dockers, an American football team in China, and how it became a symbol of U.S.-China relations. What began as a story about transcending cultural boundaries through sports has turned into a symbol of just how little China and the U.S. understand each other—and how little interest they have in trying. A Chinese studio lifted the idea of the story for a sports comedy called Clash. The original article about the Dockers, titled “Year of the Pigskin,” was natural Hollywood bait: a tale of cross-cultural teamwork featuring a fish-out-of-water American protagonist. The article also discusses how Hollywood's relationship with China has changed over the past decade, with China now producing its own big-budget triumphs and no longer needing to rely on the U.S.</p>

          <p>The article examines Barack Obama's post-presidency activities, contrasting his carefully curated public image with the urgency of the Trump era. While Trump has implemented democracy-shaking policies, Obama has largely remained above the fray, engaging in activities like visiting King Harald V in Norway and recommending books and films. The author questions whether Obama's detachment is incongruous with the desperation of his admirers, given Trump's assaults on Obama's achievements. Despite remaining the most popular Democrat, Obama's minimal communication and focus on celebrity have drawn criticism, with some arguing he is squandering his power and influence at a critical time for the country.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk over Trump’s signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, arguing that the public is the most likely loser. While both men criticize the bill, their criticisms are, in their own ways, at least partially valid, but neither opposes the bill for what makes it a monstrosity: that it redistributes taxpayer dollars to the richest people in the country by slashing benefits for the middle class, the poor, and everyone in between. The article highlights that the bill would make the largest cuts to food assistance and Medicaid in history, while offering significant tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, and whatever meager benefits there are to everyone else would likely be eaten up by the increase in the cost of food and health care caused by the benefit cuts. Despite their public disagreements, Trump and Musk are both fine with taking from those who have little and giving generously to those who have more than they could ever need.</p>

Joe suggests limiting oneself to physical attributes lessens opportunities to find a partner, while Matt Heal feels desensitized about dating apps due to preferences for taller men. Beth McColl thinks the filter may offer shorter men reassurance by helping them avoid women who only want to date really tall men, but the real problem of modern dating lies with the apps themselves, encouraging users to treat dating like picking something from the menu.</p>

Experts predict that the cuts could increase average student debt by about $6,500 among bachelor's degree recipients who received Pell Grants. Already, those grants have not kept up with the rising cost of a four-year degree, and the Congressional Budget Office projects a shortfall this year due to more students qualifying for Pell Grants.</p>

          <p>A network of women in Latin America transformed safe, self-managed abortions by sharing information about misoprostol, a drug used for at-home abortions. Activists connected the dots: If women could get their hands on misoprostol, they could end their pregnancies despite the severe legal restrictions on abortion most Latin American countries had. It began with whispers at a feminist gathering in Argentina in 1990, eventually leading to the establishment of hotlines and accompaniment networks. The activists created a step-by-step manual on how to have an abortion with pills and used a model of care called acompañamiento (accompaniment), helping women use misoprostol to have safe abortions despite the legal restrictions.</p>
