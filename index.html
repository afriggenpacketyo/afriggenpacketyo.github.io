        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against President Trump's proclamation seeking to bar Harvard University's international students. Judge Allison Burroughs stated the policy risks causing "immediate and irreparable injury". Harvard had sued to block the proclamation, arguing it violates the First Amendment and is retaliatory. The judge previously blocked a similar Trump administration plan to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students, deeming both actions unlawful and retaliatory for Harvard's exercising its First Amendment rights. Optimism is somewhat tempered due to the ongoing legal battles and the potential impact on international students.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders in many states are denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention while awaiting trial, unlike adults who receive credit for time served. This practice extends the duration of confinement for young people, negatively impacting their rehabilitation and straining taxpayer resources. Policy experts argue that the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation has inadvertently led to fewer constitutional protections for minors. The article highlights the need for reforms to ensure fair treatment and access to rehabilitative services for young offenders.</p>
