          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack, has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple state charges, including attempted first-degree murder, after allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at a pro-Israel demonstration, injuring 12 people. According to court documents, Soliman admitted to researching how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube and purchasing the necessary ingredients. He allegedly told police he wanted to kill all Zionist people and expressed no remorse, stating he would repeat the attack. Soliman, who is in the United States illegally, had been planning the attack for a year, waiting until his daughter's high school graduation to carry it out.</p>

          <p>The State Department has directed U.S. embassies and consulates to increase vetting for all visa applicants intending to visit Harvard University, including students, faculty, and tourists, to identify individuals with histories of anti-Semitic harassment and violence. Consular officers are instructed to thoroughly screen applicants' online presence and consider the absence of an online presence as a potential sign of evasiveness. This new vetting procedure, prompted by executive orders targeting visa vetting and antisemitism, will serve as a pilot program for broader visa applicant screening. The Trump administration accuses Harvard of failing to maintain a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism, leading to the stricter measures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration remains confident that the Alaska LNG project, a massive liquified natural gas initiative, will attract investors despite its $40 billion price tag. President Trump has been advocating for Alaska LNG as a national priority, envisioning an 800-mile pipeline from the North Slope to the Cook Inlet. Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes that securing commercial offtakers will facilitate financing, suggesting that countries seeking to reduce their trade deficit with the U.S. could invest in American energy. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum mentioned that the Department of Defense is prepared to support the project by signing an offtake agreement to supply gas to strategic bases in Alaska.

          <p>The Department of Justice has demanded that California's public high schools confirm by next week that they do not allow transgender athletes to compete in girls’ sports, escalating a federal inquiry into the state over its compliance with Title IX. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon stated that school districts must certify in writing by June 9 that they will not abide by the California Interscholastic Federation’s gender identity rules. Dhillon argues that knowingly depriving female students of athletic opportunities based on their sex would constitute unconstitutional sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause. This demand pits public school districts against the California Interscholastic Federation, which requires its members to recognize gender identity in sports.</p>

The plot was part of a larger, multi-year operation to silence Grozev, orchestrated by the Kremlin after Grozev identified agents behind the poisoning of Aleksei Navalny.

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has described Mexico’s judicial elections as “extraordinary” despite a turnout of less than 13% of eligible voters. The low participation rate is seen as an embarrassing setback for the ruling party, Morena, despite Sheinbaum's landslide victory in last year's national elections. Experts attribute the low turnout to the election being an off-year election, the convoluted balloting process, and the obscurity of the candidates. Despite the low turnout and criticisms from opponents, the election is expected to reinforce Morena's power and give President Sheinbaum greater control over the government.</p>

This marks one of the lowest turnouts in any federal election since Mexico transitioned to a democracy. The election, championed by President Claudia Sheinbaum, aimed to fill federal judge positions, but the lack of participation has been attributed to the election being an off-year election, a new and convoluted balloting process, and the relative anonymity of the candidates.

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) outposts in California, following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The decision came after lawmakers argued that closing the offices would negatively impact the USDA’s ability to support farmers, essential to California’s agricultural success. The closures were initially part of a broader effort led by the unofficial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cut costs across government agencies. The USDA offices provide farmers with access to loans, grants, technical assistance, and in-person meetings with USDA staff.</p>

          <p>A runway at Newark Liberty International Airport has reopened nearly two weeks ahead of schedule after undergoing renovations, which is expected to alleviate congestion at the airport. The temporary closure of runway 4L-22R had left only two other runways operational, prompting the FAA to set limits on flight arrivals and departures. The Port Authority accelerated the construction schedule by hiring additional crews and coordinating with contractors to expedite timelines. The runway was milled and paved, and outfitted with updated lighting and airfield signs, with further closures expected on weeknights and weekends to fully complete the project by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Senators are intensifying calls for a severe Russia sanctions bill to move forward, with Senator Lindsey Graham claiming the Senate will address legislation this week that would impose strict tariffs on Moscow. The bill proposes a 500% tariff on any country that buys Moscow's energy products, aiming to cripple Russia's war machine. Senator Graham coordinated with the White House on the "Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025," which has bipartisan support and aims to isolate Russia economically. Other senators, including Chuck Grassley and John Fetterman, have voiced their support for strong sanctions against Russia.</p>

Experts advise borrowers to explore debt relief options, such as credit card debt forgiveness, debt consolidation loans, or balance transfer credit cards, to manage their debt.
