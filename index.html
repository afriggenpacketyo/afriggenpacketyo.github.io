          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 02:35:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung has indicated he would support a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un to freeze North Korea's nuclear weapons production as an "interim emergency measure." Lee believes this is a feasible, realistic alternative to immediate denuclearization, considering North Korea's current rate of producing 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually. He aims to reduce tensions and restore trust with the North, suggesting that a resumption of talks between Trump and Kim, who share a degree of mutual trust, could benefit global peace and security. The article highlights Lee's pragmatic approach to foreign policy, balancing relations between the US and China while navigating a polarized domestic political scene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom, along with Canada, Australia, and Portugal, has officially recognized Palestinian statehood, marking a pivotal shift in international policy. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper explicitly cautioned Israel against retaliating by annexing parts of the West Bank, asserting that this decision is crucial for fostering peace, justice, and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the move as rewarding terrorism, the UK government emphasized that Hamas would have no future role in a Palestinian state. This recognition comes amidst dire reports from the UN on alleged genocide and famine in Gaza, highlighting the pressing need for a viable two-state solution.</p>

          <p>The Philippines is experiencing significant disruption as Super Typhoon Ragasa, featuring sustained winds of up to 215 kph and gusts of 265 kph, rapidly approaches northern Luzon. Authorities have commenced extensive evacuations in vulnerable coastal and low-lying regions, leading to the closure of schools and government offices across 29 provinces, including the capital, Manila. The remote Babuyan Islands are under the highest typhoon warning, with landfall expected around midday. Officials are warning of severe flooding, landslides, and widespread power outages, while Hong Kong is also preparing for the storm's advance by suspending all passenger flights for 36 hours.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for a mixed opening as investors closely monitor the implications of U.S. President Donald Trump's recent H-1B visa policy. The Trump administration unexpectedly signed an order to increase the H-1B application fee to $100,000, effective Sunday, for new employees. This move, framed as an effort to safeguard American jobs, has created uncertainty for major tech companies that depend on H-1B visas to recruit highly skilled personnel from nations such as India and China. India has already voiced strong opposition, warning of potential "humanitarian consequences" due to family disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands convened at State Farm Stadium in Arizona to commemorate conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot on September 10. President Donald Trump and prominent conservative figures lauded Kirk as a "martyr" for American freedom and a "warrior" for the MAGA movement, highlighting his profound impact. His widow, Erika Kirk, delivered a poignant speech, declaring her forgiveness for the alleged shooter and asserting that "the answer to hate is not hate." The service, which intertwined political rhetoric with religious fervor, underscored Kirk's lasting influence and served as a rallying cry for his movement to persist.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the intricate relationship between the birth control pill and women's libido, highlighting a frequently unaddressed side effect. While the pill has revolutionized sexual autonomy, numerous women report experiencing decreased sex drive, vaginal dryness, or emotional fluctuations. Scientific inquiry suggests that the pill may elevate levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which in turn binds to and reduces free testosterone, a key hormone for sexual desire. Nevertheless, the effect is highly individual; some women report no change or even an increase in libido due to the psychological relief from pregnancy concerns. The article stresses the importance of enhanced awareness and open dialogue surrounding women's reproductive health and contraceptive choices.</p>

          <p>Former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg voiced strong criticism regarding the UK government's perceived deference to US President Donald Trump, describing the "endless knee-bending" as "slightly cringey." Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg implored Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to assert British values and openly challenge the Trump administration on matters such as its lukewarm attitude towards NATO. He contended that the government's strategy to court the US president, particularly for a trade deal, is founded on a "miscalculation" that the UK can avoid choosing between its relationships with the US and the EU. Clegg also expressed support for Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey's condemnation of Elon Musk's recent controversial remarks.</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has officially approved the £2.2 billion privately-financed project to develop a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a move intended to stimulate economic growth. This expansion entails shifting the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters for regular operation, projected to increase annual flights from 280,000 to approximately 389,000 and passenger capacity to 80 million. While the Chancellor lauded the plans for generating thousands of jobs and billions in investment, the initiative faces significant opposition from climate campaigners and the Green Party, who decry it as a "disaster for the climate crisis."

This policy is expected to lead to labor shortages in critical US sectors, incentivize offshoring, and deter Indian students from pursuing education in the US.

          <p>A new report reveals that global leaders are planning to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than is consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius, despite commitments under the Paris Agreement. The 2025 Production Gap Report indicates that the 20 most polluting countries, including China and the U.S., plan to increase fossil fuel production. China is a major contributor to this rise, particularly with slower reductions in coal production. The article notes that while the report uses data from the Biden administration, potential Trump administration policies could further exacerbate the issue by boosting U.S. fossil fuel output.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimates that recent U.S. tariffs could slash up to one-fifth of Vietnam's exports to the United States, amounting to over $25 billion. Vietnam, the world's sixth-largest exporter to the U.S., is projected to be the worst-hit country in Southeast Asia. Initial data after the August 7 tariffs show a 2% drop in Vietnam's overall U.S. exports and a 5.5% decline in footwear exports. The World Bank has already revised down Vietnam's growth forecasts, and while exporters may absorb some costs, the economic impact could be significant, potentially shaving 5% off Vietnam's GDP.
