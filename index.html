          <h2>Turkey Faces Rising Obesity Rates Linked to Poverty and Unhealthy Food</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey is experiencing a sharp increase in obesity, ranking first in Europe for overweight and obese individuals. Experts attribute this rise to factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and the consumption of highly processed foods. High food price inflation reduces citizens' purchasing power, leading to reliance on cheap, sugary snacks and soft drinks. While the Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to combat obesity, critics argue that it stigmatizes overweight individuals and overlooks broader economic struggles, as healthy foods remain expensive and inaccessible for low-income households. A nationwide free school meal program is suggested as a solution, but the government has yet to take action. Optimism surrounding the health of the Turkish people is relatively low given the circumstances. </p>

          <p>A highway bridge collapsed onto railway tracks in the Bryansk region of Russia, near the Ukraine border, resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries. Several heavy trucks fell onto a moving passenger train as the bridge collapsed, leading to mangled carriages and a fire. Moscow Railway alleged the bridge collapsed "as a result of illegal interference in transport operations." Hours later, a second bridge also collapsed along the Trosna-Kalinovka highway in the Kursk region, injuring a train driver and causing a fire. Rescue operations are underway as investigations into the incidents have been launched.</p>

A strategic defence review will outline the "immediate and pressing" danger posed by Russia and other countries, including China.

The Defence Secretary stated that the increased investment is a message to Moscow about Britain's readiness to fight if required, aiming to deter future conflicts.</p>

          <p>Hamas is seeking amendments to the latest U.S. ceasefire proposal for Gaza, but a U.S. envoy has called the response "totally unacceptable." The proposed amendments focus on U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, aid delivery, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Meanwhile, desperation grows among Palestinians in Gaza due to hunger and the ongoing conflict, with reports of food trucks being blocked and offloaded by civilians. Israeli strikes continue across Gaza, resulting in numerous casualties, as efforts to negotiate a ceasefire remain stalled.</p>

          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, supports the new Olympic age limit of 14 and older, despite its potential impact on medal prospects. World Skate's decision aims to reduce severe injuries among young skateboarders attempting increasingly difficult tricks. Japan's street skateboarding head coach, Daisuke Hayakawa, endorsed the restriction, citing concerns about physical immaturity and skill development. While Japan will adhere to the Olympic age limit, domestic competitions may remain open to younger participants, focusing on nurturing talent and promoting the culture of skateboarding.</p>
