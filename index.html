        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation restricting travel from twelve countries due to national security concerns, with full restrictions imposed on Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Partial restrictions will affect Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Trump stated that he is committed to working with countries willing to improve information sharing and address security risks. This action follows Trump's previous travel ban during his first term, which faced legal challenges before a revised version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. The new ban was spurred by an attack on a Jewish protest in Colorado that authorities blamed on a man they said was in the country illegally. The goal is to protect national security and national interests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and the White House counsel to investigate whether the Biden administration conspired to cover up Joe Biden's mental state while in office. Biden responded, calling the investigation a "mere distraction" and defending his decision-making ability during his presidency. He asserted that any suggestion he wasn't in control is "ridiculous and false," while accusing Trump of attempting to divert attention from disastrous legislation. The White House stated the investigation will focus on the circumstances surrounding Biden's execution of executive actions during his final years in office, going beyond a review of Biden's last-minute pardons. The probe represents a significant escalation in political tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation blocking foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University for at least six months, citing the institution's alleged untrustworthiness. The proclamation invokes the Immigration and Nationality Act and directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking visas of foreign students already in the U.S. to study at Harvard. Trump claims Harvard has refused to provide information about international students, has extensive foreign entanglements, and has discriminated in its admissions practices. This action follows a previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvard‚Äôs Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which was blocked by a federal judge.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's parliament has suspended three MƒÅori MPs for performing a haka during a parliamentary sitting last year in protest of a bill seeking to redefine the country's founding treaty with MƒÅori people. Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke was suspended for seven days, while Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer received 21-day suspensions. The parliamentary committee ruled the haka could have "intimidated" other lawmakers, but Ngarewa-Packer stated they were being "punished for being MƒÅori." The incident sparked debate about free speech and cultural expression within the government.</p>

          <p>A recent ARD Deutschlandtrend survey indicates a decline in German voter trust in the United States and Israel as reliable partners, while France and Ukraine are seen as more dependable. The survey found that 73% of respondents believe the U.S. is no longer reliable, and only 16% still consider Israel a trustworthy partner, an 11% drop since October 2024. This shift reflects criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza, with 63% of respondents stating the actions have gone too far. Despite these shifts, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has gained popularity since taking office, with 39% expressing satisfaction with his work.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a warning to women using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, to use effective contraception. The MHRA states it is unknown whether these medicines could harm an unborn baby and that they may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill in overweight or obese women. The regulator advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a specific period afterward before trying to become pregnant. The agency is concerned that the popularity of these drugs means many women are not using them safely or receiving proper advice.</p>

While the AES100 differs from the jet engines used in commercial aircraft, Chinese experts consider its development a major advancement for the country's aviation sector.

It is important to ensure that the policy limit would cover the cost of rebuilding the home, and to assess whether flood insurance is needed, as floods are generally not covered by standard homeowner's insurance.</p>

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been released worldwide, with stores opening at midnight to accommodate eager fans, though one supplier, Game, cancelled some pre-orders. The console is a hybrid device that can be used as a handheld or plugged into a TV, featuring a bigger and brighter screen, more power, and increased storage. Despite the excitement, questions remain about whether the Switch 2 will match the success of its predecessor, partly due to the high price of games, such as Mario Kart World, which costs ¬£74.99. The original Nintendo Switch has sold over 150 million units since its 2017 release.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand Parliament has voted to suspend three lawmakers for performing a haka during a debate on Indigenous rights, with two MPs suspended for 21 days and one for seven days, marking the longest suspensions in the country's parliamentary history. The incident occurred last November during a debate on a bill that would have rewritten a treaty between the British crown and Indigenous Maori tribal leaders. The parliamentary privileges committee recommended the suspensions, stating the haka could have intimidated other members of the house. The lawmakers argue the suspension is an effort to silence Maori voices in Parliament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emergency experts are expressing concern that recent progress at FEMA to address long-standing issues of inequitable disaster relief is in jeopardy due to the Trump administration's program cuts and staff reductions. Under the Biden administration, FEMA took steps to simplify forms, loosen residency requirements, and provide immediate assistance, but some of these efforts have been canceled. President Trump has moved to eliminate equity programs and the agency has cut billions of dollars in programs and lost hundreds of staff. Chauncia Willis-Johnson, former emergency manager for Tampa, Fla., notes that the agency has not only stopped making progress, but has regressed.</p>

          <p>A Chinese man detained in connection with the murders of two Japanese nationals in Dalian, China, allegedly had a financial dispute with the victims, who were his business partners. The suspect, Yuan Chenggong, believed he was deceived by the two Japanese men regarding the purchase of a hot spring hotel near Mt. Fuji. Yuan, who founded a real estate company in Tokyo in 2021, may have also failed to pay his partners, leading to the conflict. The two Japanese victims were killed on May 23 in a Dalian village.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss trade disputes, the war in Ukraine, and NATO spending. Given trade tensions and the fact that Germany counts the U.S. as its biggest trading partner, Merz is expected to seek room for negotiation on tariffs and express support for a EU-US trade deal. The Russia-Ukraine war will also be a key topic, with Merz likely to reiterate Germany's support for Ukraine and the need for European involvement in peace negotiations. Merz will also aim to reassure Trump that Germany is increasing its defense spending to meet NATO obligations.</p>

This change is expected to make an additional 500,000 pupils eligible, saving parents ¬£500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the initiative up to 2029, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stating the changes align with her "moral mission" to reduce child poverty. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) notes that while the change will reduce child poverty, other measures may be more cost-effective.</p>

          <p>Divorce lawyers report that their business is seasonal, with filings peaking in late summer and early spring. A University of Washington study supports this, attributing the trend to a "domestic ritual" calendar tied to holidays. While some experts suggest sentimental reasons delay filings, others point to the end of tax season and family vacations. Data from the CDC shows the overall number of divorces in the U.S. has been declining, while "gray divorces" among those over 50 have increased, often initiated by women with financial independence.</p>
