          <p>Virginia Giuffre's family is publicly calling for Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, to be stripped of her royal title. This demand follows the emergence of a 2011 email where Ferguson referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a 'supreme friend,' leading seven charities to sever ties with her. A spokesperson for the duchess claimed the email was sent under duress to prevent a defamation lawsuit from Epstein, adding that she regrets her association with him. Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault and died by suicide in April, has consistently been at the center of the scandal involving the Royal Family and Epstein.</p>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power in Africa through government-run Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture across 49 countries. While these institutes offer scholarships and opportunities for locals, critics argue they serve Beijing's economic and political interests, potentially indoctrinating students and interfering with academic freedom. Social scientists suggest this cultural push is linked to securing access to Africa's natural resources, like lithium and cobalt. Despite the growing number of African students learning Mandarin, job prospects in China remain limited, with many graduates becoming language teachers themselves, perpetuating the cycle of Chinese influence on the continent.</p>

          <p>Sir Menzies Campbell, a distinguished figure in British politics and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, has passed away at the age of 84. Known affectionately as Ming, he served as the Member of Parliament for North East Fife for 28 years and led his party from 2006 to 2007. Before his political career, Campbell was an accomplished sprinter who held the UK 100m record and competed in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. He was a respected voice in foreign affairs, notably as a critic of the Iraq war, and later became a member of the House of Lords in 2015.</p>

          <p>A submersible expedition in Germany's Luebeck Bay has discovered that unexploded Nazi-era bombs, including V-1 cruise missiles, are now serving as thriving habitats for marine life. Scientists were astonished to find dense populations of animals, such as marine worms, crabs, and fish, covering the munitions on the seafloor. In a particularly unusual observation, over 40 starfish were found clustered on an exposed block of TNT, a highly toxic explosive. This phenomenon highlights nature's ability to adapt and utilize man-made objects, turning instruments of destruction into artificial reefs that support biodiversity in areas where natural hard surfaces have been removed.</p>

          <h2>Oshkosh Commercial Property Owners May Face Tax Increases After 22% Valuation Spike</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 06:05:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Business owners in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, are facing potential property tax increases following a revaluation that raised the average value of commercial properties by 22%. This adjustment was mandated after the Department of Revenue found that commercial lots were assessed at only 85% of their full market value, placing an unfair tax burden on homeowners. The final impact on taxes will depend on the mill rate set in the upcoming city budget, which could decrease due to the larger overall tax base. City officials are also exploring other revenue sources, like a sales tax, to reduce overreliance on property taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coordinated sting operation by Interpol across 14 African countries has resulted in the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of running extensive cybercrime networks. The operation targeted romance scams and 'sextortion' schemes, where criminals use social media and other digital platforms to defraud and blackmail victims. Authorities identified over 1,400 victims who collectively lost an estimated $2.8 million. The crackdown, which took place between July and August, led to the seizure of electronic devices and forged documents, dismantling 81 cybercrime groups. Officials noted a sharp increase in such digitally-enabled crimes, which cause significant financial and psychological harm to vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>A potential U.S. government shutdown appears increasingly likely as congressional Democrats and the Trump administration remain locked in a political standoff over funding. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is refusing to approve funding without key concessions, while President Trump seems to view a shutdown as a strategic advantage rather than a crisis. Democrats are attempting to frame the conflict around protecting healthcare subsidies, but this multifaceted message may struggle against a simpler Republican narrative blaming Democratic obstruction. With neither side willing to back down, the columnist suggests that a shutdown, while disruptive and costly, seems almost inevitable given the current political climate.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris recounts her frustration with the Biden campaign's response to the president's disastrous June 2024 debate performance against Donald Trump. According to the book, she was given talking points declaring "JOE BIDEN WON" and was expected to defend his performance, which she found disingenuous. Harris describes throwing the paper on the table and telling staff, "Don’t feed me bulls--t. Everyone saw what they saw." The memoir details how Biden stumbled over words and lost his train of thought, particularly in a confusing statement about Medicare, which Harris viewed as a devastating blow to the campaign.</p>

          <p>As global trade tensions rise, particularly with the United States, Beijing has developed a range of policy tools to protect its domestic industries and retaliate against perceived unfair practices. Beyond standard anti-dumping investigations, China utilizes an "Unreliable Entity List" to target foreign companies deemed a threat to its national interests, imposing trade and investment restrictions. Another key measure involves strict export controls on dual-use items, which are goods that have both civilian and potential military applications. These policies allow China to exert significant economic leverage and respond forcefully to actions like the substantial import duties levied by the Trump administration, demonstrating a strategic and assertive trade posture.</p>

          <p>The number of deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody has reached at least 16 since January, a significant increase compared to previous years. This spike coincides with a record number of people being held in detention, which surpassed 60,000 in August. The rising death toll has alarmed immigration advocates and lawmakers, who point to what they call "horrendous" conditions within the facilities. In response, ICE maintains its commitment to providing safe and humane environments with comprehensive medical care. However, critics argue the system is designed to be punitive and that the current administration's policies are exacerbating an already dangerous situation for detainees.</p>

This trend of media-by-oligarchy can lead to self-censorship and editorial shifts to align with the owners' business and political interests, as allegedly seen at other major news outlets.

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is campaigning on a proposal to create a network of city-owned grocery stores aimed at providing low-cost food by operating without profit motives or rent expenses. While the idea has found support among a majority of likely voters, it has drawn sharp criticism from business leaders, including supermarket CEO John Catsimatidis, who call it unrealistic. The concept of municipal grocery stores has a mixed record in the U.S., with some small towns like St. Paul, Kansas, finding success out of necessity, while others, such as nearby Erie, have failed due to consistent financial losses, highlighting the challenges of public-sector retail.</p>

According to U.S. Coast Guard data and security experts, maritime drug seizures in the region consist almost entirely of cocaine and marijuana, with no documented cases of fentanyl interdiction at sea. Critics suggest the administration is using the fentanyl crisis as a fact-free pretext to authorize extrajudicial killings and potentially lay the groundwork for military action against Venezuela or cartels in Mexico. Most fentanyl enters the U.S. through official land ports of entry after being produced in Mexico.</p>

The book is praised for its propulsive narrative and psychologically complex main character, who embodies both sincerity and vapidity while navigating online fame, personal grief, and financial instability. The review highlights Chang's satirical take on the commodification of belief and the often-hollow nature of Instagram-fueled enlightenment, creating a compelling narrative about a uniquely contemporary Los Angeles.</p>

This disruption can lead to missed court hearings and an environment of fear and anxiety, which some believe is intended to pressure detainees into self-deporting. The strategy aligns with the Trump administration's goal of expediting removals, but it severely compromises the due process and well-being of those in custody.</p>

This phenomenon occurs when two tropical cyclones move close enough to each other to begin orbiting a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths. While officials say an interaction is unlikely in this case because the second storm is significantly weaker, the possibility exists. The 'dance' between two storms of comparable strength can be intense, but typically when one is weaker, it is simply absorbed by the larger, more powerful system without significantly increasing its strength.</p>

His son, Dan Rooney, who later served as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, was instrumental in fostering ties with the country and brought the first NFL game to Dublin in 1997.

          <p>After a summer of intense hype that saw its Labubu monster toys command massive markups on the secondary market, Chinese company Pop Mart says it is pleased to see resale prices falling. The company increased production tenfold to meet demand and make the art toys more accessible to genuine fans rather than scalpers. Analysts note that while a hot resale market can build brand desirability, it can also alienate core customers in the long term. The cooling prices reflect both increased supply and potentially waning demand in some areas, but Pop Mart is focused on a sustainable model through international expansion and developing character backstories.

          <p>Chichester City FC player and former Arsenal academy striker Billy Vigar has died at the age of 21 after sustaining a significant brain injury during a match. Vigar was placed in an induced coma following the incident last Saturday, which is believed to have involved a collision with a concrete wall surrounding the pitch. His death has sent shockwaves through the football community, prompting an outpouring of tributes from former clubs and fans. A petition has been launched calling for a ban on brick walls near football pitches to prevent similar tragedies, with brain injury charities urging for immediate discussions on mitigating such risks.</p>

          <p>A deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility, where a gunman killed one detainee and wounded two others from a rooftop, is part of a disturbing trend of sniper-style attacks in the U.S. Law enforcement experts note at least seven such incidents have occurred since the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in July 2024, many targeting political figures and police. The Dallas shooter allegedly planned the ambush for months, leaving behind writings indicating a desire to terrorize ICE agents. This rise in long-range, targeted violence presents a significant challenge for law enforcement, who must now adapt to a threat that is difficult to prevent.</p>

          <p>The Welsh word 'poody,' meaning to sulk, is one of ten Welsh words added to the Oxford English Dictionary in its latest update. The term gained widespread recognition after contestants on the BBC show 'Race Across the World' used it, baffling the show's producers but resonating with viewers. The OED notes that 'poody' is a 'boomerang word,' having originated from the English 'pout,' been adopted into Welsh as 'pwdu,' and then re-borrowed back into English. Other Welsh words added include 'nobbling' (freezing cold) and 'diolch' (thank you), reflecting the evolving nature of the English language and its cultural borrowings.</p>

          <p>As autumn begins, UK health officials are warning of a seasonal rise in both flu and COVID-19 cases, urging the public to be aware of the distinct symptoms. While both viruses can cause fever and fatigue, the flu often arrives more suddenly with significant body aches, whereas COVID-19's symptom list has evolved to frequently include cold-like signs such as a runny nose and sore throat, with a hoarse voice being a hallmark of recent variants. Vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe illness from both viruses, and eligible groups are encouraged to get their seasonal shots to reduce hospitalizations and protect vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Animal rights advocates are questioning the Trump administration's pledge to reduce animal testing after discovering that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has approved millions in new funding for primate experiments. Despite promises to prioritize alternative methods, documents show about $91 million in recent spending on animal research, including a $10.1 million kidney transplant study using nearly 100 monkeys. This apparent contradiction has intensified pressure on the NIH director from groups like White Coat Waste, who have allied with key administration figures to end the practice. The continued funding suggests a discrepancy between the administration's public statements and its actual allocation of research grants.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent comments linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism have drawn criticism not only for being medically unfounded but also for echoing a long history of blaming mothers for their children's neurodevelopmental conditions. Scholars point to the debunked 'refrigerator mom' theory of the mid-20th century, which wrongly attributed autism to a lack of maternal warmth from educated, working mothers. This pattern of seeking a singular, often maternal, cause for a complex condition like autism fuels stigma and places an undue burden on women. Experts worry that the current narrative, much like past ones, distracts from productive conversations about supporting neurodiversity and providing adequate healthcare.</p>

          <p>An analysis of competing federal education budget proposals reveals that plans from the White House and House Republicans would disproportionately harm the nation's most vulnerable students. Both budgets propose significant cuts, with the House version targeting Title I funding, which supports schools in low-income communities. Research indicates these cuts would be most severe in congressional districts represented by Democrats and in schools serving predominantly students of color. For example, the White House budget would eliminate all funding for English language learners. In contrast, the Senate's proposal would largely maintain current funding levels, highlighting a deep partisan divide over the federal government's role in education.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's request for a multibillion-dollar payment from the U.S. investors taking over TikTok is being criticized by finance and policy experts as a form of extortion. This move is seen as part of a broader pattern where the administration intervenes in private business deals to extract fees or equity, blurring the lines between governance and personal power. Critics argue this creates a system of 'crony capitalism,' where business success depends on ingratiating oneself with the president rather than on innovation. While investors may see it as a 'finders' fee,' experts warn that such actions undermine free-market principles and could harm the U.S. economy.</p>
