          <p>The conflict between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has created significant uncertainty regarding NASA's budget, which faces substantial cuts. NASA's budget request to Congress proposes nearly halving funding for science projects, potentially halting 40 science missions. Trump has threatened to withdraw federal contracts with SpaceX, a key partner for resupplying the International Space Station and future Moon and Mars missions. Critics argue that the proposed budget prioritizes lunar and Martian missions at the expense of other vital space science endeavors.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are working to comply with President Xi Jinping's austerity orders, ensuring modest offices and proper meal receipts as inspectors conduct checks. The campaign, ongoing since 2012, aims to reduce overspending, improve the Communist Party's image, and combat corruption. Analysts suggest it is also about efficient spending to compete with the United States and identifying loyal cadres for promotion. Questions remain about the campaign's effectiveness due to media control and enforcement challenges.</p>
