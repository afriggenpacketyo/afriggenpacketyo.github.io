          <p>With global equities reaching all-time highs, financial experts are advising investors to adopt defensive strategies to safeguard recent portfolio gains. The article highlights that while a potential Federal Reserve rate cut is anticipated, a weakening labor market could indicate broader economic trouble, creating significant uncertainty. Analysts warn that many portfolios are overly concentrated in a few mega-cap tech stocks, posing a substantial risk if market trends pivot towards value stocks. They recommend re-evaluating tech exposure and gradually broadening investments into defensive sectors that have lagged during the recent market rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Sweden are observing a disturbing trend of teenage girls being recruited as hitwomen by organized crime networks. These young women reportedly use encrypted messaging sites to offer their services, sometimes seeking to prove they are more ruthless than their male counterparts to secure violent assignments. The article highlights how this development has been a blind spot for authorities, allowing gangs to exploit vulnerable girls, many of whom have histories of trauma and drug addiction. This issue is part of a broader surge in gang-related violence that has become a systemic threat in the country.</p>

          <p>A task force established by President Donald Trump has released a report alleging numerous instances of anti-Christian bias across federal agencies during the Biden administration. The report, chaired by Attorney General Pam Bondi, claims the government was "weaponized" against Christians, citing examples such as the mishandling of religious exemptions for COVID-19 mandates and imposing large fines on Christian universities. It also points to an FBI memo targeting certain Catholics as potential domestic terrorists and alleges discriminatory practices at departments like State and Housing and Urban Development. The task force vows to continue its investigation and rectify any identified biases.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion, ranking it as the third-largest prize in U.S. lottery history. Winners face a choice between a 30-year annuity or a lump-sum cash payment, which is currently valued at approximately $770.3 million. Regardless of the payout option, a mandatory 24% federal tax is withheld immediately, with the winner likely owing more at tax time due to falling into the top 37% income bracket.

          <p>In an excerpt from her upcoming memoir, "Listening to the Law," Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett reflects on the difficult personal decision to accept her nomination to the high court. She describes the significant sacrifices required of her family, including relocating from their home in Indiana to Washington, D.C., and the inevitable loss of privacy. Barrett recalls the intense and often unpleasant public scrutiny she faced during a previous consideration for a Supreme Court seat, which made her hesitant to repeat the experience. Ultimately, she and her husband decided to commit fully, viewing it as a public service she could not cowardly refuse.</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has called on his party to prepare for a possible early general election in 2027. Speaking at the party's conference, Farage predicted a major rift within the Labour Party and sought to capitalize on Reform's recent polling leads and local election successes. He announced the creation of a new department to prepare for government and outlined key policy goals, including welfare cuts, stopping illegal immigration, and scrapping net zero policies.

          <p>Actor John Alford, known for his roles in the television series 'London's Burning' and 'Grange Hill,' has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two teenage girls. A jury at St Albans Crown Court convicted the 53-year-old on four counts of sexual activity with a 14-year-old girl and charges of sexual assault and assault by penetration involving a 15-year-old girl. The incidents occurred at a friend's house in April 2022 after Alford had purchased alcohol that the victims consumed. Alford had denied the charges, claiming he never touched the girls and suggesting he was the victim of an extortion plot.</p>

This follows a similar decision by the band Coldplay, who also had to move concert dates at Wembley Stadium because of the transit walkout.

This slowdown is intensifying concerns about the health of the economy and makes a Federal Reserve interest rate cut later this month highly probable.

It contrasts this with the intense, albeit delayed, media coverage of Joe Biden's age and health during his 2024 campaign. The author argues that while rampant speculation is unhelpful, the White House's tendency to offer minimal explanations for Trump's swollen ankles, uneven gait, and verbal confusion warrants more persistent, evidence-based journalistic inquiry. The piece suggests that the media's relative silence is a failure to hold the current administration to the same standard of transparency as its predecessor.</p>

The GOA and other groups immediately filed lawsuits arguing that without the tax, the federal government has no basis to require registration for these items. This effort represents a significant shift, moving what was once a fringe goal of repealing one of America's oldest gun laws into the conservative mainstream.</p>

This assessment is evidenced by their recent joint military parade in Beijing, from which Trump was excluded, and their continued pursuit of agendas contrary to U.S. interests, such as Russia's war in Ukraine and North Korea's nuclear program. The author argues that Trump's foreign policy is driven by personal interests rather than a coherent strategy, and his responses to these snubs are often petulant social media posts.

          <h2>Former U.S. Space Officials Warn China May Be Advancing in Orbital and Lunar Capabilities</h2>

          <p>Former U.S. space officials have raised concerns that China is making significant strides in advanced space capabilities, potentially surpassing the United States in key areas. They pointed to a recent, mysterious mission where two Chinese satellites docked in a high orbit some 36,000 kilometers above Earth and executed what was described as the largest single maneuver ever seen in that orbit. This event is widely believed to have been a successful high-orbit refueling test, a complex capability that could extend the operational life of satellites. The achievement fuels concerns that China's rapidly advancing space program could give it a strategic advantage.</p>

          <p>A newly translated collection of early fiction by acclaimed South Korean film director Lee Chang-dong, titled "Snowy Day and Other Stories," showcases his foundational literary talents. The stories, written during the repressive political climate of the 1980s, are noted for their powerful use of imagery to evoke emotion and convey the losses and humiliations of life under a dictatorship. The review highlights Lee's skill in creating suspenseful plots that prioritize atmosphere and feeling over direct explanation, a style that foreshadows his later cinematic work like the film "Burning." The collection is praised for communicating complex indignities and asking readers to actively interpret its meaning.</p>

          <p>Along India's coast, successful conservation programs are helping protect the vulnerable olive ridley sea turtle population during their nesting season. To shield the eggs from predators and poachers, activists carefully collect them from beach nests and move them to protected hatcheries for incubation. Once the baby turtles hatch, they are gathered and released onto the sand, where conservationists stand guard to ward off crabs and birds as the hatchlings make their crucial journey to the sea. This brief but vital moment of protection, often cheered on by tourists, offers a hopeful glimpse into efforts to preserve the species.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned as Britain's deputy prime minister and housing secretary after an ethics investigation found she breached the ministerial code by underpaying tax on a property sale. Rayner admitted she made an error by not seeking specialist tax advice regarding the purchase of her flat, which should have been classified as a second home, resulting in an additional £40,000 in stamp duty. In her resignation letter, she accepted full responsibility and expressed deep regret for not meeting the highest standards. Her departure creates a significant vacancy at the top of the Labour government and is expected to trigger a new election for deputy party leader.</p>

          <p>Chicago is bracing for the imminent arrival of federal law enforcement and ICE agents, a move championed by President Trump to address violence but strongly opposed by local leaders. Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have rejected the deployment, with Johnson passing an executive order to limit federal influence on local police. Community organizations are mobilizing to inform residents of their rights amid fears that the federal presence will target immigrant communities and employ aggressive tactics like racial profiling. The deployment is part of a national crime emergency declared by Trump, which has already seen troops sent to Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>The United States is escalating its military presence in the Caribbean by deploying ten F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico to target drug cartels. This move follows a recent deadly U.S. missile strike on a boat suspected of carrying Venezuelan drug traffickers, signaling a more aggressive strategy. The deployment heightens regional tensions, particularly with Venezuela, which the U.S. accuses of facilitating the drug trade and which recently flew its own jets near a U.S. warship. U.S. officials have indicated that such forceful military actions against narco-traffickers will continue as part of a sustained campaign to disrupt the flow of illicit drugs.</p>

          <p>A massive raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at a Hyundai and LG electric vehicle battery plant under construction in Georgia resulted in the detention of hundreds of workers. The operation, part of an investigation into unlawful employment practices, has halted construction on the high-profile project, which was touted as the largest economic development in the state's history. The South Korean government has expressed "concern and regret" over the raid, urging the U.S. to ensure the rights of its detained nationals are not violated.

          <p>Angela Rayner's resignation as deputy prime minister marks a dramatic end to a remarkable political ascent. Rising from a background of poverty in Stockport, she left school with no qualifications and became a care worker before finding her footing in the trade union movement. Her journey from a council estate to one of the highest offices in British politics was a compelling story that resonated with many voters. As a key figure in the Labour Party, she was known for her combative style and ability to connect with working-class communities, but a controversy over her personal tax affairs ultimately led to her downfall.</p>
