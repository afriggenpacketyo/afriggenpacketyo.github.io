          <p>Torrential rains triggered severe flash flooding in southern New Mexico, resulting in the deaths of at least three people, including two children. The village of Ruidoso, previously impacted by wildfires, experienced dozens of swift-water rescues as homes and vehicles were swept away by the fast-moving water. The Rio Ruidoso reached a record height of 20 feet, prompting Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham to declare a state of emergency to secure federal aid for the devastated region. The area's vulnerability to flooding was heightened by burn scars from wildfires in the previous year.</p>

          <p>Seven of the largest housebuilding firms in the United Kingdom have agreed to a £100 million settlement to fund affordable housing, thereby avoiding a formal legal decision from the Competition and Markets Authority. The regulator was investigating whether the companies illegally shared commercially sensitive information, such as pricing details, which could have inflated home prices. As part of the agreement, the firms will not admit any wrongdoing but will commit to ceasing such information sharing practices in the future. The CMA stated this resolution provides a faster and more beneficial outcome than a prolonged investigation. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has proposed fundamental reforms to the UK's criminal justice system, including the use of judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud to tackle a massive case backlog. The recommendations aim to prevent a "total system collapse" by speeding up justice, but have drawn criticism from some barristers who argue that juries are essential for a fair trial. Other proposals include handling less serious offenses in lower courts and increasing sentence reductions for early guilty pleas. The government is now considering these radical changes for potential legislation.</p>

          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has issued an urgent warning about the "exodus" of companies from the London Stock Exchange, with 213 firms having left since 2016. The business group calls for lighter regulations and new incentives to encourage investment in British firms and halt the trend of companies listing elsewhere, particularly in the US. CBI chair Rupert Soames suggested that tax policies, such as those for cash ISAs, should be reformed to steer savings toward more productive investments in the economy. The chancellor is expected to address these concerns in an upcoming speech. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An additional 50 people have come forward with claims of misconduct against British TV presenter Gregg Wallace, who denies the allegations. These new claims, which include inappropriate sexual comments and touching, follow an initial investigation that led to his departure from the show "MasterChef." Baroness Helena Kennedy, who chairs an industry watchdog, has publicly advised Wallace against dismissing the women's accounts as fabricated. She also criticized television industry managers for failing to address concerns about his behavior earlier, highlighting a systemic issue of accountability.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump is squandering his historic gains with Latino voters through his administration's harsh and cruel immigration enforcement tactics. The author draws a parallel to California's Proposition 187 in the 1990s, which radicalized a generation of Latino voters against the Republican party. By targeting long-term residents in sweeping raids instead of focusing on criminals, Trump is fueling widespread fear and grassroots opposition, even among Latinos who were previously open to supporting him. This approach risks turning a potential political victory into a long-term liability for the GOP.</p>

A recent survey of its members revealed that the actual cost to produce a meal is significantly higher than the government's allocation.

          <p>Meeting minutes reveal that officials in Kerr County, Texas, discussed implementing a flood warning system at least 20 times since 2016 but failed to act before last week's deadly disaster. The idea was repeatedly raised due to the region's high flood risk, yet it stalled after a federal grant application failed and some commissioners opposed the cost and necessity of such a system. Instead, officials relied on an informal "river calling" phone tree to warn camps of danger. The lack of a centralized, automated alert system is now under intense scrutiny following the catastrophic flood that claimed dozens of lives.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' rookie phenom Jacob Misiorowski delivered a stunning performance, striking out 12 batters over six innings to lead his team to a 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The 23-year-old right-hander, making just his fifth MLB start, overwhelmed the Dodgers' lineup with a fastball that consistently topped 100 mph. The only run he allowed was a leadoff home run to Shohei Ohtani. Misiorowski's dominant outing handed the Dodgers their fifth consecutive loss, leaving even veteran players like Clayton Kershaw impressed by the rookie's overpowering stuff and command on the mound.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to impose additional tariffs on Japan and South Korea is raising concerns about a sharper economic downturn in the two export-dependent nations. Both countries, which are key U.S. allies, are already grappling with slowing growth and saw their economies contract in the first quarter. The proposed 25% tariffs target major exports like automobiles and steel, which are critical to their economies. While President Trump has indicated a willingness to negotiate if the countries open their markets, economists warn that the new duties could significantly hinder GDP growth and potentially push Japan into a technical recession.

          <p>At 80 years old, rock legend John Fogerty delivered a powerful and energetic performance at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The concert heavily featured classic songs from his time with Creedence Clearwater Revival, which he can now perform after regaining full legal rights to them. Despite his age, Fogerty's distinctive, raspy vocals remained remarkably consistent, and his guitar skills were on full display throughout the two-hour show.

          <p>Four days after catastrophic flash floods struck Central Texas, at least 161 people are still missing in Kerr County alone, with the death toll from the disaster rising to 109. Governor Greg Abbott confirmed the numbers, vowing that search and rescue operations involving helicopters, drones, and over 250 responders will not cease until everyone is accounted for. The missing include campers and a counselor from the hard-hit Camp Mystic. Rescue volunteers described the widespread destruction as a "nightmare," with the scale of debris making the search effort incredibly difficult as hopes of finding more survivors fade.</p>

          <p>In a show of unity against potential U.S. economic pressure, Brazil and India have pledged to triple their bilateral trade flows. This move comes after President Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on all member nations of the BRICS economic bloc, which he accused of being set up to harm the U.S. and its currency. The BRICS group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, among others, aims to increase the influence of emerging economies. Trump's aggressive stance has prompted key members to strengthen their own economic ties in defiance of the tariff threats. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Videos posted on social media by a Texas nurse offer a poignant glimpse into the evacuation of Camp Mystic during the deadly Central Texas floods. The footage shows a bus full of young campers being driven away from the devastation, singing worship songs together in an effort to remain calm. The nurse, Devon Paige, also shared videos taken just before the flood, showing the girls enjoying normal camp activities. These images provide a chilling contrast to the catastrophic event that followed, in which dozens of campers and counselors lost their lives when a wall of water ravaged the campsite.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that as the United States scales back its international development and foreign aid efforts under an "America first" policy, a gap is emerging in the provision of global public goods. The author argues that China is stepping in to fill this void, and Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to serve as a hub for these new development and cooperation initiatives. With its cosmopolitan character and international connections, Hong Kong can harness the eastward shift in the center of gravity for global development, finding a new path to prominence by facilitating these efforts.</p>
