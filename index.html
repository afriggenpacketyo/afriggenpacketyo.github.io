The 89-minute event will be shown in all 540 U.S. AMC locations and in up to 100 additional countries, creating a massive synchronized fan experience. The screenings will feature the premiere of her new music video, "The Fate of Ophelia," along with behind-the-scenes footage and the artist's reflections on her new songs.

          <p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel has concluded its meetings, issuing updated recommendations for several key vaccines. For young children, the committee now supports administering separate MMR and varicella shots instead of the combined MMRV vaccine for the first dose to reduce the risk of fever-related seizures. In a significant policy shift for COVID-19, the panel declined to issue a universal recommendation, instead advising that vaccination should be an individual decision made in consultation with a healthcare provider. The panel also tabled a vote on changing the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for newborns, leaving current guidance in place.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has deployed its Typhon missile system in Japan for the first time as part of the Resolute Dragon joint training exercise involving 20,000 troops from both nations. This marks the first deployment of such a weapons system in the Asia-Pacific since the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was abandoned. While U.S. officials state the system will be removed after the exercise, its presence is seen as a significant strategic move. Analysts suggest this deployment could provoke China into accelerating the development and enhancement of its own counterstrike capabilities to offset the new regional threat.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to address illegal migration across the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the military's focus is on national defense, while the UK Border Force is specifically tasked with policing the nation's borders. The comments came after nearly 1,000 migrants crossed the Channel and as the UK government proceeds with its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France. Former military commanders also cautioned that using the military would be complicated and unlikely to add much to existing efforts.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Dismisses Donald Trump's Lengthy Defamation Lawsuit Against The New York Times</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the 85-page complaint as "decidedly improper and impermissible" for its excessive length and florid detail. Judge Steven Merryday criticized the filing for violating federal rules that require allegations to be simple and concise. While the suit was thrown out, the judge has granted Trump's legal team 28 days to file an amended, shorter complaint with a 40-page limit. The New York Times has maintained that the lawsuit is an intimidation tactic meant to stifle independent reporting.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a $2.6 billion expansion of its convention center, despite stark warnings from its own policy analysts about the project's financial risks. Supporters, including Mayor Karen Bass, argue the expansion will create thousands of jobs and is necessary for the upcoming 2028 Olympic Games. However, critics, including the city controller, warn that the project will divert an average of $89 million annually from essential city services for the next 30 years and may not be completed in time for the Olympics. The vote highlights a major gamble on future economic returns versus immediate budgetary pressures.</p>

The protest reflects growing anger in the creative community over the move, which followed calls for action from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr.

          <p>Retired boxing champion Floyd Mayweather has filed a lawsuit against a Las Vegas supercar dealership, alleging fraud and deceptive trade practices in a multimillion-dollar transaction. Mayweather claims the dealership, Vegas Auto Gallery, misrepresented the history and value of a 2018 Maybach Landaulet he purchased. According to the boxer, he was charged $1.2 million for the vehicle, but later discovered the dealer had paid only $728,000 for it.

This firm position is being adopted by both progressive and moderate Democrats, who believe Republicans, as the party in control of Congress, bear the responsibility to negotiate a bipartisan solution.

The Estonian government condemned the incursion as a "brazen" and "extremely dangerous provocation," summoning Russia's chargé d'affaires to lodge an official protest. NATO, Italian, Finnish, and Swedish jets were scrambled in response to intercept and escort the Russian aircraft, which were flying without flight plans or active transponders.

The party argues this move would increase police visibility, make it easier for the public to report crimes, and help restore confidence in policing. To fund the initiative, the Lib Dems suggest abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) roles, a move they estimate could save over £100 million.

The departure follows a viral video showing a student being removed from a class for objecting to content related to transgender issues, which the student felt conflicted with their religious beliefs. An investigation by Welsh found that university leaders had approved teaching content that did not align with the official course description, leading him to remove a dean and department head. Chancellor Glenn Hegar accepted the resignation, stating it was the right moment for a change in leadership to position the university for the future.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have revealed that the man who pleaded guilty to attempting to assassinate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022 had a broader plan to kill three justices. According to a sentencing memorandum, Nicholas Roske's goal was to "single-handedly alter the constitutional order" by changing the court's ideological balance. Roske was motivated by the leaked draft opinion indicating the court would overturn Roe v. Wade. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 30 years to life in prison, arguing his actions constitute a form of terrorism that strikes at the core of the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion from investors at a staggering $200 billion valuation, according to sources. This potential fundraising round highlights the massive and rapidly increasing valuations for companies developing foundational AI models, following similar large-scale investments in competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. However, Musk later posted on his social media platform X that the report was "fake news" and that xAI is not currently raising capital. The funds would likely be used to acquire AI chips and build out the necessary computing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The White House has released a new version of the presidential welcome letter given to newly naturalized U.S. citizens, revealing a rhetorical shift in how the Trump administration defines American identity. Unlike letters from previous presidents of both parties, which emphasized the nation's founding on ideals like equality and liberty, Trump's letter focuses on assimilation into a shared culture, history, and tradition. This change reflects a broader conceptual move on the right, framing America less as a creedal nation open to all and more as a polity defined by a specific cultural heritage, raising questions about inclusivity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to revoke broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over the media. Broadcast networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox rely on government-issued licenses to use public airwaves, obligating them to operate in the "public interest." While this has historically been interpreted to cover issues like children's programming or obscenity, the current administration is framing it in political terms, citing perceived bias. Experts note that revoking a license is a complex process that would likely face significant legal challenges on First Amendment grounds.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and allow the government to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants. The request seeks to freeze a lower court's order that found the administration's move to terminate the humanitarian program was unlawful. This legal maneuver comes as the administration continues its broader effort to dismantle TPS designations for multiple countries. If the Supreme Court grants the request, the administration could proceed with revoking deportation protections for approximately 300,000 Venezuelans currently living in the U.S.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year note reaching its highest level in two weeks, despite the Federal Reserve implementing its first interest rate cut of the year. The 10-year yield climbed to 4.127% as investors balanced the Fed's move with signs of a resilient U.S. economy, including a positive weekly jobless claims report. This counterintuitive rise in long-term yields suggests that investors are weighing factors beyond short-term rates, such as expectations for future economic growth, inflation, and government debt issuance. Policymakers have indicated that two more rate cuts are likely before the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
