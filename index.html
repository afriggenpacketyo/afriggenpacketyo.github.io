          <p>A former Mace B cruise missile launch site in Okinawa, built during the U.S. military occupation, has been reopened to the public, showcasing a dark chapter of Cold War history. The site, one of four constructed in the 1960s, now serves as a reminder of the U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons on the island. Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist organization, restored the site and opened it to the public to educate visitors about Okinawa's past and the dangers of nuclear weapons.

Despite the evacuation, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff plans to meet with Iranian officials to continue nuclear program talks.

          <p>In Kharkiv, Ukraine, a strip club called Flash Dancers provides an unusual form of support for soldiers traumatized by the ongoing conflict with Russia. Dancers act as confidantes, listening to soldiers' experiences and providing comfort, though some soldiers share disturbing videos from the battlefield. The club describes itself as more "Moulin Rouge" than a typical strip club, emphasizing emotional connection over sexual relations. Despite the escapism, the war's harsh realities often intrude, with many regulars wounded or killed, and a former dancer among the casualties of a Russian strike.</p>
