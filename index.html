          <p>Pakistan's leading independent human rights group, the HRCP, has accused government authorities of a coordinated crackdown designed to impede its work. The commission reported that its offices have been sealed, bank accounts frozen, and staff have received threatening phone calls. While the government denies these claims and cites national security concerns for its actions, human rights advocates argue that the space for civil liberties and advocacy in the country is rapidly shrinking amid rising authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for the creation of an international center to coordinate global artificial intelligence governance, aiming to establish a widely accepted framework. He stated that the current global approach to AI regulation is fragmented, with significant differences between nations. This proposal was made at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, shortly after the United States announced its own policy blueprint to reinforce its dominance in AI technology.</p>

          <p>Travel and housekeeping experts warn that many areas in hotel rooms, which may appear clean, can harbor significant levels of bacteria. According to the article, decorative pillows, bed runners, TV remotes, and light switches are often overlooked during cleaning and can be teeming with germs. Experts advise travelers to wipe down high-touch surfaces upon arrival and be cautious with items like glassware and ice buckets to minimize exposure to potential contaminants.</p>

          <p>China's official military newspaper, the PLA Daily, has published a series of commentaries urging the army's political officers to rebuild their public image and reputation. The articles stress the importance of demonstrating unwavering loyalty to the Communist Party leadership, maintaining honesty, and acting with integrity, particularly in personnel promotions. Observers suggest these directives are a direct response to recent corruption scandals that have damaged the credibility of high-ranking military officials.</p>

The double-decker bus, which was carrying more than 60 people on its route from Lima, veered off the road and crashed into a ravine. Authorities note that such fatal accidents are unfortunately frequent in Peru, often attributed to factors like driver recklessness, excessive speed, and hazardous road conditions.</p>

          <p>The British government has officially condemned the Hong Kong authorities for issuing cash bounties for information that could lead to the arrest of pro-democracy activists residing in the UK. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries labeled the move an act of "transnational repression" and a threat to the rights and safety of individuals in the UK. This is the latest instance of Hong Kong offering such rewards for activists who have fled abroad.</p>

          <p>On the fourth anniversary of President Kais Saied's seizure of extensive powers, hundreds of protesters marched through Tunis to denounce what they call his "authoritarian regime." Chanting for "the fall of the regime," demonstrators criticized the mass arrests of political opponents, journalists, and activists, which they say have turned the country into an "open-air prison." The protest highlights the deep political divisions and erosion of democratic institutions in Tunisia since 2021.</p>

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 of its employees, which constitutes more than 20% of its total workforce, have applied to leave the agency under a deferred resignation program. This potential mass exodus coincides with a White House proposal to cut NASA's budget by approximately 25% for the 2026 fiscal year. The significant reduction in personnel, from around 18,000 to 14,000, raises serious concerns about the agency's capacity to maintain its ambitious exploration and innovation missions.
