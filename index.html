The deal has divided the victims' families, with some expressing relief at avoiding a lengthy trial and appeals process, while others feel let down and wanted a full confession with more details about the crime.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea, prosecutors revealed key evidence that led to his arrest for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. A critical breakthrough came from a Q-tip retrieved from his parents' trash, which provided a familial DNA match to a sample found on a knife sheath left at the crime scene. Other evidence included cell phone data placing him near the home multiple times before the attack and his meticulously cleaned car. This information offers new insight into the investigation, though a motive for the killings remains unknown.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that President Donald Trump secured 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a significant increase from his 36% share in 2020. Political experts suggest this shift reflects a growing disillusionment with the Democratic Party's economic and immigration policies rather than a move toward conservative ideology. Analysts argue that many Latino voters, particularly naturalized citizens, are driven by populist and economic concerns, feeling that both parties have failed to address their needs, creating a more dynamic and less predictable electorate.</p>

          <p>The Southern Resident killer whale population in Washington's Puget Sound, now down to just 73 individuals, is facing a severe threat due to the decline of its primary food source, the Chinook salmon. Conservationists are concerned that proposed changes by the Trump administration to the Endangered Species Act could exacerbate the problem by weakening habitat protections. This change could pave the way for industrial development in areas critical for the survival of both the orcas and the salmon, potentially reversing decades of conservation efforts.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' All-Star Lineup Record Quest Fizzles with 3 of 8 Finalists Voted as Starters</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 19:37:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poised to set a record for player popularity and elite production, the Dodgers had eight finalists for the National League starting lineup in the 2025 All-Star Game as voted by fans.\n\nVoters had 48 hours to choose between the two players at each position who had accumulated the most votes over the last month in what MLB called Phase 1. Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani already was in the starting lineup because he led NL players in Phase 1 votes.\n\nWho in Blue would join him after Phase 2?\n\nMLB announced the winners Wednesday afternoon, and Dodgers catcher Will Smith and first baseman Freddie Freeman will start along with Ohtani. The other five Dodgers finalists — second baseman Tommy Edman, shortstop Mookie Betts, third baseman Max Muncy and outfielders Teoscar Hernández and Andy Pages — were outvoted and won’t start.\n\nThe record of five starting players held by the 1976 Cincinnati Reds, the 1956 and 1957 Cincinnati Redlegs, and the 1939 New York Yankees still stands. The Dodgers fell short, despite the bevy of finalists.\n\nIt is the ninth All-Star berth for Freeman, who is batting .308 with 21 doubles, and the third for Smith, who leads the NL with a .320 batting average and .419 on-base percentage. Both players have 10 home runs.\n\nEleven-time All-Star Mike Trout was the only Angels player among the American League finalists, and he did not finish among the top three outfielders in Phase 2. Thousand Oaks High product and Athletics rookie Jacob Wilson was voted the AL starter at shortstop, beating out Bobby Witt Jr.\n\nFinalists not voted as starters have no guarantee of making the All-Star Game as a reserve. Pitchers and reserves for the 32-man rosters will be determined by a vote of MLB players and the commissioner’s office.\n\nComplete rosters of 20 position players and 12 pitchers will be announced at 2 p.m. PDT Sunday on ESPN. The All-Star Game will take place July 15 at Truist Park in Atlanta. Managers Dave Roberts of the Dodgers and Aaron Boone of the Yankees have no say in the selections.\n\nBefore the Dodgers faced the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday night, Roberts did say he hoped the number of All-Stars from his team would increase.\n\n“I think they’ve all had great first halves, and it’s great to know that three guys are starting,” he said. “And so hopefully we get a couple, two or three more. Really, good, really good.”\n\nThe teams that boasted a record five starters included Hall of Famers and also lesser-known players.\n\nThe ’39 Yankees had All-Star starters Joe DiMaggio, George Selkirk, Bill Dickey, Red Rolfe and Joe Gordon. Red Ruffing was named the starting pitcher by manager Joe McCarthy, making the ’39 Yankees the only team with six starting players.\n\nThe most recent team to land five All-Star starters was the ’76 Cincinnati Reds, known as the Big Red Machine, led by future Hall of Famers Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan. Pete Rose, Dave Concepción and George Foster also started.\n\nThe Reds were called the Redlegs from 1953 to 1959 because of a period of intense anti-communism in the U.S. To distance themselves from the Red Scare, the Reds temporarily changed their name.\n\nCincinnati fans loved their team by any name, casting a deluge of last-minute votes two years in a row that eventually required intervention from MLB commissioner Ford Frick and caused MLB to eliminate fan voting for more than a decade.\n\nFrick stood by the voting in ’56 despite complaints that five Redlegs were voted in, saying, “Everybody had a chance to vote, so there should be no squawks.”\n\nA year later he changed his tune when last-minute voting — remember, all votes were handwritten and manually tabulated — resulted in an all-Redlegs lineup. Frick swiftly stepped in and replaced three Redlegs with future Hall of Famers Stan Musial, Willie Mays and Hank Aaron.\n\nRedlegs fans were incensed, some making an effigy of the commissioner and driving it through Cincinnati tied to a truck. The reaction from players was more muted, with Redlegs center fielder Gus Bell saying, “I’m not exactly burned up about being replaced by Willie.”\n\nDodgers who finished second likely will have little quarrel with the results. Players who edged them out in voting are having excellent seasons: third baseman Manny Machado, shortstop Francisco Lindor, second baseman Ketel Marte and outfielders Ronald Acuña Jr., Kyle Tucker and Harvard-Westlake High product Pete Crow-Armstrong.\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto (8-6, 2.51 earned-run average) of the Dodgers is a strong candidate to make the NL pitching staff. At least one Angels player must be chosen as a reserve or pitcher, and the nod could go to Trout, who has 13 home runs but is batting .230.\n\nOther possibilities for the resurgent Angels are catcher Logan O’Hoppe (17 home runs), shortstop Zach Neto (12 home runs, team-high 2.7 WAR), outfielder Jo Adell (18 homers, 44 runs batted in) and starting pitcher Yusei Kikuchi (2.79 ERA in 96.2 innings).\n\nMLB All-Star Starting Lineups\n\nNational League\n\nC: Will Smith, Dodgers\n\n1B: Freddie Freeman, Dodgers\n\n2B: Ketel Marte, Diamondbacks\n\nSS: Francisco Lindor, Mets\n\n3B: Manny Machado, Padres\n\nOF: Pete Crow-Armstrong, Cubs\n\nOF: Kyle Tucker, Cubs\n\nOF: Ronald Acuña Jr., Atlanta Braves\n\nDH: Shohei Ohtani, Dodgers\n\nAmerican League\n\nC: Cal Raleigh, Mariners\n\n1B: Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Blue Jays\n\n2B: Gleyber Torres, Tigers\n\nSS: Jacob Wilson, Athletics\n\n3B: Jose Ramirez, Guardians\n\nOF: Aaron Judge, Yankees\n\nOF: Riley Greene, Tigers\n\nOF: Javier Baez, Tigers\n\nDH: Ryan O’Hearn, Orioles</p>

          <p>Approximately 120,000 car owners in the UK have been instructed to stop driving their Citroen C3 and DS3 models due to a potentially lethal fault with their Takata-made airbags. The "stop-drive" alert from parent company Stellantis follows a fatal accident in France and growing concerns that the airbag's chemical propellant can become unstable and cause the inflator to rupture violently. Owners report facing long waits for repairs, some until next year, leaving them stranded without transportation as the company scrambles to source enough replacement parts.</p>

          <p>The B-2 bomber pilots and crews who participated in the recent strikes on Iranian nuclear sites have been advised to maintain a low profile during their invited visit to the White House for the July Fourth holiday. President Trump, who has lauded the pilots as heroes, invited them for a celebration that will include flyovers, but no public ceremony identifying the individuals is planned due to security concerns. The Air Force noted the risks of adversaries targeting military personnel, emphasizing the need to protect the identities of those involved in sensitive missions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 19:00:59 EDT</div>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is facing a challenging financial situation after major concessions on a planned welfare reform bill significantly reduced anticipated savings. With the government's fiscal buffer nearly gone, Reeves is left with a limited set of difficult options ahead of the Autumn Budget. These include waiting for economic growth, finding new departmental savings, raising taxes, or extending the current freeze on tax thresholds. The article notes that changing the government's self-imposed fiscal rules is a "big no-no" for the Chancellor, who is focused on maintaining financial credibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 18:49:55 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam that will set tariffs on Vietnamese imports at 20%, avoiding a planned increase to 46%. As part of the deal, Vietnam will eliminate its own tariffs on U.S. products, granting American goods full market access. The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are "trans-shipped" through Vietnam from other countries, a practice the administration claims is used to circumvent tariffs on Chinese products. This deal comes as many other U.S. trading partners are still negotiating to avoid upcoming tariff hikes. (not investment advice)</p>
