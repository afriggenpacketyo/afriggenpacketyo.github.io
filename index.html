          <p>A third child, 10-year-old Ari Buchman, has died from injuries sustained in a tragic sailboat accident near Miami Beach. The incident occurred when a summer camp sailboat carrying five children and one counselor collided with a barge in Biscayne Bay, resulting in the deaths of two other girls, ages 7 and 13. A fourth child was injured but has been released from the hospital. The U.S. Coast Guard is leading a thorough investigation into the crash, with participation from international authorities from Argentina, the home nation of one of the victims.</p>

          <p>President Trump has changed his opinion on a controversial American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, now calling it "fantastic" after being informed she is a registered Republican. The campaign, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," had drawn mixed reactions, with some critics alleging it had problematic undertones. Trump's comment comes amidst a broader cultural discussion about the ad, which some political figures have used to criticize what they describe as overly sensitive reactions from the left.</p>

          <p>Asian stock markets experienced mixed trading after Wall Street suffered its largest drop since May, triggered by a disappointing U.S. jobs report. The report revealed that U.S. employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations, increasing concerns about a weakening American economy. This economic data, combined with ongoing uncertainty from U.S. tariff policies, has led investors to increase their bets on a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September.

          <p>A group of Democratic legislators has fled Texas to prevent the Republican-controlled state legislature from achieving the quorum needed to vote on a new congressional map. The proposed map, backed by President Trump, would create several new districts heavily favoring the GOP. Democrats argue the move is a gerrymander and that Republicans are holding disaster relief funds hostage to push the plan through. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers removed from their positions if they do not return.</p>

          <p>More than 3,000 Boeing defense workers in Missouri and Illinois are set to strike after union members rejected the company's latest contract offer. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) cited disagreements over pay, work schedules, and pensions as key issues. This labor action affects the production of F-15 fighter jets and other military hardware, adding another challenge for the aviation giant, which has recently faced safety scandals and a costly strike at its passenger jet division.</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a new system to dramatically increase the survival rate of combat drones against missile attacks. The concept involves fitting small and medium-sized drones with side-mounted rocket boosters for "terminal evasion." These boosters would allow a drone to perform sudden, high-G maneuvers in the final moments before a missile impact, making it extremely difficult to track. Digital simulations suggest this technology could increase a drone's survival probability to nearly 90 percent.</p>

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey asserts that many people are financially struggling not because of low income, but because their earnings are consumed by debt payments. He points to credit card bills, car payments, and student loans as the primary culprits that prevent individuals from building wealth. Ramsey advises people to regain control of their finances by creating a zero-based budget, aggressively paying down debt using the "debt snowball" method, and paying for purchases with cash instead of financing them.

          <p>A volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume more than 3.7 miles into the sky. The eruption of the Krasheninnikov volcano followed a major earthquake in the region. Authorities reported that the ash cloud was spreading eastward over the Pacific Ocean, away from populated areas, and no ashfall was recorded in inhabited localities. Volcanologists confirmed this was the first historically documented eruption of the volcano in centuries, though its activity is now reportedly decreasing.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have confirmed the death of Khamis Ayyad, a Palestinian American man in his 40s, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

          <p>Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, reportedly engaged in intense negotiations to release billions of dollars in previously approved government funds in exchange for confirming a slate of President Trump's nominees. The requested funds included money for the National Institutes of Health, the World Food Program, and other global health initiatives. However, after a deal was believed to be close, President Trump rejected the arrangement, leaving dozens of his nominees unconfirmed and criticizing the Democratic demands as "political extortion."</p>

          <p>According to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, the new tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration on dozens of trading partners are "pretty much set." In an interview, Greer indicated that he does not expect the rates, which include a baseline 10% tariff on all imports from targeted countries, to be negotiated down. The policy is part of the president's plan to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, and it affects major partners, including Canada, who have not reached new trade deals with the administration.

          <p>China's plan to build a new, massive embassy in London opposite the Tower of London has ignited a major controversy. Opponents, including Hong Kong pro-democracy activists, fear the facility could be used to harass dissidents and pose an espionage risk due to its proximity to the city's financial district. Local residents also object over security and privacy concerns. The UK government, which is seeking to engage with Beijing, has taken over the final decision after the local council rejected the plan, creating a complex diplomatic and political dilemma.</p>

          <p>The medical procedure of egg freezing is gaining popularity among women seeking to preserve their fertility, but it comes with a significant financial cost and no guarantee of a future pregnancy. A single cycle can cost an average of $12,000 to $13,000, and doctors often recommend multiple cycles, further increasing the expense. While some employers are beginning to offer insurance coverage, most women must pay out of pocket. Experts caution that there is a considerable drop-off at each stage, from thawing eggs to achieving a successful birth.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind has demonstrated a powerful new AI model called Genie 2, which can create playable, interactive 3D environments from a single static image or text prompt. This technology represents a significant leap in generative AI, allowing for the creation of explorable virtual worlds on the fly. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis explained that beyond entertainment, the primary goal is to build a "world model" that can understand the physical world. These simulated environments could be used to train AI agents and robots for complex tasks more efficiently.</p>
