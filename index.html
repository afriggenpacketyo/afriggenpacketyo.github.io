          <p>Dick Barnett, a key player in the Knicks' successful 1970s era, passed away in Florida at the age of 88. Barnett's unorthodox jump-shooting style contributed to the Knicks winning their only two NBA championships. Voted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in April 2024, Barnett played 14 seasons in the NBA, including nine with the Knicks, alongside teammates like Walt Frazier and Willis Reed, under Coach Red Holzman. He had become increasingly frail in recent years but did not appear to have a fatal illness.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is scheduled to visit the Philippines to enhance security cooperation, including a potential intelligence-sharing agreement aimed at monitoring China's activities in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. Analysts suggest China is wary of the strategic implications of a stronger US-Japan-Philippines security alignment, fearing it could create a hostile bloc near its borders. The General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) would facilitate protected exchanges of classified military information and defense technologies between Japan and the Philippines, potentially impacting regional surveillance capabilities.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly accused Ronen Bar, the head of Israel's domestic security agency, of lying to the Supreme Court amidst a legal dispute over Netanyahu's attempt to dismiss Bar. In a detailed affidavit, Netanyahu refuted allegations made by Bar, who claimed the dismissal stemmed from demands for personal loyalty rather than professional considerations. The case, brought by Israeli watchdog organizations and opposition parties, challenges Netanyahu's decision to oust Bar, citing a lack of trust between them, escalating tensions within the Israeli government.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky, President Trump questioned why President Vladimir Putin would continue attacking Ukraine while the United States is trying to broker peace talks, offering a small amount of hope to Ukrainians. Trump suggested that Putin may not want to stop the war and might need to be dealt with more firmly through sanctions. This development comes as the United States pushes Ukraine to accept a peace plan that would require Kyiv to abandon NATO aspirations and recognize Crimea as Russian territory, a deal Ukraine has rejected.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to hinder new wind energy projects, the U.S. wind industry is experiencing growth through the "repowering" of aging infrastructure. This involves upgrading or replacing older turbines with newer, more efficient models, increasing electricity output. Companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa are benefiting from this trend. While new greenfield projects have slowed, the repowering of existing wind farms offers economic advantages, such as avoiding property acquisition and increasing electricity generation with fewer turbines.</p>
