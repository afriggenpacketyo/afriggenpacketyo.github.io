          <h2>Key Questions for Seniors Considering a Reverse Mortgage Amid Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 15:10:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With persistent inflation straining the finances of many seniors, reverse mortgages are gaining attention as a way to access home equity. The article advises homeowners aged 62 and older to ask critical questions before proceeding, such as whether it's the most intelligent way to borrow against their home compared to options like HELOCs. It also prompts them to consider if they can manage with existing funds and to re-evaluate financial goals for their beneficiaries, as a reverse mortgage can impact inheritance. Finally, it suggests deciding on the best payment type, whether a lump sum or monthly installments, to suit their specific needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the legendary heavy metal vocalist known as the "Prince of Darkness," has passed away at the age of 76, his family confirmed. As the frontman for the pioneering band Black Sabbath, he was instrumental in creating the heavy metal genre with iconic albums like "Paranoid." After being fired from the band in 1979 for his excessive behavior, he launched a highly successful solo career with hits like "Crazy Train" and later became a reality TV star on "The Osbournes." Twice inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Osbourne's immense influence was recently celebrated at a final farewell concert.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 15:09:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor Technologies experienced a dramatic but short-lived surge, characteristic of a meme stock rally driven by retail traders on forums like WallStreetBets. The stock price tripled in a matter of days before turning negative, highlighting the extreme volatility of such speculative trading. The rally was fueled by high short interest, which may have triggered a short squeeze, and a significant increase in call options trading. Despite the recent pullback, the stock's value had increased by 400% in July alone, recalling the market dynamics of the 2021 GameStop mania. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prominent economist Mohamed El-Erian has publicly called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to resign in order to protect the central bank's institutional independence. In a post on X, the Allianz chief economic advisor argued that the Fed is facing "growing and broadening threats" to its autonomy, which he believes would only intensify if Powell remains in his position. El-Erian acknowledged that his stance is contrary to the Wall Street consensus, which prefers Powell to complete his term. His call comes amid criticism from officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who stated the Fed has suffered from "mission creep." (not investment advice)</p>

The bomber was conducting a pre-approved flyover for the North Dakota State Fair, but the commercial pilot informed passengers he was not notified of its presence. Minot Air Force Base stated it had communicated the flyover plans, but the air traffic control tower did not advise the B-52 crew of the inbound commercial flight.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at MIT have engineered a revolutionary bionic knee that provides above-the-knee amputees with significantly more natural and intuitive mobility. The system, called e-OPRA, involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic prosthesis and integrates with the user's muscles. This direct connection allows the bionic knee to respond to the user's intended movements, enabling actions like climbing stairs or kicking a ball with greater ease and confidence. Led by Professor Hugh Herr, himself a double amputee, the technology bypasses the discomfort of traditional socket-based prosthetics and could become more widely available within five years.</p>

          <p>On-location entertainment production in the Los Angeles area saw a 6.2% decrease in the second quarter compared to the previous year, according to a report from FilmLA.

However, the television sector showed a notable sign of recovery, with on-location shoot days increasing by 17%, largely due to gains in TV dramas and reality shows. The report comes as California aims to boost local production with an expanded state film and TV tax credit program. (not investment advice)</p>

He then launched a hugely successful solo career, aided by his wife Sharon, and later found a new generation of fans with the reality show "The Osbournes."

          <p>While interest rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) have declined from their 2024 peaks, they still offer substantial and predictable returns for savers. The article compares the interest earned on a $20,000 CD now versus a year ago, showing a noticeable drop; for example, a 3-year CD would have earned over $1,000 more if opened in 2024. Despite the decrease, current rates remain significantly higher than they were at the start of the decade, making CDs a reliable vehicle for growing savings. The analysis suggests that with potential rate cuts looming, now may still be an opportune time to lock in a fixed return. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has recessed the chamber a day earlier than planned for the summer break, a move that effectively stalls a vote on releasing documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. The decision delays the politically sensitive vote until September, amid bipartisan pressure for more transparency in the case. Johnson defended the early adjournment by accusing Democrats of "political games," but the move provides time to manage internal Republican divisions over the issue. This comes as the Justice Department announced it plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, and a House committee voted to subpoena her for testimony.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Ukraine Policy Creates Uncertainty Despite Arms Transfers</h2>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's approach to Ukraine, while occasionally providing support like Patriot missile systems, is ultimately undermining the country's defense against Russia. It points to a recent decision to give Vladimir Putin a 50-day window before considering new sanctions as a strategic gift, allowing Russia to intensify its bombing campaign. The author contends that the aid provided is insufficient for a Ukrainian victory and that Trump's actions create more obstacles than they solve. The analysis suggests Ukraine is being strung along, forced to curry favor with a White House whose support remains fickle and unreliable in the face of Russian aggression.</p>

Residents describe a hunger crisis worse than any in living memory, with food prices skyrocketing. While Israel states that hundreds of aid trucks are waiting for distribution, the UN and other agencies report that ongoing hostilities and restrictions make it nearly impossible to deliver the necessary aid.</p>

          <p>President Trump continued his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell but appeared to back away from the idea of firing him, stating, "he's going to be out pretty soon anyway." Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026. During a White House exchange, Trump called Powell a "numbskull" and accused him of keeping interest rates too high for political reasons, hindering homebuyers. This follows weeks of speculation about Powell's job security and legal questions over the president's authority to remove him. The White House has also escalated pressure by questioning a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's Washington offices. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts attribute the decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation for a few years, allowing people to feel less economic anxiety. This marks a shift from the post-pandemic era, when many relied on side gigs to cover basic living expenses, to now using the extra income more for discretionary spending. (not investment advice)</p>

The policy, supported by Mayor Daniel Lurie, aims to clear streets and address the city's homelessness crisis by targeting at least 400 RVs used as primary residences. While officials argue it's a necessary step to move people into more stable, indoor housing, critics call the plan cruel, pointing to a lack of sufficient shelter space. The city plans to offer a temporary permit program for current RV residents who agree to work with outreach staff, but the ban will apply to any new arrivals.</p>
