          <p>Peter Coker Jr., one of the defendants in the $100 million New Jersey deli fraud case, was attacked by inmates in a Thai prison while awaiting extradition. His attorney cited the inhumane conditions of the Thai prison and Coker Jr.'s severe cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse in asking for a lenient sentence. Coker Jr., along with his father and another man, artificially inflated the price of Hometown International and E-Waste shares. The judge deemed the companies worthless and the scheme a sophisticated fraud that caused harm.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James and 19 other attorneys general have filed two lawsuits against the Trump administration, alleging that federal funds are being withheld to coerce states into complying with federal immigration enforcement. One lawsuit targets the Department of Homeland Security for threatening to cut off "emergency preparedness" funding, while the other targets the Department of Transportation. The lawsuits claim that the administration is forcing states to choose between disaster preparedness and enabling the administrationâ€™s immigration agenda.

Acting ICE director Todd Lyons stated the facility aims to detain "the worst of the worst" and criticized sanctuary jurisdictions.

          <p>A lawyer representing small businesses argued in federal court that President Trump's tariffs are an "unprecedented and unlawful expansion" of executive power. The lawsuit claims the tariffs violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as the trade deficits cited by Trump do not constitute a national emergency. The Department of Justice defends the tariffs, arguing that Congress permits the president to impose some tariffs, and Trump's invoking of a national emergency makes his power "broader". At least six lawsuits have challenged Trump's tariffs, with this case marking the first time a panel of judges hears a challenge to Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>The NHL suspended Doug Cifu, minority owner and vice chairman of the Florida Panthers, for "unacceptable and inappropriate" social media posts made during an exchange with a Toronto Maple Leafs fan. The exchange, which began with playoff series comments, escalated into a heated debate about the conflict between Israel and Palestinians. Cifu's remarks included a reference to Canada as the "51st state" and were deemed antisemitic by some. The NHL acted swiftly, suspending Cifu from any involvement with the team and the league pending a meeting with the commissioner.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on over 20 companies for facilitating the shipment of Iranian oil to China. The network is accused of helping Iran's Armed Forces General Staff and Sepehr Energy ship oil worth billions of dollars. The sanctioned companies include CCIC Singapore PTE and Qingdao Linkrich International Shipping Agency Co. The sale of this oil has allegedly funded the development of Iranian ballistic missiles and drones, nuclear proliferation, and attacks by the Houthi militant group.</p>

Democrats plan to challenge the Republicans' efforts to write the bill, and protests have occurred outside the Energy and Commerce Committee markup. The GOP plan proposes Medicaid spending cuts by imposing work requirements, conducting more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants. The bill also includes tax provisions, such as a permanent extension of Trumpâ€™s 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act.</p>
