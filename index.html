          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Trump's recently passed spending bill, asserting that it undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk, who leads DOGE, expressed disappointment that the bill increases the budget deficit rather than decreasing it. DOGE claims to have saved $170 billion in taxpayer money by targeting government waste and redundancy, although these claims have faced scrutiny. Musk also noted that the federal bureaucracy is "much worse than I realized" and that DOGE became "the whipping boy for everything." The sweeping One Big Beautiful Bill Act is projected to raise the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant portion of the Swiss village of Blatten has been devastated after a glacier collapse sent a massive avalanche of mud into the valley. The village's 300 residents had been evacuated on May 19 following warnings about the instability of the Birch glacier. Despite the evacuation, one person is reported missing, and numerous homes have been flattened by the event. Climate change is accelerating the melting of glaciers and thawing of permafrost, increasing the risk of similar disasters in other alpine communities, prompting authorities to consider further evacuations in nearby areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposal to redirect $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools faces significant legal and practical challenges, according to education experts. Experts say that federal grants are awarded for specific research purposes through a competitive process, requiring specialized faculty, researchers, and facilities that trade schools typically lack. The American Council on Education (ACE) argues that such a redirection is both illegal and unrealistic, as Harvard's funding is tied to its competitive scientific research grants. While trade schools can apply for similar grants, they generally do not have the infrastructure for the type of research funded by agencies like the NSF and NIH.</p>

          <p>Japan, grappling with government debt twice the size of its economy, faces increasing pressure to curtail debt-fueled spending. The country's long-standing approach of using public spending to address issues like struggling farmers and social security is becoming unsustainable as the Bank of Japan moves away from negative interest rates. Ahead of a contested summer election, the ruling party is facing demands for more government aid, but concerns are growing about Japan's fiscal health. The market for Japanese government bonds has reflected this anxiety, with yields on long-term bonds rising to record highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Israel, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is reportedly considering military action against Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. This tension stems from differing views on exploiting Iran's perceived weakness, with Netanyahu advocating for immediate strikes and Trump favoring negotiation backed by the threat of force. Israeli officials fear that Trump's eagerness for a deal may lead to allowing Iran to maintain its uranium enrichment capabilities. Recent meetings between Israeli and U.S. officials have addressed these concerns, with Trump acknowledging he warned Netanyahu against launching an attack during negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by researchers at the Tokyo University of Agriculture suggests that cats use their sense of smell to differentiate between their owners and strangers. The study found that cats spent twice as long smelling samples from strangers compared to those from their owners, and favored their right nostrils when sniffing stranger scents. Additionally, a cat's personality traits, quantified using the Feline Five test, influenced how they interacted with the odors, with more "neurotic" male cats repeatedly returning to the smell tubes. While the study suggests smell is a tool for recognizing humans, it does not conclude it is the most important mechanism.</p>

          <p>A Canadian ostrich farm, Universal Ostrich Farms, facing a cull of its 400 birds due to avian flu concerns, has garnered support from Trump administration officials. Robert F Kennedy Jr., the US Secretary of Health, and Dr. Mehmet Oz have offered to relocate the birds to Oz's ranch in Florida. Kennedy appealed to Canadian officials to consider studying the ostriches for bird flu antibodies, while Oz offered to rehome the birds. Canadian officials maintain that the cull is necessary to prevent the virus from mutating and spreading.</p>

          <p>The Joshua Tree Art Museum (JTAM), a proposed project in the California desert, faces uncertainty due to a cease and desist order issued to its sponsoring foundation, the Shane Townley Arts Foundation (STAF), by the California attorney general's office. The order, issued two years ago for failure to file required financial reports, prohibits charitable activity, including fundraising for the museum. STAF president Shane Townley claims the foundation's lawyer is working to restore its active status, but the project's future remains uncertain. The article raises questions about the legitimacy of the project, given the legal restrictions and the lack of progress despite reported fundraising efforts.</p>

          <p>Porsche is facing significant headwinds, including declining sales in China, slumping demand for electric vehicles, and newly imposed tariffs by the Trump administration. The 25% tariff on imported cars to the United States, followed by a threat of 50% tariffs on all products from the European Union, has exacerbated the company's challenges. Porsche's CEO, Oliver Blume, described the situation as a "perfect storm," leading the company to scale back its forecast for the year. The company is responding by lowering overhead costs, eliminating jobs, and reintroducing models with combustion engines and expanding its offerings of plug-in hybrid vehicles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing policies that may deter foreign students from enrolling in American universities, despite earlier endorsements of green cards for graduates. The State Department has instructed embassies to delay student interviews, potentially expanding social media vetting for anti-Semitic or pro-terrorist content. Additionally, the administration has revoked thousands of student visas and targeted universities like Harvard for scrutiny of their international student programs. These actions are seen as a shift from welcoming foreign students to prioritizing an "America First" agenda, which could negatively impact the U.S. economy and research institutions.</p>

He said he believed Iran wanted to make a deal and that progress was being made, but he acknowledged that final agreement was still needed.

The measure includes a $1,000 fee for asylum applications and higher fees for work permits and other immigration services, which advocates say are unaffordable for most asylum seekers.

          <p>China has transitioned from a major lender to the largest debt collector in the developing world, potentially undermining poverty reduction efforts and increasing instability. A report from the Lowy Institute indicates that over a quarter of the external debt in developing countries is owed to China, with these countries expected to pay at least $35 billion to Beijing this year. The shift is attributed to diplomatic pressure within China to restructure unsustainable debt and recover outstanding loans. This debt servicing is "crowding out the development spending" in affected countries, which include nations throughout Africa, South America, and Asia. (not investment advice)</p>
