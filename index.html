          <p>Intel's first-quarter earnings surpassed analysts' estimates, but the company issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, leading to a stock drop. CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced plans to cut operational and capital expenses, including potential job cuts, to improve efficiency amid market share losses in the processor business and AI chip competition with Nvidia. The company anticipates $11.8 billion in revenue for the current quarter, lower than the expected $12.82 billion, and expects to break even on earnings. Intel's data center group saw an 8% sales increase, while its PC chip revenue decreased by 8%.</p>

          <p>Terry Branstad, former US ambassador to China, indicated that the US might reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to stimulate trade talks, contingent on reciprocal action from Beijing. He anticipates movement towards easing the tariff burden within the next year, emphasizing Trump's desire for a swift resolution. This comes amid reports of the White House considering slashing tariffs on non-strategic Chinese goods and a recent easing of Trump's tone on China. Currently, China faces tariffs of up to 245%, including those predating the second Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that trade discussions between the US and China are underway, contradicting China's denial of any ongoing negotiations. This follows China's call for the abolishment of "unilateral" tariff measures to resolve trade issues, while the White House had recently added 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory duties and export restrictions from Beijing. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have hinted at easing tensions, but China maintains its willingness to talk only if treated as an equal.</p>

However, Newsom expressed concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the state's economy. The IMF has cut its economic growth forecast for Japan, citing the impact of higher tariffs and a decreasing, aging population.</p>

          <p>President Trump directly appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the attacks on Ukraine, following a deadly strike on Kyiv. This comes as Trump has been pushing for a peace deal, reportedly on terms favorable to Russia. Domestically, a federal judge blocked Trump's attempts to change voting requirements, which were seen as disenfranchising millions. The move follows earlier statements from the administration indicating a desire to ease tensions with Russia.</p>
