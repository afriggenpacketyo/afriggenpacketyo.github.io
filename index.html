          <p>Jiangsu province is rapidly approaching Guangdong's long-held position as China's largest provincial economy, with its GDP growth outpacing Guangdong in the first quarter of this year. Analysts attribute Guangdong's slower growth to its reliance on the property sector, weak consumption, and the impact of trade tensions. The province is undergoing economic restructuring, shifting its focus from real estate to infrastructure and industrial investment, but faces challenges due to debt-ridden property developers. Guangdong and Hainan were the only provinces to experience declines in fixed-asset investment during the same period.</p>

          <p>The future of EV charging extends beyond traditional gas stations, with charging solutions emerging in diverse locations like homes, supermarkets, and parking garages. Despite potential setbacks from policy changes, the EV charging infrastructure is steadily growing, alleviating range anxiety for EV owners. Most EV owners primarily charge at home, utilizing Level 1 or Level 2 chargers, while Level 3 DC fast chargers are available for quicker charging on road trips. Standardization of plugs and streamlined payment systems, such as Plug and Charge, are further enhancing the EV charging experience, with fossil fuel companies also investing in EV charging infrastructure.</p>

Despite the potential risks to Japan, analysts suggest that China's proposal might be aimed at undermining Japan's relationship with the U.S. Japan is seeking exemptions from the tariffs but fears the impact on its domestic producers.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed to clearing the driving test backlog by next summer, aiming to reduce wait times to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026. To achieve this, the government plans to provide at least 10,000 extra driving tests per month, double training capacity for driving examiners, and incentivize qualified DVSA staff to return to examining. The Transport Secretary acknowledged that current wait times are unacceptable and announced a consultation on changes to the test booking system to crack down on test booking bots that exploit learners. A record 1.95 million tests were booked last year.</p>

Hunter's insistence on playing both positions challenges the traditional specialist approach in football, raising questions about training, coaching, and contract structures.</p>

          <p>Eni Aluko, a broadcaster, suggests her career has been negatively impacted by her decision to stand up to Joey Barton, who made defamatory statements about her. Aluko states that she has experienced a reduction in television appearances over the past 18 months. She also describes the double standard faced by women in broadcasting, where limited opportunities create intense competition. Aluko faced threats and abuse on social media following Barton's posts, which a judge ruled were defamatory, leading her to feel self-conscious and disguise herself in public.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Democrats are launching primary challenges against incumbent House Democrats, driven by dissatisfaction with the party's response to President Trump. These Gen Z and millennial candidates aim to bring a new generation of leadership to Washington, focusing on more aggressive strategies and bolder policy proposals. While Democratic leaders are divided on supporting these challenges, some argue that they are necessary to move the party forward and learn from past election losses. These primary campaigns could improve the party by keeping incumbent Democrats accountable and addressing voter frustrations.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein's retrial has begun in New York, with opening arguments focusing on charges of sexual assault brought by three women. The retrial follows the overturning of Weinstein's 2020 conviction, with prosecutors aiming to persuade a jury of his guilt based on the testimonies of the three accusers. The defense is expected to highlight inconsistencies in the women's accounts. Weinstein was separately convicted of sexual assault in California, but has appealed that conviction as well. This trial is viewed as a significant moment for the #MeToo movement, highlighting the ongoing pursuit of justice for survivors of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals that misinformation about measles is prevalent, with a significant proportion of adults uncertain about how to evaluate false claims. The poll found that many people are exposed to false claims about the measles vaccine, such as it being more dangerous than the disease or causing autism. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to believe this misinformation, and parents who believe false claims are more likely to delay or skip recommended vaccines for their children. The poll highlights the challenge of navigating health information in a world saturated with misinformation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's initial rise inspired right-wing populists globally, but his aggressive trade policies and confrontational approach are now causing a "Trump slump" for these leaders. Political leaders who previously embraced Trump's messaging are distancing themselves due to concerns about tariffs and strained relationships with America's allies. In Canada and Australia, conservative populists are struggling to maintain support as voters seek leaders who can confront Trump's policies. While some leaders like Italy's Giorgia Meloni attempt to balance their political survival with a more moderate stance, Trump's appeal is waning in many countries.</p>

          <p>Scotland is considering a ban on greyhound racing as its last track faces closure, sparking debate between animal welfare advocates and racing enthusiasts. Campaigners argue for the ban due to concerns about animal cruelty, citing injuries and euthanasia of unfit dogs. Trainers and owners defend the sport, emphasizing their prioritization of dog welfare. With the potential extinction of the sport in Scotland, a proposed bill aims to prevent any future resurgence. The Scottish government remains unconvinced that a ban is necessary, but MSPs from various parties support the measure.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered a review of US-funded international organizations, including the IMF and World Bank, raising concerns about the future of US support. Project 2025 proposes a US withdrawal from both institutions, labeling them "expensive middlemen." Critics fear that an inward-looking Trump administration could unravel the post-Bretton Woods global financial system. A US withdrawal may create a liquidity crisis for the IMF and World Bank, potentially benefiting China's geopolitical leverage.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stated that China's new trade restrictions on rare earth magnets have impacted the production of the company's Optimus humanoid robots. These robots rely on the restricted exports. Musk said Tesla is working with Beijing to secure approval to access these critical resources, assuring that they will not be used for military purposes. China's restrictions, a response to U.S. tariffs, require exporters of certain rare earth elements to obtain licenses, raising concerns about potential global shortages and prompting the U.S. to consider new tariffs on critical minerals.</p>
