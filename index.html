        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has formally responded to criticism from the White House regarding cost overruns in the renovation of the Fed's headquarters. In a letter, Powell addressed accusations of luxury amenities and directed critics to a new public website providing transparency on the project. The inquiry is part of a broader White House pressure campaign against the Fed for not lowering interest rates, with administration officials accusing Powell of mismanagement. Powell's reply maintained a professional tone, explaining the reasons for the budget issues without engaging in the confrontational rhetoric from the White House.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the court-approved release of all grand jury testimony related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This move follows public pressure and dissatisfaction with a recent Justice Department memo that stated no "client list" existed and confirmed Epstein's death as a suicide. Legal experts note that such a request is highly unusual and the release process could be lengthy, potentially facing objections from individuals named in the testimony. The decision comes amid ongoing political fallout and conspiracy theories surrounding the case, which the Trump administration has been trying to manage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting Exxon Mobil's claim to a right of first refusal on Hess's assets in the Stabroek Block oil development. Exxon, which holds the largest stake in the project, stated it disagrees with the ruling but respects the process. The acquisition is a major strategic victory for Chevron, though it may lead to some headcount reductions as the two companies integrate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The tragic deaths of 27 people at Camp Mystic in Texas are being investigated, with a focus on a history of failed safety measures and delayed warnings. A key factor was the county's failure to secure funding for a modern flood warning system after its old one became defunct in 1999. The camp's owner also reportedly waited over an hour to evacuate after receiving a severe flood alert and had previously secured exemptions to build in a known flood zone. This article explores the sequence of events and systemic failures, from ignored warnings to bureaucratic hurdles, that contributed to the catastrophic loss of life.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will not take further action against the Irish rap group Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their pro-Palestinian comments at the Glastonbury festival. The force concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The investigation, which the band labeled "political policing intimidation," was part of a wider controversy surrounding the group's political statements. The decision to drop the case follows weeks of debate and even comments from the prime minister about the appropriateness of their performance at the festival.</p>

          <p>With silver prices reaching their highest point in over a decade, some investors may be tempted to shift their focus from the much more expensive gold market. This article explores the pros and cons of such a move, noting that while silver offers similar protections against inflation at a lower entry price, it lacks gold's historical stability and value. Instead of a complete switch, it suggests that investors might use the current market momentum as an opportunity to re-evaluate their precious metal allocations within a diversified portfolio. The optimal balance depends on individual goals and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

Scammers often create a sense of urgency, use suspicious links, and employ generic greetings to trick recipients into revealing personal account information. To protect oneself, individuals should never click on suspicious links or reply to the messages. Instead, they should contact their bank directly through official channels, report the scam, and consider using security tools like two-factor authentication and antivirus software for added protection.</p>

          <p>This article examines the political strategies of former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, arguing that his methods of self-portrayal as a "liberator" of an oppressed majority have parallels in contemporary politics. Amin framed his most brutal policies, like the expulsion of Uganda's Asian community, as an "Economic War" to free native Ugandans, a narrative that gained him temporary support. The author suggests this brand of demagoguery, which claims to fight for an aggrieved majority against outsiders, endures today.

If Congress allows the more generous COVID-era subsidies to expire, many consumers will have to pay a much larger share of their premiums, and higher earners could lose subsidies entirely.

          <p>A nonpartisan analysis by the Tax Policy Center reveals that while all income groups will see some savings from a new tax law, higher-income households will benefit the most. The law, which extends the 2017 tax cuts and adds new breaks, will provide an average tax cut of about $2,900 per household in 2026. However, approximately 60% of the total tax breaks will go to the top 20% of earners. For instance, the highest-earning households will save an average of $12,540, or 2.5% of their income, compared to an average savings of just $150 for the lowest-earning households.

          <p>A 39-year-old Canadian man has been charged with hijacking constituting terrorism after seizing control of a small Cessna 172 airplane. Authorities report he threatened a flight instructor at Victoria International Airport before flying to Vancouver, prompting NORAD to scramble F-15 fighter jets. The plane landed safely, and the suspect was arrested. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated the suspect acted with an "ideological motive," and social media posts under his name identify him as a "messenger of Allah" sent to warn about climate change and impending human extinction.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou faces a critical challenge in securing passage for his 44 billion euro budget package, designed to reduce the country's large deficit. His minority government must convince opposition Socialist lawmakers to at least abstain from no-confidence votes, as both the hard-left and far-right parties have threatened to topple his government. The Socialists are demanding significant revisions, arguing the current plan unfairly burdens workers. Bayrou has a two-month window during the parliamentary recess to negotiate and adapt the budget to prevent another political crisis and potential snap elections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted an injunction, permitting the Trump administration's layoffs of approximately 1,400 Department of Education staffers to continue. The layoffs are part of a broader plan to reduce the agency's size. Education stakeholders and student advocates have expressed concern that the downsizing will impede the department's ability to manage federal student aid and support borrowers. The decision comes as the agency is already facing a significant backlog of applications for income-driven repayment plans, potentially making it harder for borrowers to access support and affordable payment options.</p>

          <p>The United States consulate in Wuhan, China, has temporarily suspended all visa interview services due to what it calls "unsafe" indoor temperatures. In a public notice, the consulate reported that the waiting area temperature exceeded 33°C (91°F) and blamed the building's management for delaying the activation of the air conditioning. The notice also criticized management for new security procedures that forced visa applicants to wait outside in the sun. The consulate stated it is working to resolve the issue and will resume services once the health and safety of staff and applicants can be assured.</p>

          <p>This article explores the profound ethical questions facing AI engineers who are offered massive compensation packages to develop potentially world-altering technology. While AI offers the promise of significant social good, it also carries existential risks, from enabling malicious actors to the possibility of hostile superintelligence. The intense competition between labs often leads to safety precautions being sidelined in the race for progress. The author argues that working at a frontier AI lab is only ethical if one has a defensible reason to believe their contribution will make the outcome better, not worse.</p>

          <p>Deadly sectarian violence has erupted in the southern Syrian city of Suweida, with residents describing horrific scenes of killing and destruction. The clashes, which began between local Druze and Bedouin tribes, escalated when government forces were deployed to "restore stability." However, witnesses accuse these forces and affiliated Islamist fighters of carrying out massacres against Druze civilians, including summary executions and looting. The UN has documented killings by government-affiliated groups, while a UK-based monitor reports nearly 600 deaths since the fighting began.</p>

          <p>Sir Grant Shapps, the former UK Defence Secretary, has defended the government's decision to use a secret injunction to conceal a major data breach that exposed the details of thousands of Afghans who had worked with Britain. He stated his primary focus was on "sorting out the mess and saving lives," arguing the secrecy was justified to prevent those on the list from being hunted and killed by the Taliban. The breach, which also included details of some British officials and special forces, occurred in 2022 but was kept from the public until the injunction was recently lifted.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition that affects blood flow in the legs. The diagnosis came after the president noticed swelling, prompting a medical evaluation. According to his physician, the condition is "benign and common" for his age group and tests showed no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure. The physician also attributed recent bruising on Trump's hand to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, stating it was unrelated to the vein condition.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is set to sign winger Bryan Mbeumo after Brentford accepted a £65 million bid for the Cameroon international. The deal, which could rise to £70 million with add-ons, would make the 25-year-old Brentford's largest-ever sale. Mbeumo is expected to become United's third major signing of the summer, valued for his versatility, finishing ability, and high work rate. His threat on the ball was notable last season, where he led the Premier League in carries that directly resulted in a goal, making him a key addition to United's attack.</p>
