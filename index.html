          <p>During a White House meeting intended to improve relations, President Trump confronted South African President Ramaphosa with claims of white farmers being killed and persecuted in South Africa, showing a video with discredited claims of a "white genocide". Ramaphosa responded that the opposition chants in the video do not represent government policy and that South Africa is committed to racial reconciliation. Trump referenced a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances, a claim Ramaphosa denied this has happened. The meeting highlighted existing tensions between the two countries, including South Africa's genocide case against Israel and the US suspension of aid to South Africa. </p>

          <p>The Army is implementing a two-phase plan to separate service members experiencing gender dysphoria, following President Trump's executive order prioritizing military excellence and readiness. The first phase, ending June 6, allows service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria to voluntarily separate with separation pay eligibility based on years of service. The second phase involves involuntary separation, identifying service members through records reflecting their sex at birth. The Army spokesperson stated that every service member will be treated with dignity and respect throughout the process. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers granted to California, which allow the state to set stricter standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Democrats call this move the "nuclear option", arguing it sets a dangerous precedent by overruling the Senate Parliamentarian and bypassing the filibuster. Republicans contend they are acting under the Congressional Review Act, while California officials threaten legal action if the waivers are revoked. The outcome could significantly impact 16 other states and D.C. that have adopted California's standards, with the auto industry divided on the issue. </p>

          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have risen significantly, with some areas experiencing temperatures 4Â°C above normal, creating a marine heatwave. This phenomenon, driven by a warm spring and weak winds, could disrupt marine life breeding patterns and lead to influxes of jellyfish and harmful algae blooms. Scientists are surprised by the heatwave's persistence, lasting over two months, and its potential to influence land temperatures. While the UK is usually protected from severe impacts due to cooler waters, the long-term effects on marine ecosystems remain uncertain. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has granted refugee status to Afrikaners claiming violence and discrimination in South Africa, a move based on claims of a "white genocide." However, some Afrikaners dispute these claims, stating that Whites remain economically strong and that racial motives are not generally a factor in the country's high crime rate. While acknowledging violent attacks on farmers, one Afrikaner cattle farmer emphasized the importance of land sharing and training new Black farmers. Experts suggest that the South African government's stance against Israel and relations with China may have influenced Trump's decision. </p>

          <p>Food banks in Florida are struggling to meet the needs of a growing number of people due to federal funding cuts to USDA programs. These cuts, amounting to 40% of Feeding South Florida's annual budget, have reduced the ability of food banks to purchase food directly from local farmers and producers. The decrease in aid impacts vulnerable populations, with some individuals stating they would likely starve without the food bank's assistance. The situation also affects farmers, who are left with surplus produce they lack the funds to process and distribute. </p>

Flight tracking data indicates the deportation flight landed in Djibouti, East Africa.

          <p>A New York Police Department inspector, Terrell Anderson, has been transferred after allowing dozens of prospective officers to continue in the hiring process despite failing to meet mental health standards. Anderson, who commanded the candidate assessment division, reportedly overrode negative psychological reports for 80 candidates, allowing them to enter the Police Academy. The NYPD is investigating the matter, which comes as the department faces a shortage of officers. Anderson has been recognized as an innovative officer who sought to improve community relations. </p>

          <p>President Trump confronted South African President Ramaphosa about land seizures from white farmers, falsely accusing his government of persecution. However, Trump has used similar government-sanctioned land grabs in the U.S. to build his border wall. The president told his aides to "take the land" for the wall, leading to over 110 lawsuits against landowners in Texas. Trump's claims of discrimination in South Africa are at odds with his own use of eminent domain to seize private property. </p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers have advanced a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion ban, requiring doctors to not face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. The bill, however, does not expand abortion access or include exceptions for rape or incest. The bill defines a "life-threatening" condition as one capable of causing death. The bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors navigating exceptions under the abortion ban. </p>

The decision follows investigations into the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.
