        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly defended Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial for an alleged coup attempt. Trump characterized the prosecution as a politically motivated "witch hunt" and called for an end to the legal proceedings. In response, current Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration asserted the country's sovereignty and the integrity of its judicial process, rejecting any foreign interference. The exchange highlights the continued political alliance between Trump and Bolsonaro, both of whom have challenged the outcomes of their respective presidential election losses and faced subsequent legal scrutiny.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 15:50:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House and Texas Republicans are pushing back against criticism that the National Weather Service (NWS) failed to provide adequate warning for the catastrophic floods in Texas. White House officials called accusations of blame against the Trump administration a "depraved lie," detailing a timeline of alerts they argue were timely and sufficient. Conversely, Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer have called for an investigation into whether budget and staffing cuts at the NWS under the administration compromised its forecasting capabilities. This political dispute unfolds as the death toll from the disaster continues to rise, with officials emphasizing the tragedy should not be a time for partisan attacks.</p>

          <p>The devastating flash floods in central Texas claimed the lives of dozens, including young summer campers, counselors, and local residents who acted heroically in their final moments. Among the victims were camp counselors like Chloe Childress and director Dick Eastland, who died trying to save campers, and a father, Julian Ryan, who sacrificed himself to help his family escape their flooded home. The article shares personal tributes from family and community members, painting a portrait of the lives lost, from 8-year-old twin sisters to dedicated teachers. These stories highlight the profound personal tragedies behind the disaster's staggering death toll.</p>

          <p>Russia's recently appointed Minister of Transport, Roman Starovoy, has reportedly died by suicide just hours after being dismissed from his post by President Vladimir Putin. State media, citing the national Investigative Committee, reported that Starovoy fatally shot himself in his car. The dismissal came amid significant air traffic disruptions in Russia caused by Ukrainian drone attacks. Shortly after Starovoy's death was reported, a second senior transport official, Andrei Korneichuk, also died suddenly of a reported cardiac arrest during a meeting. These incidents add to a series of sudden deaths among high-profile Russian officials and business leaders.</p>

          <p>A report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) reveals that over 158 million Americans cast ballots in the 2024 presidential election, with more than 211 million actively registered to vote. The data indicates that voter turnout was 64.7% of the citizen voting-age population, the second-highest rate in the last five presidential elections, trailing only the 2020 contest. The report also details voting methods, showing a shift back towards in-person voting compared to the pandemic-era 2020 election. Nearly 73% of voters cast their ballots in person, either on or before Election Day, while mail-in voting accounted for just over 30% of all ballots.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in central Texas, which has claimed at least 90 lives, resulted from a confluence of extreme weather and systemic vulnerabilities. The storm, fueled by remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, dumped an unprecedented amount of rain on a region known as "flash flood alley." While climate change contributes to more intense rainfall, gaps in the emergency warning system exacerbated the tragedy. Alerts were sent in the middle of the night to areas with spotty cell service, and some counties lacked modern flood sirens due to cost concerns. The article explains that while forecasting has improved, effective disaster mitigation requires a chain of planning, infrastructure, and clear public communication that appeared to have gaps in this event.</p>

However, policy experts clarify that this does not change the fundamental way Social Security benefits themselves are taxed. Critics argue the relief disproportionately benefits wealthier seniors and will not help low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax, while also potentially increasing financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund.

Advanced scanning of the fossil revealed unique details, and analysis of its teeth suggests the seagull-sized reptile fed on hard-shelled prey like primitive, armored fish. The discovery was made in a rich fossil bed that has preserved a snapshot of a diverse ecosystem from the late Triassic period, offering new insights into this transitional era of evolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration announced it will delay a broad slate of tariff hikes until August 1, but simultaneously revealed new, targeted tariffs on several countries including Japan, South Korea, and South Africa. The new levies, with rates up to 40%, will also take effect on August 1. This dual approach of delay and targeted escalation has created further uncertainty for global trade, with the president threatening even higher duties if countries retaliate. The move comes as negotiations with key partners like the European Union and Japan continue, with the White House indicating it is close to some deals but requires more time to finalize them.

          <p>A suspect was shot and killed by law enforcement after opening fire on a U.S. Border Patrol building in McAllen, Texas. The individual, identified as 27-year-old Ryan Louis Mosqueda, fired numerous rounds at the entrance of the federal facility located at the McAllen International Airport but did not gain entry. Border Patrol agents and local police returned fire, neutralizing the suspect. Two officers and a Border Patrol employee sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the incident. A motive is not yet known, and authorities found additional weapons and ammunition in the suspect's vehicle, which had Michigan license plates.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 76,000 immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua, effective in early September. This decision removes long-standing work permits and protections from deportation for individuals who have lived in the U.S., many since the 1990s, after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America. The administration argued that conditions in those countries have improved enough to no longer warrant the special status. This move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs and could place tens of thousands of long-term residents at risk of deportation.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has bombed the Galaxy Leader, a British-owned cargo ship that was hijacked by Houthi rebels in November 2023. The strike was part of a broader wave of Israeli airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, which Israel said was a response to repeated Houthi attacks. The IDF stated that the terror group had fitted the captured vessel with a radar system, turning it into a floating observation platform to aid attacks on international shipping. The seizure of the vessel, which is partly owned by an Israeli businessman, had become a prominent symbol of Houthi aggression in the Red Sea.</p>

          <p>An analysis of emergency alerts shows that the National Weather Service (NWS) issued 22 warnings for the Kerr County area as catastrophic flooding unfolded, with the language growing increasingly urgent over several hours. The first alert for the county was sent at 1:14 a.m. on July 4, but the first to use the most severe language, "SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!" was not sent until 4:03 a.m. By this time, the Guadalupe River was already rising rapidly. This timeline provides critical context to the debate over whether residents and campers received adequate and timely warnings, as local officials did not issue their own separate alerts and relied solely on the NWS system.</p>

          <p>The film "F1," starring Brad Pitt, has become Apple's most successful theatrical movie to date, surpassing $293 million at the global box office. Distributed by Warner Bros.

A significant portion of its success is attributed to a strong partnership with IMAX, which accounted for over $60 million of its total ticket sales. While the film's high production and marketing budget means it still has a way to go to reach profitability, its box office performance marks a significant milestone for the tech giant's growing presence in the film industry.

In another story from Seattle, two young brothers, both champion chess players, decided to donate their tournament winnings to help a 10-year-old boy suffering from chronic pancreatitis.

In response, Winn has described the article as "highly misleading" and stated that she and her husband are seeking legal advice, reaffirming that the book is "the true story of our journey."

A federal judge in Maryland, who is overseeing a civil case related to his wrongful removal, expressed frustration at the government's lack of clarity.

          <p>The United States has recorded its highest annual number of measles cases in 33 years, with the tally surpassing 1,277 infections. The surge is largely driven by a significant outbreak in Texas and occurs amid falling childhood vaccination rates and the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment. Health experts warn that the official count likely underestimates the true scope of the problem. The vast majority of cases are among unvaccinated individuals. This public health crisis unfolds as vaccine policy faces upheaval, with experts expressing concern that the U.S. is losing its grip on a disease that was declared eliminated just over two decades ago.</p>
