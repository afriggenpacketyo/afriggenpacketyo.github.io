          <p>China's state media has released details of a military encounter from last year where a Chinese J-16 fighter jet successfully expelled two foreign stealth fighters from its airspace. The pilot, Li, described performing aggressive maneuvers, including flying inverted just meters above one of the foreign jets, to gain a tactical advantage. After locking his targeting systems onto both aircraft, the foreign jets reportedly departed the area. The report did not specify the nationality of the stealth fighters but highlighted the incident as a demonstration of the People's Liberation Army Air Force's capability in defending its territorial claims.</p>

          <p>Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona was not sworn into office this week by House Speaker Mike Johnson, leaving her unable to officially represent her district. Grijalva speculates the delay is intentional, linked to her plan to provide the final signature on a discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Speaker Johnson's office has indicated she will be sworn in when the House returns to full session, blaming the current government shutdown for the procedural pause. This has left Grijalva in a state of political limbo, unable to access her office or vote on behalf of her constituents.</p>

          <p>Research from the organization Pregnancy Justice reveals that hundreds of people across 16 states have been charged with pregnancy-related crimes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The article highlights that these prosecutions often target low-income women for alleged substance use during pregnancy, utilizing laws intended to protect children, not fetuses. This trend reflects a growing acceptance of "fetal personhood," which could lead to increased surveillance and criminalization of pregnant individuals for a wide range of behaviors. Critics warn this approach worsens health outcomes and sets a dangerous precedent for policing reproductive health.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is using her dissenting opinions to issue stark warnings about threats to the rule of law in the United States. In a notable dissent against a ruling that limited federal judges' power to block presidential actions, she cited a book on the legal structure of Nazi Germany, drawing a parallel to the current judicial drift. Legal scholars interpret her writings as a deliberate message to the American public and lower courts about the dangers of unchecked executive power. Despite facing criticism from the court's conservative majority, Jackson continues to be a prolific and forceful dissenter on key issues like voting rights and environmental protections.</p>

          <p>Munich Airport, one of Germany's largest, has reopened after being shut down twice in 24 hours due to confirmed drone sightings near its runways. The closures impacted thousands of passengers and caused significant delays, adding to a series of similar incidents at critical infrastructure sites across Europe. Authorities are investigating the source of the drones, with concerns raised about potential Russian involvement, though no definitive link has been established.

          <p>A uranium enrichment facility in Eunice, New Mexico, operated by the European company Urenco, is significantly expanding its capacity to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This growth is driven by the electricity needs of AI data centers and a push for domestic manufacturing, alongside a U.S. ban on Russian uranium imports set for 2028. As the only commercial enrichment plant in the U.S., the facility is crucial to Washington's ambitious plans to triple or quadruple nuclear energy production by 2050. However, the expansion faces challenges, including bottlenecks in the nuclear fuel supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy Jr.'s leadership, describing his approach as a "hostile takeover" of the agency. In testimony, Houry stated that Kennedy avoided meetings with top health officials even during deadly outbreaks like measles and pushed to alter the childhood immunization schedule without scientific basis. She claims her attempts to provide Kennedy with accurate information were consistently rejected, leading to her resignation along with other senior leaders. Her account paints a picture of a public health system being dismantled by a leader who shuns expertise.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk's assassination, many Black, brown, and queer college students are expressing unease with his posthumous deification and the resulting impact on free speech. Students interviewed feel Kirk's rhetoric was hateful and that marginalized communities are being unfairly blamed for his death, leading to racist threats against Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The article details incidents where students faced disciplinary action or expulsion for mocking Kirk's death, raising concerns about censorship and the suppression of dissenting views. This has created a climate of fear and consternation on campuses across the country.</p>

          <p>Starship Technologies, a venture from Skype co-founder Ahti Heinla, is expanding its autonomous robot delivery service, which is already operating in cities across the UK, Finland, and Estonia. The company claims its six-wheeled robots can deliver groceries and food more cheaply than human drivers, making the service viable even in less-dense suburban areas. Heinla believes this technology is on the cusp of widespread adoption and will address the growing demand for deliveries without displacing human jobs. While facing competition and regulatory hurdles, Starship has already completed over 8 million deliveries and is poised for significant growth.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in Massachusetts, William Young, delivered a powerful condemnation of the Trump administration's actions against non-citizen residents, ruling that it violated the First Amendment by targeting pro-Palestinian foreign scholars for deportation. In his opinion, Judge Young went beyond the legal specifics to personally rebuke the president for ignoring the Constitution and bullying dissenters, stating that freedom of speech applies to all people within U.S. borders, not just citizens. The judge framed the case as a critical defense of American values against an administration that he fears is exploiting divisions to undermine core constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>A new progressive party in the UK, intended to be a left-wing alternative to Labour and co-led by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, is already suffering from public infighting and deep internal divisions. The conflict became public when Corbyn disavowed a membership drive email sent by Sultana's faction, leading to accusations of a "sexist boys' club" and a subsequent public meltdown. The turmoil reflects fundamental disagreements on vision and strategy, from identity politics to the party's focus on electoralism versus grassroots activism. This disunity threatens to render the party ineffective and potentially split the left-leaning vote, benefiting right-wing rivals.</p>

          <p>The introduction of "Tilly Norwood," a hyper-realistic AI-generated actress, has sparked panic and condemnation throughout Hollywood. Created by UK-based AI production company Particle6, Norwood is being marketed as the first of a new wave of "synthetic talent" for film, TV, and advertising. In response, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) and prominent actors have voiced strong opposition, arguing that creativity should remain human-centered and warning against the replacement of human performers. While major talent agencies have so far refused to represent the AI avatar, the controversy highlights the growing anxiety among actors about their job security in the age of generative AI.</p>

          <p>The detention of dozens of foreign nationals in Venezuela is causing growing alarm among their families as political tensions escalate between the Maduro government and the United States. Human rights groups argue that these individuals, including humanitarian workers and business people, are effectively being held as political hostages to extort concessions from foreign governments. The recent buildup of U.S. naval forces in the Caribbean for an anti-narcotics mission, which Maduro views as a threat, has heightened fears for the prisoners' safety. Relatives and advocates are caught between hoping for diplomatic resolution and fearing that increased pressure could lead to harsher treatment.</p>

The investigation is focused on determining whether Al-Shamie, who was out on bail for an alleged sexual assault, acted alone or was part of a larger network.

Analysts suggest that unlike previous shutdowns, Bitcoin's current market position makes it more responsive to risks associated with U.S. government instability.

Such an outcome would align the Czech Republic more closely with Hungary and Slovakia, potentially creating another challenge to EU unity on issues related to Russia.

          <p>Chinese director Lou Ye's new film, "An Unfinished Film," has garnered international acclaim for its courageous, semi-documentary portrayal of a film crew quarantined near Wuhan during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. The article argues that the film's significance lies in its honest depiction of the lockdown experience, a topic heavily censored by the Chinese state. The film captures the chaos of "zero COVID" but is also notable for what it omits, particularly the mass deaths that followed the policy's abrupt end. This silence reflects a broader societal reticence and unprocessed trauma, making the movie an essential but incomplete examination of a painful recent history.</p>
