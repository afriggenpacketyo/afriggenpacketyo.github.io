        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's reelection, Australian markets experienced a downturn in early trading, reflecting investor caution amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index edged down by 0.29%, reversing previous gains, while the Australian dollar slightly depreciated against the U.S. dollar. This movement occurred as several major Asian markets, including Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and China, remained closed for public holidays. The market's reaction suggests a desire for policy stability, although U.S. futures also dipped, contrasting with Wall Street's strong performance the previous week.</p>

          <p>Monday's British newspapers are dominated by several key stories, including counter-terrorism police raids across England, resulting in multiple arrests related to a foiled terror plot. The Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph highlight these operations, with the latter reporting renewed calls to proscribe Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp. Political news also features prominently, with attention focused on the government's response to Reform UK's success in local elections. The Financial Times details the pressure on the prime minister to reverse cuts to the winter fuel allowance, while The Guardian focuses on comments from Louise Haigh urging the prime minister to avoid a lurch to the right. A feature on VE day commemorations also takes center stage.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on all foreign-produced movies, citing a need to revive the struggling American film industry. In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed that other countries are offering incentives that draw filmmakers and studios away from the United States, posing a national security threat. He authorized the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to begin instituting the tariff, aiming to ensure movies are made in America again. This proposal follows pauses in Trump's other tariff plans due to market instability and backlash, as he navigates trade negotiations with countries like China.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to reopen and significantly expand Alcatraz, the former prison island near San Francisco, to house America's most violent offenders. Trump stated that this move would serve as a symbol of law, order, and justice, addressing the issue of repeat criminal offenders. The Bureau of Prisons stated it would comply with all Presidential Orders. Alcatraz, which operated as a maximum-security prison from 1934 to 1963, housed infamous criminals like Al Capone. The island currently operates as a popular tourist site, managed by the National Park Service after being included as part of a new National Park Service site in 1972.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes how President Trump's policies are influencing global elections, particularly in Canada and Australia, where center-left parties saw their fortunes revived while parties that borrowed from the MAGA playbook lost out. In Canada, Prime Minister Mark Carney campaigned on an explicitly anti-Trump message, while in Australia, Anthony Albanese benefited from an anti-Trump sentiment. The article suggests that voters are considering Trump's impact when making decisions, with conservative leaders struggling to shake off associations with the American president. Singapore also saw a boost for the incumbent People’s Action Party due to concerns about Trump's trade wars.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that George Simion, a right-wing nationalist promising to “Make Romania Great Again,” won the first round of Romania’s presidential election, contrasting the trend of voters punishing candidates friendly to President Trump.

The results rebuke a previous annulled election victory by ultranationalist Calin Georgescu.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing to delay childbearing, experts like Vardit Ravitsky caution against over-reliance on the procedure, citing costs and no guarantees. Ravitsky fears women may view egg freezing as a guaranteed solution, overlooking the risks and financial burdens involved. Fertility specialist Dr. Lucky Sekhon emphasizes the drop-off at every stage, from fertilization to implantation. Critics also argue that companies offering egg freezing as a benefit may be motivated by retaining female employees rather than genuinely helping them. A better solution, Ravitsky argues, would be to implement policies that support motherhood at younger ages.</p>

The number of egg freezing procedures has increased significantly, with women citing reasons such as career goals and not finding the right partner. While egg freezing does not guarantee a baby, it provides a sense of control and reduces the pressure of the biological clock. Dr. Tomer Singer predicts that egg freezing will become routine, with sex primarily for pleasure. However, critics caution against viewing egg freezing as a certain solution and emphasize the need for more education and affordable access.</p>

The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. Dr. Tomer Singer views egg freezing as revolutionary, allowing women to delay childbearing without compromising on their choice of partner. However, experts caution that egg freezing is not a guarantee, with success rates varying based on age and the number of eggs frozen. The procedure's high cost raises concerns about accessibility and potential exploitation by fertility companies. Some believe society should better support women having children at younger ages.</p>

          <p>This 60 Minutes article discusses President Trump's executive orders targeting law firms connected to investigations or legal cases related to him or his allies, which has sparked concerns about the rule of law. These orders threaten to bar attorneys from courthouses and federal agencies, potentially bankrupting firms. Nine major firms made a deal with the White House, agreeing to provide nearly $1 billion in legal services to causes supported by Trump. Critics argue that these actions undermine the right to counsel and create a climate of fear within the legal community, with some lawyers resigning in protest. A federal judge has since blocked one of the orders, calling it unconstitutional.</p>

The decision by the eight producers led by Saudi Arabia to boost output by 411,000 barrels per day in June caused U.S. crude to fall by over 4%. This move, following a similar production surge in May, has raised concerns about an oversupplied market and the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on demand.

The article argues that President Trump misjudged China's political strategy and its capacity to withstand economic hardship.
