          <p>DoorDash is set to acquire British food delivery firm Deliveroo for $3.9 billion, marking a significant expansion into overseas markets.

This acquisition will allow DoorDash to operate in over 40 countries, covering a combined population of over 1 billion people, providing local businesses with essential tools and technology to thrive.

          <p>In a surprising turn of events, Friedrich Merz failed to secure the necessary votes to become German chancellor in the first parliamentary vote, falling short of the required majority. This setback has halted the parliamentary session and prompted discussions on the next steps, as the German constitution mandates a second vote within 14 days. Merz's Social Democratic Union, in coalition with the Christian Social Union and the Social Democratic Party, had been expected to form a government after signing their coalition agreement.

          <p>The acquisition of Deliveroo by DoorDash exemplifies the diverging fortunes of US and UK stock markets, with DoorDash using its greater financial strength to acquire its UK rival. While both companies began similarly, DoorDash's valuation is now 35 times that of Deliveroo, reflecting a broader trend of companies shunning the London Stock Exchange for US listings due to higher valuations and greater investor appetite. This trend underscores the challenges faced by the UK in retaining its major firms, as US markets offer more attractive opportunities for growth and expansion. BlackRock and JP Morgan have noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering restricting visa applications from nationalities perceived as more likely to overstay their visas and claim asylum, including those from Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. This crackdown aims to address the issue of individuals entering the UK legally on work or study visas and then seeking asylum. Labour's plans to reduce migration include making it a criminal offence to endanger the lives of others at sea, to target small boat crossings, and cutting demand for overseas hires by developing training plans for sectors that are currently reliant on migrant workers. A new immigration white paper is expected to provide further details on these plans.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump's repeated musings about serving a third term are not mere jokes but a dangerous pattern of testing constitutional limits. Drawing parallels to historical concerns about unchecked presidential power, the editorial emphasizes Trump's history of pushing outlandish ideas into mainstream discourse. The board asserts that Trump's behavior suggests a genuine desire to wield power without limits, citing instances where he has ignored judicial rulings and attempted to circumvent constitutional amendments. The editorial urges Republican leaders to forcefully assert the clarity of the law and reject any attempts to evade the two-term limit.</p>

          <p>Liz Peek argues that the emerging buzz around Kamala Harris' potential 2028 presidential run underscores the Democratic Party's current leadership vacuum.

She contends that Harris' reliance on far-left policies and messaging alienates moderate voters, hindering her chances of success. Peek concludes that Democrats must move beyond their hatred of Donald Trump and develop a winning platform to regain voter support.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deep funding cuts are rolling back progress in the fight against HIV in the South, reversing earlier efforts to end the epidemic. Community-based groups and health departments are reducing HIV testing and outreach due to delayed or slashed federal funds. Trump's administration is barring funds from programs built around diversity, equity, and inclusion, impacting communities at highest risk of HIV. Experts warn that eliminating federal funds for HIV prevention could lead to a significant increase in new infections and AIDS-related deaths. The cuts have shaken every state, but the South is acutely vulnerable when it comes to HIV.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether Novak Djokovic can continue his Grand Slam dominance past the age of 36, a feat rarely achieved in tennis history. While Djokovic has defied age with his exceptional fitness and dedication, historical trends suggest that winning majors in the late 30s is exceedingly difficult. Despite recent struggles, some experts believe Djokovic's motivation and past successes at major tournaments give him a chance to add to his already impressive record. The article notes that even if Djokovic doesn’t win another Slam it’ll just mean that the Big Three will be forever linked with winning their last at 36.</p>

          <p>President Trump's increased use of the military for immigration enforcement at the southern border is raising legal questions about the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of federal troops in civilian law enforcement. The designation of areas along the border as military installations allows federal military personnel to temporarily detain and search individuals, effectively bypassing the Act. Experts like Mark Nevitt and Dan Maurer express concerns about the blurring of military and law enforcement roles, the potential for excessive force, and the impact on military readiness and recruitment. There are also concerns that the President is framing the border as being "under attack."</p>

          <p>Despite facing massive tariffs due to the closure of a trade loophole, experts believe Temu and Shein will remain dominant forces in the U.S. e-tail scene. The companies are adapting by localizing their supply chains, onboarding U.S. sellers, and utilizing local warehouses to mitigate tariff impacts. While prices may increase, experts remain confident that Temu and Shein will continue to offer competitive prices due to their agile supply chains and ability to operate on razor-thin margins. Furthermore, Trump's trade tariffs on China and other trade partners have also affected American retailers and e-commerce sites like Amazon.</p>

          <p>Hamas has stated that there is "no point" in further talks on a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, after Israel approved an expanded offensive. The offensive, which Israeli officials say will involve displacing the majority of Gaza's population, is aimed at returning hostages and defeating Hamas. UN Secretary General António Guterres has warned that expanded Israeli ground operations would lead to more civilian casualties. President Trump has said the US would help supply food to people in Gaza, while accusing Hamas of stealing aid.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose 100% tariffs on foreign-made films has created confusion and unease in Hollywood, with industry leaders unsure how the policy would be implemented. The threat, prompted by concerns that foreign tax breaks are harming the U.S. film industry, has stalled production plans and stymied studios as they try to assess potential new costs. While it's unclear if the tariffs will actually be implemented, the mere threat has already damaged the industry, with production plans stalled and stymied while studios work out what new costs they must now factor in.</p>

          <p>For the better part of the last decade, China’s economic narrative has been defined by one central doctrine: “supply-side reform”. Now the time has come for a new pivot – one that prioritises the other half of the equation: demand. Over the past 10 years, China has tackled bloated industrial sectors, reined in speculation in the property market and suppressed the most polluting, inefficient industries. Companies like BYD DJI and TikTok owner ByteDance have become household names across continents.</p>

The funding will support projects such as converting office space into consulting rooms and building new practices, addressing concerns about inadequate infrastructure. While the government acknowledges this investment as a significant step, it cautions that it will not solve all existing problems immediately. The funding is intended to improve patient experience and enable doctors to treat more patients, but the Royal College of GPs emphasizes the need for long-term investment.</p>
