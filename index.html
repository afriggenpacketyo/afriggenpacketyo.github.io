            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Ábrego García, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, despite court orders for his return to the US. Van Hollen shared a photo of the meeting and conveyed Ábrego García's message to his wife. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has refused to release Ábrego García, who the White House alleges is an MS-13 gang member, a claim disputed in court. The Justice Department has not charged Abrego Garcia with any gang-related crimes. The situation remains unresolved, with the DOJ appealing the return order.</p>

            <p>The global economy is facing challenges due to escalating trade wars and policy changes driven by the US administration. While initial statements from the US administration were dismissed, its trade wars and tariff policies have introduced volatility into global markets and undermined trade foundations. The lack of a clear international response is concerning, given the significant economic and political stakes involved. Tariffs impose costs, disrupt supply chains, and harm consumers, raising questions about the sustainability of this strategy and the potential for long-term economic consequences.

            <p>The Trump administration has halted the Empire Wind 1 offshore wind project in New York, raising concerns about the future of clean energy development in the US. The Interior Department cited insufficient analysis, despite a thorough environmental review.

            <p>The Trump administration is targeting Harvard University by threatening to revoke its tax-exempt status. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is reportedly planning to enact this demand, which could cost Harvard millions of dollars annually. This move is part of an ongoing battle, and a significant escalation on Trump’s attack on Harvard and his aggressive, multi-pronged assault on higher education institutions. The White has urged Harvard to change its hiring, teaching and admissions practices to help fight antisemitism on campus.</p>

            <p>Canada's housing affordability crisis continues to plague the nation, with home prices in major cities like Vancouver reaching exorbitant levels. The crisis has become a key issue in the upcoming federal election, with voters questioning whether any party has a viable plan to address the problem. While each party has proposed solutions, such as increasing housing construction, experts caution that these measures may not be sufficient to reverse the trend of rising home prices and declining affordability.

            <p>Bin workers in Birmingham are on strike due to the removal of Waste Recycling and Collection Officers (WRCO) roles, leading to potential pay cuts. The dispute centers around the council's plan to reduce crew sizes and eliminate the higher-paid WRCO position. The union claims some workers could face pay cuts of up to £8,000, while the council disputes this figure. The strike has resulted in waste accumulation throughout the city, highlighting the impact of the labor dispute.</p>

Kanter also noted the entire advertising ecosystem has suffered because of Google's practices, adding that news publishers and other content providers have been "overcharged and underpaid."
