          <p>A coalition of 25 countries, including the U.K., Canada, and Japan, has issued a joint statement demanding an immediate end to the war in Gaza. The statement strongly condemns what it calls the "drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children," highlighting that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking assistance. The nations urged Israel to comply with international humanitarian law and facilitate proper aid distribution. Israel's government rejected the statement, asserting it is disconnected from reality and holding Hamas responsible for prolonging the conflict and for the welfare of the remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma is moving forward with its initial public offering, aiming to raise up to $1 billion by selling shares priced between $25 and $28 each. This pricing could give the company a fully diluted valuation of up to $16.4 billion, significantly higher than its 2024 tender offer valuation of $12.5 billion. The IPO follows a collapsed $20 billion acquisition deal by Adobe, which faced regulatory hurdles. Figma's preliminary second-quarter results show continued revenue growth, with sales projected to be up to 41% higher year-over-year, signaling strength in a slow tech IPO market.

          <h2>Microsoft SharePoint Servers Targeted in Active Cyberattacks Affecting Global Organizations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 12:25:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft has issued a warning about active cyberattacks targeting a vulnerability in its on-premises SharePoint software, a tool widely used by businesses and governments for collaboration. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) stated the flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to gain full access to SharePoint content and execute malicious code. Security researchers at Palo Alto Networks believe thousands of organizations globally could be affected, as attackers are already exploiting the vulnerability to steal data and establish persistent backdoors. Microsoft has released patches for some versions and is working on a fix for the remaining vulnerable software.</p>

          <p>A Montreal man, Luciano Frattolin, has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of his 9-year-old daughter, Melina, in upstate New York. Authorities allege Frattolin killed his daughter during a vacation, concealed her body in a shallow pond near Ticonderoga, and then fabricated a story about her being abducted by strangers. The false report triggered a massive search and an Amber Alert. Police grew suspicious after finding inconsistencies in his account of the events. A motive for the alleged killing is still under investigation, and Frattolin is also charged with concealment of a corpse.</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced the airline is considering increasing the bonus paid to staff for identifying passengers with oversized bags. Employees currently receive €1.50 for each oversized bag they intercept, a practice the airline says is aimed at eliminating boarding delays and ensuring fairness for the vast majority of passengers who comply with baggage rules. The airline states that less than 1% of its customers pay oversized baggage fees, which can be as high as £75. The discussion comes as Ryanair reported a significant increase in profits for the first quarter, reaching €820 million.</p>

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has warned that the future of public service broadcasting is at risk if younger audiences do not engage with its content.

Ofcom's report noted that children spend significantly more time on YouTube than on all public service broadcasters combined.

          <p>During a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced that Germany will contribute to providing a total of five Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine. This marks an increase from the two units Berlin had previously pledged to help finance. The commitment comes as Ukraine's defense minister stated that Kyiv needs an additional $6 billion in military support for 2025 to ramp up its domestic weapons production. Ukrainian officials continue to stress the urgent need for more air defense, long-range weapons, and artillery to counter Russia's ongoing aggression.</p>

          <p>Subway has named Jonathan Fitzpatrick, a veteran of Burger King and former head of Driven Brands, as its new CEO. The appointment follows the retirement of John Chidsey and the sandwich chain's $9.6 billion sale to private equity firm Roark Capital last year. Fitzpatrick takes the helm during a challenging period for the fast-food industry, as consumers cut back on dining out and seek value. Subway, the largest U.S. restaurant chain by store count, has faced declining sales and market share erosion amid stiff competition from other sandwich and fast-casual brands.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies a common misconception about filing for a federal tax extension. While requesting an extension from the IRS grants an additional six months to submit tax return paperwork, it does not postpone the deadline for payment. Taxpayers are still required to estimate their tax liability and pay what they owe by the original April 15 deadline to avoid late payment penalties and interest charges. For those unable to pay their full tax bill, the IRS offers several options, including installment agreements and, in cases of severe financial hardship, an Offer in Compromise to settle the debt for a lesser amount.</p>

          <p>A team of divers has discovered the wreckage of HMS Nottingham, a Royal Navy warship sunk during World War One, 109 years after it was torpedoed by a German submarine. The ship was found 60 miles off the coast of Scotland at a depth of 82 meters by ProjectXplore, an international shipwreck-hunting project. Thirty-eight crew members were killed in the 1916 attack, but the ship's final resting place remained a mystery despite numerous search attempts. Divers positively identified the wreck by its dimensions, equipment, and an embossed "Nottingham" name stamp found on the stern.</p>

The findings corroborate long-held fears of local residents and highlight the lasting health dangers of nuclear waste.

The proposal includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on land formerly occupied by a golf club. The group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful because the land was protected by covenants requiring it to be kept open for public recreation. The judge ruled that the planning authority had properly exercised its judgment in approving the plans, which the club says will also deliver newly accessible parkland.</p>

This suggests the administration is prepared to let the steep levies take effect to gain leverage in trade talks. Bessent emphasized that the quality of the deals is more important than the timing, casting further doubt on whether the administration sees August 1 as a fixed deadline for finalizing agreements.
