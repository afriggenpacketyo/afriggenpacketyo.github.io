        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office clarified his stance on transgender women, stating that he no longer believes trans women are women, following a UK Supreme Court judgment. The ruling clarified that under the Equality Act, a woman is defined as a biological woman, impacting the rights of transgender women to access women-only spaces and services. Starmer's spokesperson emphasized that the Prime Minister has consistently stated "a woman is an adult female" and that the court's decision provided necessary clarity for guidance. The PM has stated that trans women should be treated with dignity and respect.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged past $90,000 for the first time since March, fueled by investors seeking refuge from turbulent stock markets and a weakening US dollar. This increase coincides with President Trump's intensified criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which has contributed to market instability. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin experienced significant inflows, indicating renewed investor interest in the cryptocurrency as a hedge against economic uncertainty. While Bitcoin's correlation with equities has historically been high, it has recently shown signs of decoupling, demonstrating resilience amidst market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices have soared to over $3,500 an ounce, reaching a record high due to President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve and escalating trade tensions, which have shaken investor confidence in the U.S. economy.

The IMF also cut the US growth forecast to 1.8% citing trade tensions. Central banks' increasing gold reserves further support the precious metal's rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stock futures are showing positive signs after a sharp decline on Monday, triggered by President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a significant drop amid investor uncertainty about tariffs and Powell's future role. However, positive factors, including potential for a US-India trade deal and Republican support for Fed independence, may be contributing to the market's rebound. Despite this, Trump's trade policies continue to impact global markets, with mixed trading results in Asia and Europe.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly lowered its 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 1.8% from 2.7%, attributing the decline to the negative impacts of President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs. These tariffs have disrupted trade relationships and triggered countermeasures from trading partners, posing a major headwind for the U.S. economy. The IMF also increased its estimate of a U.S. recession to 40%, and revised its global growth forecast downward to 2.8%. The report also revised inflation expectations to 3% reflecting stubborn price dynamics in the services sector as well as a recent uptick in the growth of the price of core goods.</p>

          <p>The American fishing industry, which generates nearly $100 billion annually, faces increasing threats from climate change as rising river temperatures deplete oxygen levels and harm fish populations. This is particularly impacting the fly fishing industry, where guides are finding it harder to make a living due to prolonged periods of unsuitable water temperatures. Organizations are working to restore river flow and protect banks to mitigate the effects of climate change and preserve the local fishing-tourism economy. Protecting the rivers is essential to preserve the magic of the industry.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent actions against Harvard University, including revoking federal research funding and threats to its nonprofit status, are tied to a broader right-wing strategy to undermine progressive institutions. Influenced by figures like Curtis Yarvin, who advocate for dismantling "the Cathedral" of elite academic and media institutions, the administration seeks to force universities to align with conservative viewpoints. This assault on Harvard is seen as a weaponization of government power, potentially transforming the relationship between universities and the federal government. While Harvard is fighting back, the longer-term implications for academic freedom and research funding are significant.</p>

          <p>Joseph Mallord William Turner, born in 1775, is celebrated 250 years after his birth as one of the greatest Romantic painters. Turner, known for capturing the grandeur of nature and the power of machines, mastered the interplay of light, color, and atmosphere, finding inspiration in nature and his travels across Europe. His artistic style evolved, particularly during his visits to Venice, becoming increasingly abstract and mystical, influencing later Impressionists like Claude Monet. Today, Turner is considered a pioneer of modernism and a forerunner of abstract art.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is gathering private medical records from various federal and commercial databases to support Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new autism study. This initiative will provide researchers with access to comprehensive patient data, including medication records, lab testing results, and data from wearable devices. A new disease registry will also track Americans with autism and advocacy groups have criticized Kennedy for describing autism as a "preventable disease".

Companies like Abbott Laboratories, Apple, Cra-Z-Art, Johnson & Johnson, Honda Motor, Hyundai Motor Company, Nvidia and TSMC are expanding their manufacturing presence in the U.S., committing significant investments.
