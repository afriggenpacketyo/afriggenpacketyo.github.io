          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, accompanied by his daughter Kim Ju Ae, has arrived in Beijing to attend a significant Chinese military parade, marking a rare international appearance. This visit is the first by a North Korean leader to a Chinese military parade since 1959, signaling a potential strengthening of diplomatic ties and regional alignment. The "Victory Day" parade commemorates the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War Two surrender and is expected to facilitate meetings with China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin. Kim Ju Ae's frequent public appearances alongside her father have led South Korea's spy agency to suggest she is his most likely successor, adding a layer of dynastic speculation to this high-profile diplomatic event.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst has officially announced her decision not to seek reelection in 2026, concluding her two terms in the Senate. As the first woman to represent Iowa and the first female combat veteran in the upper chamber, her departure creates an open seat that Democrats are keen to contest, despite Iowa's recent Republican electoral trends. Ernst emphasized her legislative achievements, including initiatives to prevent violence against women, support for farmers and veterans, and efforts to combat federal waste. Her decision initiates a significant political race in the state, with both parties now strategizing for the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Miami International Airport experienced a chaotic incident when Alvina Omisiri Agba, a 23-year-old woman from England, allegedly snatched a 4-year-old boy from his mother at a security checkpoint. Agba, who insisted the child was hers, wrapped her limbs around the boy to prevent his rescue and pushed the mother. A witness intervened, securing the child, before Agba fled and was subsequently arrested. She later claimed to deputies that she acted because "God told her to do it," and was found not to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Agba faces charges including interference with custody and battery for this disturbing event.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles was illegal, citing a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. This 1878 law restricts the federal government's use of military forces for domestic law enforcement purposes, with limited exceptions. The White House has indicated it will appeal the decision, calling it an overreach, while California Governor Gavin Newsom lauded the ruling as a victory for the Constitution. Although currently on hold and specific to California, this order could establish a significant legal precedent, impacting the administration's broader plans to use the Guard for domestic policy enforcement, including immigration and crime suppression in other cities.</p>

          <p>An eight-year-old child sustained a "significant amount of blood loss" after being bitten by a shark while snorkeling near Horseshoe Reef off Key Largo, Florida. The boy was airlifted to a Miami hospital for urgent treatment of a severe leg wound above the knee, with local reports describing his injuries as critical. Florida consistently leads the U.S. and the world in unprovoked shark bites, recording 14 of the 28 U.S. incidents in 2024. Despite these statistics, the article emphasizes that such incidents remain relatively rare, even in areas known for shark activity like New Smyrna Beach.</p>

Simultaneously, spot gold reached an unprecedented high of $3,500, solidifying its status as a traditional safe-haven investment during periods of economic instability. These market dynamics are unfolding amid increasing concerns regarding the legality of President Donald Trump's global tariffs and the possibility of the U.S. government having to refund billions in trade duties.

The Proud Boys allege issues such as evidence tampering, witness intimidation, and violations of attorney-client privilege during their criminal proceedings, seeking financial compensation for their imprisonment.

          <p>President Donald Trump's trade policies encountered a major legal challenge as a federal appeals court deemed many of his administration's tariffs illegal.

The legal uncertainty further complicates planning for the shipping industry and global supply chains, which have already been grappling with tariff volatility.

By consistently presenting a united front and viewing Western democracies as a cohesive adversary, Xi and Putin are, in effect, inadvertently reinforcing the U.S. alliance system.

          <p>Graham Linehan, the acclaimed co-creator of "Father Ted," was arrested at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of inciting violence, linked to his posts on X (formerly Twitter). Linehan reported that his arrest was based on three April posts expressing his views on confronting "a trans-identified male" in "a female-only space," including a controversial suggestion to "punch him in the balls." He later explained to police that the "punch" tweet was a serious point delivered with humor, not an actual incitement to violence. The incident has ignited a furious backlash from public figures like J.K. Rowling and prompted debate among politicians regarding the appropriate use of police resources in cases of online expression.</p>

This article explains that, absent a specific employment contract clause, an employer typically cannot legally enforce such an extended notice period. Jack's 401(k) and vested company contributions are secure, and his final paycheck cannot be withheld. However, the article advises that while he is not legally bound, departing without adequate notice could damage professional relationships, potentially impacting future opportunities like consulting. It suggests a direct conversation with management, sharing personal reasons if comfortable, to mitigate negative perceptions and ensure a smoother transition.</p>

Morgan murdered Scott by shooting him six times outside a gym, four years after Scott's actions in seizing a phone from Morgan's cell exposed a sexual relationship between Morgan and a female officer. Following Scott's refusal of a bribe to conceal the phone, Morgan issued terrifying threats, including details about Scott's family and home. The judge explicitly categorized the murder as a "revenge killing" for Scott's diligent performance of his duties, an act that has inflicted profound and lasting grief upon Scott's family and young children.</p>

          <p>This article outlines the qualifications for a reverse mortgage, a financial instrument that enables homeowners to convert their home equity into cash without the burden of monthly payments, a solution increasingly popular among retirees. While these loans are typically more accessible than conventional mortgages, federal Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) requirements are strict. Applicants must be at least 62 years old, own their home outright or have a minimal mortgage balance, and the property must be their primary residence. Lenders also perform financial assessments to confirm the borrower's ability to manage ongoing property expenses. Mandatory counseling ensures that borrowers fully grasp the financial implications, serving as a safeguard for both parties. (not investment advice)</p>
