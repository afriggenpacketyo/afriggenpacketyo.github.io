          <p>Approximately 2,800 service members, including 700 Marines, are expected to support the National Guard in Los Angeles within 48 hours as part of Task Force 51. The Marines have undergone training in de-escalation and crowd control and will operate under Title 10 status, focusing on protecting federal personnel and property. While they can detain individuals to prevent harm or interference, they must transfer custody to civilian law enforcement. This deployment aims to maintain order and protect federal assets amidst ongoing protests in the city. Optimism for a peaceful resolution remains moderate, considering the potential for escalation and the need for de-escalation tactics. </p>

While there have been improvements in women's economic participation, the country still lags in female participation in management positions.
