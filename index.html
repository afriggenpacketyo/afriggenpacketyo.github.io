The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite for monitoring greenhouse gases. With a success rate of approximately 98%, the H2A series is now being replaced by the more cost-effective H3 rocket. This transition aims to enhance Japan's competitiveness in the global satellite-launch market, which is increasingly dominated by private companies like SpaceX.</p>

Displaced multiple times and now living with her family in a small apartment, she describes the struggle to find purpose after her school was destroyed and her world fell apart. Her diary captures moments of terror from nearby explosions, the psychological torture of constant drone surveillance, and the profound grief of losing students, colleagues, and family members.

          <p>Scientists have discovered mysterious radio waves originating from a distant galaxy cluster known as SpARCS1049, which took 10 billion years to reach Earth. The signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. This finding suggests that the processes creating these energetic particles, possibly from supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions, have been shaping galaxy clusters for nearly the entire history of the universe. The discovery opens a new window into understanding how the early universe evolved.</p>

While Ohtani's outing was a significant positive, the Dodgers' bullpen struggled, and the offense couldn't overcome an early deficit, setting up a series rubber match on Sunday.

The White House is pressuring Congress to pass the legislation by July 4th, calling it a reflection of shared priorities.

          <p>A 20-year-old woman was bitten on the leg and foot while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York. State officials believe the bite was likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark, based on analysis of the non-life-threatening injuries. The woman did not see what bit her, and a drone search of the area did not locate any dangerous marine life. Swimming was temporarily suspended at the beach as a precaution but resumed the following morning after lifeguards and drones confirmed the water was clear.</p>

          <p>Bain, a 24-year-old member of the K-pop group JUST B, publicly came out as gay during a concert in Los Angeles, a bold move in South Korea's conservative entertainment industry. In an interview, he described the personal toll of hiding his identity and the mixed but ultimately supportive reaction from his family. While a few K-pop artists have come out before, Bain's public declaration has been widely celebrated by international fans and the LGBTQ community in Korea. The act challenges industry taboos where even heterosexual relationships are often concealed, raising questions about potential shifts in a globally influential but culturally traditional industry.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are pushing to pass President Trump's signature domestic policy bill, a 940-page package that extends tax breaks and boosts deportation funding, by a July 4th deadline. The effort faces significant hurdles, including internal party disagreements over proposed spending cuts to programs like Medicaid and food stamps. While the White House is urging swift passage, some conservative senators are concerned about the bill's impact on the national debt. The legislation's fate remains uncertain as it requires near-unanimous support from the narrow Republican majority to overcome unified Democratic opposition.</p>

The bill also includes a compromise on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, raising the cap to $40,000 for many, but leaves a workaround for pass-through businesses intact.

The state's Parkways Authority took full responsibility for the failure to reroute traffic, which left drivers stuck in their vehicles with no information or supplies.

This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wife's household, and female offspring remained connected to their maternal homes. The findings, which also show preferential treatment for females in grave goods, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies.</p>

          <h2>Report of Baby Tiger on California Highway Turns Out to Be a Dead Hawk</h2>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol responded to an unusual report of a baby tiger on the side of Highway 166 in San Luis Obispo County. A driver had called in what they believed was a stranded tiger cub along the remote roadway. However, when an officer arrived to investigate, they discovered the animal was not a large feline but a deceased hawk. It remains unclear what led to the zoological mix-up. California has strict laws prohibiting the private ownership of exotic animals like tigers due to public safety and wildlife concerns.</p>

          <h2>Shifting US Descriptions of Iran Attack Raise Questions About Damage and Goals</h2>

          <p>One week after the U.S. attack on three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created uncertainty about the mission's success. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary initially claimed the sites were "obliterated," subsequent intelligence reports and official statements have been more nuanced. The stated goal also appeared to shift from crippling Iran's nuclear program to achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Questions remain about the extent of the damage, particularly to underground facilities, and whether Iran was able to move enriched uranium before the strikes.</p>

          <p>The long-standing rumor was confirmed as Britpop band Pulp was revealed to be the mystery act billed as "Patchwork" on the Glastonbury Pyramid Stage. Frontman Jarvis Cocker led the band through a celebrated set that included classic hits like "Sorted for E's & Wizz" and "Common People," as well as new material. The performance marked the 30th anniversary of their legendary 1995 headline slot at the festival. The set was a nostalgic and triumphant moment, culminating in a communal singalong of their signature anthem, enhanced by a perfectly timed Red Arrows flypast.</p>
