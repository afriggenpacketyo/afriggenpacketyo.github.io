          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in central Texas have resulted in the deaths of more than 100 people, with a significant number of victims being young campers and counselors at Camp Mystic. The tragedy has also ignited a political firestorm, with questions arising about the adequacy and timing of warnings from agencies like the National Weather Service. The article highlights the immense scale of the disaster, combining the heartbreaking human toll with the emerging debate over accountability and the government's response to the crisis.</p>

          <p>During a White House dinner, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he was nominating U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The meeting occurred in the context of recent U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and ongoing efforts to broker a 60-day ceasefire in the Gaza conflict. Both leaders expressed optimism that their actions against Iran could lead to greater stability in the Middle East, even as complex negotiations to halt the 21-month war with Hamas continue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed a broad increase in import tariffs but has simultaneously issued new, specific tariff rates for 14 individual countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Thailand. This move extends a period of trade uncertainty, with the new rates set to take effect on August 1 unless alternative deals are negotiated. While the delay of a wider tariff war offered some relief, the targeted levies have raised concerns among economists about potential price increases for U.S. consumers and renewed volatility in financial markets.

          <p>Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility three weeks after being shot multiple times in his home.

The alleged perpetrator is in custody facing multiple federal and state charges, including murder and attempted murder, in connection with the violent assaults on lawmakers.</p>

This marks a major shift from the policy implemented in 2006, years after Richard Reid attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his shoes on a transatlantic flight.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's priorities are dangerously misplaced, as evidenced by its new budget and a recent show-of-force immigration raid in Los Angeles. The author condemns the billions in new funding for ICE and Border Patrol while critical agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Weather Service face severe cuts. The commentary contends that the administration is manufacturing a crisis at the border while ignoring existential threats like pandemics and climate change.</p>

          <p>An 83-year-old woman was killed in North Carolina after her vehicle was swept away by flash floods generated by Tropical Depression Chantal. The storm system drenched the state, causing dozens of water rescues and forcing evacuations in low-lying areas, with some parts of Chapel Hill being inundated. The remnants of the storm are now moving northeast, with forecasters warning of continued heavy rainfall and potential flooding across several mid-Atlantic states from Virginia to Pennsylvania.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned its plan for a large-scale layoff of tens of thousands of employees that was slated for August. The agency stated that a department-wide reduction-in-force is no longer necessary due to sufficient staff reductions achieved through a hiring freeze, retirements, and normal attrition. However, critics, including Democratic senators, argue that the high attrition rate is a result of a toxic work environment that will ultimately harm veterans' care.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been selected to his 11th career MLB All-Star Game, this time as a special "Legend Pick" by the commissioner. The selection is an honor recognizing his storied career rather than his performance this season, which has been limited by his recovery from surgery. A surprised and grateful Kershaw called the selection a "tremendous honor," acknowledging that while he felt he didn't deserve it based on 2025 stats, he would enjoy the experience.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-up order for 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, citing the platform's vulnerability on the modern battlefield. The decision was heavily influenced by lessons from the war in Ukraine, where drones and advanced air defense systems have proven highly effective against low-flying aircraft. Officials stated that the funds will be redirected toward investing in more futuristic capabilities, like smart systems and drones, reflecting a significant shift in military procurement strategy.</p>

          <p>The chief inspector of prisons for England and Wales has issued a stark warning that the system is being destabilized by an overwhelming amount of drugs smuggled into facilities. A new report finds that criminal gangs are using methods like drones to deliver contraband, fueling uncontrolled criminality that inexperienced and understaffed prison officers are unable to contain. The watchdog noted that a lack of purposeful activity for bored inmates in overcrowded conditions is a major contributing factor to the pervasive drug problem.</p>
