          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes against Houthi targets in three Yemeni ports, including Hudaydah, in an operation codenamed "Operation Black Flag." The strikes reportedly targeted a power station and a commercial ship previously hijacked by the Houthis, which Israel claimed was being used for maritime surveillance. These actions were framed as a response to the Iran-backed group's repeated attacks on Israel and commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Houthi-run media confirmed the strikes, stating their air defenses engaged the incoming Israeli missiles.</p>

          <p>Mexico has won its record-extending 10th CONCACAF Gold Cup championship, defeating the United States 2-1 in a competitive final. The U.S. team took an early lead with a goal from Chris Richards, but Mexico equalized before halftime and secured the winning goal in the 77th minute. The victory marks a successful title defense for Mexico's full-strength squad, while the U.S. team, competing without several of its top European-based players, fell short of winning its eighth title. The match highlighted Mexico's continued dominance in the regional tournament.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Fuzhou University in China have developed a novel vision sensor using semiconductor "quantum dots" that can adapt to extreme changes in light faster than the human eye. The new system is designed to mimic the human visual system's ability to adjust to varying light conditions and remember those settings for faster future adaptation. This technological advancement also aims to overcome the limitations of current systems by enabling quicker computation while consuming less energy. The research represents a significant step forward in neuromorphic engineering and advanced sensor technology.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, though it continues to pose a significant threat of flash flooding across the Carolinas and south-central Virginia. The system is expected to bring 2 to 4 inches of rain, with localized amounts up to 6 inches, prompting flood watches in the region. While tropical storm warnings have been canceled, authorities are cautioning residents about dangerous surf, rip currents, and the risk of driving on flooded roads.

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods in central Texas that killed nearly 80 people, questions are being raised about whether officials provided adequate warnings to residents. Some local authorities stated the deluge's severity was unexpected, with one county judge noting the lack of an expensive, county-administered warning system. The National Weather Service (NWS) defended its actions, citing the issuance of multiple flood watches and warnings with significant lead times. The debate highlights the challenge of communicating the scale of unprecedented weather events and potential impacts of budget cuts on forecasting agencies.</p>

          <p>Amid his public feud with President Trump, Elon Musk's proposal to create a new "America Party" faces substantial challenges, according to election law experts. The process involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are often biased toward the two major parties and would likely trigger costly legal battles. Experts suggest that building a nationally recognized party is a multi-year, multi-hundred-million-dollar project, making it highly improbable to have a significant impact by the 2026 midterm elections. The article details the immense financial and bureaucratic obstacles involved.</p>

          <p>An al-Qaeda affiliate, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), has become one of Africa's most lethal militant groups, driving a surge of violence across Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Formed in 2017 as a coalition of jihadist groups, JNIM seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law and has exploited regional instability and local grievances to recruit thousands of fighters. The group funds its operations through cattle-rustling, taxation, and extortion, while using modern technology like Starlink for coordination. Military juntas in the Sahel have struggled to contain the growing threat, with some analysts arguing that only negotiation, not military force, can end the conflict.</p>

          <p>The ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs is compelling companies worldwide to fundamentally rethink and restructure their global supply chains. Businesses that have long relied on Chinese manufacturing, such as an Illinois-based toymaker, are now moving production to countries like Vietnam and India to avoid steep import taxes. Meanwhile, Canadian companies face a double impact from both U.S. tariffs and Canada's retaliatory measures, forcing difficult decisions like altering menus at a fried chicken chain. This shift highlights the disruptive real-world consequences of protectionist trade policies on international commerce and business operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marking the 20th anniversary of the 7/7 London attacks, King Charles has released a message calling for unity against those who aim to create division. He condemned the "senseless acts of evil" on July 7, 2005, when suicide bombers killed 52 people on the city's public transport system. The King's message praised the compassion and courage shown in the aftermath and emphasized the importance of building a society of mutual respect and understanding. Commemorative events are scheduled to be held in London to remember the victims and honor the resilience of the city.</p>

          <p>As the official inquiry into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal prepares to release its report on the human impact, victims like Harjinder Butoy are demanding justice. Butoy, who was wrongly convicted and spent 18 months in prison, is one of thousands of sub-postmasters falsely accused of financial shortfalls due to the faulty computer system. While Parliament has exonerated those convicted, many victims are still navigating complex and lengthy compensation processes. The upcoming report is expected to shed light on the devastating personal and financial toll of one of the UK's largest miscarriages of justice.</p>

          <p>The Green River Drift in Wyoming stands as the longest-running cattle drive in the United States, a 70-mile journey undertaken by a small group of ranchers each spring. This 125-year-old tradition was born out of necessity after a brutal winter, allowing ranchers to move cattle to high-country pastures to graze while hay is grown in the valley below. Despite facing modern challenges like government regulations, predators, and changing economic landscapes, families continue the demanding work. They are driven by a deep connection to the land and a commitment to preserving a way of life passed down through generations.</p>

          <p>Two decades after the 7/7 London bombings, the UK's counter-terrorism capabilities have evolved significantly, but the nature of the threat has become far more complex. The 2005 attacks prompted a major overhaul, leading to better intelligence sharing, new legislation, and a national network to disrupt plots. However, the rise of ISIS introduced the challenge of self-radicalized, lone-actor attacks, which in turn inspired similar violence from the far-right. While the state now has a sophisticated suite of tools, it faces a more diverse and unpredictable threat landscape, raising ongoing questions about public safety and civil liberties.</p>

Superintendent Anna Bearman, then a 23-year-old constable, was initially dispatched to what was believed to be a fire at King's Cross station. However, upon being diverted to Russell Square and seeing injured people fleeing from multiple locations, she felt a "pinch-in-the-stomach moment" of dread.

          <p>Following the catastrophic Texas floods, a dispute has arisen between some state officials and the National Weather Service (NWS) over the adequacy of the weather forecast. While the NWS maintains it issued timely flood watches and warnings, some Texas officials argue the forecasts failed to predict the historic and devastating scale of the deluge. Meteorologists note the exceptional difficulty in precisely forecasting such extreme precipitation events, while critics point to job cuts at the NWS as a potential factor. The disagreement highlights the immense challenge of both predicting and effectively communicating the threat of rare, life-threatening weather.</p>

          <p>According to expert Denis Simon, the future of the US-China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement (STA) is a critical bellwether for the overall health of the two nations' relationship. First signed in 1979, the STA has been a foundational framework for scientific collaboration, building trust when diplomatic ties were fragile. Today, the agreement is politically sensitive, intersecting with national security concerns, economic competition in fields like AI and semiconductors, and rising techno-nationalism. The debate over renewing the STA reflects a larger discussion about the extent to which the U.S. should engage with a strategic competitor.</p>
