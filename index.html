          <p>Shohei Ohtani contributed an RBI single during the Los Angeles Dodgers' 6-5 victory over the Washington Nationals. Ohtani, who had been experiencing a three-game RBI drought, went 1-for-3, also drawing two walks. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts served a one-game suspension related to a previous game's incident, while Ohtani is still scheduled to pitch against the Nationals on Sunday. This article also mentions other MLB action, including a game where Tomoyuki Sugano was pulled early and another where Yusei Kikuchi pitched well in a loss; it highlights Ohtani's resilience and his continued role as a key player for the Dodgers, contributing both at bat and on the mound. The Dodgers' victory and Ohtani's performance underscore their strong position in the league, despite recent controversies and injuries. The Dodgers were able to secure a win against the Nationals despite Ohtani's struggles, showcasing their overall team strength.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly ambush of a Minnesota lawmaker by a suspect impersonating a police officer, authorities are urging the public to verify the identity of anyone claiming to be law enforcement. Police Chief Mark Bruley advises calling 911 to confirm the officer's legitimacy, while security expert Brian Higgins suggests not opening the door to unverified individuals. Higgins also recommends being familiar with local police uniforms and vehicles. The suspect, Vance Boelter, allegedly used a mask, tactical vest, and fake police vehicle in the shootings, emphasizing the need for heightened vigilance and caution when interacting with individuals claiming to be officers. The incident has sparked fear and concern in the community, leading to increased awareness and safety measures.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is appealing to the House of Lords to pass the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill was approved by MPs in the House of Commons but faces further scrutiny in the Lords. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, argues that the Lords should scrutinize but not oppose the bill. Critics express concerns about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals, while supporters emphasize the bill's safeguards, including multiple declarations, independent medical assessments, and a multi-disciplinary panel review.</p>

          <p>China's property sector is facing a prolonged downturn, further compounded by a shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates a significant decrease in demand for new homes in urban areas, projecting it to remain below 5 million units per year. This decline is attributed to falling population and slowing urbanization. The shrinking population is expected to reduce home demand by 0.5 million units annually in the 2020s and 1.4 million units in the 2030s. Despite efforts to incentivize child-bearing, pronatalist policies are likely to have limited effect due to deep-rooted economic and social issues.</p>

Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student, was detained by ICE in March and became a symbol of the crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests. Despite being a legal US resident not accused of breaking any laws, the Trump administration sought to deport him over his role in the protests, arguing they were antisemitic. The judge ruled that the government could not deport Khalil based on foreign policy concerns but could continue deportation proceedings over allegations of lying on his green card application, which Khalil disputes.</p>

          <p>The head of China’s United Front Work Department has cautioned religious groups to be vigilant against “hidden dangers” and “foreign infiltration”. This warning was issued during visits to various religious organizations, as reported by Xinhua. It follows similar calls from senior leaders, including President Xi Jinping, to promote the “Sinicisation of religion”. The slew of Chinese leaders checking on religious matters comes just weeks before the Dalai Lama’s 90th birthday on July 6, indicating heightened scrutiny and control over religious activities in the country.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential motivations behind Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to attack Iran, framing it as a long-sought goal to eliminate what he perceives as the greatest threat to Israel. The author notes that the attack has garnered significant support within Israel, even from those who typically oppose Netanyahu's policies. However, the long-term consequences of the conflict, including the potential for a devastating "war of cities" between Tehran and Tel Aviv, remain uncertain, raising questions about whether the attack will ultimately benefit Netanyahu politically or lead to further instability.</p>
