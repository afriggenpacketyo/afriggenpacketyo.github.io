        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced the termination of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, alleging mortgage fraud and questioning her integrity and competence. Cook promptly challenged his authority, asserting that no legal cause for dismissal exists and she would not resign, engaging a high-profile attorney to contest the action. This move is widely viewed as an unprecedented escalation of Trump's attacks on the U.S. central bank's independence and an attempt to exert direct influence over monetary policy. The situation has generated significant concern among financial experts regarding market uncertainty and could lead to a landmark legal battle over the President's power to remove Fed governors, potentially reshaping the central bank's leadership.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor's shares tumbled over 6% after Mercedes-Benz confirmed plans to divest its 3.8% stake in the Japanese automaker, worth roughly $346 million. Mercedes-Benz characterized the sale as a portfolio cleanup, stating the holding was not strategically significant. This development intensifies pressure on Nissan, which is already navigating challenges from U.S. tariffs, a downturn in sales, and fierce global competition in the transition to electric vehicles, especially from Chinese manufacturers. The automaker recently engaged in failed partnership talks with Honda and announced substantial job cuts and plant closures, with its stock having declined over 29% this year.

          <p>A Republican-led House Education and Workforce Committee has expanded its investigation into alleged antisemitism within the University of California system, now targeting UCLA and UC San Francisco medical schools. The committee has demanded years of internal documents, citing reports of hostility towards Jewish individuals and questioning the universities' responses, to determine if Title VI of the Civil Rights Act has been violated. This move follows the Trump administration's suspension of over $500 million in grants to UCLA due to similar allegations. The probe also considers a separate report from a UCLA task force detailing instances of anti-Palestinian, anti-Muslim, and anti-Arab racism, underscoring the multifaceted nature of campus tensions.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has once again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, first due to an oxygen leak and then because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. This milestone mission is crucial for demonstrating fixes and upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year, aiming to enable a faster launch cadence. A successful flight would advance the development of autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, a key requirement for NASA's planned moon landing as early as 2027 and eventual Mars missions. While some NASA officials express optimism, other experts remain skeptical about the ambitious timeline, citing the system's inherent complexity and the unprecedented nature of large-scale cryogenic propellant transfer in orbit.</p>

Fernand is the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, occurring after Hurricane Erin, which reached Category 5 intensity but also stayed over open waters. The NOAA had previously predicted an above-normal season, with 13 to 18 named storms anticipated.</p>

          <h2>Trump Threatens Steep Tariffs on China Over Rare-Earth Magnet Exports</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to China, threatening 200% tariffs if the country restricts its rare-earth magnet exports, potentially jeopardizing the existing trade truce. He also asserted that U.S. control over airplane parts, specifically Boeing components, provides significant leverage, claiming past actions grounded numerous Chinese aircraft. This aggressive stance follows a recent rebound in China's rare-earth magnet shipments to the U.S., despite Beijing's prior export curbs. China's near-monopoly on global rare-earth supply, essential for American manufacturing in sectors like automotive and electronics, underpins its strategic advantage in trade negotiations. Analysts suggest Trump's remarks are a negotiating tactic to push for a trade deal. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite Trump's pre-meeting social media post hinting at a "Purge or Revolution" in South Korea, Lee lauded Trump's relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, suggesting he could be a "peacemaker." While the meeting successfully averted a diplomatic dressing-down, it concluded without concrete agreements on contentious issues like trade tariffs or the cost-sharing for U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. Trump reiterated his desire to meet Kim Jong Un again, and also floated the idea of the U.S. owning the land for Osan Air Base.</p>

The proposed measure seeks to overhaul California's congressional map, potentially making five GOP-held districts more favorable to Democrats, a move Newsom frames as a counter to Texas Republicans' redistricting efforts. Opponents contend the plan violates the state constitution by undermining the independent redistricting commission, bypassing a public review period, and illegally redrawing maps mid-decade. If enacted, the new map could significantly impact the 2026 midterm elections by helping Democrats secure control of the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>Current and former FEMA officials have issued a stark warning to Congress, stating that the Trump administration's significant cuts and reforms to the agency risk reversing decades of progress made since Hurricane Katrina. An open letter, signed by 181 individuals, alleges that the administration's decisions "hinder the swift execution of our mission" and that appointees lack proper qualifications. The declaration criticizes the termination of grants for disaster preparedness, such as the BRIC program, which disproportionately affected Trump-voting counties.

Pickett, a fourth-year player with 25 NFL starts from his time with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles, will now back up Geno Smith. His departure from Cleveland, where he was competing with rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders behind starter Joe Flacco, was influenced by a hamstring injury that limited his preseason participation, leaving the Browns' backup role still undecided.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding, reversing an earlier decision to withhold the congressionally-allocated money after a multi-state lawsuit. The funds, intended for programs like after-school care, teacher training, and English-learner support, were frozen weeks before the school year, causing widespread uncertainty. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who led the lawsuit with 22 other states, accused the administration of illegally impounding funds. While a White House spokesperson had previously cited concerns about "misused" funds for a "radical left-wing agenda," the agreement ensures critical programs, many benefiting low-income families, will now receive their allocated resources.</p>

          <p>Wildfire smoke from the Pickett Fire, the largest blaze in the San Francisco Bay Area this year, is now threatening California's Napa Valley vineyards, evoking memories of past crop devastation. Winery owner Chris Jambois, whose Black Sears Winery lost two vintages to smoke taint from the 2020 Glass Fire, expressed deep concern over the increasing frequency of such events. Even if the flames spare the orchards, the smoke can severely impact grape quality, making the wine taste "like licking an ashtray" and leading to substantial economic losses. The relentless heat wave across the western U.S. is contributing to the fire activity, pushing vineyard owners to a critical point of "soul searching" regarding their future.</p>

          <p>The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador due to an "administrative error," has become a symbol of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies. Despite a prior "withholding of removal" order based on a fear of persecution, Garcia was deported, imprisoned, and later returned to the U.S., only to face new criminal charges and another deportation order. Accusations of gang membership and human trafficking, which Garcia and his lawyers deny, have been central to the government's stance. This situation highlights the administration's hardline approach, which has seen increased mass deportations and raids, sparking protests and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk, through his AI startup xAI, has filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, accusing them of monopolistic collaboration that disadvantages xAI's chatbot, Grok.

Musk's xAI argues that Apple's 65% share of the U.S. smartphone market and OpenAI's 85% share of the AI chatbot market, combined with their exclusive deal, constitute an anti-competitive lock-up.

Instead, three key rules are proposed for better back health: prioritize movement, build strength, and address mindset. The article emphasizes that posture is dynamic, not static, advocating for regular breaks and shifts in position rather than rigid adherence to one stance. It also highlights that strong core and back muscles, achievable through simple exercises like pilates or yoga, are crucial. Finally, it notes that stress and emotional factors significantly influence posture and pain, suggesting a holistic approach to well-being.</p>
