          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended to land on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after being stranded in orbit for 53 years due to a booster malfunction in 1972. According to Roscosmos, the spacecraft may have remained intact and splashed down in the Indian Ocean west of Jakarta, Indonesia. The article contextualizes the event within the Cold War space race, highlighting the Soviet Union's Venera program and its achievements in exploring Venus.

          <p>Xi Jinping has strategically positioned China to dominate global supply chains, leveraging exports and state-controlled banking to counter the United States. Since 2020, Xi has directed massive lending to industrial borrowers and introduced economic warfare tactics like export controls, particularly in critical minerals. The article explains that China's dominance poses challenges to the U.S. and other nations, forcing them to navigate reliance on Chinese trade amid rising tensions. Despite China's gains, this strategy faces internal challenges, including strained relations with trading partners and potential economic repercussions for Chinese households, which highlights the complex balancing act between global ambition and domestic stability.</p>

          <p>A newly introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances in the United States. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the EBDPA, which would allow research to catch up with the increasing cannabis consumption. Experts suggest this could help policymakers craft effective legislation and allow more clinical research on medical cannabis. While the Biden administration pushed for cannabis rescheduling, the EBDPA would repeal sections that forbid federal funds for research on Schedule I substances.</p>
