          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant previously deported and then brought back to the U.S., is now facing federal charges. His attorneys are arguing that the charges are an abuse of power, especially considering the initial administrative error that led to his deportation. Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia's lawyers, voiced concerns about the government's actions and their impact on due process. The legal team plans to vigorously defend Abrego Garcia against the charges in Tennessee, arguing the government is trying to cover up their initial mistake.</p>

Residents claim that the drone surveillance has led to privacy concerns and a loss of enjoyment of their property.

The airline is delaying the acceptance of two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring extra tariff-related costs. The tariffs, part of President Trump's trade agenda, have disrupted supply chains and forced companies to raise prices. Without the new aircraft, Alaska Airlines must cancel 14 flights a day through the end of July, affecting routes served by its regional subsidiary, Horizon Air.</p>

          <p>A former girlfriend of Sean "Diddy" Combs, identified as "Jane," testified about feeling pressured to participate in sexual encounters with male escorts while he watched.

Prosecutors have charged Combs with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, charges he denies.
