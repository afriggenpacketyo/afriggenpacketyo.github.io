          <p>Irish-speaking rap group Kneecap has apologized to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox following footage of a band member appearing to call for violence against Tory MPs. The group rejects inciting violence and says the footage was taken out of context. The apology comes amidst calls for the group to be denied entry into the US and Canada for their upcoming tour, and for their removal from music festivals. The group has previously received government arts funding and recently won a discrimination case against the UK government after funding was withdrawn.</p>

          <p>Electricity has been restored to almost all of Spain and Portugal nearly 18 hours after a widespread blackout disrupted daily life for millions. The cause of the outage remains unclear, with officials ruling out foul play but unable to pinpoint the exact trigger. Initial information suggests a high-voltage connection line between France and Spain was interrupted, potentially exacerbating existing strains on European grids caused by climate change.

          <p>In a surprising turn of events, Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Conservative Party, lost his seat as the parliamentary representative of his Ottawa district. Bruce Fanjoy, the Liberal candidate, secured the victory in Carleton, a district Poilievre had represented since 2004. Poilievre's campaign had embraced some of Mr. Trump’s rhetoric, railing against “radical woke ideology” while pledging to defund Canada’s national broadcaster and cut foreign aid. The loss raises questions about his future leadership of the Conservative Party.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer is grappling with the aftereffects of a cyber attack, leading to empty shelves in some stores and disruption to online orders.

          <p>The European Space Agency has successfully launched the Biomass satellite, designed to assess the amount of carbon stored in the world's forests by seeing through clouds and leafy canopies. The satellite, nicknamed "space brolly," uses a long-wavelength radar to penetrate deep into forests and measure the woody material, providing a proxy for carbon dioxide storage. This will allow scientists to more accurately model climate change and track deforestation rates, addressing the challenge of consistently measuring carbon storage across vast tropical regions. The satellite will produce annual maps over the next five years, showing carbon storage and losses.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after the end of the Vietnam War, former American buildings in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, tell the story of a nation transformed. These structures, once occupied by US officials and agencies, now house Vietnamese families, businesses, and government offices, bridging two distinct eras. The buildings serve as a reminder of the war's legacy, while also reflecting Vietnam's embrace of free trade and its complex relationship with the United States. Despite economic progress, some residents express concerns about ongoing issues like trade tariffs and the lingering effects of the war.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's budget cuts are disrupting animal research, potentially leading to the euthanasia of lab animals as funding dries up. The cuts have forced the closure of labs, leaving scientists out of work and research projects unfinished.

Concerns are rising about the ethical implications of euthanizing animals without scientific gain, and the potential impact on future research.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in a case examining the legal recourse available to victims of wrong-house raids by federal officers. The case stems from an incident in Atlanta where FBI and SWAT agents mistakenly blasted open the door of a family's home while serving an arrest warrant for a neighbor. The central question is whether the Federal Tort Claims Act, as amended, allows victims to sue the government for such incidents, or if liability only applies when officers follow government orders. The ruling could have significant implications for law enforcement accountability.</p>
