          <p>Police identified Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old British man of Syrian descent, as the attacker who killed two Jewish people and injured three others at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. Al-Shamie drove a car into people outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue before attacking them with a knife, and was subsequently shot dead by police at the scene within minutes. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the "terrorist attack," announcing increased police presence at synagogues nationwide, while Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis attributed the tragedy to a rising wave of "Jew hatred." Authorities praised security staff and Rabbi Daniel Walker for their immediate bravery in preventing the attacker from gaining access to the synagogue, averting an even worse tragedy.</p>

          <p>The FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary, lauded the Trump administration's new TrumpRx platform, calling it a "major step" towards making prescription drugs affordable for Americans. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has agreed to offer significant discounts, up to 85% on some medications, through the direct-to-consumer government purchasing platform, in line with the lower prices paid by Europeans. While experts like Stacie Dusetzina express skepticism about the program's broad impact on most Americans' out-of-pocket costs, suggesting it may only benefit a smaller group who pay cash, Makary believes it will effectively address the larger issue of healthcare costs in the United States, expecting more drugmakers to join the initiative when the website launches next year.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce publicly criticized Philadelphia Eagles receiver A.J. Brown for expressing his frustrations online about his role, despite the team's undefeated 4-0 start. Brown had posted a cryptic message after a low-yardage game, indicating his displeasure, prompting a discussion among sports commentators about team dynamics versus individual grievances. While Kelce acknowledged players' right to frustration, he emphasized the importance of prioritizing team success over personal statistics, particularly when the team is winning. Brown later took accountability for his emotions, clarifying his post was not directed at anyone within the Eagles organization, and team management downplayed any concerns about his commitment, suggesting the issue is now resolved.</p>

          <p>A report by human rights group Global Witness alleges TikTok's algorithm actively recommends pornography and highly sexualized content to children's accounts, even when safety settings like "restricted mode" are activated. Researchers created fake 13-year-old profiles and found explicit search suggestions leading to graphic videos, including content embedded within innocent videos in an attempt to evade content moderation. Despite TikTok's claims of having over 50 safety features and removing most violating content before viewing, a follow-up investigation conducted months later revealed the problem persisted, which was a huge shock to the researchers. TikTok stated it took immediate action to remove policy-violating content and improve its search suggestion feature after being informed of the findings by Global Witness.</p>

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) projects an extra 220,000 children will require Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) by then, exacerbating the current £12 billion annual spending, which has risen 66% in a decade. Local authorities are already accumulating hundreds of millions in debt due to these rising costs, prompting calls for the total debt, forecast to reach £5 billion next year, to be wiped completely. The government is expected to publish its reform plans soon, aiming for more early intervention and mainstream education for SEND pupils.</p>

          <p>The Energy Department canceled nearly $8 billion in funding for over 200 green energy projects across 16 states won by Kamala Harris, coinciding with the federal government shutdown. Critics argue these cuts, announced by OMB Director Russell Vought, are politically motivated and will severely hinder efforts to reduce carbon emissions, combat pollution, and strengthen electrical grids, potentially costing tens of thousands of jobs. Washington Governor Bob Ferguson called the action "illegal" and is pursuing legal challenges, while Senator Martin Heinrich criticized the lack of transparency and courtesy from the administration. The Energy Department, however, maintains the projects did not adequately advance national energy needs or provide a positive return on investment.</p>

Colds typically develop gradually with nasal and throat issues, flu adds aches, fevers, and muscle weakness, while COVID-19 might include loss of smell/taste or a "razor-sharp" sore throat. The article explains how colder weather, increased indoor gatherings, and school environments contribute to virus spread, advising self-isolation for recovery and seeking medical advice if symptoms persist or worsen. Dr. Duke offers practical tips for self-care, including paracetamol, vitamin D supplementation, and hydration, while cautioning against overuse of decongestant sprays.</p>

          <p>Residents in Altadena, California, are encountering significant concerns over lead contamination in their soil as they attempt to rebuild homes lost in the devastating Eaton Fire. Many homes in the area were built before 1978, when lead-based paint was banned, leading to elevated lead levels post-fire that pose health risks, particularly for children and pregnant individuals. Testing by USC and L.A. County Public Health confirmed significant lead concentrations, even after initial soil removal by the Army Corps of Engineers, with some homeowners still lacking desired testing. This situation highlights ongoing environmental and health challenges in the recovery process, with residents needing to ensure their land is safe before rebuilding.</p>

          <p>The current government shutdown has seen the Trump administration accused of weaponizing the funding lapse, a stark contrast to previous shutdowns, by targeting political opponents. President Trump has threatened mass firings of federal workers and announced funding freezes for Democratic districts, including $18 billion for New York City infrastructure projects. Officials have also used government websites for partisan messaging, violating ethics guidelines and drawing criticism from nonpartisan groups. This aggressive approach, driven by figures like OMB Director Russ Vought and linked to "Project 2025," has created widespread uncertainty and intensified the political battle, leading some Democrats to reconsider their strategy amidst the unprecedented norm-busting.</p>

A notification to Congress frames cartels as "non-state armed groups" whose actions constitute an "armed attack" on the U.S., allowing for wartime powers.

However, this dissatisfaction has not translated into significant gains for Democrats, who are urged by strategists to articulate their own plans for the community rather than just criticizing Republicans.

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll indicates persistent pessimism about the U.S. economy and job market, with most Americans believing conditions are worsening due to continuously rising prices. Over half view the job market negatively, and a majority anticipate difficulty finding desired jobs if they were looking, despite many currently employed feeling secure. Furthermore, a majority hold a skeptical outlook on Artificial Intelligence, expecting it to negatively impact job availability in their fields over the next decade. This broad negativity spans income and education levels, though it is slightly less pronounced among younger Americans, reflecting widespread anxiety about future economic stability.</p>

          <p>A report details a chaotic and dysfunctional environment at the Pentagon under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, whose leadership is characterized by unusual fixations on public image and personal loyalty. President Trump's appearance at a military gathering, suggesting troop deployment to U.S. cities, further highlighted the unorthodox dynamic and Hegseth's willingness to follow orders. Hegseth, a former TV host, is accused of lacking deep experience, fostering an atmosphere of paranoia after "Signal Gate" leak investigations, and surrounding himself with a personal entourage rather than relying on experienced staff. This has led to a department focused more on implementing executive orders than creative problem-solving, raising concerns about stability and governance.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou remains defiant despite fan taunts and calls for his sacking after a damaging 3-2 Europa League defeat. Postecoglou is now winless in his first six games, a club record for a permanent manager in 100 years, leading to intense pressure from supporters who jeered him and praised his predecessor. Despite the negative mood and questions directed at the club's owner, Postecoglou believes in his process and asserts the team is close to a breakthrough.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Goldman Sachs study reveals that a growing number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are living paycheck to paycheck, making retirement savings increasingly unattainable. Approximately 42% of Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X workers report no spare savings after covering basic expenses, a figure projected to exceed half by 2033 due to relentlessly rising housing and healthcare costs. The report highlights that simply advising people to "save more" ignores these financial realities, as basic expenses now consume an ever-growing share of after-tax income. This underscores a "financial vortex" where systemic pressures hinder individual savings, leading many older workers to believe a "miracle" is needed to retire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The EAT-Lancet Commission released an updated "planetary health diet" report, advocating for a diet rich in nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with significantly less meat, dairy, and sugar. This diet aims to cut global greenhouse gas emissions from food systems by over half and prevent up to 15 million premature deaths annually, according to new research from over 35 countries. The report, widely accepted by global health and environmental experts, faces a "coordinated campaign" of misinformation, particularly from the meat and dairy industries, that has successfully riled up public opinion in the past. Researchers highlight the weakening of fact-checking on social media and the rise of AI tools as factors fueling disinformation, underscoring the challenge in promoting sustainable eating.</p>

The new cards replace previous designs with updated imagery showcasing California's redwoods, poppies, and coastline, while retaining the REAL ID symbol, a golden bear with a star. The magnetic strip on the back of the old licenses has been removed in this redesign, which is part of periodic updates to improve security and prevent counterfeiting, following the last major update in 2010. Existing licenses remain valid until their expiration date, so motorists are not required to immediately update their cards.</p>

OMB Director Russ Vought, an architect of "Project 2025," has already announced billions in energy and infrastructure funding cancellations, targeting states represented by Democratic leaders. Law professors and federal unions, including the American Federation of Government Employees, argue that these threats of mass firings and permanent cuts exceed executive authority and have filed lawsuits against the administration. Democrats accuse Trump of acting like a "king" and demand enforceable provisions to ensure fair fund distribution, highlighting a deep constitutional and political impasse with potential long-term consequences for federal services and workers.</p>

Newsom's office condemned the compact as a "hostile takeover" of universities, criticizing its demands to limit international students, ban gender/sex in admissions, and eliminate departments deemed hostile to conservative ideas. The University of Southern California, one of the targeted institutions with a high international student population, is reviewing the letter, facing potential significant economic challenges if it complies.

However, the article highlights significant defensive errors, including a goalkeeper mistake and a ricocheted clearance leading directly to goals, indicating fundamental issues beyond officiating. With five games without scoring this season, a record not seen since 1991-92, the team's struggles extend beyond single incidents, raising concerns about tactical choices, transfer ambition, and overall attacking quality.</p>

Despite being generally seen as well-meaning by Beijing, these researchers find it difficult to obtain necessary information to conduct studies that could challenge negative narratives. Scholars believe Beijing's reticence stems from concerns about potential distortion and misrepresentation by Western researchers, as well as the comparatively low cost of making accusations that inflict serious damage on named companies. However, they argue that greater transparency and data disclosure would ultimately benefit the region’s long-term development and help counter the U.S. claims more effectively.</p>

          <p>During the ongoing government shutdown, Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance and President Trump, falsely claimed Democrats were demanding billions for "free healthcare for illegal aliens." A BBC Verify fact-check debunks this, clarifying that Democrats are pushing to extend Obamacare subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts, not to expand coverage to undocumented immigrants. Federal law prohibits taxpayer-funded healthcare for undocumented individuals, and Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries explicitly denied any intent to change this long-standing policy. The Republican claim misrepresents Democratic efforts to restore healthcare access for "lawfully present" immigrants, such as refugees, who would lose benefits under recent policy changes, thereby fueling political misinformation.</p>

While the immediate practical impact on most patients' out-of-pocket costs remains ambiguous, as many would still pay cash, the agreement sets a precedent.

Early attempts at ranking, like Kendric Babcock's 1911 study, were quickly suppressed due to intense controversy and political intervention. The modern U.S. News & World Report rankings, emerging in the 1980s, capitalized on consumer demand and institutional competition as higher education became a mass-consumer good, leading to evolving methodologies and some institutions gaming the system.</p>
