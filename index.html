          <p>The UK government has announced new powers for police to manage repeat protests by considering their cumulative impact on communities. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated this is about imposing restrictions and conditions, not an outright ban, citing recent demonstrations that have left Jewish communities feeling intimidated. The move follows large-scale arrests and has drawn criticism from civil liberties groups who argue it undermines the right to peaceful assembly and free speech.</p>

          <p>In the investigation of Kenneth Fandrich's murder, Hillsboro police raced to a scrapyard to retrieve a minivan believed to be the primary crime scene. The suspect, Dr. Steven Milner, was allegedly stalking Fandrich over an affair with his wife and used the "burner" vehicle in the crime. Unfortunately, detectives arrived a week too late, discovering the minivan had already been crushed and processed as scrap metal, a significant setback for the prosecution.</p>

          <p>In a new memoir, singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam, also known as Cat Stevens, discusses his lifelong spiritual journey and complex career. He explains his decision to leave music for nearly 30 years after converting to Islam, a choice influenced by early interpretations of his faith that he later reassessed. Now performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens, he sees the combined name as a complete picture of his identity, asserting that his songs have always been biographical and remain relevant today.</p>

          <p>Senator Cory Booker has placed blame for the ongoing government shutdown on Donald Trump, describing the situation as a "tsunami of Donald Trump's creation." Speaking on ABC's "This Week," Booker emphasized that the standoff is creating a healthcare crisis by threatening Medicaid and Affordable Care Act subsidies. He stated that his focus is not on political blame but on the millions of Americans at risk of losing their health insurance and facing rising medical costs.</p>

          <p>Under new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting its strategy to a more confrontational, "eco-populist" approach in an effort to convert growing membership into electoral power. The party, now at its largest-ever size, aims to shed its image as a niche environmental group and become a more insurgent political force by "picking fights" and adopting bold messaging. This change reflects a belief that a more aggressive stance is needed to resonate with voters.</p>

          <p>The SEC is considering a proposal, prompted by President Trump, to end the requirement for public companies to file quarterly financial reports, potentially moving to a semi-annual schedule. Proponents argue this would save companies significant time and money, allowing managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term results. However, the change could significantly impact the revenue of major accounting firms and reduce transparency for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge asserts that the single most important rule for parents in a high-tech world is to prohibit electronic devices from their children's bedrooms overnight. She argues this straightforward, no-cost rule is crucial for protecting sleep, which is vital for the physical and mental health of developing brains. Lack of sleep is linked to numerous negative outcomes, and removing phones at night can significantly improve a child's ability to learn and regulate emotions.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that few Americans believe either party's position is worth causing a government shutdown, with significant concern over its potential economic impact. President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans all receive low approval ratings for their handling of the situation, with a majority of the public holding all parties responsible. The poll also shows the Republican party is most often described as "extreme," while the Democratic party is seen as "weak."</p>

The U.S. has recently applied these "derivative" tariffs to hundreds of new items, including components for transport and energy, which will significantly impact European manufacturers.

          <p>A JPMorgan report challenges the common retirement savings goal of $1 million, suggesting that most American households can retire comfortably with a smaller nest egg. Using an income-replacement model that includes Social Security, the analysis indicates a household earning $90,000 annually would need around $700,000 by age 65. The report notes that a seven-figure target is typically only necessary for households earning $125,000 or more, but cautions that potential future cuts to Social Security could require higher savings.

          <p>President Trump has intensified his focus on billionaire philanthropist George Soros, naming him as a potential target for investigation for allegedly financing "leftwing terrorism." This move is seen by critics as an attempt to intimidate Democratic donors ahead of the 2026 midterm elections and to create a political distraction. Soros, a frequent target of right-wing criticism, has been a major financial backer of Democratic and progressive causes, and the threat of an inquiry could have a chilling effect on fundraising.</p>
