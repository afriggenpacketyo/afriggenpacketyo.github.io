          <p>Negotiations between New Jersey Transit executives and the union representing train drivers resumed on Saturday, a day earlier than planned, as the transit strike entered its second day, disrupting commuter services. The strike began due to stalled contract talks, primarily over pay, with the union seeking parity with other regional railroads. While NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan involving supplemental buses, the agency has urged residents to work from home if possible to mitigate the impact. Despite some progress, the agency is wary of setting a precedent that would negatively impact future budgets.</p>

          <p>Ukraine criticized Russia's delegation to the Istanbul talks, deeming it a "sham" due to the absence of decision-makers, despite the agreement to exchange prisoners. President Zelenskyy had hoped for a personal meeting with President Putin, but the latter did not agree. The Ukrainian delegation proceeded out of respect for the US President and Erdogan, but with low expectations. Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine withdraw its troops as a gesture of goodwill, which Ukraine rejected as an ultimatum. Experts suggest Russia is not ready for genuine talks due to its advantage on the front lines.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria surprised senior officials at the Treasury Department, creating confusion about the scope and pace of the rollback. The move came after months of lobbying by Syria's transitional government, which blamed sanctions for its economic struggles. Secretary of State Rubio said the decision was discussed for weeks, and relief may come through waivers under the "Caesar Act." The reversal reflects a shift in U.S. policy, potentially impacting relations with allies and regional dynamics.</p>

Hobbs, a moderate pragmatist, faces a potentially formidable opponent in the 2026 election. Despite these challenges, her defenders argue that her focus on everyday Arizonans and her ability to block Republican legislation could prove beneficial.</p>
