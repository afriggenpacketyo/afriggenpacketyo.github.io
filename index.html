          <p>A Maltese court sentenced two men to life in prison for their role in the 2017 murder of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. The men were found guilty of supplying the explosives used in the car bombing that killed Caruana Galizia, who was known for her reporting on corruption. The sentences follow years of investigations and convictions of other individuals involved in the assassination. The family of Caruana Galizia hopes the sentences will deter future attacks on journalists.</p>
