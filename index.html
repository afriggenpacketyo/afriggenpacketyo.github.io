          <p>The Senate Finance Committee has released its version of President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," which differs significantly from the House-passed version, potentially leading to a confrontation between the two chambers. Key points of contention include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Medicaid work requirements, and extensions of the Trump 2017 tax cuts. The Senate bill proposes keeping the SALT deduction cap at $10,000, while the House bill offers deductions up to $40,000 for those making less than $500,000 annually. The Senate version permanently extends the Trump 2017 tax cuts, a move Senate Republicans deem essential for business and family planning, and the Senate bill includes a $5 trillion hike to the federal debt limit, higher than the House’s $4 trillion.

          <p>A federal jury in Colorado found MyPillow founder Mike Lindell liable for defaming Eric Coomer, a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems, after the 2020 presidential election.

Lindell's lawyers argued that his platform is not liable for statements made by others, and Lindell claimed he went to trial to draw attention to the need to eliminate electronic voting machines. Coomer stated that the conspiracy theories spread about him cost him his job and mental health, with Lindell's statements being the most distressing. </p>

Obeng, who is Black, claims he experienced emotional distress after being unfairly targeted by the burger chain’s dress code, which requires employees to wear company-issued hats with their hair tucked in. Obeng began wearing braids to comply, but management took issue with his sideburns, which he considered important to his cultural identity. He was eventually fired, and the lawsuit alleges that In-N-Out violated the CROWN Act, which prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of an employee’s hairstyle or hair texture.</p>

Chevron argues that because it began oil production during World War II as a federal contractor, these cases should be heard in federal court.

          <p>President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict has been ambiguous, ranging from supporting Israeli strikes to distancing himself from them. This article explores Trump's options, including escalating military involvement, maintaining the current course of limited involvement, or pulling back due to domestic political considerations. Trump's ultimate objective is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and his preferred method is through a deal between the U.S. and Iran.

Trump accidentally dropped the document, blaming the wind, and initially misstated that the agreement was with the European Union. The White House clarified that the agreement was with the United Kingdom, and Trump said the agreement was not much different from one he signed with the U.K. in May. The White House provided additional details on steel and aluminum in the US-UK agreement, saying that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will determine a quota of products that can enter the U.S. without being subject to the 25% Section 232 tariff.</p>
