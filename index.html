          <p>The article discusses the growing concern among scientists that the United States is at risk of losing its leading position in the sciences. This is due to budget cuts and immigration policies that are unwelcoming to international researchers. The withdrawal of the welcome mat for promising researchers from around the world is causing alarm. These policies could have long-term consequences for American innovation and scientific advancement, as other countries become more attractive destinations for scientific talent and investment. The U.S.'s historical dominance in science is now threatened. The scientific community is worried about the future of American research.</p>

          <p>The article reports on skepticism among former spy-hunters regarding the Trump administration's plan to revoke visas of certain Chinese college students. These experts view the measure as heavy-handed and potentially counterproductive. The State Department's plan aims to address concerns about espionage and intellectual property theft. However, critics argue that the broad revocation of visas could deter talented students from coming to the U.S., ultimately harming American universities and research institutions. Some believe a more targeted approach would be more effective in mitigating risks while preserving academic exchange.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the resurgence of Chinese tourism in Japan, surpassing pre-pandemic levels from 2019, but with a noticeable shift in travel habits. Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, Chinese travelers now seek immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. This change is driven by travelers in their 30s and 40s, who prefer family trips over traditional group tours. The Japan National Tourism Organization is adapting its strategies to target this evolving market, including engaging on Chinese social media platforms. Despite a temporary dip in visitor numbers due to concerns about a manga predicting a major disaster, overall tourism from China continues to grow.</p>

          <p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Indo-Pacific defence chiefs that China wanted to “fundamentally alter the region’s status quo”, and that American allies must step up defence investments. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Hegseth said that the threat posed by China was “real and could be imminent”. He said this included Beijing’s efforts to build the capacity to take over Taiwan by force by 2027. Hegseth appealed to senior officials, saying that Washington “counts on” American allies and partners to do their part on defence as they shift their strategic focus to the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US secretary of defence has called on Asian countries to boost their military spending to increase regional deterrence against China, which was “rehearsing for the real deal” when it comes to taking over Taiwan. Pete Hegseth, addressing the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, reiterated pledges to increase the US presence in the Indo-Pacific and outlined a range of new joint projects. He said the renewed European focus on their region – particularly the Russia-Ukraine war – allowed the US to shift focus to its “priority theatre” in the Indo-Pacific. Hegseth also took a swipe at the absence of any senior Chinese delegate at this year’s conference.</p>

          <p>Canadian officials are warning of tough days ahead for fighting growing wildfires in Saskatchewan and Manitoba with hot and dry weather in the weekend forecast. The wildfires have forced thousands to evacuate in the two central prairie provinces, with both this week declaring states of emergency. Smoke from the fires has triggered air quality alerts in Canada and as far as Chicago, where forecasters say the smell of smoke will be noticeable. There are also air quality advisories in place in parts of the US Upper Midwest, including Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, affecting an estimated 22 million Americans.</p>

Authorities warned people to avoid the area due to the potential for bee swarming. Bee experts and the local community are working to help the bees return to their hives and find their queen. Honeybees play a key role in pollination and food production, but they have been facing numerous threats and declining for years due to insecticides, parasites, disease, climate change, and lack of a diverse food supply.</p>
