          <p>Japan has requested that eight countries and regions block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites, as gambling with overseas-based betting sites is illegal in Japan. The government is addressing the issue after revelations of professional athletes and celebrities using these sites, with a police survey estimating over 3 million people in the country have gambled online. Japan has engaged with countries including Canada, Costa Rica, and Malta, and plans to tighten regulations on illegal online gambling by prohibiting websites from directing traffic to casino sites. An analysis of online casino sites available in Japanese found that most operators were licensed in Curacao.</p>

The cable also asserts that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and that the U.S. military remains in a defensive posture to protect U.S. personnel and infrastructure in the region amid threats from Iranian ballistic missiles.

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, with a 6.4% jump in May, exceeding analysts' estimates and accelerating from the previous month.

However, industrial output growth slowed to 5.8% year on year, and fixed-asset investment expanded by 3.7%, undershooting forecasts, while the contraction in property investment deepened.

          <p>Israel and Iran traded more missile attacks despite calls for a halt to the fighting, with neither country backing down as their conflict raged for a third day. The exchange of fire comes as talks on Iran's nuclear program in Oman between the U.S. and Iran were called off. Iran said Israel struck its oil refineries, killed the intelligence chief of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and hit population centers. Israel said Iran has fired over 270 missiles since Friday, 22 of which had slipped through the country's sophisticated multi-tiered air defenses.</p>

          <p>China's economic data in May sent mixed signals, with US tariffs continuing to affect manufacturing and exports, but domestic consumption showed slight improvement. Retail sales rose by 6.4%, exceeding forecasts, driven by a trade-in program for appliances and other household goods. However, some regions have halted their programs due to depleted funds. The Conference Board's China Center noted that the retail data appeared strong, particularly in dining and home-appliances segments, likely driven by holiday effects and consumption-promoting policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed immigration officials to prioritize deportations in cities run by Democrats, citing growing resistance in Los Angeles and other major US cities. He called on officials to achieve the "single largest Mass Deportation Program in History," claiming Democrats use undocumented immigrants to expand their voter base and cheat in elections. The directive comes amid protests against recent deportations, with dissenters criticizing Trump's policies they claim erode US democracy. Authorities are investigating a shooting possibly associated with a march in Utah.</p>

          <p>The Dodgers defeated the Giants after a reported blockbuster trade sent Giants pitcher Kyle Harrison to the Red Sox just before the game, disrupting the Giants' lineup.

Pitcher Dustin May delivered a solid performance, pitching through the sixth inning, and the Dodgers' bullpen closed out the game.

When operating at standard brightness, the new PeLEDs had a theoretical lifespan of over 185,000 hours, or around 21 years.
