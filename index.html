          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere soon due to a rocket malfunction that left it stranded in orbit. The New York Times article explains that because the spacecraft was designed with a heat shield to survive Venus's atmosphere, it may partially survive its re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. While the exact timing and location of re-entry are uncertain, scientists are closely tracking its descent, though the risk of injury on the ground is considered low. If any pieces of the spacecraft survive the impact, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's trade policies are characterized by rapid shifts, causing uncertainty for businesses globally as his administration's stance on tariffs and trade deals changes frequently. The Guardian article notes that this week alone, Trump's positions on tariffs for strollers and movies, as well as the overall approach to global trade agreements, have fluctuated significantly. The Federal Reserve chair observed that businesses are struggling to adapt to the unpredictability of these policies. Despite initially focusing on lowering prices, the administration has shown inconsistencies, such as considering tariff exemptions for childcare products and reversing course on imposing tariffs on foreign-produced movies.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, was previously sanctioned by the Football Association for questioning the gender of a transgender woman opponent during a friendly match. Vaughan stated she raised concerns with the referee regarding fairness and safety after learning the player was transgender. The BBC article reports that the FA's appeal board later found Vaughan's hearing "unfair," quashing the original ruling and ordering a new process, but the case was dropped after the complainant withdrew. Vaughan, now 18, asserts the case has negatively impacted her life and seeks an apology from the FA, who have declined to comment further.</p>

          <p>Changes to de minimis rules, which allowed low-value packages to enter the US without tariffs, are causing concern among online shoppers and businesses. The BBC article reports that President Trump's decision to end the exemption has led to price hikes and potential shortages. Shoppers like Deborah Grushkin rushed to make purchases before the deadline, while businesses warn of potential failures for smaller firms. Economists estimate that ending de minimis will lead to significant new costs, disproportionately affecting lower-income households.</p>
