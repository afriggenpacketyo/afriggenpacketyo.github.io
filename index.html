          <h2>Chinese Study Challenges Darwinism with Lamarckian Findings on Rice</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by Chinese scientists published in Cell challenges Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that rice plants can inherit acquired traits without DNA changes. The research showed that rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on cold tolerance to subsequent generations through epigenetic modifications, specifically DNA methylation. This finding supports elements of Lamarckism, the 19th-century theory that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The study highlights the potential role of epigenetics in evolution and suggests that environmental factors can directly influence heritable characteristics in plants.</p>

          <p>The Monaco Grand Prix introduced a mandatory two-stop rule to increase strategic options and create more dynamic racing, but the rule's effectiveness is debated. While the rule did lead to a greater variety of strategic scenarios, it did not significantly alter the race's outcome. Some teams exploited the rule by using their drivers strategically to benefit others, leading to driver discomfort and apologies from team bosses. The core issue remains the difficulty of overtaking at Monaco, a problem that has persisted for decades, and the introduction of artificial gimmicks may not be the solution without track modifications.</p>

          <p>The diamond industry faces multiple challenges, including potential tariffs and the rise of lab-grown diamonds (LGD). The industry is pushing for diamonds to be excluded from U.S. tariffs, arguing they are raw materials used in jewelry. LGDs, chemically identical to natural diamonds, are sold at a significant discount, impacting the demand for mined diamonds. De Beers, a major player, is doubling down on natural diamonds and closing its LGD jewelry brand, aiming to reinforce its commitment to natural diamonds amid these market shifts.</p>

Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturer BYD has surpassed Tesla in pure electric car registrations in Europe for the first time in April.

          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers are declining for a second day due to concerns about a price war and increased regulatory scrutiny. BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares fell significantly after announcing price cuts on multiple electric and plug-in hybrid models. China's commerce ministry is reportedly meeting with industry bodies and automakers to address the practice of marking cars as sold to meet targets, which leads to zero-mileage cars being sold on the secondhand market. Analysts expect BYD's vehicle margin to face pressure in the short term due to the price reductions. (not investment advice)</p>
