            <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on the company's third-party sellers, suggesting they may pass increased costs to consumers. Amazon has been strategically buying forward inventory and renegotiating purchase order terms to mitigate price increases. While there's some evidence of consumers stocking up in anticipation of price hikes, the long-term impact remains uncertain. This situation underscores the challenges businesses face in navigating trade policy changes and their potential effects on consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Twenty-one aging former research chimpanzees have been moved from the Alamogordo Primate Facility to Chimp Haven, a federal sanctuary in Louisiana. The move allows the chimps, many in their 50s and 60s, to live in a more natural setting with larger social groups. The NIH stopped invasive biomedical research on chimps about a decade ago, and almost all of the approximately 300 chimps owned or supported by the NIH have been gradually transferred to Chimp Haven. The sanctuary aims to provide a happy ending for these animals after decades in research.</p>

            <p>China has vowed to strengthen and improve its export-control measures to safeguard its interests amid escalating trade tensions with the United States. The Ministry of Commerce said it will accelerate efforts to modernize the country's export-control system and improve enforcement. The move comes as Washington has imposed a 125 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, while Beijing has imposed an 84 per cent levy on US goods. China has also carried out countermeasures by imposing export controls on 28 US entities.</p>

            <p>The Nasdaq Composite experienced its largest rally since 2001, climbing over 12% as markets rebounded following President Trump's pause on tariffs for some countries.

The market's recovery followed several days of selling triggered by Trump's aggressive tariff plans, though tariffs on China remain elevated. The tech-heavy index posted its second-best day ever, reflecting investor relief and renewed optimism.</p>

            <p>The U.S. is wielding "tariffs as a weapon to exert maximum pressure and seek selfish gains," according to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian. The EU has paused retaliatory measures after President Trump backed off from tariffs on most trading partners. Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 125% has drawn criticism from Beijing, which views the move as against the whole world. The situation highlights ongoing trade tensions and the potential for further escalation.</p>

            <p>The world's most popular gadgets, including iPhones, could become more expensive in the U.S. due to tariffs on Chinese goods. Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China. If costs incurred by tariffs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise significantly. Some analysts believe Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases, while others suggest the cost of a "Made in USA" iPhone could soar.</p>

            <p>Indie icons Pulp have announced a new album, 'More,' and shared their first single in almost 24 years, called 'Spike Island.' Frontman Jarvis Cocker said the band was tempted back into the studio by the overwhelming response to their 2023 reunion tour. The new single was inspired by the infamous Stone Roses concert at Spike Island in 1990. The album, to be released on June 6, is dedicated to Pulp's former bassist Steve Mackey, who died in 2023.</p>

            <p>Ipswich striker Liam Delap will be available for £30m this summer because of a relegation release clause, which will be triggered when his club inevitably returns to the Championship. The 22-year-old is likely to move on, with interest from several Premier League sides after netting 12 goals in 33 games in all competitions in his first full season in the top flight. Previously, multiple sources told BBC Sport that Delap was expected to be available for £40m in the summer - with his previous club Manchester City holding a 'buy-back' fee at that price.</p>

The government aims to create a leaner and more focused Cabinet Office to drive work to reshape the state and deliver its Plan for Change.

            <p>President Trump has signed an order aimed at easing rules restricting water flow in showerheads, seeking to "make America's showers great again." The order directs the energy secretary to rescind a change introduced by Barack Obama that restricted multi-nozzle showers from discharging over 2.5 gallons of water per minute overall. Trump has criticized the "ridiculous" amount of time he says it takes to wet his hair in the shower. Consumer and conservation groups have argued that changing the rules is wasteful and unnecessary.</p>
