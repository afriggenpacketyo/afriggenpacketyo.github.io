          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 18:05:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University officials took a more assertive stance against pro-Palestinian protests this year, intervening aggressively when demonstrators occupied the main library. Unlike a similar incident a year prior, campus security confronted and arrested demonstrators before the New York Police Department arrived. The university's actions satisfied critics, including the Trump administration's antisemitism task force, which had previously cut research funding due to concerns about the university's handling of protests. However, the forceful response drew criticism from those who believed unarmed protesters should not be met with force, and some student activists reported injuries. The article highlights the evolving dynamics of pro-Palestinian activism and the university's response to it.</p>

          <p>Marc Short, a former chief of staff to ex-Vice President Mike Pence, argues that raising taxes on wealthy Americans is counterproductive, especially since many small businesses file taxes as individuals. Congressional Republicans are considering allowing the rate on individuals making $2.5 million or more to revert from 37% to 39.6% to help pay for middle- and working-class tax cuts. Short dismisses new Trump priorities like eliminating taxes on tips and Social Security as gimmicky, arguing they complicate the tax code. Conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity also oppose tax hikes on the wealthy.</p>

          <p>The US and UK have agreed to reduce import taxes on British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the country tariff-free, offering relief to key UK industries. The agreement reduces the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year and slashes tariffs on steel and aluminum. It also includes "reciprocal access" for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers. While leaders from both countries hail the agreement as significant, analysts note that it does not meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump.</p>

          <p>Josh Raffaelli, a former fund manager at Brookfield Asset Management, has filed a lawsuit accusing the company of fraud and attempted bribery. The suit alleges that Brookfield mistreated investors and improperly limited investments in an Elon Musk company. Raffaelli claims that Brookfield backtracked on pledges to invest in his funds and vetoed a major investment from a foreign conglomerate, limiting potential upside for clients. He also reported Pinegrove Capital Partners, an asset manager mostly owned by Brookfield, for exaggerating its capital levels. Brookfield denies the allegations, calling the suit meritless.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison is facing a lawsuit claiming negligence in maintaining its infrastructure triggered the Eaton fire, exposing people to dangerous levels of lead, asbestos, and other toxic substances. The lawsuit cites an investigation by The Times that found toxic heavy metals in soil samples at home sites even after federal crews removed ash and topsoil. Altadena was vulnerable to lead contamination because most of its homes were built before lead paint was banned. The lawsuit seeks compensation for residents harmed by the toxic substances and money for medical monitoring.</p>

          <p>A judge declared a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict in the murder trial of Christopher Schurr, a Michigan police officer who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya, a Black man, during a traffic stop. The incident, captured on video, showed Lyoya fleeing from Schurr and a scuffle over the officer's Taser before Schurr shot Lyoya. Schurr testified he feared for his life because the Taser could cause "excruciating pain" and injury. The mistrial comes one day after three former Memphis police officers were acquitted of murder in the killing of Tyre Nichols.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that the increasing focus on individual federal judges, rather than the law itself, is a concerning trend. The author contends that this shift moves away from a government of laws and towards a government of individuals, which could be exploited by figures like Trump to undermine the court system. While acknowledging that judges are not purely objective, the article suggests that focusing on their personalities rather than their rulings delegitimizes the legal process and risks physical harm against judges. The article also discusses the rise of "activist judges" and the potential for political influence on judicial decisions.</p>

Critics argue the cuts could "dismantle essential services" and exacerbate the overdose crisis.

          <p>President Trump announced a plan to modernize the air traffic control system, replacing technology at thousands of sites and building new coordination centers. The announcement follows an outage at Newark Liberty International Airport, where air traffic controllers lost communications. The plan requires a minimum of about $30 billion, with officials saying implementation would take up to four years. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian supports upgrading the air traffic control system, stating it can't operate in its current form for much longer.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates plans to give away most of his fortune by 2045, accelerating his charitable giving through the Gates Foundation. He cited Andrew Carnegie's essay, The Gospel of Wealth, arguing that wealthy people have a duty to return their fortunes to society. Gates said the foundation would draw from its endowment to give away $200 billion, focusing on eliminating preventable diseases, infectious diseases, and poverty. He also criticized the US, UK, and France for cutting their foreign aid budgets and accused Elon Musk of harming children through cuts to US aid.</p>

Israel imposed the blockade on March 2, then shattered a two-month ceasefire by resuming military operations in the territory on March 18.
