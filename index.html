          <p>Thousands of Kenyans marched in Nairobi to commemorate the one-year anniversary of deadly protests against tax hikes and economic hardship. Demonstrators chanted slogans against President Ruto, expressing frustration over unfulfilled promises of economic recovery. Security forces fortified government buildings, and many businesses and schools closed in anticipation of potential violence. The protests were also fueled by the recent death of a blogger in police custody, intensifying scrutiny of police conduct and raising concerns about human rights abuses and tactics reminiscent of Kenya's authoritarian past.</p>

          <p>Japan Post Co.'s freight license has been revoked by the government due to widespread failures in conducting mandatory alcohol checks for drivers.

          <p>An influential CDC advisory committee on immunization practices is meeting amid controversy following Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s replacement of all 17 seated members. Senators have called for a postponement due to concerns about the new committee members, some of whom have questioned vaccines and spread false claims. The meeting agenda has also raised flags, with topics like thimerosal being discussed despite being disproven as a cause of autism.

          <p>Researchers at the San Carlos Clinical Hospital in Madrid have found that injecting stem cells from human fat into mice skin may improve hair regrowth, particularly in male mice when combined with an energy-boosting molecule. The study, published in Stem Cell Research & Therapy, achieved significant hair regrowth in both male and female mice with appropriate doses. While the study's lead author cautions that human clinical trials are needed to confirm these benefits, the findings suggest a potential new therapeutic approach for androgenetic alopecia. The researchers are actively working on confirming safety for men and women in human clinical trials, with the treatment potentially available in approximately five years.</p>

          <p>Initial reports suggest that the U.S. strikes on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility may not have caused the "total obliteration" claimed by President Trump, with the Defense Intelligence Agency assessing only limited damage to the advanced centrifuges. The effectiveness of the GBU-57 bunker-busting bombs depends heavily on the type of rock they are dropped on, with calculations showing they may have only penetrated a fraction of the claimed depth. The facility's location deep under a mountain ridge may have also provided additional protection. While the White House disputes these claims, the reports raise questions about the success of the operation.</p>

          <p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader since 1989, holds immense power within the country's intricate political structure. He has the final word on national security matters and controls various institutions, including the military, intelligence agencies, and state-controlled charitable foundations. While he has expressed distrust of the U.S., he has also consented to nuclear agreements and resisted surrendering Iran's uranium enrichment programs. At 86, Khamenei is focused on the survival of the revolution and has named possible successors, influencing the future leadership of Iran.</p>

Experts explain that the word's meaning is defined by the context of the moment, advising parents not to fear slang and to read the context clues.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite expectations, the recent conflict between Israel and Iran has not caused an oil crisis, with prices remaining lower than pre-attack levels. This resilience is attributed to several factors, including Iran's decision not to disrupt oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz and traders becoming more skeptical of price spikes. Additionally, the approaching autumn season typically sees lower oil demand, and the market is currently oversupplied, with the U.S. being the world's dominant oil producer. These factors have collectively mitigated the potential for a crisis, leading to a more stable oil market than anticipated.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months. The assessment found that entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, but the underground infrastructure remains largely intact. The assessment provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take for Iran to regain access to the facilities, and some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes. The White House has disputed the findings, calling the assessment "flat-out wrong."</p>

          <p>A Japanese court has convicted a U.S. Marine of sexually assaulting a woman on Okinawa, sentencing him to seven years in prison.
