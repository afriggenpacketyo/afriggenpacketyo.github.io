        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several European countries are reconsidering nuclear power as a means to achieve greater energy independence, driven partly by the costs associated with renewable energy sources. Denmark plans to analyze the potential of new nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, while Spain may review the shutdown of its nuclear plants, and Germany has softened its opposition to atomic power. This renewed interest in nuclear energy reflects a hedging strategy to complement renewables like solar and wind, ensuring a more stable and diverse energy supply for the future. Denmark, however, clarified it does not plan to return to traditional nuclear power plants.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to brand damage from CEO Elon Musk's political involvement and increasing competition. Despite overall battery electric car sales rising in Europe, Tesla's sales have tanked nearly 40% over the January-April period. The company faces challenges from traditional automakers and aggressive Chinese players like BYD, which recently outsold Tesla in Europe for pure electric cars. Additionally, European consumers are showing a preference for hybrid electric vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently serve.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain due to pericardial constriction, a rare condition where the sac around the heart thickens and prevents it from fully opening. After contracting COVID-19 and experiencing a series of unexplained symptoms, doctors at NYU Langone eventually diagnosed Mauceri's condition through open-heart surgery. The surgery, performed by Dr. Eugene Grossi, involved removing the thickened pericardium, allowing Mauceri's heart to function normally again. Following the surgery and subsequent treatment for a small intestine blockage, Mauceri has returned to conducting and feels healthier than he has in years.</p>

          <p>NPR and three Colorado public radio stations have filed a lawsuit against the Trump White House, challenging the president's executive order that aims to block the use of Congressionally appropriated funds for NPR and PBS. The lawsuit alleges that the order infringes on Congress's right to direct federal spending and violates First Amendment protections for freedom of speech and the press. NPR's President and CEO Katherine Maher argues that the order is retaliatory and viewpoint-based discrimination. The suit highlights the interconnectedness of the public radio system and the vital role it plays in providing news and information to millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>As former Governor Andrew Cuomo leads in the New York City mayoral race, his rivals are increasingly comparing him to the current mayor, Eric Adams, suggesting that electing Cuomo would be akin to a second term for Adams. Both are moderate Democrats who often criticize the left wing of their party and share similar policy positions on mental health, rent control, and charter schools. The Justice Department is investigating Cuomo over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, a situation mirroring Adams's own federal investigation. Despite these similarities, Cuomo's campaign emphasizes his superior management skills compared to Adams's scandal-ridden tenure.</p>

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's aversion to wind power, some Texas Republicans are embracing it as a vital source of income for rural communities. Rancher and former state lawmaker John Davis, a staunch Trump supporter, has allowed wind turbines on his property, providing significant financial opportunities for his family and local community. However, a series of bills in the Texas legislature threaten to curtail the state's renewable energy sector, prompting bewilderment among conservatives who recognize the economic benefits of clean energy. These bills could reverse Texas's position as a clean energy leader and limit landowners' ability to host wind and solar farms.</p>

          <p>Pakistani authorities confiscated two African lions and arrested a man in Punjab province after he was seen walking one of the lions on the street while carrying an automatic rifle, causing panic among residents. The man, who was filming a TikTok video, faces up to seven years in prison for illegal possession of lions and endangering public safety. Under the Punjab Wildlife Act, keeping or displaying big cats in urban areas is a criminal offense. The government in Punjab has also launched an app to register big cats in an attempt to regulate ownership.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old Florida man, Timothy Schulz, was fatally shot by sheriff's deputies after an apparent alligator attack in a lake. Deputies were called to the scene after reports of a man acting bizarrely and swimming in a lake known to contain alligators. After emerging from the water with an alligator bite, Schulz charged at deputies with garden shears and then attempted to enter their patrol vehicle, resulting in the deputies shooting him. The incident is under investigation, and the deputies have been placed on routine administrative leave.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has increased its growth forecast for the UK economy in 2025 to 1.2%, rising to 1.4% in 2026, citing an ongoing economic recovery. However, the IMF warns that the Chancellor must adhere to fiscal rules regarding tax and spending to maintain stability. The report points to global trade tensions and uncertainty as factors that could weigh down growth, while praising the government's planning reforms and infrastructure investment plans. The IMF suggests some changes to the government's self-imposed fiscal rules, including cutting the number of times the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) produces an assessment of the UK's finances to once a year, rather than twice.

          <p>UK food inflation has reached its highest annual rate in a year, driven by rising beef and fresh produce prices. According to the British Retail Consortium, food prices rose 2.8% in the year to May, with beef prices increasing significantly due to high demand and low supply. A steakhouse chain reported passing on some of the increased costs to customers, while farming industry experts claim that government schemes have not supported beef production. The industry struggles to keep up with beef demand as environmental schemes are prioritized over production. (not investment advice)</p>

While some observers worry that his return could jeopardize mediation efforts, others argue that sidelining Kabila is counterproductive.

The difficulty in enforcing the rule consistently has led to calls for a simpler solution, such as limiting the maximum length of putters.

          <p>President Trump delivered a Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery, honoring fallen veterans but also including personal boasting and partisan asides. While paying tribute to military sacrifices, Trump claimed he was "fixing" the republic after a difficult four years and criticized unchecked immigration. He promoted the upcoming US army's 250th anniversary and mentioned the World Cup and Olympics being held in the US during his term. The speech also saw references to the diversity efforts in the military and a pardon for Scott Jenkins.</p>
