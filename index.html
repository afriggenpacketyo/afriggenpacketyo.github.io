          <p>Nomura Holdings, a Japanese investment bank, is set to purchase Macquarie's U.S. and European public asset management businesses for $1.8 billion in an all-cash deal expected to finalize by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. This acquisition aligns with Nomura's strategic goal to expand its global asset management division, anticipating an increase in assets under management from $590 billion to $770 billion. Macquarie will retain its Australian public investments business and collaborate with Nomura on future product distribution, with Nomura providing seed capital for alternative funds for U.S. clients. The transaction's financial impact on Nomura is projected to be minimal, with both entities continuing independent operations until the deal concludes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has unveiled a proposed budget that addresses a nearly $1 billion financial gap by eliminating over 2,700 city positions, with approximately 1,650 layoffs across various departments, including over 400 civilian positions at the LAPD. While the Fire Department would see an increase in staffing, many other agencies face significant spending reductions, impacting services like animal care, transportation, and sanitation. Union leaders have vowed to fight the layoffs, urging the state for financial assistance, as the city grapples with rising personnel costs, legal payouts, and a slowing local economy.</p>

          <p>Following Nico Iamaleava's departure from Tennessee to UCLA due to a reported NIL dispute, UCLA quarterback Joey Aguilar is now transferring to Tennessee. Iamaleava's move was driven by a disagreement with Tennessee over his NIL deal, which he felt should be worth $4 million for the upcoming season. Despite Iamaleava's father denying the NIL-related narrative, Aguilar's transfer was prompted by Iamaleava's confirmation of his move to UCLA. Aguilar, with one year of eligibility remaining, brings a record of 6,760 passing yards and 56 touchdowns from his previous two seasons.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging its efforts to exert control over academic decision-making and alleging a threat to $9 billion in federal funding. The lawsuit follows the administration's demands for changes to Harvard's policies, including oversight of viewpoints taught at the university, which Harvard President Alan Garber rejected as governmental overreach. Harvard claims the administration's actions, including freezing funding and threatening tax-exempt status, have severe consequences for research, students, and the standing of American higher education. The lawsuit marks the first legal challenge against Trump's crackdown on universities accused of mishandling campus protests.</p>

The expansion includes new firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and mechanics, aiming to improve response capabilities and address homelessness-related fire incidents. This proposal comes after criticism of budget cuts impacting the department's ability to combat the wildfire, which destroyed thousands of structures and resulted in fatalities.

          <p>A minke whale died from domoic acid poisoning linked to a toxic algal bloom in Long Beach Harbor, adding to the growing number of marine animals affected by the bloom in Southern California. Test results confirmed high levels of domoic acid in the whale's urine, consistent with other marine mammals affected by the bloom, which began earlier than usual this year. The algal bloom is attributed to an upwelling of nutrients and possibly climate change and runoff from recent fires, impacting hundreds of sea lions and dolphins.</p>

          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced another plunge as President Trump intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for not lowering interest rates. Trump's remarks added to market turmoil already fueled by his tariff plans, raising fears of an economic recession. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all fell significantly, while the dollar index reached its lowest level since 2022. Gold prices surged as investors sought safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty.</p>

The Supreme Court has halted deportations under the Alien Enemies Act unless detainees are given due process to challenge their removal.

This marks a shift from the 2021 election, where the environment was a top voter concern. Concerns over rising prices, energy costs, and the war in Ukraine have contributed to the change in focus.</p>
