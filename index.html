          <h2>Expert Debunks Myths on Cooking Oils, Advises on Healthy Choices for Frying</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 19:06:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A University of Cambridge professor, Nita Forouhi, debunks common myths about cooking oils, advising on healthier choices for home cooking. The article clarifies that sunflower and vegetable oils are good for us, being low in saturated fats and high in beneficial polyunsaturated fats, contrary to some negative claims. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy due to near-zero trans fats. While extra virgin olive oil is best for dressings due to its low smoke point, basic olive oil is suitable for shallow frying, and vegetable or sunflower oil for deep frying.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's Crackdown on Sanctuary Jurisdictions Sees Limited Success</h2>

          <p>Eight months into the Trump administration, its aggressive efforts to penalize "sanctuary" cities and states for non-cooperation with federal immigration enforcement have yielded few tangible results. Despite numerous lawsuits, threats of funding cuts, and increased ICE raids, most jurisdictions maintain their policies, citing the 10th Amendment. Federal courts have largely blocked attempts to withhold funds, and only Louisville, Kentucky, and the state of Nevada have reversed their sanctuary policies. This article highlights the legal and political stalemate surrounding immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the world must acknowledge the evolving threat from a modernized North Korean military, moving beyond its nuclear program. Leader Kim Jong-un signaled a strategic shift towards significantly upgrading conventional armed forces, possibly with Russian assistance, recognizing that conventional capabilities are crucial for winning wars. This presents a critical new variable in regional security, as a nuclear-armed North Korea pursues comprehensive conventional weapons modernization, innovation in defense production, and integration of cutting-edge technologies.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce "fundamental changes" to its asylum system, requiring refugees to wait longer than the current five years to apply for permanent settlement. The automatic family reunion route for close relatives, temporarily suspended in September, will be permanently scrapped. The prime minister stated that settlement "must be earned by contributing to the country," aligning with stricter rules for legal visa holders. Critics argue these measures will not deter illegal migration but push vulnerable people towards smugglers, while the Refugee Council expresses concern.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval is reportedly slipping among Latino voters, a key demographic, primarily due to economic concerns like high grocery and housing prices. Recent polls indicate significant disapproval of his handling of the economy and growing concern over immigration reform, with nearly half fearing deportation. Despite this decline in Trump's support, Democratic-commissioned polling suggests Democrats have not made major gains among these voters. This article highlights a complex political landscape where dissatisfaction with one party doesn't automatically translate to support for the other.</p>

          <p>The US government shutdown is halting "nonessential" work across federal agencies, impacting critical services like wildfire management, weather forecasting, and disaster response. While the Forest Service will continue wildfire response, prevention efforts like prescribed burns will be reduced, and state grants for forest management delayed.
