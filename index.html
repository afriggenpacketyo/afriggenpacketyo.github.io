          <p>King Charles III's visit to Ottawa underscores Canada's sovereignty in response to suggestions from U.S. President Donald Trump about annexing the northern neighbor. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, outlining the government's agenda. This rare occurrence, with Charles' mother having done it only twice, highlights the differences between Canada and the U.S. The King's support for Canada has been evident, including displaying Canadian military medals. The King will also participate in community events during his visit, reinforcing Canada's unique identity and history.</p>

          <p>Nicolás Maduro's government in Venezuela claimed a sweeping victory in regional and legislative elections, despite low turnout and the absence of independent monitors. The electoral council, loyal to Maduro, announced the results on state television without providing evidence, sparking criticism that the election was a performance to legitimize the government. Opposition leaders were divided on whether to participate, with some calling for a boycott due to concerns about fairness. Maduro's government has been accused of manipulating elections and suppressing dissent, leading to further political instability and division within the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump delayed imposing 50% tariffs on all imports from the European Union until July 9 to allow more time for trade negotiations. The decision followed a conversation with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who requested additional time to reach a trade deal. Trump's initial threat of tariffs had raised concerns about an economically destabilizing trade war. While the delay provides a window for further talks, economists have warned that ongoing trade tensions and uncertainty are slowing business investment and disrupting global supply chains.

This arrest follows the detention of three other officials at the Chongjin shipyard where the destroyer was built.

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that around 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake, more than double the number detected in 2022. This increase is attributed to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews and improved detection systems. The company uses a three-pronged process relying on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews. Boosting and member fraud account for the bulk of fake reviews, while paid reviews, often originating in Asia, are considered more pernicious.</p>
