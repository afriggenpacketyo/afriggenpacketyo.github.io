          <p>A 23-year-old former student, identified as Robin Westman, opened fire on Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass, killing two children. The victims were 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski. Authorities report the shooter, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, had legally purchased three firearms and harbored a fascination with past mass shootings. The investigation is exploring potential motives, including hate and domestic terrorism, as writings left by the shooter contained anti-Catholic and other hateful references.</p>

          <p>India's economy grew by 7.8% year-over-year in the April-June quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts due to strong performance in manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. Despite this robust real GDP growth, a fall in nominal GDP growth to 8.8% from 10.8% in the previous quarter suggests a potential slowdown. Economists note that while corporate earnings are strong, upcoming U.S. tariffs and a falling rupee could pose challenges in the coming quarters, tempering the otherwise positive outlook.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, this article revisits the event, which became the costliest and one of the deadliest storms in U.S. history. The failure of New Orleans' levee system led to the flooding of 80% of the city, causing nearly 1,400 deaths and a severe humanitarian crisis. The piece reflects on the chaotic aftermath, the criticized federal response, and the lasting impact on communities like the Lower Ninth Ward, which residents say has never fully recovered from the disaster.</p>

          <p>Share prices for major UK banks like NatWest, Lloyds, and Barclays have dropped following a proposal from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) for a new windfall tax on their profits. The think tank argues the tax could raise up to £8 billion annually to compensate taxpayers for losses incurred from the Bank of England's quantitative easing program. While the Treasury has not commented, banking industry groups warn that such a tax would harm the UK's international competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revoked the Secret Service protection for his 2024 election rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris. A senior adviser confirmed the decision, which ends the security detail that typically extends for six months after a vice president leaves office but had been extended to a year under the previous administration. This move follows other instances of Trump ending federal security for political figures, including former National Security Advisor John Bolton and Joe Biden's children.</p>

          <p>Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has been dismissed by the country's Constitutional Court over a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen. The court ruled that her informal and critical remarks about the Thai army during the call violated ethical standards, marking the fifth time a prime minister has been removed by the court since 2008. The decision is a significant blow to the powerful Shinawatra political dynasty and plunges the nation's politics into a new period of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced that no official Israeli government delegation will be invited to the DSEI defense exhibition in London due to Israel's military escalation in Gaza. A UK government spokesperson called the operation "wrong" and stressed the need for a diplomatic solution. Israel's defense ministry condemned the move as discriminatory and politically motivated, though individual Israeli defense firms will still be permitted to attend the major international trade show, highlighting a growing diplomatic rift.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual arrival of pumpkin spice season faces a new threat from the Trump administration's 50 percent tariffs on imports from India, a major exporter of key spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. While the immediate impact on this year's products may be minimal, the tariffs are expected to eventually raise costs for the multi-billion dollar pumpkin spice industry. This economic pressure will test the limits of America's cultural obsession with the flavor, which has evolved from a seasonal trend into a ubiquitous consumer phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, a detailed analysis suggests that despite a $14.4 billion investment in a new levee system, New Orleans remains critically vulnerable. The article argues that factors like rapid land subsidence and sea-level rise are eroding the effectiveness of the new defenses faster than projected, potentially leaving the city exposed to future catastrophic storms. Compounded by federal and state funding cuts for maintenance and resilience projects, the city's long-term future is described as being deeply uncertain.</p>

While these retailers will likely remain cheaper than traditional stores, consumers should expect price increases and potential shipping delays as global postal services and businesses adapt to the new rules, which may also impact lower-income households more significantly.</p>
