          <p>The Russian Defense Ministry reported that Ukrainian drones targeted airfields in five regions, resulting in fires affecting several aircraft. According to reports, the attacks occurred in the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions, with drones launched from areas near the airfields. While Russia claims to have repelled most of the attacks, Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency asserted responsibility, estimating the damage to Russian strategic aviation at $7 billion. This incident follows President Zelenskyy's announcement of a delegation traveling to Istanbul for peace negotiations with Russia. The optimism score takes into account the context of ongoing conflict and potential escalation.</p>

          <p>David Challen successfully campaigned for his mother, Sally Challen's release from prison after she killed his father, Richard, with a hammer, after decades of coercive control. A law passed in 2015, which recognizes psychological manipulation as a form of domestic abuse, helped secure Mrs. Challen's release from prison after she had been jailed for life for murder in 2011. David has written a book, called 'The Unthinkable', about his family's experiences to help others, highlighting the need for greater awareness and protection for victims of domestic abuse. He described normalizing the coercion and control in his home, as well as the sexual violence his mother endured.</p>

          <p>An international study found that regular exercise during the three years following colon cancer treatment can significantly improve survival rates. Colon cancer patients who participated in a structured exercise program were 28% less likely to experience a recurrence of cancer and had a 37% higher overall survival rate after eight years. The exercise group engaged in moderate-intensity activities for 2 ½ hours per week, guided by coaches. Researchers suggest that exercise should be considered a standard treatment for colon cancer, as it could be remarkably cost-effective compared to new cancer drugs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Rand Paul expressed his opposition to President Trump's "one big beautiful bill," citing concerns about the national debt. Paul believes the bill requests too much money, particularly for military spending and border security, arguing that the President has already curbed border flow without additional funds or legislation. His primary objection centers on the bill's provision to raise the debt ceiling, which he advocates removing for a separate vote. While Paul is open to supporting the bill's tax components if the debt ceiling provision is removed, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defends the bill's impact on the deficit, citing income from tariffs.</p>

          <p>Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), suggested that the White House may not need Congressional approval for all of President Trump's proposed cuts to the federal workforce. Vought indicated the administration prefers using "executive tools" for most cuts, submitting only a fraction of the "department of government efficiency" (Doge) changes to Congress. He defended the cost-cutting measures proposed in the One Big Beautiful Bill, arguing it would not increase the deficit. Vought's remarks underscore the administration's efforts to consolidate power and dismantle the federal workforce, sparking debate over the constitutionality of such actions.</p>

          <p>An attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of more than 30 people, with scores wounded, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses. Witnesses claim they were fired upon from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while the Israeli military denies involvement. The incident occurred amidst faltering mediation efforts to secure a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) delivered aid "without incident" early on Sunday and dismissed what it referred to as "false reporting about deaths, mass injuries and chaos" around its sites.</p>
