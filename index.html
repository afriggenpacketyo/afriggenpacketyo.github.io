          <p>An eyewitness and former aid truck driver has alleged that American security subcontractors, alongside the IDF, indiscriminately fired upon Palestinian civilians seeking aid at sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The witness provided secretly recorded videos to CBS News, claiming shootings were a daily occurrence and describing scenes of desperation among Palestinians. The GHF and the IDF have categorically denied the allegations, calling them baseless and stating that no civilians have been killed by gunfire at or near their sites. The UN reports over 1,800 Palestinians have died trying to access food since May.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders addressed recent comments from teammate Dillon Gabriel, who distinguished between "entertainers" and "competitors." Gabriel later clarified his remarks were aimed at the media, not Sanders, a sentiment Sanders acknowledged without fully confirming his belief. Sanders stated that others' words do not affect him and that his focus remains on his performance, regardless of external narratives or potential controversy within the team's crowded quarterback room. The interaction highlights the media scrutiny surrounding the two rookie players as they compete for a spot.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has determined that Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, was not lawfully appointed as the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. The ruling disqualifies her from participating in ongoing criminal cases, stating she has exercised her duties without legal authority since July 2025. While the judge noted this does not automatically invalidate past indictments, her actions could be declared void. The Trump administration, which used a novel series of personnel moves to install her, has announced it will immediately appeal the decision.</p>

Individuals found with violations, such as criminal activity or overstaying their visa, will have their visas revoked and face deportation if in the U.S. In a separate move, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced an immediate halt to issuing work visas for commercial truck drivers, citing safety and economic concerns for American workers.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a contentious congressional redistricting plan into law, which will now go before California voters in a November special election for final approval. The new map is designed to make five Republican-held U.S. House seats more favorable to Democrats, serving as a direct response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas. Democrats argue the move is necessary to neutralize what they call a power grab by Donald Trump and to protect democracy. California Republicans have condemned the plan as an illegal, partisan strategy that undermines the state's independent redistricting commission.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, slowed to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in the previous month but still exceeding economists' forecasts of 3%.

The "core-core" inflation metric, closely watched by the Bank of Japan as it strips out both food and energy costs, remained steady at 3.4%. These figures arrive as the central bank continues to monitor price trends while navigating sluggish trade numbers and modest economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, facing mounting debt from years of poor harvests, has successfully pivoted his family's business by trading crops for sheep. He now practices solar grazing, renting out his flock of 6,000 sheep to act as natural lawn mowers for large-scale solar farms, which keeps vegetation from obstructing the panels. This innovative approach turned a potential $200,000 loss from cotton farming into a nearly $300,000 profit in one year. The venture highlights a growing trend for farmers seeking stable income amid the economic challenges facing small and mid-sized agricultural operations.</p>

The vehicle, which was discontinued in 2023, returns longer, wider, and taller with significantly more cargo space and a technology-focused interior. With a starting price of $36,995, Stellantis hopes the revitalized and more efficient Cherokee will reclaim market share in the competitive midsize SUV segment.</p>

          <p>An analysis of military technology reveals that the West, particularly the U.S. and UK, is playing catch-up in the development of hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound. China and Russia are currently considered the leaders in this field, having invested heavily in these programs for years while Western nations focused on counter-insurgency. These weapons are a strategic threat due to their extreme speed and maneuverability, making them difficult to detect and intercept with current defense systems. The article notes this renewed arms race is a component of an emerging geopolitical contest not seen since the Cold War.</p>

          <p>American midfielder Dante Polvara made a significant impact for Aberdeen, coming off the bench to score a crucial goal and lead a comeback in their Europa League play-off match against FCSB. Trailing 2-0, Aberdeen's hopes were revived when Polvara scored just three minutes after being substituted into the game, which ultimately ended in a 2-2 draw. The fan-favorite player has been used sparingly by the manager this season, but his energetic and effective performance has created a strong case for him to be included in the starting lineup for the second leg of the tie in Bucharest.</p>

The false report, known as a swatting incident, caused panic and terror among students and faculty who were instructed to shelter in place. Local and federal authorities, including the FBI, have launched an investigation to find the person responsible for making the fake threat, which is a criminal offense.</p>

This action is part of a broader, unprecedented effort by President Trump to influence the independent central bank's policies and personnel.

          <p>President Trump has voiced strong support for the Resolution Copper mine project in Arizona, which would be built on land sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe. His endorsement came after a federal appeals court issued a last-minute order temporarily halting the transfer of the federal land, known as Oak Flat, to the multinational mining companies. Trump met with mining executives and criticized the court's decision, emphasizing the project's job creation and the nation's need for copper. Tribal leaders and environmental groups continue to fight the project, arguing it will destroy a vital religious and cultural site.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's recent commitment to provide U.S. "security guarantees" to Ukraine, a significant policy shift, has been weakened by Russia's immediate and public rejection of the concept. Throughout the week, Russian officials have reiterated that the presence of any foreign troops in Ukraine is unacceptable, directly contradicting the premise of a NATO-like security blanket. This public undermining of the U.S. president's declaration makes a potential peace deal look doubtful and complicates the diplomatic landscape.

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the massive financial penalty, which had grown to over $500 million with interest, imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial. The judges ruled that while Trump was liable for fraud, the fine was excessive and likely violated constitutional protections against severe punishment. The court upheld the non-monetary penalties, including a three-year ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York. The New York Attorney General's office, which brought the case, plans to appeal the decision on the fine to the state's highest court.</p>
