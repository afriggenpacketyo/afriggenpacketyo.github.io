          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted for the 31st time since December, with lava fountains soaring 100 feet from its summit crater. This highly active volcano's latest display is contained within the crater, posing no threat to homes, offering spectacular views for park visitors and livestream audiences. Scientists monitor the magma flow and ground changes to predict eruptions, noting a recent trend of shorter, wider lava fountains. Native Hawaiian tradition views the crater as home to the goddess Pele, emphasizing the cultural significance of these natural phenomena.</p>

          <p>Multiple postal services in Europe and India are suspending most package shipments to the United States due to new import duties imposed by the Trump administration. Effective August 29, goods valued under $800, previously exempt, will face tariffs, causing confusion and operational challenges for carriers. Countries like Germany, Denmark, and India cited a lack of clarity on new rules and insufficient time to prepare for duty collection mechanisms. This move impacts international trade, though letters and small gifts under $100 remain exempt, and private express services are unaffected.</p>

          <p>At least 25 people were killed in Israeli strikes and shootings in Gaza, including those sheltering in tents and seeking food aid, as a famine declaration for Gaza City intensified global pressure. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) reported catastrophic hunger affecting nearly a quarter of Gaza's population, attributing it to the war and aid restrictions. Israel dismissed the famine declaration as false while continuing preparations for a Gaza City offensive, further complicating stalled ceasefire efforts. Aid groups and a grieving relative pleaded for a truce amidst the escalating humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's attempt to withhold Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants from 34 cities and counties identified as "sanctuary cities." These cities had policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The ruling prevents the administration from stripping hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, expanding protections for these municipalities. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the Trump administration's efforts to compel local governments to align with its immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced he would swiftly sign a controversial GOP redistricting bill, which passed the state Senate after a weeks-long standoff in the House. The Republican-backed proposal aims to redraw the state's congressional map, creating five new GOP-leaning districts to bolster Republican seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats have vowed to challenge the new map in court, arguing it dilutes minority voting power and undermines fair representation. This move follows President Trump's call for a special session to secure more Republican seats.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez were denied parole after separate hearings in California, decades after killing their parents in 1989. The parole boards cited the brothers' prison conduct, rather than solely the original crimes, as a primary reason for denial. Erik's history included fights, drug use, a tax-fraud scam, and stashing banned items, contradicting claims of being a "model prisoner." Lyle's denial acknowledged his remorse but highlighted persistent "anti-social personality traits" like deception and rule-breaking, including recent mobile phone violations. Both brothers continued to claim self-defense due to alleged sexual abuse by their father.</p>

Director Robin Kvapil filmed the participants as they witnessed destruction in Kharkiv and mass graves near Izium, yet their opinions remained largely unchanged, often dismissing evidence as "faked" or "propaganda." The film, released on the anniversary of the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, has sparked intense debate in the Czech Republic about Russian influence and national division.

The device delivers gentle pulses to the vagus nerve while patients perform tasks, leading to two to three times greater improvement compared to rehab alone.

Utilizing LLCs and trusts can also shield assets from lawsuits and allow parents to outline usage rules, preventing conflicts among siblings.

Elliott, known for strategic activism, has successfully influenced these changes without taking a board seat, signaling management's commitment to long-term growth. These actions, alongside the planned diabetes business spin-off and new product developments, are expected to instill shareholder confidence in Medtronic's future trajectory (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Businesses are reintroducing "recession specials," a trend indicating deteriorating consumer sentiment and growing fears of an economic slowdown, exacerbated by President Trump's recent tariffs. Establishments like Brooklyn's Clever Blend and San Francisco's Super Duper burger chain are offering discounted deals, some explicitly using "recession" in their branding. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index has declined, with concerns over trade policy, inflation, and weakening labor markets driving the shift. This trend reflects a widespread public bracing for economic hardship, leading to a pullback in spending across all age groups (not investment advice).</p>

Residents like the Blancetts, displaced by Hurricane Ian, are moving inland to "storm-proof" towns, while others rebuild existing homes with hurricane-resistant features, often with nonprofit assistance. Despite the clear return on investment for preventive measures, federal support for mitigation is declining under the Trump administration, which has cut FEMA grants and even proposed shutting down the agency.

          <p>President Trump's recent attacks on the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, labeling it "OUT OF CONTROL" for its portrayal of slavery, echo a century-old "lost cause" myth. This myth, spearheaded by groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy, sought to minimize chattel slavery and vindicate white people from its role in U.S. history. Trump's tirade, similar to comments by other conservative figures, aims to overhaul museum exhibits and politicize their content, comparing funding cuts to universities to a potential re-evaluation of the museum's displays. Critics argue this is a deliberate attempt to pervert history and control the national narrative.</p>

The Coast Guard searched for 18 hours but found no trace of Kawahara, whose life jacket was still on the boat, suggesting a "freak occurrence." Friends and family are mourning the loss of the respected salmon, tuna, and halibut fisherman, who was also a passionate advocate for fish conservancy. The last clues are text messages from Kawahara describing a foggy morning and a whale surfacing near his boat, before all communication ceased.</p>

          <p>The parents of baby Emmanuel Haro have been arrested on suspicion of murder after authorities concluded they faked his abduction, ending a week-long national search. Rebecca Haro initially reported being attacked and her baby kidnapped, but her statements contradicted evidence, leading to her and Jake Haro's arrest. Investigators believe Emmanuel is deceased and are still searching for his body, having served multiple search warrants and analyzed electronic devices. Riverside County child protective services also removed a 2-year-old child from the couple's home. The community, which had held vigils, is now demanding answers for the "beautiful, little baby."</p>
