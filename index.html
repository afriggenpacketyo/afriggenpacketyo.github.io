          <h2>US Faces Protracted 'Cold War' with Iran Following Strikes on Nuclear Facilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 05:00:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a precarious US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Iran, this opinion article analyzes the strategic motivations behind the recent American strike on Iran's nuclear infrastructure. It argues the pre-emptive attack was not to stop an imminent threat but to deny Iran near-term weapon-building options, a conclusion supported by CIA intelligence suggesting key facilities will take years to rebuild. The author contends that deep-seated ideological divides make formal peace unlikely, positioning the US for a prolonged period of containment and deterrence similar to a new Cold War, where stability will depend on strategic patience rather than diplomatic breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>During a diplomatic tour in Europe, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi addressed concerns over Beijing's export controls on dual-use goods, including rare earths. Speaking in Berlin, Wang asserted that these materials have never been and should not become an issue between China and the European Union, assuring that the normal needs of European companies will be met if regulations are followed. He framed China's policies as being in line with international norms and contributing to world peace, suggesting that those who are 'deliberately hyping the issue' have ulterior motives. The visit aims to set the stage for an upcoming China-EU summit.</p>

          <h2>Cities Across the US increasingly Replace Traditional Fireworks with Drone Shows for July 4th</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 05:00:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dozens of American cities are opting for synchronized drone displays instead of traditional fireworks for their Independence Day celebrations this year. Citing safety concerns like drought conditions and fire risks, cities such as Salt Lake City are embracing the high-tech alternative. Proponents also highlight that drone shows are quieter, making them more inclusive for individuals with PTSD and pets, and are a more environmentally friendly option. While the drone show industry is experiencing a surge in demand, the shift is not without resistance, as some communities, like those in Lake Tahoe, are reverting to pyrotechnics after public pushback.</p>

          <p>Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff attributes the U.S. dollar's worst start to a year in half a century to President Trump's policies. In an interview, Rogoff stated that trade wars and rhetoric threatening foreign investment have acted as a catalyst for the dollar's 10.8% drop, making the U.S. seem less safe for investors. He also highlighted concerns over the nation's escalating debt and the lack of a clear plan to manage it, suggesting these factors are accelerating a global trend of moving away from the dollar. This shift could have significant long-term costs for the American economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In observance of the Fourth of July, NPR gathered perspectives on freedom from a diverse group of everyday Americans. The responses reveal a complex and multifaceted understanding of the concept, moving beyond its traditional definition. For many, freedom is intrinsically linked to safety from poverty and violence, the right to self-determination without systemic barriers, and the ability to live without fear. Several contributors emphasized that true liberty involves a collective responsibility to others, arguing that individual freedom cannot exist at the expense of another's rights. The collection of voices highlights a national dialogue grappling with both the ideals and the current realities of freedom in the United States.</p>

          <p>Zarah Sultana, the independent MP for Coventry South, has announced her resignation from the Labour Party to establish a new political party alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sultana, who was stripped of the Labour whip for opposing the two-child benefit cap, cited the government's stance on Gaza, growing poverty, and welfare policies as key reasons for her departure. In her statement, she accused the political establishment of smearing those protesting the situation in Gaza and declared the current government an 'active participant in genocide.'

The situation in Saxony is particularly dangerous as the blaze is detonating old munitions buried in a former military training ground where the fire started.

Burke stated that while visa cancellations are typically for public advocacy, an exception was made for Ye, emphasizing that Australia does not need to 'deliberately import bigotry.'

The documentary celebrates the perseverance of those at the back of the pack, showcasing their often-extraordinary personal stories, such as a man who ran after recovering from paralysis. Organizers and filmmakers believe these relatable stories of overcoming personal challenges can inspire a broader audience to see themselves as runners. The film challenges the conventional sports documentary genre by arguing that the most compelling narratives are not always found at the front of the race.</p>

While Germany's factory activity shows slight signs of recovery, it remains in contraction, underscoring the continent's economic challenges. Analysts suggest that the EU's desire to rebuild its industrial base means it cannot afford a flood of cheap Chinese imports, making this a central issue in diplomatic and trade negotiations.

          <p>Russia launched its largest single aerial attack on Kyiv since the beginning of the war, using a combination of 550 drones and missiles to target the Ukrainian capital overnight. The massive barrage injured at least 23 people and caused significant damage across multiple districts, including partially destroying a residential building and sparking fires in warehouses and homes. Ukrainian air defenses successfully intercepted 270 targets, but Russia still managed to hit eight locations. The attack occurred just hours after President Trump confirmed a pause in some U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine, including critical air defense munitions.</p>

The Public Accounts Committee found that the department has failed to analyze exit check data since the visa route was introduced in 2020 and shows 'little curiosity' about its operation. The report also highlighted evidence of exploitation, including debt bondage and excessive hours for workers on this visa route.

          <p>The U.S. Space Force is a potential major beneficiary of President Trump's recently passed tax and spending package, which could deliver a 30% year-on-year funding increase to nearly $40 billion in 2026. A significant portion of this budget, around $25 billion, is slated for the 'Golden Dome' multi-layered missile defense system, representing an initial investment in interceptors and advanced sensors. This financial boost provides a beacon of hope for defense and space contractors amid budget cuts at NASA and signals a strategic pivot from space exploration to achieving 'space superiority.'

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics are becoming a tool for the Trump administration to exert federal power and advance a political agenda. The author highlights how the event's 'National Special Security Event' (NSSE) designation, enacted years in advance, grants broad latitude to federal agencies like ICE, creating a climate of fear for the city's large undocumented population. The article warns that Trump could leverage federal funding and security oversight to undermine local Democratic leaders, turning the international sporting event into a vehicle for stoking nationalism and implementing hardline immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Recent criticism from Chinese state media regarding the addictive nature of 'blind box' toys is unlikely to hinder the growth of Pop Mart, the company behind the popular Labubu dolls. While the commentary caused a temporary dip in its stock, analysts believe the company is insulated from significant regulatory impact because its primary demographic is young adults, not the minors targeted by the critique. Furthermore, Pop Mart's rapidly expanding overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, provide a substantial cushion, with international revenue projected to soon account for over half of its total sales.</p>
