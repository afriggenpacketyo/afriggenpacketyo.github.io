          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing Beto O'Rourke's political action committee, Powered by People, from funding Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a Republican redistricting plan. The lawsuit, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, accuses the PAC of deceptive fundraising and bribery to cover travel and lodging for the absent legislators. O'Rourke has countersued, claiming the move is a political attempt to silence dissent and dismantle a major voter registration organization. The order remains in effect for two weeks pending a further hearing.</p>

The win marks a successful start to her partnership with new coach Francisco Roig. Despite a slow start in the sweltering heat, Raducanu demonstrated strong defense and returning skills, capitalizing on her opponent's errors to secure the win. Her next match will be a challenging Wimbledon rematch against either world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or former champion Marketa Vondrousova.</p>

          <h2>Bengals Coach Zac Taylor Details Preference for Preseason Games Over Joint Practices</h2>

          <p>Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor has explained why his team is one of only three in the NFL to forgo popular joint practices during training camp. Taylor stated he prefers using the time to focus on his own team's development and install new plays, rather than preparing for a specific opponent. He believes that intrasquad competition and giving starters, like Joe Burrow, reps in preseason games is more beneficial for their preparation. This approach allows the team to continue evaluating position battles, particularly on the offensive line.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans that would allow foreign nationals who receive fixed-term prison sentences to be deported immediately after sentencing. Under the proposal, these individuals would be barred from re-entering the UK, with their destination country deciding whether they serve any remaining prison time. The government argues this will save taxpayer money and protect the public, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population. Critics, however, have raised concerns that some countries may refuse to accept the deported criminals.</p>

          <p>This article explores the changing depiction of Kashmir in India's Hindi-language film industry, known as Bollywood. Initially portrayed as a romantic, scenic paradise in post-independence cinema, the region's image shifted dramatically with the rise of militancy in the late 1980s. Films then began to frame Kashmir as a conflict zone, often reflecting nationalist perspectives. In recent years, and especially since India revoked the region's semi-autonomy in 2019, films like "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370" have increasingly aligned with the government's political stance.</p>

For months, the two nations had engaged in tit-for-tat psychological warfare, with the South broadcasting K-pop and anti-Pyongyang messages and the North responding with irritating sounds.

          <p>In her forthcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon denies there was a conspiracy to destroy her predecessor and mentor, Alex Salmond. She accuses Salmond of failing to show contrition for his inappropriate behavior towards women and of being willing to damage the Scottish National Party and democratic institutions for his own ends. Sturgeon recounts the painful breakdown of their political partnership, stating she had to refuse his request to intervene in a government investigation into complaints against him. She describes the period as "mortal political combat."</p>

          <p>Three Thai soldiers have been wounded by a landmine along the border with Cambodia, one of them severely, according to the Thai army. The incident occurred in a disputed territory just days after both nations agreed to extend a ceasefire that ended recent deadly clashes. The Thai army claims the explosion is evidence that new mines are being laid in violation of the Ottawa Convention, which both countries have signed. Cambodia has denied laying new mines, stating the devices are likely remnants from past conflicts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced he will hold a press conference on Monday that he claims will "essentially, stop violent crime in Washington, D.C." This follows his recent threats to federalize the city's police force and deploy the National Guard to address crime levels. The announcement comes after a White House staffer was injured in an attempted hijacking and the administration's decision to deploy federal law enforcement officers on the city's streets. Critics argue the move infringes on the district's right to self-governance.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to halt weapons exports to Israel intended for use in Gaza has been met with significant opposition from within his own conservative CDU/CSU coalition. Critics argue the move breaks with Germany's long-standing policy of special responsibility towards Israel's security, known as "Staatsräson." However, the decision has also garnered support from other party members and the junior coalition partner, the SPD, who see it as a necessary reaction to the Israeli government's recent decisions regarding the conflict.</p>

Investigators are reportedly exploring the possibility that the motive was linked to a belief that he had been sickened by a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through a homeowner's roof in McDonough, Georgia, has been dated to 4.56 billion years ago, making it about 20 million years older than our planet. A University of Georgia geologist examined fragments of the space rock, which created a fireball seen across the state in June. The analysis suggests the meteorite originated from the breakup of a larger asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter around 470 million years ago. Scientists plan to officially name it the McDonough Meteorite.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of people marched through the town of Nuneaton in an anti-immigration protest, one of several similar demonstrations held across England. The protest was organized after the local council leader, from the Reform UK party, stated that two men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers. Police confirmed one arrest for making threats but described the event as mostly peaceful. The incident has fueled a national debate, with Reform UK leader Nigel Farage calling on police to release the immigration status of all charged suspects.</p>
