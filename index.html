          <p>The Trump administration has announced new tariffs on seven countries, including Japan, South Korea, and South Africa, set to take effect on August 1. The duties range from 25% to 40% and are justified by the administration as a necessary measure to correct persistent trade deficits. The move, which extends a previous tariff policy after a 90-day pause, prompted a downturn in U.S. financial markets. The administration has warned the targeted nations against imposing retaliatory duties, stating that any such actions would result in further increases to the U.S. tariffs.

          <p>The death of Daniel Park, a man accused of conspiring in the bombing of a California fertility clinic, is being investigated as a suicide, according to his former attorney. Park's death at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles closes the only federal prosecution in the case, as his alleged co-conspirator died in the blast. The incident has intensified scrutiny of the detention facility, with lawyers and a recent Justice Department report highlighting significant shortcomings and "inhumane" conditions, including unmet medical needs and inadequate emergency responses for inmates.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale was forced to make an emergency landing in Fort Myers after a passenger's portable battery caught fire mid-flight. The flight crew successfully extinguished the flames, and the aircraft, carrying 185 passengers and six crew members, landed safely with no injuries reported. Out of an abundance of caution due to residual smoke, the situation was declared an emergency. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which highlights the growing concern over lithium-ion battery fires on airplanes.</p>

          <p>The White House and Senator Ted Cruz have pushed back against criticism of the National Weather Service's handling of the deadly Texas floods, labeling accusations of failure as partisan attacks. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt detailed a timeline of NWS alerts, asserting that the agency provided early and consistent warnings and had extra staff on duty. While some Democratic leaders have called for an investigation into potential staffing shortages, the administration maintains the tragedy was an "act of God" and that the NWS performed its duties correctly.</p>

          <p>Russia's Transport Minister, Roman Starovoy, has died from a suspected suicide just hours after being dismissed from his post by President Vladimir Putin, according to state media. The dismissal followed a weekend of significant air traffic disruptions in Russia caused by Ukrainian drone attacks. Shortly after Starovoy's death, another senior transport official, Andrei Korneichuk, also died suddenly from a reported cardiac arrest during a meeting. These deaths add to a series of sudden and often mysterious fatalities among high-profile Russian officials and business leaders.</p>

          <p>TikTok is reportedly preparing to launch a new version of its application in the United States ahead of a potential sale of its U.S. operations. The move comes as its parent company, China-based ByteDance, faces a September 17 deadline to divest or face a nationwide ban due to national security concerns raised by the government. The new app, expected in early September, is likely an attempt to address these security issues by potentially altering how user data is handled. The future of the platform's popular algorithm remains a key question in any potential sale.</p>

The move has drawn criticism from President Trump and comes as Tesla faces challenges, including declining car deliveries and rising competition.

However, tax experts clarify this is a deduction, not a direct elimination of the tax, and will not benefit the lowest or highest-income seniors.

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut anticipated in the coming months, prospective borrowers of Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are advised to take preparatory steps. Financial experts suggest homeowners should first check their credit report and score, taking action to improve them to secure the best possible rates. It is also recommended to shop around with various lenders now to establish a baseline of options, rather than waiting for a rate cut to begin the process. Finally, calculating potential repayment costs under different interest rate scenarios is crucial, as the home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following its most significant first-half decline since 1973, the U.S. dollar faces ongoing headwinds that could keep it under pressure. The 10.7% drop against global currencies is attributed to factors like U.S. policy volatility, swelling national debt, and the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This weakness has benefited U.S. companies with large international sales but has also fueled discussion about the dollar's long-term status as the world's primary reserve currency. Some global central banks are increasing gold purchases as an alternative to U.S. assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dozens of heavily armed federal immigration agents, including some on horseback and in armored vehicles, conducted a major enforcement operation in MacArthur Park, a central hub for Los Angeles' immigrant community. The show of force comes as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement nationwide, with over 1,600 arrests in the L.A. area in recent weeks. The agents were met by protesters, and Mayor Karen Bass arrived at the scene, demanding the agents leave immediately. It remains unclear if any arrests were made during the high-profile sweep.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to reshape the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which could strip eligibility from certain nonprofit organizations. A draft proposal aims to exclude employers involved in what the administration defines as "illegal activities," with a focus on groups providing legal services to immigrants or support for transgender youth. Advocates who reviewed the proposal fear it grants the education secretary subjective power to punish organizations for political reasons, potentially impacting entire hospital systems or local governments and blocking many borrowers from promised loan relief.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in central Texas were caused by an extreme weather event that saw some locations receive more than 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend. Preliminary data from the National Weather Service shows massive rainfall totals in the Guadalupe River basin, with towns like Bertram and Liberty Hill being among the hardest hit. The deluge caused the Guadalupe River to rise an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes.

The newly named species, Eotephradactylus mcintireae, was a flying reptile about the size of a small seagull. The discovery, detailed in a Smithsonian-led paper, helps fill a significant gap in the fossil record from the late Triassic period. The fossil's remarkable preservation in volcanic ash allowed for an unusually precise dating, providing new insights into the evolution of these early flying animals.</p>
