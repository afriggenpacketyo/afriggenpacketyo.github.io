        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ranchers in northern Mexico are grappling with a severe economic crisis after the U.S. suspended live cattle imports due to concerns over the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. This ban exacerbates the hardship for families already weakened by years of severe drought, cutting off their primary source of income. Many ranchers are now forced to sell their cattle at a significant loss within Mexico or diversify into other ventures like beekeeping to survive. The situation highlights the vulnerability of the cross-border livestock trade to biological threats.</p>

          <p>A sudden and extreme downpour, known as a cloudburst, has triggered catastrophic flash floods in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, leaving more than 100 people missing in Dharali village. The deluge caused a local river to swell, submerging roads and buildings and leading to at least four reported deaths. Rescue operations are severely hampered by the vast amount of debris, incessant heavy rains, and damaged infrastructure, which has isolated the affected area from disaster response teams and officials.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision follows a significant rate cut in the previous meeting and comes as India navigates rising trade tensions and tariff threats from the United States. The central bank has shifted its stance to "neutral," indicating it will carefully assess incoming economic data before making future policy changes, despite low inflation and strong GDP growth.

          <p>A high-ranking UN official has issued a stark warning that a full-scale expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza would risk "catastrophic consequences" for millions of Palestinians and the remaining hostages. The warning came in response to reports that the Israeli government is considering a plan for the total reoccupation of the Gaza Strip. The UN reiterated that Gaza must remain part of a future Palestinian state and condemned the severe restrictions on humanitarian aid, which have led to mass starvation.</p>

          <p>Italy's cabinet has passed a draft law that would tighten regulations on gender-affirming medical treatments, such as puberty blockers and hormones, for minors. The proposed legislation, backed by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government, would require new health ministry protocols and establish a national registry to monitor treatments, citing the need to protect minors' health. The bill, which now heads to parliament for approval, has sparked protests from transgender rights advocates who oppose the increased restrictions.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported quarterly revenue of $7.69 billion, exceeding analysts' expectations, driven by strong performance in its data center and gaming segments. However, the company's adjusted earnings per share missed Wall Street forecasts, causing its stock price to decline in extended trading. The mixed results reflect a complex market, with robust CPU demand offset by the impact of U.S. export restrictions on the company's AI chip sales to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion from a FEMA disaster mitigation program. The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funds without congressional authority. The judge ruled the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to communities relying on the funds for critical flood-prevention and resilience projects.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is partnering with Indiana's prison system to house 1,000 immigration detainees at the Miami correctional center, a maximum-security facility. This move is part of a significant expansion of federal immigration detention capacity under the Trump administration, which has heavily increased ICE's budget. The decision has drawn criticism from civil liberties advocates, who have previously raised alarms about inhumane conditions and overcrowding at the Indiana prison.</p>

          <p>According to a source close to his legal team, Sean "Diddy" Combs has been in contact with Donald Trump to seek a presidential pardon. Combs was recently convicted of prostitution-related offenses and is currently denied bail while awaiting sentencing in October. In a recent interview, President Trump confirmed he had been approached about the matter but expressed reluctance to grant a pardon, citing Combs' past political hostility towards him, making a favorable decision seem unlikely.</p>

          <p>A massive, China-backed copper mining project in Afghanistan's Logar province is finally making significant progress after being stalled for 17 years. The state-owned China Metallurgical Group, which was awarded the contract for the Mes Aynak mine in 2008, says it is ready to begin extraction this year. The project had been delayed by security challenges and the presence of ancient Buddhist archaeological remains, which will now reportedly be protected by a switch to a more costly underground mining process.</p>

          <p>The FBI's annual crime report reveals that crime rates in the United States fell across every major category in 2024, continuing a downward trend from a spike during the pandemic. The data, collected from thousands of law enforcement agencies, shows significant decreases in both violent and property crimes, including a 14.9% drop in murder and a notable 18.6% drop in motor vehicle thefts. While the numbers are promising, experts caution that some crime types, like aggravated assault, remain higher than pre-2020 levels.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation into the 2023 Titan submersible implosion has concluded that the deaths of the five people aboard were preventable. The comprehensive report issued scathing findings, primarily faulting OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, who was piloting the vessel, for negligence. Investigators cited an inadequate vessel design using cheaper carbon fiber, a disregard for safety warnings, and a failure to adhere to industry regulations as key factors that led directly to the catastrophic failure near the Titanic wreckage.</p>
