          <p>Elon Musk stated that he regrets some of his social media posts about President Donald Trump, acknowledging they "went too far." This comes after a public dispute with his former ally, which had caused market concerns over Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict was triggered by Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill, which Musk claimed would undermine the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and increase the U.S. budget deficit, a point the Trump administration disputes. Over the weekend, Trump warned of consequences if Musk supported Democratic candidates challenging the bill, though he later indicated he would be open to speaking with Musk. The article highlights the dissolving of a tight partnership and its immediate impact on Tesla's stock, which has since recovered. </p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how President Trump's tariffs have led to increased revenue for the Treasury, with May seeing a record high of over $22 billion in tariff payments. These income figures are among the first concrete indicators of the costs imposed by Mr. Trumpâ€™s trade policies. While the president argues tariffs can generate income and encourage domestic manufacturing, the revenue remains a small share of the federal government's income, which primarily comes from individual and corporate income taxes. Republicans have suggested tariff revenue could offset losses from their tax and spending bill, but analysis indicates this would not occur until after 2029, and proposed tax cuts would initially lead to revenue losses.

          <p>The EPA announced plans to revoke a Biden administration rule that limited carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, arguing the rules would "suffocate our economy." EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the Trump administration aims to protect the environment while growing the economy. The agency also plans to repeal updated limits to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, despite data showing significant reductions in mercury emissions under the existing standards. Critics, including former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, argue the rollbacks are illogical and dangerous, with environmental groups prepared to sue the EPA. </p>

          <p>The Phoenix Suns are reportedly discussing trade options for Kevin Durant with his business partner, Rich Kleiman, CEO of Boardroom. Several teams, including the Houston Rockets, Miami Heat, Minnesota Timberwolves, New York Knicks, and San Antonio Spurs, have expressed interest in the 36-year-old forward. Durant is due to earn $54.7 million in 2025-26 and could sign a two-year extension worth up to $112 million if traded. The Suns finished the season with a 36-46 record, leading to changes in coaching and management. </p>

          <p>The WTA Tour will now offer ranking protection to female tennis players who undergo egg or embryo freezing, allowing them to start a family at a later date without jeopardizing their careers. This offer is available to players ranked in the world's top 750 who spend more than 10 weeks out of competition. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, praised the rule, saying it will reduce the pressure on players to return to the court too quickly. Stephens has twice used the off-season to freeze her eggs and emphasized the importance of having the protected ranking to avoid risking their health. </p>
