          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed economist and Trump adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors just before a pivotal meeting on interest rates. His confirmation raises concerns about the central bank's independence, as Miran plans to take an unpaid leave from his White House role rather than fully resigning. This move has been criticized by Democrats as an attempt by the administration to exert political influence over monetary policy, a charge Miran has denied, pledging to preserve the Fed's autonomy.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index reached a new record high, breaking the 45,000 mark for the first time, leading gains across Asian markets. The surge was largely driven by investor optimism following President Trump's positive comments on the progress of U.S.-China trade negotiations. This sentiment was further bolstered by a framework deal for the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok, contributing to positive momentum in other regional and U.S. markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has denied the Trump administration's request to oust Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, ensuring she can participate in this week's key interest rate meeting. The court upheld a lower court's ruling that the president likely lacked the legal grounds, or "cause," to remove her based on allegations of mortgage fraud that predated her tenure. This decision is seen as a significant defense of the Federal Reserve's independence from political pressure.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order deploying the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee, as part of a new federal task force aimed at combating what he termed rampant crime. This action mirrors similar deployments in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles and is presented as a model for future interventions in other cities like Chicago. The move has drawn criticism from local Democratic leaders, who describe it as an authoritarian push and an overreach of presidential power.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that smoke or fume events occur on commercial airliners more than three times a day, raising serious health concerns for passengers and crew. Experts warn that these fumes, often caused by oil leaks in the engine's air supply system, can be toxic and lead to neurological problems. The issue is reportedly most prevalent on the Airbus A320 family of jets, prompting flight attendant unions to call for mandatory installation of air filtration systems to ensure cabin safety.</p>

Many medical experts now believe the original 2002 study that linked the therapy to increased risks of cancer and stroke was flawed because it focused on older women. More recent research indicates that the treatment is significantly safer when initiated closer to the onset of menopause, prompting a potential shift in medical guidance that could benefit many women.</p>

          <h2>California and Louisiana Share Highest Poverty Rate in the U.S., Report Finds</h2>

          <p>According to a new analysis, California is now tied with Louisiana for the highest poverty rate in the United States, with 17.7% of its population, or 7 million people, unable to meet basic needs. The report from the California Budget and Policy Center adjusts for the state's high cost of living, identifying steep housing costs as the primary driver of the crisis. The state's poverty rate has climbed sharply since a historic low in 2021, when expanded pandemic-era safety net programs temporarily alleviated financial hardship.</p>

          <p>At a United Nations forum, China's ambassador, Fu Cong, delivered a sharp critique of unilateralism, implicitly targeting the Trump administration's foreign policy. Without naming the U.S., he stated that certain countries are dealing "severe blows" to multilateralism and warned against tearing down the existing global governance system. The remarks, made just before the UN General Assembly, underscore the ongoing diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Washington over international norms and institutions.</p>

          <h2>Forthcoming 'Hillsborough Law' to Include a Legal Duty of Candour for Public Officials</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 17:30:22 EDT</div>

          <p>The United Kingdom government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," a landmark bill that will impose a legal "duty of candour" on public officials. This legislation will require authorities to act with honesty and cooperate fully with inquiries into major disasters, with criminal sanctions for failure to do so. Championed for decades by the families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster, the law aims to end official cover-ups and ensure justice for victims of state-related tragedies.</p>

          <p>This article provides the historical context for the new "Hillsborough Law," detailing the 36-year struggle for justice by families of the 97 football fans who died in the 1989 disaster. It recounts how initial inquests and trials failed to hold police and other authorities accountable, leading to a prolonged campaign for legal reform. The resulting law, which mandates a "duty of candour" for public officials and ensures equal legal funding for victims, is presented as a hard-won legacy to prevent other families from enduring a similar fight for truth.</p>
