        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge strongly condemned President Trump's executive order aimed at the law firm WilmerHale, declaring it unconstitutional and a threat to the American justice system's independent judiciary and bar. Judge Leon, appointed by former President George W. Bush, expressed outrage in his 73-page opinion, criticizing the administration's arguments as "absurd." The order had targeted WilmerHale for hiring Robert Mueller, instructing the attorney general to suspend security clearances and federal agencies to terminate contracts. WilmerHale sued, calling the order an "unprecedented assault" on the judicial system, and the court's decision to block the order affirms constitutional rights. The White House has yet to respond to the ruling.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated his intention to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who are currently imprisoned for bank fraud and tax evasion, during a phone call with their children. The Chrisleys were sentenced in 2022 after being convicted of submitting false financial statements to obtain over $30 million in loans and concealing income from the IRS. Their daughter, Savannah, has been advocating for their pardon, claiming they were unfairly targeted due to their celebrity status. Trump said the couple received "pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing."</p>

          <p>The State Department has directed U.S. embassies to temporarily suspend scheduling new student visa appointments as the Trump administration prepares to broaden social media screenings for applicants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed diplomatic posts to halt new appointments to prepare for the expanded vetting, which could subject all student visa applicants to social media checks. The State Department says it takes the vetting process seriously, and the pause will last until further guidance is issued. This policy follows recent efforts to screen visa applicants for antisemitic activity and attempts to deport students based on pro-Palestinian activism.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Republican senators are advocating for increased sanctions on Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine, marking a contrast to President Trump's more lenient stance. Senator Lindsey Graham is leading a bipartisan effort to pass legislation imposing sweeping sanctions on Moscow, highlighting missed opportunities for diplomacy. While Trump has hinted at a potential change in posture, musing about a potential economic partnership with Russia after a peace deal, some Republicans believe stronger action is needed to pressure Putin. Other senators, such as Charles E. Grassley, have publicly urged Trump to impose stronger sanctions.</p>

          <p>A new aid center in the Gaza Strip, backed by Israel, experienced chaotic scenes on its first full day of operation, as desperate Palestinians surged toward the site seeking humanitarian assistance. The aid center was intended to circumvent Hamas. Footage showed large crowds, including women and children, running towards boxes of aid, with some people climbing over sand berms, and gunfire was heard in the distance causing panic. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation acknowledged the overwhelming volume of people, and the Israeli military said troops fired warning shots outside the compound. The aid is a mere trickle for the two million people in Gaza, and there are concerns that the new system will forcibly displace residents into a single area.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine, stating that Putin is "crazy" and "playing with fire," prompting a response from the Kremlin suggesting that Trump is suffering from "emotional overload." Trump's frustration stems from Putin's continuing campaign of civilian slaughter in Ukraine, despite Trump's claims of a personal connection with the Russian president. Trump has admitted that Putin wants all of Ukraine, blaming Zelenskyy and Biden for the war. The Kremlin views Trump's behavior as a liability and questions whether it will result in any meaningful change in American policy.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem advocated for Karol Nawrocki to become president of Poland at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Warsaw, criticizing his opponent. Noem's endorsement of a foreign political candidate is an unusual move for a sitting U.S. Cabinet member. She also criticized European leaders for allowing in migrants and "destroyed their civilizations." She praised Trump as making the United States "safer" for the public, and stated that if the Polish elect the right person, the country will continue to have the backing of the U.S.</p>

          <p>Republican U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville has officially announced his candidacy for governor of Alabama, launching a campaign website to reveal his intentions. Tuberville aims to succeed Republican Governor Kay Ivey, who is term-limited, and if successful, could become Alabama’s governor-elect by the end of 2026. His transition from college football coach to politician was marked by his alignment with Donald Trump, who previously endorsed him over Jeff Sessions. Tuberville has strong ties with conservative organizations and has drawn national attention for his blockade of military promotions in protest of the Pentagon’s abortion-related policies.</p>

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics reveals that recent college graduates are experiencing increased difficulty in finding employment, contributing to a rise in the national unemployment rate. Unemployed recent graduates account for 12% of the overall increase in unemployment since mid-2023, despite making up only 5% of the labor force. The unemployment rate among recent college graduates is nearing 6%, surpassing the national average, which is attributed to a mismatch between the oversupply of graduates in fields where business demand has waned, particularly in the tech industry. Economic uncertainty, driven by President Trump's tariff agenda, is also slowing hiring, potentially leading to continued increases in unemployment among recent graduates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to permit the swift deportation of migrants to countries other than their own, challenging a federal judge's ruling that requires a "meaningful opportunity" for migrants to object.

The administration contends that the home countries of migrants convicted of violent crimes often refuse to allow their return, making deportations challenging.

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States from 2016 to 2023. The percentage of mothers rating their mental health as "excellent" decreased, while those reporting poor mental health increased, particularly among single parents and those with children on Medicaid or uninsured. Researchers suggest factors such as high housing and child care costs, rising food prices, and the lack of national paid parental leave contribute to this decline. Experts emphasize that the findings may reflect increased openness about mental health struggles, rather than solely indicating a worsening condition.</p>
