          <p>A tragic stampede at a political campaign rally in southern India has resulted in at least 31 deaths and 50 injuries. The event was for the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam party, led by popular actor-turned-politician Vijay. The incident highlights the dangers of large, uncontrolled crowds at public gatherings in the country, where similar tragedies have occurred in the past during religious festivals and political events. Authorities are investigating the circumstances that led to the deadly crush as the community mourns the significant loss of life.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a major storm currently in the Atlantic, may interact with a nearby developing weather system, creating a rare phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. This occurs when two tropical storms orbit a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths and intensity. While meteorologists consider this outcome unlikely, the possibility exists for the two systems to engage in a complex "dance." The developing storm is expected to become Tropical Storm Imelda, raising concerns for coastal areas in the southeastern United States.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas resulted in the death of one detainee and critically injured two others. The gunman, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after opening fire from a nearby rooftop. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted attack, citing anti-ICE messages found on the shooter's shell casings. This event follows other recent security threats at ICE facilities, prompting DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to condemn the violence and increase security nationwide.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of U.S. troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing the use of "full force" to protect federal facilities from what he termed "domestic terrorists." The move targets ongoing protests at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, which have at times led to clashes. This action marks an expansion of the administration's strategy of using federal forces in U.S. cities, a policy that has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers who accuse the president of attempting to incite violence and overstepping federal authority.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro following his comments at a protest in New York. During the demonstration, Petro urged U.S. soldiers to disobey President Trump's orders, which the State Department labeled as "reckless and incendiary." This action signifies a significant escalation in tensions between the U.S. and Colombia, a traditionally close ally in Latin America. The relationship has become strained under Petro's leftist government, with recent disagreements over anti-narcotics efforts and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have killed at least 57 people across Gaza, according to health officials, amid escalating international pressure for a ceasefire. Despite this, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant address at the United Nations, stating that his country "must finish the job" against Hamas. The attacks have hit refugee camps and residential areas, exacerbating a dire humanitarian crisis with hospitals on the brink of collapse. U.S. President Trump has indicated that negotiations for a deal to release hostages and end the war are ongoing.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold the remainder of its significant stake in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD, ending a highly profitable 17-year investment. BYD confirmed the news, stating that buying and selling is a normal part of investing and expressed gratitude for Buffett and Charlie Munger's long-term support. The divestment comes as BYD faces cooling growth, having recently cut its sales targets and reported its first quarterly profit decline in over three years. Berkshire's exit caused BYD's shares to fall over 6% this week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lt. Col. George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has died at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II and also served in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. Armed Forces, celebrated for their skill and for breaking racial barriers.

          <p>Despite widespread pessimism, the U.S. economy is showing surprising resilience, largely attributed to the "wealth effect" from a booming stock market. Strong consumer spending, particularly among wealthier households with stock holdings, is helping to offset a stagnant jobs picture and prevent a recession. However, economists warn that this foundation is precarious; a significant downturn in the stock market could quickly erode consumer confidence and push the vulnerable economy into a downturn. Recent data shows robust GDP growth and consumer activity, even as overall sentiment remains low. (not investment advice)</p>

His income comes from VA disability, the GI Bill, and teaching English.

          <p>Anson Funds, an activist investment firm, is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO), a major out-of-home advertising company. This move comes after CCO divested its international assets to become a U.S.-focused company but failed to see its stock price recover as expected. Anson argues that a sale is the best path forward for shareholders, as the company still carries significant debt and its transition to more profitable digital billboards has been slow. Potential acquirers could include industry rivals or private equity firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the American dream of homeownership out of reach for many, modular homebuilders like Colorado-based Fading West are being presented as a key part of the solution. By constructing homes in a factory setting, the company claims it can reduce costs by up to 20% and cut delivery times in half compared to traditional on-site building. This method reduces waste, avoids weather delays, and ensures a stable workforce. The approach recently proved effective in providing temporary housing for victims of the Maui wildfires, highlighting its potential for both disaster relief and addressing the nationwide housing shortage.</p>

          <p>A review of President Trump's recent economic assertions reveals a mix of accurate, misleading, and false statements. While his claim about falling mortgage rates is true, his statements that grocery and energy prices are down are incorrect, as federal data shows increases in both sectors over the past year. His declaration that inflation has been "defeated" is also false, with the annual rate holding at 2.9%, above the Federal Reserve's target. The article provides a detailed breakdown of data on gas prices, manufacturing, and wage growth to offer context for the president's economic messaging.</p>

May, who resigned from office and is representing himself, faces five to 20 years in prison for each of the five counts.
