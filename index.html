            <h2>Markets Surge After Trump Eases Tariff Stance, Excluding China</h2>

            <p>Global stock markets experienced a significant rally following President Trump's decision to temporarily suspend tariff hikes for most countries, excluding China. The announcement triggered a wave of optimism among investors, leading to substantial gains in various sectors including autos, pharma, luxury goods, and banking. However, U.S. futures indicated a potential pullback, and oil prices declined, reflecting ongoing concerns about the economic impact of the trade war, particularly the elevated tariffs imposed on China. This move signals a shift in trade policy, though tensions with China remain, potentially creating further market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A recent WHO report reveals a disturbing trend: a woman dies every two minutes due to inadequate maternal healthcare, with 260,000 deaths recorded in 2023. Sub-Saharan Africa and India bear the brunt of these deaths, highlighting stark inequalities in access to care. The report warns that the UN's goal to reduce maternal mortality will be missed by a significant margin, and that recent cuts to international aid from the US and UK threaten to reverse progress. Experts emphasize that preventing maternal deaths requires political commitment, financial investment, and improved healthcare systems, especially in crisis-stricken regions.</p>

            <p>A UK parliamentary committee is advocating for a 5% levy on streaming services' UK revenue to bolster the domestic TV production industry. This proposal aims to address concerns that the rise of streaming platforms is crowding out independent British producers and threatening the creation of uniquely British content. Industry figures are divided, with some warning that a levy could stifle investment and raise costs for consumers, while others argue it's necessary to level the playing field and ensure public service broadcasters can continue producing high-quality dramas. The government acknowledges the industry's challenges and is considering further measures to support growth.</p>

            <p>Following President Trump's decision to increase tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%, China has accused the U.S. of pursuing selfish gains and wielding tariffs as a weapon. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that this action goes against the interests of the international community and vowed to safeguard the Chinese economy. China maintains that it does not want a trade war but will not hesitate to defend its interests, emphasizing that tariffs and trade wars ultimately have no winners. The spokesperson criticized the U.S. for prioritizing its own interests over global welfare.</p>

Chinese economists emphasize the importance of government stimulus to boost domestic demand and secure a dominant position in the face of U.S. competition.

            <p>Car thefts are on the rise in the United States, fueled by teenage carjackers and international crime rings that ship stolen luxury vehicles to overseas markets for higher profits. Washington, D.C., has seen the highest vehicle theft rate, prompting undercover operations to dismantle these criminal networks. Soft-on-crime policies in major cities are contributing to the problem, with thieves facing minimal penalties. Stolen vehicles are often moved through ports in New York and New Jersey, then shipped to West Africa with falsified documents, making them difficult to trace.</p>

            <p>The narrative that NBA coach Tom Thibodeau overworks his players and increases their risk of injury has been challenged by empirical data. Despite Thibodeau's reputation for relying heavily on his starters, research indicates that his players are not demonstrably more prone to injury than others in the league. However, a broader trend reveals a rise in injuries across the NBA, regardless of coaching style, highlighting the need for teams to prioritize depth and proactively manage player health. This suggests that while Thibodeau's methods may not be uniquely detrimental, the league-wide increase in injuries necessitates a more comprehensive approach to player welfare.</p>

            <p>The director general of Taiwan's National Immigration Agency (NIA) is stepping down early due to controversy surrounding stricter regulations on spouses from mainland China. The NIA had been enforcing a policy requiring mainland-born spouses to provide documentation proving they have renounced their mainland nationality, or risk losing their residency permits. This policy sparked criticism for potentially disrupting thousands of families, leading to the director general's early retirement. The 2004 revision to the island's immigration law is at the center of the dispute.</p>

She emphasized that opinions and free speech are important but cannot be weaponized and used as a route to hate speech.

Tammy Conner, who said she was beaten by Booth for four years from the age of 16, has decided to speak out in the hope that other women will come forward.

He also suggested the UK should renew ties with the EU, including collaboration that is even more extensive than removing post-Brexit trade barriers. Brown warned of a breakdown in economic and geopolitical orders and urged world leaders to step up their collective action. He said leaders should consider offering extended credit to exporting and importing firms, lowering interest rates, and mobilizing the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to protect poorer nations.</p>
