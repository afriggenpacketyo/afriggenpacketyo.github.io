          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, was unexpectedly released from prison along with 13 other political prisoners after five years of incarceration. Tikhanovsky, an opposition activist himself, has been reunited with his wife in Lithuania, where she lives in exile. His release coincided with a visit to Minsk by US special envoy Keith Kellogg, who met with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, suggesting a possible diplomatic breakthrough. Tikhanovsky's release is seen as a potential win for Lukashenko, helping him to alleviate international isolation, but hundreds of other political prisoners remain in Belarusian jails.</p>

          <p>Weaver Nut Company, Inc. has issued a recall for multiple batches of chocolate nonpareils sold across the United States due to the potential presence of undeclared milk allergens.

The company is working with the FDA to ensure the safety of its products, and the issue was discovered following a customer complaint and subsequent lab testing that confirmed the presence of milk.

          <p>UBS maintained a 'Hold' rating on Conagra Brands, Inc., citing growth pressures and a projected decrease in earnings per share by fiscal 2026.

Conagra has streamlined its portfolio by selling Chef Boyardee and Van de Kamâ€™s brands and recently launched 50 new frozen food items to align with consumer preferences.

          <p>Las Vegas casinos are quietly laying off dealers due to declining tourism and increased automation, with major resorts like Fontainebleau and Resorts World reducing staff. Visitor volume in Las Vegas dipped 7.8% year-over-year in March 2025, leading to decreased gaming revenue and hotel occupancy. Travel industry analysts attribute the decline to broader economic uncertainty and evolving U.S. travel policies, while automation, including electronic table games, is further reshaping the role of casino dealers. Las Vegas's unemployment rate has climbed to 5.2%, driven by cuts in the leisure and hospitality sector.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in London and Berlin, calling for an end to Israel's war in Gaza. Demonstrators in Berlin criticized German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's comment that Israel was doing the West's "dirty work" by bombing Iran, expressing concerns about a wider regional conflict. Protesters in London carried signs against arming Israel and waging war on Iran, marking ongoing monthly demonstrations since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict. The marches occurred as fears spread that the Israel-Iran war could escalate, with concerns about regional devastation.</p>

Reed suggests Trump's rejection of the intelligence community's conclusions may be related to his contemplation of an attack against Iran. Reed noted that if Gabbard made a false statement, there would be an obligation to correct the record.</p>

          <p>Torsten SlÃ¸k, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, suggests a scenario where President Trumpâ€™s tariffs are extended long enough to ease economic uncertainty and provide a significant bump to federal revenue. SlÃ¸k speculates that maintaining 30% tariffs on China and 10% tariffs on all other countries for 12 months, while countries lower non-tariff barriers, could be a "victory for the world." This strategy could produce $400 billion in annual revenue for U.S. taxpayers and reduce uncertainty for businesses. (not investment advice)</p>
