            <p>A Los Angeles court has ruled in favor of Sony Pictures Television, granting them the right to take over distribution of the popular game shows "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" from CBS. Sony had filed a lawsuit alleging that CBS breached their contract by entering into unauthorized licensing agreements and undervaluing the shows. The judge's decision allows Sony to begin distributing the shows, though CBS plans to appeal the ruling, claiming it is only a preliminary decision based on partial evidence. The outcome of this legal battle will significantly impact the distribution and revenue streams of these iconic game shows.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing them to enforce a long-standing requirement for non-citizens in the US to register with the federal government. The administration argues they are simply enforcing an existing law, while opponents fear it will facilitate mass deportations. The ruling mandates that non-citizens over 14 without legal status must register, provide fingerprints and address, and carry registration documents. The requirement has been enforced only rarely since its introduction in the 1940s, most notably after 9/11 under the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles judge has sided with Sony Pictures Television, granting them the right to take over distribution of its game shows “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune” from CBS. Sony filed a lawsuit alleging that CBS breached their contract by entering into unauthorized licensing deals for the shows and then paying itself a commission. CBS plans to appeal the ruling, stating that the contract with Sony is not dead yet and that they are confident they will prevail on the merits once all evidence is heard at trial.</p>

            <p>India's attempt to build a stronger relationship with the US under President Trump has not produced the desired outcomes, as evidenced by the imposition of tariffs. Despite India's efforts to engage with the Trump administration and make concessions on tariffs, the US has proceeded with protectionist measures. This development has led to disappointment in India, with concerns about the potential impact on the country's economy. The situation suggests a shift in the dynamics of the US-India relationship compared to the Biden administration.</p>

            <p>President Trump has acknowledged there will "always be transition problems" and "difficulty" as US markets fell amid continued uncertainty over his global tariff war. Trump paused his threat to impose tariffs as high as 50% on "worst offender" countries, but pressed on with his trade war with China. Beijing has shown no sign of backing down, this week increasing its retaliatory tariffs to 84% on American products. Despite this, Trump said he was still hoping to secure a deal with China.

Trump's erratic trade policies and vacillations on tariffs are creating uncertainty and eroding trust in the American financial system. The pullback from Europe and questioning of American support for Ukraine are prompting European countries to develop their own security arrangements.

Experts suggest that Xi believes the uncertainty created by tariffs will drive countries towards China, and that China has been preparing for this possibility by expanding trade relations with the rest of the world. While Trump expresses hope for a deal, Xi's calculations involve significant risks and opportunities for China.</p>
