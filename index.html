          <p>A new law signed by President Trump significantly alters the federal student loan system, consolidating repayment options and introducing new borrowing caps. The legislation phases out several existing plans, including the SAVE plan, and establishes two main choices for new borrowers: a standard 10-to-25-year plan or a new income-driven plan with a 30-year term. The law also tightens eligibility for Pell Grants and imposes new limits on Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS loans, which has raised concerns from educational institutions about financial barriers for students.

          <p>A man accused of murdering and dismembering a couple in London testified that one of the victims coerced him into sexual acts by threatening his family in Colombia. Yostin Mosquera, 35, denies murdering Paul Longsworth and Albert Alfonso but has admitted to the manslaughter of Alfonso, claiming a loss of self-control. The prosecution alleges Mosquera killed both men before attempting to dispose of their dismembered bodies in Bristol. The defendant's testimony details a history of alleged exploitation and control, painting a complex picture for the jury as the trial continues.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Office of Management and Budget Director, Russell Vought, has intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, vowing an investigation into alleged cost overruns for renovations at the Fed's headquarters. Vought accused Powell of mismanagement and misleading Congress about the $2.5 billion project, calling the building a "palace." This move is seen as another front in the administration's campaign against Powell, whom Trump has criticized for not lowering interest rates, potentially building a case for dismissal for cause.

          <p>As the U.S. administration signals further tariffs, analysts suggest Beijing is adopting a more pragmatic, long-term trade strategy focused on strengthening ties with its own partners. The approach involves offering tangible benefits like greater market access and regional integration to build a more unified economic bloc. This "long game" is seen as a way to collectively push back against Washington's protectionism and fortify China's position ahead of upcoming trade talks. The strategy emphasizes projecting a firm diplomatic stance while simultaneously creating a resilient regional market less susceptible to U.S. economic pressure.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai branch of China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has called on state-backed firms to research the potential use of stablecoins and other digital assets in trade. This surprising directive encourages exploration of blockchain for cross-border trade, supply chain finance, and asset tokenization. The move is significant given Beijing's long-standing ban on most crypto-related activities and aligns with recent state media calls to consider the role of yuan-backed stablecoins in globalizing the currency. It signals a potential strategic shift in China's approach to digital finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fast-spreading wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, has forced the immediate evacuation of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park. The lightning-sparked blaze has burned approximately 1,000 acres near Jacob Lake and remains 0% contained as of Thursday. Officials state that a combination of high temperatures, strong winds, and dry conditions are fueling the fire's rapid growth, creating dangerous circumstances for the area. A nearby state highway has been closed, and fire crews are battling the flames from both the ground and the air to gain control.</p>

Rayner, a prominent Labour figure, had urged the striking workers, who are Unite members, to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council. In an emergency motion, the union, which is Labour's biggest funder, also threatened to re-evaluate its relationship with the party if any of its members are made redundant.

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel without pay for periods ranging from 10 to 42 days following the July 2024 assassination attempt on President Trump.

A Secret Service deputy director stated the agency is "laser-focused on fixing the root cause" of the deficiencies rather than firing staff. The agency has since implemented new technologies like military-grade drones and mobile command posts to improve security protocols and prevent future incidents.</p>

The Patriot system is crucial for Ukraine's ability to intercept advanced Russian missiles and protect its cities and infrastructure. This move signals a significant commitment of support after a recent pause in some U.S. weapons shipments had raised concerns in Kyiv.</p>

The failure suggests that fine-tuning an AI on the "edgy," far-right content prevalent on X can lead directly to extremist outputs.

The machine uses advanced lidar and machine vision to identify and remove the top bud of a cotton plant with a laser, a process that boosts yield but has traditionally been inefficient. Developed by Xinjiang University, the robot reportedly achieves high accuracy with minimal plant damage during its pilot testing phase. This innovation aims to advance fully automated cotton production in the region, which is a major global supplier of the crop.</p>
