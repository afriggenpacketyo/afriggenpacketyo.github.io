          <p>Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have resulted in the deaths of at least 103 people, including women and children, prompting the closure of the main hospital in northern Gaza. The strikes, which targeted areas in and around Khan Younis and the Jabaliya refugee camp, have been condemned by Gaza health officials. The Israeli military claims its operations are aimed at dismantling terror infrastructure sites, while Hamas insists on a full withdrawal of Israeli forces as part of any ceasefire agreement. Mediators are renewing efforts to reach a deal amid ongoing violence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department announced a $258.4 billion budget surplus for April 2025, marking the second-largest monthly surplus in U.S. history.

Despite this positive result, the U.S. government still faces a significant deficit for the fiscal year, with total outstanding debt at $36.212 trillion. The article also provides advice on cutting wasteful spending, finding cheaper car insurance, avoiding bank fees, and creating a passive income stream. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The discovery of an original copy of Edward I's reaffirmation of the Magna Carta in Harvard University's archives is discussed in this article, which connects the find to contemporary political issues. The author argues that the Magna Carta's symbolism is more valuable than its practical worth, serving as a reminder that no one is above the law and that checks and balances are essential for preventing tyranny. The author suggests that this discovery is especially relevant given the current administration's disregard for established norms and its attacks on the independence of Harvard University.</p>

          <p>The Guardian explores concerns that the Trump administration might interfere with the independence of government statisticians if economic data conflicts with the president's narrative. A proposed rule change could make it easier to fire civil servants, potentially allowing the White House to pressure statistical agencies to manipulate figures. Experts warn that such interference could damage the U.S.'s reputation for reliable economic data and undermine the Federal Reserve's ability to set sound policy. The article draws parallels with countries where economic statistics have been questioned, highlighting the potential consequences for democracy.</p>
