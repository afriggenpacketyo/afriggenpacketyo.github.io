          <p>A detention officer in Cherokee County, North Carolina, was shot and killed after an inmate he was escorting managed to seize his weapon during a medical visit. The inmate, Kelvin Simmons, was being treated for foot pain when a scuffle broke out, leading to the death of 56-year-old Officer Francisco Flattes. A second officer was injured but is expected to recover. Simmons, a federal inmate facing bank robbery charges, fled the scene in a stolen vehicle but was later apprehended and now faces a first-degree murder charge for the officer's death.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's sudden cancellation of two pandemic-era grant programs has left food aid organizations and small farmers struggling. These programs provided about $1 billion for food banks and schools to purchase fresh produce directly from local producers, supporting over 8,000 small farms nationwide. The cuts, described by the USDA as a return to fiscal responsibility, are now threatening the supply of fresh food to underserved communities and jeopardizing the financial stability of farmers who had scaled up operations to meet the demand. Aid groups warn this will worsen food insecurity for vulnerable populations.</p>

The request comes as California's wildfire season intensifies, with the state's dedicated National Guard firefighting unit reportedly at just 40% of its normal staffing levels.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests that practical and logistical obstacles, rather than vaccine hesitancy, are the primary reasons for declining childhood vaccination rates in the UK. Difficulties booking appointments, lack of reminders, and transportation issues are preventing many parents from getting their children vaccinated. This decline has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough. Health experts are calling for better support systems, such as improved NHS app functionality and expanded vaccination services, to make it easier for families to access these crucial immunizations.</p>

          <p>This article examines the contentious tenure of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the U.S. Secretary of Health, focusing on his mission to combat chronic disease in America. While his focus on issues like processed foods and chemical additives has drawn support from some, his history of promoting health conspiracies and his moves to dismantle parts of the public health apparatus have been met with fierce criticism from the scientific community. The analysis delves into the paradox of his leadership: whether his ambitious, anti-establishment approach could revolutionize neglected areas of healthcare or cause significant harm by undermining scientific evidence and institutions.</p>

Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of Amazon's marketplace helps keep prices stable, as some sellers will absorb costs to gain market share. He also discussed the transformative impact of AI, predicting that most consumers will have robots in their homes within the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

Government lawyers contended that the president has the authority to make that determination and that the court cannot second-guess it.
