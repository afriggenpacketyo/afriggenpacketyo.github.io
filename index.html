          <p>During a San Francisco concert on her "The Lifetimes Tour," pop singer Katy Perry experienced a technical issue with an aerial prop. While performing her song "Roar" on a large mechanical butterfly, the prop unexpectedly dropped several feet, startling the artist but causing no injury. Perry quickly recovered and professionally finished the performance, later remarking, "Not today, Satan," as the song concluded. This incident is one of several recent examples of artists encountering malfunctions with complex stage equipment during live shows across the music industry.</p>

          <p>At least 30 people were injured, one critically, after a driver intentionally plowed a car into a crowd outside The Vermont music venue in Los Angeles early Saturday. Police report that the incident occurred after an individual was removed from a nearby business and subsequently drove into the gathered people. After the vehicle was disabled, bystanders pulled the driver from the car, and during a physical altercation, an unknown individual shot the driver. The driver is hospitalized and will be arrested, while the shooter remains at large.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested a 52-year-old Mexican national accused of decapitating an Illinois woman and hiding her body in a bleach-filled container. The suspect, Jose Luis Mendoza-Gonzalez, had been arrested on lesser charges in April but was released from custody by a local judge, a decision that has drawn sharp criticism. Opponents of Illinois' SAFE-T Act argue the law facilitated his release, highlighting concerns about public safety and the handling of violent crimes involving non-citizens. The Department of Homeland Security vowed that the victim, Megan Bos, would receive justice.</p>

          <p>Mike Huckabee, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, visited a Christian village in the West Bank to condemn an arson attack on the historic Byzantine-era Church of Saint George. Local Palestinian residents have blamed Israeli settlers for the fire, which occurred amid escalating violence in the region. Huckabee, a staunch supporter of Israel, expressed solidarity with the community and demanded a full investigation and prosecution for those responsible for the sacrilegious act. His visit underscores growing international concern over the surge in violence and attacks on religious sites in the occupied territory.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against The Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit alleges the paper knowingly published false and defamatory claims about a purported birthday letter from Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, which the paper described as "bawdy." Trump has vehemently denied the report, labeling the letter a fake. The lawsuit faces a high legal standard, requiring proof of "actual malice" for a public figure to win a defamation case.</p>

          <p>Health experts and officials are raising alarms over the increasing popularity of high-strength nicotine pouches, also known as snus, among teenagers in the UK. These discreet pouches, which are currently unregulated by age restrictions, deliver a powerful nicotine hit and are reportedly causing severe gum damage and addiction in young users. With use among 16 to 24-year-olds nearly quadrupling since 2022, there are urgent calls for the government to pass the Tobacco and Vapes Bill. This legislation would make it illegal to sell the products to minors and address their aggressive marketing.</p>

          <p>Motorists across the UK are increasingly resorting to waiting in unofficial lay-bys and side roads to avoid steep airport drop-off fees, which have been raised at over half of the country's busiest airports. At Edinburgh Airport, for example, a £6 tariff for a brief 10-minute stop has pushed many drivers to coordinate pickups just outside the paid zones, creating congestion and potential safety risks.

          <p>A debate is intensifying across the UK on whether to shorten the traditional six-week summer school holiday, with proponents arguing it could help close learning gaps and ease childcare burdens for working parents. Some school districts are already adopting a five-week summer break in favor of a longer two-week half-term in October. However, the proposal is divisive, with many teachers opposing the change, viewing the long break as essential for rest and preparation. The discussion also considers the potential economic impacts on holiday pricing and the challenges for employers managing staff leave requests.</p>

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been removed from his position at the Pentagon. Fulcher initially joined the Defense Department as part of Elon Musk's government efficiency team before being promoted to his advisory role. His departure is part of a broader staffing shakeup in Hegseth's office that began after sensitive military plans were leaked in a Signal chat group earlier this year. In a statement, Fulcher said he had completed his planned six months of service and was proud of his work.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and is threatening to terminate a key partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. The move is a response to actions by the Mexican government that forced airlines to relocate from Mexico City's main airport, which the U.S. claims violates a bilateral trade agreement. Under the new rules, all Mexican carriers must seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. The dispute could impact the more than 40 million passengers who fly between the two countries annually and adds another layer of tension to U.S.-Mexico trade relations.</p>

          <p>A recent multi-national prisoner swap provides a new lens through which to examine the Trump administration's strategy of third-country deportations, according to former State Department lawyer Chris Camponovo. This approach involves sending asylum-seekers and other migrants to countries other than their own to await processing or be resettled. The analysis in this article delves into the complex legal and diplomatic maneuvering behind such policies. It explores what the high-stakes prisoner exchange reveals about the administration's broader goals and the practical consequences of its aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after 17-year-old Aamir Siddiqi was murdered in a mistaken-identity contract killing in Cardiff, his sister has made a public appeal to the fugitive suspected of ordering the hit. Mohammed Ali Ege, one of Europe's most wanted men, fled after being arrested in India and remains at large. In a poignant interview, Nishat Siddiqi urged Ege to hand himself in, telling him he is "not truly free" while living a life on the run.

          <p>Rory McIlroy delivered a dramatic and eventful third-round performance at The Open, keeping himself in contention with a score of 66 to reach eight under par. His round was highlighted by a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th hole, which sent roars through the massive crowds at Royal Portrush. Despite a bizarre incident involving a buried golf ball and a costly bogey, McIlroy's strong finish has given him what he described as "half a chance" heading into the final day.

          <p>Germany is shifting its foreign policy focus to build a stronger security and defense alliance with France and the United Kingdom, a partnership now known as the "E3." This move is driven by the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty about the future of US security commitments to Europe under a potential Trump presidency. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, signaling a new era of cooperation. The E3 alliance aims to bolster European self-reliance, with the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK playing a central role.</p>

While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, Barcelona is betting on the 27-year-old's potential and vast top-level experience.

The technology, which uses subatomic particles for processing, has the theoretical potential to solve endless complex calculations instantly, which could revolutionize fields from medicine and materials science to logistics and artificial intelligence. While major milestones have been achieved, practical, real-world applications are still hindered by the instability of qubits, the fundamental units of quantum information.
