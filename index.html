          <h2>Samsung Electronics Secures $16.5 Billion Chip-Supply Contract Through 2033</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 23:13:30 EDT</div>

          <p>Samsung Electronics announced a major, long-term contract worth $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors, boosting its foundry business. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, does not name the client due to a confidentiality agreement, sparking speculation that it could be a major tech firm like Qualcomm or Tesla. This agreement is a significant development for Samsung as it competes with TSMC and aims to ramp up production of its next-generation 2-nanometer chips, especially after recent struggles to meet AI-related demand.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have struck a framework deal on tariffs, establishing a 15% rate for most EU goods, which is lower than the threatened 30% but higher than previous levels. The agreement is being presented as a significant win for the Trump administration, which also secured commitments for the EU to purchase billions in US energy and arms. For the EU, the deal removes significant economic uncertainty, even though it represents a major concession, particularly with a 50% tariff remaining on steel and aluminum exports to the US.</p>

          <p>Following the recent death of rock legend Ozzy Osbourne at 76, his Black Sabbath bandmate Geezer Butler shared a poignant account of their final show together. Butler described being shocked by how frail Osbourne appeared during rehearsals for the July 5th concert, noting he needed assistance and performed while seated. The tribute show, which also featured numerous other rock icons, marked a bittersweet end to a nearly six-decade friendship and career, with Butler expressing gratitude for one last performance in front of adoring fans.</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is poised to announce that its members have overwhelmingly rejected a 3.6% pay increase offered by the government. The union has criticized the offer as inadequate compared to pay rises for other public sector workers, and a high turnout in the consultative vote raises the likelihood of a formal strike ballot in the autumn. This development adds to growing industrial unrest in the UK's health sector, with the GMB union also rejecting the deal and resident doctors currently on a five-day strike.</p>

          <p>Top medical groups, including the American Medical Association, are voicing "deep concern" over reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may dismiss the members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). This follows Kennedy's recent replacement of a CDC vaccine advisory committee with his own, less-experienced picks. The USPSTF is a highly trusted, independent panel that has provided evidence-based guidelines for primary and preventive care since 1984, and its potential overhaul raises fears of political interference that could undermine public health.</p>

The analysis, based on a 15% tariff scenario, suggests countries will reconfigure trade relationships away from the U.S., with American imports from China, Canada, and Mexico expected to fall sharply. Logistics experts warn that the tariffs will make many products more expensive, potentially reducing product diversity for American consumers and causing some shippers to put high-value orders on hold.

          <p>Google has acknowledged that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to function as intended during the catastrophic 2023 earthquake in Turkey, which killed over 55,000 people. The system should have sent a high-level "Take Action" warning to 10 million people near the epicenter, but instead sent only 469, underestimating the quake's magnitude. The company has since adjusted its algorithms, but the failure has raised concerns among scientists about relying on such technology and the transparency surrounding its performance in life-or-death situations.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the influential and sharp-witted musical satirist, has died at the age of 97. Famous in the 1950s and '60s for his piano-driven songs that cleverly skewered politics, war, and societal norms, Lehrer largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on a career teaching mathematics. His work, known for its intelligence and dark humor on topics from nuclear proliferation to pollution, had a profound impact on generations of comedy songwriters and satirists.</p>

          <p>Police officers who were first on the scene of the deadly stabbing attack in Southport have recounted the horror they faced and the moment they confronted the killer. Sgt Greg Gillespie described arriving to a scene of "fear and terror" and making the split-second decision to enter the building with PC Luke Holden before armed backup arrived, knowing only that a child had been stabbed. The officers came face-to-face with the blood-stained attacker, whose cowardly demeanor they noted, in an event that has left an indelible mark on them and the community.</p>

          <p>The ancient village of Keeladi in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has become the center of a historical and political battle following significant archaeological discoveries. Excavations have unearthed a 2,500-year-old urban settlement, with some artifacts suggesting a literate society that predates or developed independently of the dominant narrative of northern Indian civilization. These findings have ignited Tamil pride and challenged established historical timelines, turning the site into a symbol of the deep-rooted cultural and political divide between India's north and south.</p>

          <p>Under the new government of President Javier Milei, human rights organizations and government agencies in Argentina are experiencing mass layoffs and budget cuts, threatening efforts to document the crimes of the country's former military dictatorship. Key institutions, including the National Archive of Remembrance and the Human Rights Secretariat, have seen their staff decimated, while groups like the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo have had their subsidies cut. This has sparked protests and fears that the country's decades-long process of "Truth, Memory and Justice" is being deliberately undermined.</p>

          <p>A profile of comedian John Oliver explores his journey from the Edinburgh Fringe festival to becoming one of America's most influential satirists with his HBO show "Last Week Tonight." Oliver explains that his goal is to make people laugh about serious topics he cares about, using meticulously researched deep dives into obscure and complex issues like hospice care or nuclear annihilation. He views his criticism of the U.S. not as a sign of dislike for his adopted homeland, but as an expression of love and a desire to see it improve.</p>

          <p>An investigation by journalist Miriam Lewin and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo successfully located a Skyvan PA-51 aircraft used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights," where prisoners were thrown alive into the Atlantic. By tracking the plane to the U.S. and obtaining its flight logs, they provided crucial, documented evidence of these atrocities. This evidence was instrumental in a landmark 2017 trial that convicted dozens of officials for crimes against humanity, and the plane has since been returned to Argentina as a memorial.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting a quarterly beat and raising its guidance, Honeywell's stock experienced a significant drop, a trend that has frustrated some market watchers this earnings season. The conglomerate is in the process of a complex split into three separate companies, a factor that may be creating "spin purgatory" and investor impatience. An analyst suggests the sell-off is an overreaction, arguing that the company is well-positioned for the reindustrialization of America and that the current discouragement presents a buying opportunity for those with conviction in its long-term value.
