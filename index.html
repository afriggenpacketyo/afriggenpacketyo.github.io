          <p>Democratic senators are challenging President Trump's declaration of a national emergency to justify tariffs on Canada, calling it a "made-up emergency."  They aim to block the tariffs through a Senate vote, arguing that Trump is falsely claiming an emergency to raise revenue for his tax cut plan.  The vote requires a simple majority and could succeed if a few Republicans join the Democrats.  However, the House, controlled by Republicans, is unlikely to support the legislation.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly offering significant tax cuts to major US tech companies in exchange for lower tariffs from the Trump administration.  The proposed reduction in the digital services tax (DST) aims to mitigate the impact of Trump's tariffs.  The move represents a concession to US tech firms, but the UK also plans to broaden the DST's scope to include smaller companies from other countries.  This strategy reflects the UK's efforts to secure a favorable trade agreement amidst escalating global trade tensions. <i>(not investment advice)<br></i></p>
