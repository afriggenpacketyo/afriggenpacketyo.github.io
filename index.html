          <p>The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, has dropped a federal trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka stemming from an incident at an ICE facility, while charging Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting law enforcement during the same event. The article details that Habba, a Trump appointee, said the decision to charge McIver came after a review of video footage. McIver, in turn, has denied the charges as "purely political."

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has secured trade deals with both the European Union and the United States, showcasing Britain's ability to engage with its two largest trade partners.

While the agreements offer benefits such as reduced tariffs and streamlined travel, they also required concessions on fishing rights and agricultural imports. The article argues that Britain faces a challenging reality as a midsize economy navigating a world dominated by larger trading blocs.</p>
