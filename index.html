          <p>Germany plans to tighten border checks with additional police officers as soon as the new coalition government takes office. Incoming Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt announced stricter measures, including increased entry denials, to reduce illegal migration. Dobrindt emphasized the need for control, clarity, and consistency in managing migration. He received support from regional interior ministers, who promised even tighter border checks. The coalition agreement includes turning away asylum seekers from German borders in coordination with European neighbors, a policy that could conflict with European asylum law.</p>

          <p>As the US government seeks a new agreement with Iran over its nuclear program, Iran's opposition remains divided on the best path forward.

The internal rift between the government and the population has grown wider following the "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement, and an organized opposition has failed to materialize due to systematic persecution of critics and dissidents.</p>
