        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norway's parliamentary election is expected to result in a narrow win for the incumbent Labour Party, as voters focused on rising living costs and international political instability. Opinion polls suggest the left-leaning coalition will secure a slim majority in parliament, though the race remains tight. The campaign was dominated by domestic issues like inflation and public services, but global uncertainty from the war in Ukraine and U.S. trade policies also played a significant role. This uncertainty may have favored the ruling party, as voters often seek stability during tumultuous times.</p>

          <p>Following Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's announcement of his resignation, former economic security minister Sanae Takaichi has emerged as a leading candidate to succeed him, potentially becoming the nation's first female prime minister. A recent opinion poll places Takaichi slightly ahead of her main rival, agriculture minister Shinjiro Koizumi. Her potential rise comes as Japan grapples with a cost-of-living crisis and follows Ishiba's short tenure, which saw his ruling coalition lose its majority. Analysts note that Takaichi is favored for her strong policy ideas and decisive leadership style.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is set to officially inaugurate the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Africa's largest hydroelectric project, sparking significant concern in downstream nations Egypt and Sudan over water security. The dam, which will double Ethiopia's electricity capacity, is viewed by Addis Ababa as a crucial development project, but Cairo and Khartoum fear it will restrict their access to the vital waters of the Nile River. Despite years of negotiations, no legally binding agreement has been reached on the dam's operation. Experts suggest that while the dam poses risks, cooperative management could help mitigate climate change-related challenges like droughts for all three countries.</p>

          <p>A former British Army Sergeant Major, Michael Webber, has admitted to sexually assaulting 19-year-old Gunner Jaysley Beck, who took her own life in December 2021. Beck had filed a complaint against Webber after he pinned her down and tried to kiss her, but an official inquest found the Army's mishandling of her report was a contributing factor in her death. Her family stated their belief that she would still be alive if the chain of command had properly reported the assault to the police. Webber, who has since left the military, pleaded guilty and is now awaiting sentencing.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index experienced a significant 1.5% surge after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his plan to resign. The positive market response is linked to optimism surrounding potential successors, especially Sanae Takaichi, who is perceived as a pro-growth candidate favoring deregulation. This political transition occurs as Japan confronts economic pressures, including a cost-of-living crisis, and introduces a period of political uncertainty. In financial markets, the Japanese yen weakened, while government bond yields continued to climb amid the news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson has been sentenced to life in prison in Australia for the murder of three relatives and the attempted murder of a fourth, whom she served a meal containing toxic death cap mushrooms in 2023. The judge labeled her crimes as belonging to the "worst category" of offenses. Patterson will be eligible for parole after 33 years, a decision influenced by the harsh conditions she faces in solitary confinement. The victims were her estranged husband's parents and aunt, while his uncle survived with lasting health issues; Patterson has continued to maintain her innocence.</p>

          <p>The board of Tottenham Hotspur has confirmed that the club is not for sale after its owner, ENIC Sports & Developments Holdings Ltd, unequivocally rejected two preliminary buyout offers.

The rejected expressions of interest came from two separate consortiums. The statement emphasized that ENIC, which holds nearly an 87% stake in the Premier League club, has no intention of selling its interest, aiming to put an end to the recent rumors.</p>

          <p>Germany's manager Julian Nagelsmann faced criticism for his post-match comments following his team's 3-1 victory over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifier. Nagelsmann described Northern Ireland's strategy as not "brilliant to watch," focusing on long balls and set pieces, which pundits felt was disrespectful. Commentators pointed out that Germany also employed long-ball tactics throughout the game. Despite the win, Germany's performance was considered lackluster, and Nagelsmann's remarks are seen as potentially adding extra tension to the upcoming reverse fixture in Belfast.</p>

          <p>China's export growth slowed to its lowest rate in six months, rising just 4.4% in August, significantly impacted by a 33% year-over-year drop in exports to the United States.

While U.S. trade has fallen, China has expanded its exports to markets in Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa.

          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Mars Possesses a Solid Inner Core, Challenging Previous Models</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A joint China-U.S. study analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander has discovered that Mars has a solid inner core, a finding that contradicts previous planetary formation models. The solid core is estimated to be about 600km in radius, which is proportionally similar to Earth's. Planetary scientists had not expected Mars to have cooled sufficiently to form a solid inner core, making this discovery significant. The finding places Mars alongside Earth and the Moon as celestial bodies known to have this feature, potentially reviving theories about ancient plate tectonics on the Red Planet.</p>

          <p>Following a major immigration raid at a Hyundai manufacturing facility in Georgia that resulted in the detention of approximately 300 South Korean workers, President Donald Trump has called on all foreign companies to respect U.S. immigration laws. In a social media post, Trump stated that while foreign investment is welcome, companies must prioritize hiring and training American workers. The raid, one of the largest single-site sweeps under his administration's anti-immigration campaign, has reportedly caused tension in the diplomatic and economic relationship between the U.S. and South Korea.</p>
