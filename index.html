          <p>A New York City police officer was killed and another wounded after a gunman opened fire inside a high-rise office building in Midtown Manhattan. The attack also left at least two civilians injured, one critically, before the suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The building, which houses offices for major corporations like Blackstone and the NFL, was placed on lockdown as a massive police presence secured the area. Authorities have confirmed the scene is contained and the lone shooter has been neutralized.</p>

          <p>Veteran defensive lineman Christian Wilkins was released by the Las Vegas Raiders following an incident where he reportedly gave a teammate an unwanted "playful" kiss on the forehead. While the interaction led to a human resources complaint, his release is also tied to a dispute over his injury rehabilitation. The Raiders are seeking to void the remaining $35.2 million in guaranteed money on his contract, citing his handling of a foot injury. Wilkins has since filed a grievance through the NFL Players Association.</p>

When asked about starvation in Gaza, Trump cited television images, stating "you can't fake that," despite his access to extensive government information. This reliance on TV, particularly Fox News, makes him susceptible to media narratives and manipulation, shaping policy on complex issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The author argues this approach is dangerous in an age of deepfakes and misinformation.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has rejected a lawsuit aimed at forcing the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The lawsuit, filed by investment fund Azoria Capital, argued that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should be subject to federal "Sunshine Act" open meeting laws. However, the judge upheld the FOMC's long-standing practice of meeting privately, ruling it is not a government agency subject to the act. The judge also questioned if the lawsuit was a publicity stunt for the new fund. (not investment advice)</p>

The Foreign Office had previously refused to ask Israel to let the family leave, citing a policy reserved for exceptional cases like separated spouses or children.
