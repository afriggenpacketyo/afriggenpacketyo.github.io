          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a new executive order adjusting tariff rates on goods from numerous countries, with duties ranging from 10% to 41%. A significant provision imposes an additional 40% tariff on any goods determined to have been transshipped to circumvent original duties. The order also raises tariffs on Canadian exports to 35%, excluding goods under the USMCA pact. These updated rates are set to become effective seven days after the order's issuance, impacting global trade partners currently negotiating agreements with the United States.

          <p>The White House has announced plans to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project long advocated by President Trump. The $200 million cost will be covered by private donations, including from the president himself, with construction slated to begin in September. This new facility, to be built alongside a modernized East Wing, will seat approximately 650 guests, eliminating the need for temporary tents for large state functions. The administration states the design will respect the historical architecture of the White House while providing a much-needed venue for future administrations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. CDC is considering a travel notice for China due to a significant surge in Chikungunya fever, with over 5,000 cases reported since last month, primarily in Guangdong province. Chikungunya is a virus transmitted by infected mosquitoes, causing symptoms like high fever and severe joint pain, along with potential headaches, muscle pain, and rashes. The rising number of infections has prompted international health organizations to increase their monitoring of the situation. This outbreak highlights the ongoing challenges of managing mosquito-borne illnesses in densely populated regions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two major cities that have historically driven economic growth in China's Guangdong province, are reporting underperforming GDP figures. Analysts attribute the slowdown to a combination of weakening global demand for exports and insufficient domestic consumption to compensate. Shenzhen has been particularly affected, with significant year-on-year drops in fixed-asset investment and real estate development, indicating a decline in investor confidence. Despite growth in the hi-tech sector, falling exports suggest these key economic engines are facing considerable headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pop star Justin Timberlake has disclosed that he battled a "relentlessly debilitating" case of Lyme disease throughout his recent Forget Tomorrow world tour. The 44-year-old singer shared on Instagram that the diagnosis explained the severe nerve pain and fatigue he experienced on stage. Despite the physical and mental toll, he chose to continue the tour, viewing it as a test of his mental tenacity. Timberlake's revelation comes after a challenging year that also included a DWI arrest, and he stated he aims to be more transparent about his personal struggles with his fans.</p>

The proposal involves the state legislature sending a ballot measure with new district maps to voters, which would remain in effect until 2030.

          <p>Following a blockbuster market debut, four major venture capital firms—Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia—are holding a collective $24 billion worth of stock in design software company Figma. The company's shares soared 250% on their first day, valuing the company at nearly $68 billion, more than triple the amount Adobe had offered in a failed acquisition attempt. The successful IPO is a significant positive development for the tech industry and venture capitalists, who have seen scarce returns from public offerings over the past few years, signaling a potential reopening of the IPO market.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate cuts, consumers carrying high-interest credit card debt are advised to create a proactive repayment strategy rather than waiting for external relief. Financial experts suggest borrowers assess their situation and consider independent debt-reduction methods like the "debt snowball" or "debt avalanche" plans. For those with significant balances, exploring professional debt relief services such as debt management programs or credit counseling may be beneficial. The article stresses the importance of taking control of one's finances now, as even future rate cuts are likely to have a minimal impact on high credit card APRs.</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock price fell after the company, despite reporting better-than-expected second-quarter revenue and profit, issued a light operating income forecast for the upcoming quarter. The company's Q2 sales grew 13% year-over-year, with its advertising and cloud units showing strong performance. However, the third-quarter guidance spooked investors who are closely watching for returns on the company's massive investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. CEO Andy Jassy sought to reassure investors about the long-term potential of its AI offerings and the leadership position of its cloud division, AWS. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is bringing back the presidential fitness test, a program first initiated in 1956 by President Eisenhower over concerns about national security and the physical fitness of American youth compared to Europeans. The test typically assessed cardiovascular fitness, strength, and flexibility through exercises like a one-mile run and pull-ups. However, its effectiveness is debated, as data from recent decades shows that child health metrics in the U.S. have generally worsened, not improved. The revival of the test reopens a long-standing discussion about the role of schools in promoting physical health among children.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the CISA director during the Biden administration, had her appointment to a prestigious chair position at West Point rescinded. The decision by the Secretary of the Army came shortly after a pro-Trump activist criticized the hiring on social media, accusing Easterly of being a "holdover" who would undermine the Trump administration. In a statement, Easterly lamented that the opportunity was a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage." The incident raises concerns about the influence of political activism on academic and military appointments, and the vetting process for such roles.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece from The Atlantic argues that President Trump's trade policy has evolved from its "America First" realpolitik roots into a form of "warped idealism." The article contends that Trump is now using economic tools like tariffs to achieve personal and ideological goals, such as punishing Brazil for prosecuting his ally Jair Bolsonaro or Canada for recognizing a Palestinian state. This approach, it claims, serves foreign interests over American ones and undermines U.S. credibility without providing any clear economic benefit to the nation, ultimately betraying the pact Trump made with his voters.</p>

          <p>For savers with a significant deposit like $20,000, this article compares the earning potential of high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts in the current rate environment. With rates for both account types currently over 4%, the difference in interest earned over a year is often minimal, though high-yield savings accounts currently have a slight edge. The choice between the two may therefore depend on other features, such as the check-writing capabilities and debit card access that often come with money market accounts. Savers are advised to compare specific offerings to find the best fit for their financial goals.</p>
