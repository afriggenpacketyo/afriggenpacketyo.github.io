          <p>Major European financial institutions, including Unicredit, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank, are set to release their quarterly earnings, with markets anticipating continued positive momentum from the banking sector. This financial optimism contrasts with downgrades in other industries like luxury and energy. However, a significant macroeconomic variable looms as the European Central Bank holds its policy meeting. The ECB is expected to maintain current interest rates, but it is widely assumed they will implement cuts if the US proceeds with threatened 30% tariffs on EU imports, creating a tense waiting game for investors.

          <p>The 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Green Bay, Wisconsin, was a perplexing case that initially focused on her boyfriend, Doug Detrie. However, data from Detrie's Fitbit device provided a crucial alibi, showing minimal activity during the time of the murder and leading to his exoneration. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify a new suspect, George Burch, a man with no apparent connection to the victim. The case against Burch was solidified using his phone's Google Dashboard location data, which tracked his movements from a bar to the crime scene and other key locations, ultimately securing his conviction.</p>

          <p>Five consecutive days of severe rainfall across South Korea have caused widespread devastation, leading to at least 14 fatalities and leaving 12 other individuals missing. The government's Interior and Safety Ministry reported that the deaths resulted from landslides, building collapses, and flash floods triggered by the extreme weather. In the southern town of Sancheong, eight people were found dead, while other fatalities occurred in Gapyeong and Osan. With southern regions receiving up to 800 millimeters of rain, nearly 4,000 people have been evacuated from their homes as of Sunday morning.</p>

          <p>A new mural honoring the late Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela was unveiled at Dodger Stadium, celebrating his enduring legacy nine months after his passing. Created by artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts Valenzuela and is intended to symbolize unity within the Latino community, a group for whom he became an icon. Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, sparked "Fernandomania" and helped connect the team with Latino fans who felt a deep personal pride in his success. The tribute has been emotionally received by fans, who see him as a symbol of hope and representation.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the devastating flash floods that struck Texas's Kerr County over the July 4th holiday, officials have announced a significant positive development in the search efforts. The number of individuals reported missing has been reduced from nearly 100 to just three, following weeks of intensive search and rescue operations. The floods, which caused at least 135 deaths statewide, were particularly destructive along the Guadalupe River, washing away homes and overwhelming a Christian summer camp. This progress in accounting for the missing brings a measure of relief to a community grappling with immense loss.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' recent struggles continued as they fell to the Milwaukee Brewers in an 8-7 loss, marking their ninth defeat in the last eleven games. Although the Dodgers' offense showed signs of life by scoring seven runs and hitting back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning, it wasn't enough to overcome a lackluster pitching performance. The team repeatedly failed to capitalize on key opportunities, such as leaving the go-ahead run at third base with no outs in the third inning. The loss highlights the team's ongoing difficulty in synchronizing its hitting and pitching to secure wins during this disappointing stretch.</p>

Government forces deployed to the city of Suweida were reportedly involved in attacks on the Druze community, complicating the situation.

          <p>In a commentary piece, Simon Tisdall analyzes the seemingly intractable nature of major global conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine, suggesting the root cause extends beyond politics. He argues that the world is experiencing a crisis of its "moral order," where universally accepted ethical standards have fractured, making peaceful resolutions nearly impossible. This moral relativism allows for atrocities and war crimes to be justified by different groups, hindering mediation and perpetuating violence. Tisdall posits that without a collective recommitment to shared ethical principles, as defined by international law and social contracts, the cycle of conflict will continue unabated.</p>

The goal is to give authorities the tools to intervene long before a violent attack can be carried out.</p>
