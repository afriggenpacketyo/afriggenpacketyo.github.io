          <p>A lunchtime fire at a restaurant in Liaoyang, northeastern China, resulted in the deaths of 22 people and injured three others, prompting an investigation into the cause. Chinese President Xi Jinping called the incident a “deeply sobering lesson” and urged local officials to quickly treat the injured, determine what triggered the blaze, and hold those responsible to account. Over 20 fire trucks and 85 firefighters were dispatched to the scene to combat the fire that broke out in a residential area. Xi also emphasized the need for improved emergency response plans and increased safety checks before the May Day holiday.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, reaffirming its full-year outlook while anticipating manageable disruptions from global trade conflicts, unlike rival PepsiCo which trimmed its forecast. Coke's CEO, James Quincey, emphasized responding to consumer behavior rather than sentiment, sticking to current pricing plans despite potential cost increases in materials like aluminum and orange juice. The company's organic revenue grew 6%, driven by higher prices, with unit case volume up 2% due to growth in India, China, and Brazil. However, North America experienced underperformance due to weakening consumer sentiment, particularly among Hispanic consumers, influenced by false rumors regarding undocumented workers.</p>

          <p>Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, President Trump's nominee for U.S. Surgeon General, is facing scrutiny over discrepancies in her claimed credentials, including her medical degree and board certifications. While she has presented herself as double board-certified with a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, records indicate she earned her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean (AUC) School of Medicine and is only certified in family medicine. Medical ethicists have raised concerns about the importance of transparency and credibility for the Surgeon General, a role that requires public trust and clear communication about health matters. Nesheiwat's background also includes personal tragedy, as she accidentally shot and killed her father at age 13.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House condemned Amazon for its reported plan to display the cost of President Trump's tariffs next to product prices, labeling it a "hostile and political act." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt questioned why Amazon didn't highlight inflation during the Biden administration, advocating for Americans to "buy American." This criticism follows reports that Amazon will show consumers the tariff-related portion of an item's cost, similar to surcharges recently added by fast-fashion giants Shein and Temu. The administration argues that such disclosures demonstrate that American consumers, not China, bear the burden of these policies.</p>

The symbol, historically associated with Christianity, has evolved into a personal talisman and a declaration of shared beliefs, particularly among young Christian women. Figures like White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and Attorney General Pam Bondi wear cross pendants as expressions of their Christian upbringing, while others see them as symbols of strength and connection with fellow believers. However, the symbol's increasing visibility in the political sphere has introduced partisan implications, complicating its meaning for some.</p>

          <p>A coalition of labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments has filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's overhaul of the federal government, arguing it's unconstitutional because Congress hasn't authorized the changes. The lawsuit targets actions taken by the President, Elon Musk's DOGE team, and agency heads to downsize the federal workforce, claiming they "usurp" Congress' authority. The plaintiffs argue that federal agencies are created by Congress, which alone has the power to undertake such large-scale transformations. They seek to vacate Trump's executive order and halt agency "reduction in force" plans, citing irreparable harm and arguing that the compressed timeline prevents proper compliance with regulations.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles expects a significant 35% drop in shipping volume next week compared to last year, as President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods lead companies to cut import orders. Shipments from China, which constitute approximately 45% of the port's business, are expected to decline sharply, with about a quarter of the usual number of arriving ships being canceled in May. Port Director Gene Seroka believes U.S. retailers have about five to seven weeks before the curtailed shipments start impacting product availability and prices for consumers. Apollo Global Management's chief economist warns of potential layoffs in transportation and retail industries, empty shelves, and a possible recession this summer.</p>

The article suggests considering short-term CDs and strategies like CD laddering to maximize returns in an environment with an inverted yield curve.

Introverts' brains often resist discomfort, which pushes them to think more deeply and choose their words carefully, leading to precise, thoughtful, and impactful communication. By prioritizing listening, honesty, and clarity, introverts foster collaboration and better decision-making within organizations, making them a vital force despite their quiet nature.</p>

Agencies must begin "utilization monitoring" using employee ID card data or, alternatively, daily surveys and laptop data, with initial reports due May 19 and subsequent reports every two weeks. This data collection is intended to "shrink the Federal real estate footprint" and "ensure compliance" with the President's return-to-office policy.

In the first quarter, GM's profit fell 7% to $2.8 billion, with a 14% drop in earnings before interest and taxes in North America.

          <p>The Trump administration plans to ease some tariffs on automakers by rolling back import duties on steel and aluminum, aiming to prevent the industry from being hit twice by its tariff policies. While the 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, automakers will be reimbursed for previously paid double tariffs. Stellantis and Ford have expressed support for the move, while General Motors postponed its first-quarter conference call to assess potential tariff changes. The administration says this measure will reward companies manufacturing domestically and incentivize further investment in American manufacturing.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that Malta's fast-track naturalization scheme for foreign investors, known as the "golden passport" program, violates EU law. The court stated that granting citizenship in exchange for payments or investments amounts to a "mere commercial transaction." The program, which allowed investors meeting financial requirements to apply for Maltese citizenship after 12 months of residency, has been criticized for facilitating white-collar crime and sanctions evasion. The Maltese government said it would respect the court's decision while studying the legal implications, while transparency advocates welcomed the ruling.</p>
