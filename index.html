          <p>ABC News has suspended senior national correspondent Terry Moran after he posted a since-deleted critical message on X targeting Stephen Miller and President Trump. Moran described Miller as "richly endowed with the capacity for hatred" and Trump's hatred as a means to self-glorification. The network stated that Moran's post violated their standards of objectivity and impartiality, leading to his suspension pending further evaluation. The White House responded strongly, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling Moran's comments "unhinged and unacceptable," while Miller himself accused Moran of being a radical journalist. The suspension highlights the sensitivity surrounding media coverage of the Trump administration and the potential consequences for journalists expressing personal opinions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests in response to recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, which resulted in numerous arrests. Activists organized a "mass mobilization" outside Los Angeles City Hall, prompting the deployment of approximately 300 National Guard troops to protect federal property and personnel. The protests were sparked by ICE executing search warrants at multiple locations, including a clothing warehouse, leading to clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators. The situation escalated with reports of arrests, property damage, and the use of non-lethal munitions by federal agents, prompting local officials to urge peaceful assembly. The deployment of the National Guard and the ongoing protests highlight the deep divisions and tensions surrounding immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples' dynamics has identified the five most common sources of conflict in relationships. These include tone of voice or attitude, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. The psychologist emphasizes that contempt, often conveyed through tone and body language, is a strong predictor of divorce. Uneven distribution of labor, particularly the "invisible load" of managing household tasks and appointments, is a frequent cause of arguments over chores. Effective communication strategies, such as the "five-second rule" for taking time-outs during heated discussions, can help couples navigate these challenges.</p>

The storm is located about 170 miles southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. While no coastal watches or warnings are in effect, the storm may bring two to four inches of rainfall to western Mexican states, potentially causing flooding and mudslides. Additionally, Barbara is expected to generate dangerous sea swells and rip currents along the southwestern coast.

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to address protests against ICE actions is viewed as a calculated move to provoke unrest and expand presidential power. The deployment is based on a dubious legal rationale and aims to shift attention away from Trump's failures while portraying him as a strongman. By militarizing the situation, Trump may be seeking to create a national emergency that would allow him to exercise authoritarian control. Critics argue that the move is intended to radicalize citizen-soldiers and undermine local authorities, urging restraint to deny Trump the political spectacle he desires.</p>

          <p>A new executive order issued by President Donald Trump, which restricts travel from 12 countries, is set to come into effect on June 9th. This order is more methodical compared to previous iterations, as it follows a process where top advisors compiled a list of countries with insufficient screening standards for potential migrants deemed a national security risk. This order signals Trump's intention to reinstate the controversial travel ban policy from his first term, which faced significant legal challenges and widespread criticism.</p>

          <p>ABC News suspended veteran correspondent Terry Moran after he posted a harsh criticism of President Trump and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on X. Moran's post, which has since been deleted, described Miller as a "world-class hater" and Trump as using hatred for self-glorification. ABC News stated that Moran's comments violated the division's policy on objectivity and impartiality. The White House responded sharply, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling Moran's remarks "unacceptable and unhinged." The incident underscores the heightened sensitivity surrounding media coverage of the Trump administration and the potential repercussions for journalists expressing personal opinions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's swift response to protests in California, deploying the National Guard, may appeal to his base but risks escalating tensions. Despite reports that the protests were largely peaceful, Trump administration officials claimed that immigration agents were being targeted and that local law enforcement was slow to respond. Trump federalized the California National Guard over Governor Gavin Newsom's objections and threatened to deploy active-duty U.S. Marines. While Trump declared victory and thanked the National Guard, the move raises concerns about federal overreach and the potential for inflaming an already tense situation.</p>
