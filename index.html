          <p>Judge Hannah Dugan of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was arrested by the FBI on charges of obstruction for allegedly helping a man evade immigration authorities at her courthouse. The FBI claims Dugan intentionally misdirected agents, allowing the individual to avoid arrest, while her attorney asserts her arrest was not in the interest of public safety. The arrest has sparked controversy, with some officials accusing the Trump administration of weaponizing federal law enforcement against immigrant communities and others calling it a dangerous move that threatens the separation of powers.

          <p>A Japanese research team has discovered that exposure to a one-minute sound at 100 hertz may prevent motion sickness symptoms by stimulating the inner ear and improving balance. In experiments, 70 to 80 percent of volunteers exposed to the sound experienced alleviation of symptoms such as lightheadedness and nausea while on a swing, in a driving simulator, or in a car. This study offers a potential non-pharmaceutical preventive measure as the risk of motion sickness increases with the development of self-driving technology, and it is believed that the sound activates the vestibular system.</p>

Precious items, including a gold collar from the pyramid of King Talakhamani, are missing, and the government plans to contact Interpol and UNESCO to recover the stolen artifacts.

          <p>The Trump administration is reversing its policy of terminating visas for foreign students, following numerous lawsuits and widespread fear among students. Immigration officials are now working on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas, restoring records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (SEVIS). The policy had affected an estimated 1,800 students and 280 universities, with many students facing potential deportation due to alleged participation in political protests or previous criminal charges.</p>

          <h2>California Considers Allowing Testing of Driverless Heavy-Duty Trucks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 18:10:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California regulators have released a proposal to allow the testing of self-driving heavy-duty trucks on public roads. This would open the door for companies to test autonomous technology on vehicles over 10,001 lbs. The proposed regulations aim to enhance data-reporting requirements for manufacturers and give the state's DMV more authority to apply enforcement measures. The proposal is subject to a public comment period and is expected to face pushback from safety advocates and labor unions concerned about job losses.</p>
