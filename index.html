          <p>The US and UK have reached a trade agreement aimed at increasing market access for American farm exports, while the UK secures concessions on car and steel exports. President Trump hailed the deal as a breakthrough, emphasizing reciprocity and fairness in international trade. However, a 10% tariff on most UK goods remains in place, and some analysts view the substantive benefits as limited. The agreement includes provisions for the UK to export 100,000 cars annually to the US with a reduced tariff and removes additional tariffs on steel and aluminum, signaling a potential approach for future trade negotiations with other countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump appointed Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin after his nomination faced Senate opposition. Pirro, a former district attorney and staunch Trump supporter, will step down from Fox News to assume the role, which oversees criminal prosecutions and civil cases in Washington, D.C. The appointment raises legal questions about bypassing Senate confirmation, and Pirro's past false statements about the 2020 election, which were part of a lawsuit against Fox News, have drawn scrutiny. Martin will move to the Department of Justice as the new Director of the Weaponization Working Group, Associate Deputy Attorney General, and Pardon Attorney.</p>

          <p>China's latest stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have failed to boost its stock market due to persistent worries about economic deterioration and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. Unlike previous stimulus packages, this one is more targeted at industrial and social needs rather than direct market support. Analysts suggest that investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and prop up the real estate sector. The central government acknowledged the intensified impacts from external shocks, indicating a cautious approach to the economic challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>A massive health fraud scheme involving at least 119 Amtrak employees and doctors bilked the railroad company out of $12 million through fraudulent medical claims. Employees accepted cash kickbacks from healthcare providers in exchange for their insurance information, which was then used to file claims for services never provided or medically unnecessary. While some employees have retired, resigned, or been criminally charged, a significant number are still employed by Amtrak. The company states it is taking steps to address medical insurance fraud, including increased oversight and enhanced fraud prevention measures.</p>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are advocating for a reevaluation of World War II history, challenging the traditional Western-centric perspective that marks 1939 as the war's starting point. They propose that Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria, escalating into a full-scale war in China by 1937, should be recognized as the true beginning. This revisionist view aims to highlight and elevate China's role in the war against fascism. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, with countries worldwide holding commemorations, including President Xi Jinping's attendance at Moscow's Victory Day parade.</p>

          <p>A federal class-action lawsuit alleges that UCLA's medical school uses race as a factor in admissions, despite state law and Supreme Court rulings against affirmative action. The suit, brought by activist groups, claims the school favors Black applicants with lower GPAs and MCAT scores while requiring near-perfect scores from white and Asian applicants. Citing whistleblowers, the lawsuit accuses the associate dean for admissions of soliciting information to determine applicants' race and using it in the decision-making process. This legal challenge coincides with increased scrutiny of UCLA and other UC campuses by the Trump administration for alleged illegal DEI practices in admissions.</p>

          <p>Columbia University's response to a pro-Palestinian demonstration in the main library marked a significant shift in the university's approach to disruptive protests. Unlike a similar occupation a year prior, campus security intervened aggressively, leading to arrests and injuries. The university's actions have drawn praise from some, including the Trump administration's antisemitism task force, but have also sparked criticism from those who believe unarmed demonstrators should not be met with force. Demonstrators vandalized the library with graffiti, and the university is moving to tighten control of protest discipline.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to consider including a tax hike on wealthy Americans in the upcoming fiscal package. This proposal involves creating a new top income bracket for individuals earning over $2.5 million per year and taxing income above that level at 39.6%. This would partially reverse the tax cuts enacted in 2017, which reduced the top rate to 37%. The move aims to offset the cost of extending the 2017 tax cuts and protect Medicaid, addressing concerns about cutting benefits for the poor to fund tax cuts for the rich.</p>

This marks a significant shift from India's protectionist stance, which has historically relied on high import duties. The U.S. tariffs on Indian exports appear to have prompted this change. Experts believe that reducing trade barriers is crucial for India's economic growth, facilitating foreign investment and access to global markets.

          <p>The Camogie Association is facing increasing pressure to relax its enforced skort rule, with many arguing it is sexist and uncomfortable for players. County and club teams have been advocating for the option to wear shorts instead of skorts in camogie matches. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue. A recent survey revealed that 70% of players experience discomfort while wearing the skort, and 83% want the option to choose shorts.</p>

          <p>The acquittal of three former police officers in the state trial over the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols has sparked outrage and raised questions about accountability for police violence. Despite video evidence of the officers brutalizing Nichols, a jury acquitted them on all charges, including second-degree murder. The defense successfully shifted blame, emphasized the dangers of policing, and highlighted Nichols's resistance. The verdict adds to a mixed record of outcomes in cases against police officers since George Floyd's death, underscoring the challenges of prosecuting law enforcement for excessive force.</p>

          <p>An order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to remove ideologies deemed "divisive" from military service academy curricula has led to canceled classes, book bans, and resignations at West Point. The academy's leaders have initiated a schoolwide effort to remove readings focusing on race, gender, and the darker aspects of American history. This has raised concerns about academic freedom and the politicization of the academy. Two tenured professors have resigned in protest, citing the order's impact on their ability to teach.</p>

Oscar Garcia Maceiras, Inditex's CEO, says US President Donald Trump's tariffs won't disrupt its supply chains or change Zara's plans to expand further in the US. The business has changed the way we shop by sourcing a lot of its clothes closer to home and changing products much more frequently.</p>

Professor Mahesh Anand is the only scientist in the UK to have been loaned this extremely rare material, which he describes as "more precious than gold dust". After grinding and zapping the dust with lasers, Prof Anand's team hope to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth. Inside the grains of dust could be evidence to back up scientists' theory that the Moon was made from the debris thrown out when Earth struck a Mars-sized planet 4.5 billion years ago.</p>
