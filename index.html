          <p>American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency mining firm with ties to Eric and Donald Trump Jr., is set to merge with Gryphon Digital Mining, a publicly-traded company, allowing the firm to list on the Nasdaq. The company aims to mine bitcoin at below-market costs and accumulate a substantial reserve of the cryptocurrency. The Trump family's increasing involvement in cryptocurrency has drawn criticism, with some alleging potential conflicts of interest, particularly concerning crypto regulation and elected officials' participation in crypto ventures. The merger is expected to close as early as the third quarter of this year.</p>

The article suggests a pattern of leveraging the presidency for personal enrichment, raising questions about conflicts of interest and the erosion of traditional norms. The removal of constraints extends to law enforcement, as the Trump administration disbanded a Justice Department unit dedicated to investigating cryptocurrency crimes.</p>

The winners were selected based on the average number of coins they held, rather than their final holdings, incentivizing some to sell at peak value. This resulted in criticism and questions regarding ethics and access to government for personal profit. The trading frenzy started on April 23, when a website associated with Mr. Trump’s coin announced the contest.</p>

          <p>A new book alleges that Joe Biden's decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election race for too long negatively impacted Kamala Harris's subsequent campaign after Biden withdrew. Former Obama campaign advisor David Plouffe reportedly described Harris's campaign as a 'fucking nightmare' due to Biden's actions. The book also suggests that concerns were raised about Biden's cognitive abilities, and that efforts were made to shield him from his own staff. The 27 June 2024 debate in Atlanta was no anomaly, the book argues. Since at least 2022 Biden has been increasingly prone to lose his train of thought and struggle to remember the names of top aides.</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny and Fuerza Regida have made Latin music history by simultaneously holding the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Billboard 200 album chart with their Spanish-language albums. Bad Bunny's 'Debí Tirar Más Fotos' regained the top spot, while Fuerza Regida's '111XPANTIA' debuted at No. 2, marking the highest-charting música regional album by a group or duo. The album title itself, “111XPANTIA,” is made up of two parts: the first is a palindrome, “111,” which some call an “angel number,” or a sign of luck; the second part stems from the Nahuatl word for manifestation, “ixpantia.”</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant delays due to a staffing shortage at an air traffic control facility. The delays are the latest in a series of setbacks for the airport, including recent radar outages. The Transportation Secretary plans to reduce the number of flights to mitigate the issues, while the FAA has convened a task force to address the problems.

At least three other people were killed in the attack, and three others were wounded. The attack underscores the problem of electoral violence in Mexico, where organized crime seeks to control local mayors. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that police were trying to track down the killers of Lara, who was running under the banner of Sheinbaum’s ruling Morena political bloc.</p>

          <p>Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander has been reunited with his family in Israel after being held captive by Hamas in Gaza for 19 months. The 21-year-old had been serving in the Israeli army on the border of Gaza when he was captured by Hamas militants on 7 October 2023. Israel paused its military operations in Gaza for a few hours to facilitate the transfer. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the release was intended as a goodwill gesture and as part of efforts to reach a new ceasefire deal ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>President Trump's imposition of tariffs on Chinese products, followed by a temporary reduction, highlights the limitations of his aggressive trade strategy. While the tariffs disrupted global trade, they did not result in significant concessions from China beyond an agreement to continue negotiations. This has raised questions about whether the economic disruptions were justified. On Monday morning, Mr. Trump said that if the countries did not reach an agreement in that time, tariffs on Chinese products would rise again to be “substantially higher,” though not to 145 percent.</p>

          <p>This article discusses President Trump's plan to accept a $400 million plane from Qatar for use as Air Force One, raising ethical and national security concerns. The author argues that the arrangement could be seen as bribery and a violation of the Constitution's foreign emoluments clause. The fact that we don’t know what Qatar might want from Trump doesn’t change that. In fact, it’s arguably scarier, because rather than consider the exchange a quid pro quo for something specific, Trump could slant any number of policy choices to benefit Doha.</p>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company on the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, a multibillion-dollar Amtrak project. This has raised concerns about conflicts of interest, given Musk's leadership roles in companies regulated by the government and his position as an advisor to President Trump. The Department of Transportation said that the estimated price for the tunnel had increased by $2.5 billion, and that Amtrak had not yet found ways to reduce costs. The tunnel was expected to be completed by 2035.</p>

          <p>This guest essay highlights concerns over the safety of food additives in the United States, where thousands of chemicals are allowed in food with limited FDA oversight. The author points out that the US allows food companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals without prior Food and Drug Administration approval. Research on chemicals tends to be narrow, focusing on immediate health effects rather than long-term impacts or interactions between chemicals. The health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., believes toxic chemicals in food are behind the U.S. explosion in rates of obesity and a range of other chronic illnesses.</p>

The FAA has installed new fiber optic lines at Newark airport and New York's Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports to replace old copper wires since the first outage, but plans to spend the next two weeks testing those new lines out before switching over to them.</p>

She has been criticized for her handling of the Epstein files, her close ties to Elon Musk, and her frequent appearances on Fox News. Critics, including Senate Democrats who opposed her confirmation, have cited one episode in particular to cast that relationship as unsavory: Her acceptance of a $25,000 campaign contribution from Mr. Trump made around the time she declined to join other states in investigating complaints against Trump University.</p>

In a letter addressed to Trump on Sunday, the studios and unions did not mention his threat to introduce 100% tariffs on films made abroad, but instead thanked him for supporting the industry through their “shared goal” of domestic production. The letter also calls for Trump to back three tax provisions in the upcoming budget reconciliation bill being drafted by Congress that it argues would “immediately make America more competitive, expand the American media industry, brings jobs back to America, and support the independent spirit of American business”.</p>
