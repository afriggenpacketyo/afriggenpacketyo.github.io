        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mark Zaid, a prominent whistleblower attorney, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for revoking his security clearance, claiming it was done as political retribution. Zaid, who has represented whistleblowers across administrations, argues that the revocation undermines his ability to represent his clients effectively. The lawsuit alleges violations of the First and Fifth Amendments, seeking to restore his clearance and declare the presidential memorandum unconstitutional. Zaid asserts that security clearances should not be used as political weapons, emphasizing the potential harm to his livelihood and clients. Optimism for the case is relatively low given the politicized nature of the situation. (not investment advice)</p>

The event celebrated the importance of clothing and style in the formation of Black identities within the Atlantic diaspora, offering a vibrant display of sartorial creativity. The gala and its corresponding exhibition are considered a celebration of Black culture and creativity, so the optimism score is relatively high.</p>

          <p>OpenAI announced it is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, allowing the nonprofit that controls it to maintain its grip on the company. This decision is a victory for critics like Elon Musk, who argued OpenAI was too focused on profits. The restructuring comes after corporate drama and concerns from regulators and experts about OpenAI's direction. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, stated the change provides a more understandable structure, while law professor Jill R. Horwitz noted that the meaning of 'control' remains to be seen. The new structure allows the nonprofit to be OpenAI’s largest shareholder.</p>

          <p>A skull discovered in the ossuary of the Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Hungary may belong to Matthias Corvinus, a legendary European king. Facial reconstruction specialist Emese Gábor found morphological similarities between the skull and that of Corvinus' son. The skull's physical features align with what is known about Corvinus, including his age and height, and greenish discoloration suggests a metal crown. Researchers plan further studies, including DNA and isotope analyses, to shed light on Corvinus and historical treasures at Hungarian heritage sites.</p>

          <p>Mr. Deepfakes, a large website dedicated to deepfake pornography, has shut down after a critical service provider withdrew its support. The site allowed users to upload and view deepfake porn videos, as well as buy and sell custom nonconsensual content. The shutdown follows the passage of the "Take It Down Act," which makes posting nonconsensual sexual imagery a federal crime. Experts see the closure as a positive step in combating deepfake abuse, though they acknowledge the issue will persist on less mainstream platforms. The issue of nonconsensual sexual deepfake imagery is taken more seriously and societal infrastructure is needed to react better than before.</p>

Senators Jeff Merkley and Elizabeth Warren have voiced strong opposition, with Warren stating the legislation would enable the president and his family to profit.

          <p>The Trump administration has asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to mifepristone, aligning with the Biden administration's earlier position. The Justice Department argued that the case does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the Texas district court where it was filed. This move is surprising, given President Trump's opposition to abortion rights, but may reflect a desire to avoid politically sensitive actions on abortion. The lawsuit seeks to reverse FDA measures that expanded access to mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortions, and could significantly impact abortion access nationwide.</p>

          <p>President Trump has seemingly disengaged from the Israel-Gaza conflict, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns of an "intensive" Israeli escalation. Analysts suggest that after initial diplomatic efforts, Trump's administration has become distracted, giving Netanyahu a free hand. This shift comes as Netanyahu plans to call up tens of thousands of reservists for a fresh assault on Gaza. While Trump has expressed concern for Gaza's population, his attention to the conflict has been sporadic. Experts note a contrast with the Biden administration's micromanagement of Israel's operations, and the new Trump administration is being more hands off.</p>

The FAA said the plane was registered to Paul Berkovitz of Westlake Village. Kit planes are popular for being less expensive than factory-built aircraft, but the crash puts a spotlight on their accident rate and regulatory approval process.

          <p>President Trump has expressed uncertainty about upholding the Constitution as his administration pursues an aggressive deportation campaign. He questioned the need for due process for everyone, indicating a belief that the legal system should not impede immediate deportations. Trump's rhetoric portrays migrants as "monsters" and "murderers," justifying bypassing legal procedures. The administration has faced legal setbacks, including a judge barring the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, but shows no signs of backing down. This continues the trend of undermining trust in judicial systems.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order restricting federal funding for "gain-of-function" research, citing its potential dangers. The research involves experimenting with pathogens to understand how they might become more transmissible or cause more severe illness. The order blocks U.S. funding for such research in "countries of concern," such as China and Iran, and prohibits U.S. dollars from "contributing to foreign research likely to cause another pandemic." HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary voiced support for the restriction, citing concerns about accidental releases and potential pandemics.</p>

A Gallup survey found only 46% of Americans expressed support for Israel, the lowest level in 25 years. While US support for Israel is likely to continue, the shifting sands of public opinion raise questions about the extent and limits of that backing.</p>
