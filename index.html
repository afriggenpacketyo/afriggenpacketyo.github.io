          <p>In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated she is considering another run for the presidency. While not officially committing, she responded with "possibly" when asked about a 2028 bid, asserting that her career in public service is not over. Harris also commented on the 2024 election, stating her warnings about Donald Trump's authoritarian tendencies have been proven correct and criticized businesses for capitulating to his demands. Polling in her home state of California, however, shows limited support for another presidential campaign at this time.</p>

Her parents attribute her remarkable recovery, which includes walking and dribbling a basketball, to the "miraculous power of prayer" and skilled medical care. The community gathered to celebrate her release, offering a moment of hope following the tragic August attack that killed two children and injured 18 others.

          <p>England's rugby league team experienced a significant loss to Australia in the first Ashes match in 22 years, with coach Shaun Wane describing the performance as "torture." Despite a close first half, Australia dominated the second, capitalizing on England's errors and wasted opportunities. Australian full-back Reece Walsh was named player of the match for his pivotal role in both defense and offense. The defeat puts Australia in a strong position to retain the Ashes in the next match, extending their long-standing unbeaten record against England in test series.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in New Zealand successfully removed 80 to 100 high-powered magnets from the stomach and intestines of a 13-year-old boy. The magnets, which the teen purchased online, had clamped together inside his digestive tract, causing pressure necrosis and requiring the removal of part of his bowel. This case highlights the significant dangers of ingesting multiple small, powerful magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys. Despite being banned for sale in New Zealand, such items remain easily accessible online, prompting renewed concerns about product safety and enforcement of regulations.</p>

          <p>The popular investment strategy of passively investing in S&P 500 index funds, like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), may be losing its appeal for some investors seeking better diversification. Financial experts note that the S&P 500 has become heavily weighted towards the technology sector, which now accounts for over 35% of the index, a record high. In response, some traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500. This trend suggests a broadening of investment focus beyond large-cap tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has abruptly ended trade negotiations with Canada, a move that experts warn could impact U.S. prices for goods like cars, auto parts, and home appliances. The decision was reportedly a response to a Canadian television ad that featured former President Ronald Reagan speaking critically about tariffs. This halt in talks could keep existing steep tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in place for an extended period. Since these metals are key components in many consumer products, the continued tariffs could lead to higher costs for manufacturers and, ultimately, for consumers.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent lawmaker Catherine Connolly is set to become the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded defeat.

Connolly, a former barrister known for her criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza, has garnered support from several left-leaning parties. She will succeed Michael D.

          <p>A new report from Brown Harris Stevens reveals that more than one-third of Manhattan condos sold between July 2024 and June 2025 were sold for less than their purchase price. The median price per square foot for these properties has remained largely flat over the past decade, a stark contrast to the significant price increases seen in most of the country. When factoring in inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual share of unprofitable sales is likely even higher. The luxury market, particularly apartments sold for over $10 million, was the exception, consistently yielding profits for sellers. (not investment advice)</p>
