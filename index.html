            <p>A Gaza hospital, Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, was reportedly hit by an Israeli air strike, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Witnesses claimed the strike severely damaged the intensive care and surgery departments, causing patients and staff to flee. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that the hospital housed a "command and control center used by Hamas" and that they took measures to mitigate harm to civilians. A local journalist reported receiving a phone call from the IDF, urging immediate evacuation of the hospital, recalling the 2023 incident at the same hospital, where hundreds died in an attack.

            <p>Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is actively supporting a recall campaign aimed at unseating opposition lawmakers in an effort to regain control of the legislature. The DPP's move is driven by frustration with the opposition's dominance in the legislature, which has led to legislative gridlock. Analysts warn that the campaign could deepen partisan divisions and political instability, particularly as Taiwan faces increased pressure from Beijing. The DPP needs to unseat and replace at least six district-based KMT legislators to reclaim a working majority. Optimism score: 50</p>

            <p>The article discusses the implications of Donald Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on the UK, arguing that Britain should prioritize closer ties with the EU rather than attempting to "cosy up" to Trump. It highlights the historical distrust between Europe and the US, pointing to the creation of the European Monetary System in the 1970s as a response to American economic policies. The author suggests that Trump's actions are causing even greater distrust and that the UK's economic interests require abandoning self-imposed red lines regarding rejoining the customs union and single market. Paul Krugman notes that EU tariffs on US goods are minimal, further undermining the rationale for the trade war. Optimism score: 45</p>
