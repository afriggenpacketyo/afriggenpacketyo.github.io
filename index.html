          <h2>UK Economy Shows Stronger Than Expected Growth in First Quarter</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced a 0.7% expansion in the first three months of the year, surpassing analyst expectations of 0.6%, according to recent data from the Office for National Statistics. The services sector was the primary driver of this growth, with significant contributions from production as well. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the UK's economic performance relative to other major economies, some analysts cautioned that this growth rate may not be sustainable due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes, with some economists feeling 'quite cheered' by the figures. Businesses are adopting varied strategies to cope with the changing economic landscape, including absorbing tariffs to maintain stable pricing in the US market.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has given the green light to a $433 million chip joint venture involving Apple supplier Foxconn and HCL Group, aiming to bolster India's semiconductor industry. The plant, located in Uttar Pradesh, is slated to begin operations by 2027 and will manufacture display driver chips for various electronic devices, with a capacity of 20,000 wafers per month. This move aligns with the trend of Apple suppliers diversifying their manufacturing bases from China to India amidst ongoing trade tensions. India's 'Semiconductor Mission' seeks to establish a robust chip and display ecosystem within the country, with this joint venture marking the sixth semiconductor unit under the plan.</p>

          <p>A European Union trade official has stated that the EU is not interested in reviving the stalled Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) with China, citing a "steady deterioration" in trade ties over the past two decades due to increasing business barriers. Despite lobbying efforts from Chinese officials to resume talks, the EU's stance remains firm following the European Parliament's decision to delay ratification in 2021 due to human rights concerns in Xinjiang. While there have been recent signs of thawing relations, including the lifting of Chinese sanctions on some members of the European Parliament, the EU's trade priorities appear to be shifting away from the investment agreement.</p>

          <p>Germany's foreign minister has announced that Berlin is prepared to support the United States' call for NATO member states to increase their defense spending to 5% of GDP. This commitment comes as NATO members are currently obligated to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense, a target that many countries have yet to meet. While some nations view the 5% target as unrealistic, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte suggested a compromise involving increased military spending alongside investments in defense-related infrastructure. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has also declared intentions to reinvest in Germany's armed forces to create the strongest army in Europe.</p>

Aina contends that Anthony Elanga was "miles offside" during the play's build-up, but the flag was not raised until after the incident due to a protocol introduced in 2020.</p>

According to a former Secret Service agent, these incidents negatively impact the cruise industry, deterring potential customers. The expert noted that the high concentration of people and the presence of alcohol can exacerbate the likelihood of criminal activity on cruises.

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of its rice stockpile to roughly 600,000 tons in an effort to control rising rice prices amid a supply shortfall. This potential release, which includes 300,000 tons over three months, would supplement the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The government's stockpile would then decrease to around 300,000 tons, which is about a third of the appropriate reserve level, raising concerns about future responses to poor harvests.

          <p>President Trump's acceptance of a $400 million Boeing 747-8 from the Qatari royal family has sparked controversy and raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. Critics across the political spectrum have criticized the gift, particularly given Trump's previous accusations against Qatar for financing terrorist groups. The scandal has drawn attention to the Trump family's broader exploitation of the presidency for personal enrichment, including cryptocurrency ventures and real estate deals in the Middle East. While Trump defends the gift as a cost-saving measure for taxpayers, critics argue it underscores the extent to which he is leveraging his position for financial gain.</p>

          <p>Three Māori MPs in New Zealand are facing potential suspension from parliament for performing a haka in protest during a legislative session last year. The parliamentary committee deemed the haka, which was performed in response to a controversial bill redefining the country's founding treaty, as potentially "intimidating" to other lawmakers. The Māori Party has criticized the proposed suspensions as a "warning shot" against dissent, while Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters condemned the MPs for flouting rules and intimidating others. The suspensions are scheduled for a vote on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>A baby spider monkey and two rattlesnakes were discovered at the residence of a suspect arrested for methamphetamine possession in Vallejo, California. Solano County Sheriff’s Deputies initially stopped 50-year-old Clifford Vincenty during a traffic stop and found half a pound of methamphetamine in his vehicle. A subsequent search of Vincenty's home revealed an additional pound of methamphetamine, cash, and the exotic animals. Animal Control safely removed the animals, and the spider monkey, named Violeta, was placed in the Oakland Zoo, highlighting the issue of wildlife trafficking and the demand for exotic animals as pets.</p>

Two British academics made the finding, noting that it is one of only seven such documents from that date still in existence. The manuscript, purchased for $27.50 after World War II, has been authenticated through ultraviolet photography and spectral imaging.

          <p>A group of 21 economies, including the U.S. and China, is cautioning that global growth is at risk of a sharp slowdown due to tariff tensions and policy uncertainty. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forecasts growth to drop to 2.6% in 2025, from 3.6% in the prior year. The Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit noted that the uncertainty was weighing on business confidence, leading many firms to delay investments and new product launches until the situation turned "more predictable."

          <p>Alabama lawmakers have approved legislation providing additional legal protections for police officers, setting legal standards for the use of force and providing for an immunity hearing. Republicans argue the bill offers clarity and support for officers making split-second decisions, while Democrats fear it could embolden misconduct and disproportionately affect Black people. The bill states that an officer “shall be justified” in the use of physical force as long as it is not constitutionally excessive force or “recklessly” outside of the officer’s discretionary authority. The bill now goes to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, who said she will sign it into law.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, propelled by a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is projected to moderate in the coming years, although potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not expected to be a major contributing factor. The IMF notes that most Danish drug products are not produced in the country nor cross its borders, limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs. Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system, where intellectual property drives the value of medicines manufactured in other countries. The Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk's increased demand for its diabetes and weight loss medications has been a significant growth driver.</p>
