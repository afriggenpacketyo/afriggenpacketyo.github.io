          <p>UK newspaper headlines report a "judgement day" for Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner concerning stamp duty underpayment, with calls for her resignation. Separately, Nadine Dorries' defection from the Conservative Party to Reform UK is described as a "seismic blow," boosting Nigel Farage and potentially leading to more Conservative defections. The political landscape is seen as "trembling" ahead of an election. Additionally, there are numerous tributes to iconic fashion designer Giorgio Armani, who is lauded as a pioneer and the "man who invented power dressing."</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court's ruling, allowing Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility in the Everglades to remain operational. The 2-1 decision concluded that state and federal officials are likely to prove the site is not subject to federal environmental reviews, as it is state-operated without federal reimbursement. Environmental groups and a Native American tribe had challenged the facility on environmental grounds. The Department of Homeland Security and Governor Ron DeSantis lauded the ruling, emphasizing continued immigration enforcement, while critics vowed to continue their legal fight.</p>

          <p>PBS is cutting approximately 15% of its workforce, notifying 34 staffers of position eliminations, due to the complete elimination of federal funding for public broadcasting by Congress, effective October 1. This, combined with the loss of a federal grant and other vacant positions, results in over 100 job losses and a 21% revenue hit for PBS. CEO Paula Kerger stated that all facets of PBS would be affected, forcing difficult choices across the system. NPR's CEO also announced budget reductions to support affected stations, with an estimated 70-80 public radio stations potentially facing closure.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have formally committed to providing postwar security guarantees for Ukraine, including a "reassurance force" on land, sea, and air to prevent future aggression. This development follows a summit aimed at securing US backing for such guarantees, with US contributions expected to be finalized soon. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the move as a significant step, while the Kremlin dismissed the guarantees as unsuitable. The coalition's efforts also include a breakthrough in European countries purchasing US arms for Ukraine, with a recent delivery of long-range cruise missiles.</p>

Trump has reportedly been exploring options to encourage other candidates to withdraw, aiming for a one-on-one race against Mamdani, whom he called a "communist." Mamdani, in turn, criticized Trump for cutting SNAP benefits to fund tax cuts. The race, currently a four-way contest, is generating significant political maneuvering and White House interest.</p>

As part of the agreement, Japan pledged $550 billion in investments in US projects and committed to increased purchases of American agricultural products, commercial aircraft, and defense equipment. The deal, which also offers "breakthrough openings" in various sectors, is expected to retroactively apply lower tariffs. However, the article highlights the significant financial hit Trump's tariffs have had on major auto manufacturers like Toyota, Ford, and GM.

          <p>Two armed Venezuelan F-16 fighter jets flew near the USS Jason Dunham, a US Navy guided-missile destroyer, in international waters, an act described by Defense Department officials as a "highly provocative move" and a "show of force." The Pentagon stated this action was intended to interfere with US counter-narcotics and counter-terror operations in the Caribbean. This incident escalates tensions between the US and Venezuela, particularly after President Trump's recent pledge to crack down on drug cartels and increased rewards for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's arrest. Venezuela has denied US allegations and deployed its own vessels to patrol its coastline.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, stating it cost taxpayers nearly $120 million. Newsom's office detailed expenses for food, pay, and travel for the more than 4,200 soldiers and 700 marines deployed. A judge recently ruled this deployment illegal, violating the Posse Comitatus Act by using the military for civilian law enforcement. Newsom, who had previously sued over the deployment, labeled it "waste, fraud and abuse" and a step towards authoritarianism, highlighting its financial and societal costs.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on three Palestinian human rights organizations—the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and Al-Haq—for requesting the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigate Israel for alleged genocide in Gaza. These groups had asked the ICC in November 2023 to examine Israeli air strikes, the siege of Gaza, and population displacement. The sanctions follow previous Trump administration actions against ICC judges and its chief prosecutor over Israeli arrest warrants and a case concerning US troops in Afghanistan. This comes as a major academic association of genocide scholars concluded legal criteria were met for Israel committing genocide.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Metropolitan Division officers are now assisting the California Highway Patrol (CHP) in providing security for former Vice President Kamala Harris, following President Trump's revocation of her Secret Service protection. This temporary arrangement, funded by the city, aims to prevent a security lapse until Harris hires her own team. The move has drawn criticism from the LAPD union, arguing that city taxpayers should not bear the cost for a wealthy individual. Governor Gavin Newsom's office condemned Trump's action as "erratic, vindictive political impulses" that endanger Harris, whose book tour is set to begin next month.</p>

While acknowledging their consumer appeal for automating tasks like booking flights, Arora emphasized that businesses would require stringent credential and enterprise security measures. He predicted that such browsers, despite significant investment by major tech companies, would not be permitted in enterprise environments within 24 months unless these controls are integrated. Arora highlighted his company's acquisition of CyberArk to enhance identity security, citing credential theft as a primary cause of breaches and underscoring the need to protect privileged information.</p>

Newsom's office acknowledged the edit, stating it was intended to mock the president.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers were swept in a three-game series by the last-place Pittsburgh Pirates, a performance described as "frustrating" and "embarrassing" by veteran infielder Miguel Rojas. The team's inconsistent play and inability to capitalize on opportunities, even against weaker opponents, have led to mounting pressure and a significant slide since July. Despite facing dominant pitching from Paul Skenes in the final game, the Dodgers' overall struggles are a concern with only 22 games remaining. The team now holds a narrow two-game lead in their division and risks losing a top-two playoff score, prompting calls for renewed joy and focus.</p>

          <p>A US federal appeals court upheld an injunction preventing the State Department from enforcing President Donald Trump's policy directive that restricts transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports reflecting their gender identities. Trump's executive order, signed upon his return to office, aimed to recognize only male and female biological genders, reversing a previous Biden administration policy that allowed an "X" sex indicator. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued, arguing the policy reflected "unconstitutional animus" and violated rights.

This initiative aims to broaden the digital currency's utility beyond its current use cases since its 2019 launch. Analysts suggest that employing the digital yuan could enhance the traceability and transparency of often opaque payment relationships, allowing funds to reach the end of the payment chain directly. This move could significantly improve real-time visibility and control over economic transactions, potentially addressing long-standing issues of debt default. (not investment advice)</p>
