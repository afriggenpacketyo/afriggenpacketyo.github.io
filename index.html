          <p>President Trump, in a commencement address at West Point, emphasized a foreign policy focused on peace and partnership, even with countries holding profound differences. He criticized past political leaders for misusing the military in unintended missions and asserted his commitment to core national interests. Trump touted his "Golden Age" agenda and contrasted military service with careers in business, highlighting the honor and sacrifice of the graduating cadets. He stated that the choice to serve in the military was "better" than pursuing high-paying careers on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley.</p>

          <p>North Korea has detained shipyard officials, including the chief engineer, following a failed launch of a new warship that resulted in damage to the vessel. Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un reportedly expressed dismay over the incident, blaming officials for carelessness and unscientific practices.

          <p>Venezuelans are participating in elections for lawmakers and governors, but the main opposition is urging a boycott, citing government repression and a lack of electoral fairness. The vote is the first major electoral event since last year's presidential election, which was marred by fraud allegations. Opposition leaders, like Maria Corina Machado, view the elections as a "parody" to legitimize President Maduro's rule, while a smaller faction advocates for participation to prevent further consolidation of power by the ruling party. In the lead-up to the vote, dozens of government critics were detained, further escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>Rachel Feintzeig discusses her obsession with the HBO series "The Last of Us," despite its disturbing content, arguing that it provides a distraction from real-world anxieties. She reflects on how horror movies helped her cope with grief after a miscarriage, offering a temporary escape from personal struggles. The author finds that immersing herself in fictional apocalypses allows her to confront fears in a controlled environment, reminding herself that the horrors are not real. Ultimately, the author acknowledges the need for escapism in the face of relentless real-world challenges.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in rice prices under the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. This expectation follows the dismissal of his predecessor due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice. The poll also indicates that 44.7% believe rice prices should be reduced to below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a target lower than the one pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet has seen a slight increase in the wake of these developments.</p>

The service is now the responsibility of the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), which will oversee all railway infrastructure.

The government established a compensation fund for subpostmasters wrongly prosecuted due to the faulty Horizon IT system, but progress has been slow.

He explained that only a small percentage of infected individuals develop severe symptoms, and no human cases of locally-acquired West Nile Virus have been reported in the UK to date.

          <p>Michelle Renee, who was kidnapped and forced to rob a bank to save her daughter, recounts how she was falsely painted as a criminal during the trial of her abductors. Despite overwhelming evidence of her innocence, the defense attacked her credibility, bringing up her past as a stripper and inconsistencies in her resume. They also questioned her maternal instincts, implying she was in on the plot. The experience left Renee feeling like she was the one on trial, even though she was the victim of a horrific crime. In a 2020 parole hearing, Christopher Butler admitted Renee had nothing to do with the planning or execution of the crime.</p>

The cost-of-living pressures and business concerns over tax policies are factors contributing to his unpopularity.
