He criticized the current administration's stance that it is safe for Afghans to return, disagreeing with this notion, and urged lawmakers to raise the cap on Special Immigrant Visas to allow for the evacuation and care of those who fought alongside the United States.</p>

Despite the ongoing violence, Russia and Ukraine completed a major prisoner exchange involving 303 people from each side, marking the largest swap of the war, but Ukraine's President Zelensky stated that America's silence encourages Putin.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, killed at least seven children of a local doctor, Alaa al-Najjar, with two more missing and presumed dead, according to Gaza officials and the family. The doctor's husband, Hamdi al-Najjar, remains in critical condition, while one other child was injured, prompting an investigation by the Israeli military to determine if "uninvolved civilians were harmed." The strike is part of a renewed round of fighting between Israel and Hamas, exacerbating the already immense civilian toll in Gaza.</p>

While ordinary soldiers face indefinite deployments and high casualties, Kaskad offers a safer and more politically advantageous path to military service.</p>

Harvard's international students comprise about 27% of the student body and are typically ineligible for federal financial aid.</p>
