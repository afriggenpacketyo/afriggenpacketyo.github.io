          <p>Donald Trump's social media post claiming he persuaded Coca-Cola to use real cane sugar in the U.S. caused shares of high fructose corn syrup producer Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) to fall significantly. Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, stating they would share details on new product innovations soon. The Corn Refiners Association warned the move could cost American jobs and increase foreign sugar imports, while ADM's stock saw a premarket drop of nearly 3%. This development comes after months of gains for ADM's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party is assessing comments made by MP Diane Abbott, who recently stated she does not regret a 2023 letter that led to her suspension. In the letter and a new interview, she differentiated between racism based on skin color and other forms of prejudice, which drew criticism and was labeled antisemitic by party leader Keir Starmer. Despite apologizing and being reinstated, her recent remarks have reopened the controversy, prompting the party to review them under its rules and procedures. Abbott maintains she was highlighting the different ways racism is experienced.</p>

          <p>PIM Brands, the maker of Welch's Fruit Snacks, has announced it will remove artificial dyes like Red 40 and Blue 1 from its products, starting with popular flavors ahead of the back-to-school season. The company will replace them with colors from natural sources, aiming to complete this transition across its entire portfolio by early 2026. This move aligns with a broader industry trend and a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services initiative to eliminate synthetic dyes from food. Health concerns have linked some artificial dyes to hyperactivity in children.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency theft has dramatically increased in the first half of 2025, with $2.17 billion stolen from services, already surpassing the total for all of 2024. A report by Chainalysis highlights a major hack on the Bybit exchange and a disturbing rise in physical attacks, where criminals use violence and kidnapping to access individuals' crypto wallets. These personal wallet attacks now account for over 23% of all crypto thefts. Experts attribute the trend to increased crypto adoption and price appreciation, making both platforms and individuals more valuable targets for criminals.</p>

Proponents, however, point to Rwanda as a success story, where an open-door policy boosted tourism revenue and security was managed through integrated border systems.

          <p>NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher warned that proposed federal funding cuts to public broadcasting could endanger public safety, as many local stations are integral to state emergency alert systems. The warning came as the Senate passed a rescissions package cutting $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds 1,500 local stations. The legislation, pushed by President Trump over allegations of bias, could force smaller rural stations that rely heavily on federal funds to reduce services or close entirely, impacting communities that depend on them for vital information.

          <p>The U.S. has announced new trade deals with Vietnam and Indonesia that lower standard tariffs but impose steep 40% levies on "transshipped" goods, raising alarm in Southeast Asia. This move is seen as an effort to curb China's practice of re-routing exports through neighboring countries to evade U.S. tariffs. The economic impact on the region depends heavily on how Washington defines transshipment; a broad definition could cripple supply chains that rely on Chinese components. While the policy aims to decouple economies from China, it also risks creating diplomatic friction between Beijing and its Southeast Asian neighbors. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece highlights the absurdity of labeling people as criminals based on suspicion alone, especially when they are being held in a facility for the "worst of the worst."</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Claim That Sunscreen Increases Skin Cancer Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 07:26:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article fact-checks a false claim circulating on social media that sunscreen use increases the risk of skin cancer. Experts and health departments confirm there is no scientific evidence for this assertion; in fact, UV radiation is the main cause of melanoma, and sunscreen helps protect against it. The rise in skin cancer diagnoses alongside increased sunscreen sales is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, greater awareness, and people spending more time in the sun. The article clarifies that while countries like Australia have high sunscreen use and high skin cancer rates, this correlation does not imply causation.</p>

          <p>A liquor store owner in rural Utah has closed her shop rather than sign a new state contract that she says would have made her business unprofitable. The new contract from the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Services (DABS) would have forced her to cover $24,000 in credit card fees, decimating her earnings. She is one of several operators suing the state, arguing they are misclassified as independent contractors instead of employees. The closure has a ripple effect on the local community, forcing a nearby bar owner to drive 50 miles to restock inventory.</p>

          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four and a half hours, smartphone addiction is a growing public health concern linked to anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. This article outlines several science-backed methods to reduce problematic usage, as breaking the habit can be as difficult as quitting smoking. Recommended strategies include creating physical distance from the phone, reducing notifications, setting the screen to grayscale, and using self-control apps. Experts suggest combining multiple behavioral "nudge" techniques and, for severe cases, seeking professional help through therapies like CBT to address the root causes of the addiction.</p>

          <p>Russian customs officials, in a joint operation with the FSB security service, seized 1,800 pounds of cocaine from a shipment of bananas, marking the country's largest bust of Latin American drugs this year. The cocaine, valued at over $153 million, was pressed into briquettes labeled with a luxury fashion brand logo and hidden in a secret compartment. The operation was initiated based on a tip from foreign colleagues about a South American criminal group's smuggling plans. This seizure is part of a global trend where traffickers increasingly use banana shipments to conceal large quantities of cocaine.</p>

          <p>The United States has funded the construction of a new naval logistics facility at Oyster Bay in the Philippines, a move that could enhance Manila's maritime capabilities in the disputed South China Sea. The facility will provide repair and maintenance for small Philippine military watercraft, directly strengthening their ability to operate in the region. While the U.S. embassy stated it is "not a military base," analysts suggest it strengthens the Philippines' hand in confrontations with China. The development is also seen as potentially paving the way for shared use of Philippine naval facilities by the U.S. military.</p>

          <p>At Donald Trump's urging, Texas Republicans are set to redraw the state's congressional map in a bid to gain up to five more seats for their party in the U.S. House. This mid-decade redistricting is a risky political gamble, as it would require spreading Republican voters more thinly, potentially making some GOP-held districts more competitive. Critics argue the move is an undemocratic effort to further dilute the voting power of the state's growing non-white population, who are already disadvantaged by the current maps. The push comes as the state is still recovering from devastating floods.</p>

          <p>For decades, Kentucky resident Russ Miller, known as the "River Cowboy," has dedicated himself to cleaning thousands of discarded tires from the state's rivers. Miller, who co-founded the cleanup group Friends of Red River, was inspired to act after seeing the waterways choked with trash. Millions of the nearly 300 million tires discarded in the U.S. each year end up illegally dumped, posing an environmental hazard as they leach toxic chemicals. Miller's grassroots efforts have removed an estimated 3,000-4,000 tires and inspired a new generation of volunteers to tackle the persistent problem of illegal dumping in Kentucky.</p>

          <p>This article explores the evolution and growing appeal of foldable smartphones, like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold and Flip series, suggesting they represent a meaningful innovation in a stagnant market. The author notes that these devices, reminiscent of old flip phones, offer adaptability by providing a small screen for basic tasks and a larger, tablet-like screen for more immersive use. While standalone AI gadgets have so far failed to replace the smartphone, foldables provide a bridge to the future, offering users more control over their screen time. The trend indicates the smartphone will remain our primary device, but in new forms.</p>
