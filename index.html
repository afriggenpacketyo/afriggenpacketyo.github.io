          <p>The Trump administration fired Shira Perlmutter, the director of the U.S. Copyright Office, after she and her office released a report expressing concerns about AI's use of copyrighted materials. The report questioned the amount of data AI developers need and its effect on a model's capabilities. Representative Joe Morelle suggested the firing was due to Perlmutter's refusal to support Elon Musk's AI data mining efforts. The U.S. Copyright Office, a department of the Library of Congress, registers copyright claims and administers copyright law, and the firing has sparked controversy regarding intellectual property rights and AI development.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for "direct talks" with Ukraine, proposing they begin on May 15 in Istanbul, Turkey, aiming to "remove the root causes of the conflict." This comes after European leaders urged Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire. Putin stated he would discuss details with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

          <p>As conflict escalated between India and Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, the Trump administration grew concerned about a potential nuclear war. Despite initial reluctance, Vice President JD Vance and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio intervened after Pakistani and Indian Air Forces engaged in dogfights and explosions hit a key Pakistani air base near its nuclear command. Vance contacted Prime Minister Modi, while Rubio spoke with General Munir of the Pakistani army, leading to a cease-fire brokered by President Trump. The intervention highlights the U.S.'s role in preventing nuclear conflict and the delicate balance of power in the region.</p>

Ralston, a 24-year-old mother, was found strangled in her car in 1977. The case went cold due to lack of leads, but a thumbprint found on a cigarette carton at the crime scene matched Sims through an upgraded FBI database. Sims, who had a prior conviction for attempted murder, is being held without bail and is scheduled for a court date in August.</p>
