          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading after announcing a 250 billion yen share buyback and exceeding operating income estimates, although operating income decreased by 11% compared to the previous year. The company also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, which will be listed this year and classified as a discontinued operation. While Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was unenthusiastic, the company clarified that the estimated tariff impact did not reflect the recent trade deal between the U.S. and China. Sony has expanded from consumer electronics to include movies, music, and gaming consoles like the PlayStation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ye, also known as Kanye West, released an antisemitic song praising Hitler, sparking controversy and legal concerns, particularly in Germany where Nazi symbols and slogans are prohibited. While the song was quickly banned on platforms like Spotify and YouTube, it remains accessible on X, highlighting the challenges of removing offensive content online. Germany's strict laws against hate speech make the song illegal, punishable by imprisonment or fines, contrasting with the U.S. where freedom of speech protects even hate speech.

          <p>British businesses are warning the UK government that tightening immigration rules will lead to labor shortages, particularly in sectors like health and social care. The government plans to cut migration by raising English-language and skills requirements, and increasing the time migrants must live in the UK before applying to stay indefinitely. Businesses fear that Brits cannot or will not fill the gap, as recruiting British workers, especially in social care, is already a struggle. Care England warns the plans could have serious consequences for a sector already under immense pressure with 131,000 vacancies.</p>

The plan involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives.

          <p>British astronaut Rosemary Coogan is undergoing rigorous training at NASA's Johnson Space Center, including spacewalk simulations in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory. The training covers all aspects of space travel, from using the onboard toilet to performing complex repairs on a replica of the International Space Station. ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.</p>

          <p>Ukrainians living in Poland are reporting a significant increase in anti-Ukrainian sentiment, including abuse on public transport, bullying in schools, and xenophobic material online. This comes after an initial outpouring of compassion following the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The rise in abuse is attributed to a polarizing presidential election campaign and a change in public attitudes. Research indicates a decline in the percentage of Poles in favor of accepting Ukrainian refugees.</p>

          <p>Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, testified in the sex-trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean Combs, detailing drug-fueled sex sessions with male prostitutes that she said left her feeling "disgusting" and "humiliated." Ventura described Combs' alleged orchestration of the events, including dictating her appearance and sex acts. She stated she stayed in the relationship to keep Combs happy, despite the increasingly abusive nature of their interactions. Ventura's testimony is vital to the prosecution's case, as she had previously accused Combs of sexual assault and years of physical abuse in a 2023 lawsuit that was quickly settled.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reduced most of their recent tariffs on each other's imports and suspended part of the reciprocal duties for 90 days, following high-level trade talks in Switzerland. The U.S. reduced its tariffs on Chinese goods to 30 percent from 145 percent, while China lowered its retaliatory tariffs on the United States to 10 percent from 125 percent. Both countries have agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to discuss issues of mutual concern. The U.S., however, has decided to retain 10 percent of a 34 percent tariff hike on all Chinese imports introduced as part of its "reciprocal" scheme in early April.</p>

          <p>Chimpanzees in Uganda have been observed using medicinal plants to treat open wounds and other injuries, according to a study by University of Oxford scientists. Researchers filmed and recorded instances of the animals using plants for first aid, both on themselves and occasionally on each other. The study builds on previous findings that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate, and adds to evidence that primates use natural medicines to stay healthy in the wild. The researchers also found records of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of other animals they weren't related to, adding to the evidence that wild chimpanzees have the capacity for empathy.</p>

The move comes despite efforts in the past year to improve relations between the two countries after a long period of tension, including a deadly military clash in the Galwan Valley in 2020.</p>
