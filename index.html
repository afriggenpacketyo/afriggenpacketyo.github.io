          <p>China's recent Victory Day parade was used by President Xi Jinping to project a vision of a new world order while warning that the globe is at a crossroads between peace and war. The event highlighted lingering historical wounds, particularly with Japan, as concerns grow over rising nationalism and a perceived lack of remorse for wartime actions. The article notes that both China and Russia are challenging Western-centric historical narratives of World War II, positioning themselves as key victors against fascism. This commemoration underscores China's ambition to assert its leadership on the world stage.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado has left three students in critical condition, one of whom has been identified by law enforcement as the suspect. The incident occurred around noon, prompting a massive police response and a lockdown of the school and a nearby elementary school. All three injured students were transported to a local Level 1 Trauma Center with gunshot wounds. The motive for the shooting is currently unknown as authorities continue their investigation at the now-secured scene.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined an emergency request from South Carolina officials, allowing a transgender male student to continue using the boys' restroom at his school. The decision lets a lower court's injunction stand while the legal challenge against a state policy proceeds. The state's rule prohibits transgender students from using facilities that align with their gender identity. While not a ruling on the merits of the case, the court's order is a temporary victory for transgender rights advocates, with Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissenting from the decision.</p>

          <p>NASA has confirmed it has taken new measures to restrict access for Chinese citizens, including those with U.S. visas, to its facilities and data systems. The move, which affects contractors, graduate students, and visiting scientists, is aimed at enhancing physical and cybersecurity. This policy change comes amid a growing space race between the two nations, with both countries planning crewed missions to the moon in the coming years. The action reflects escalating tensions and a more competitive stance from the U.S. in the aerospace and technology sectors.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University is ongoing, with the gunman still at large. Initial reports of a suspect being in custody were later corrected by university officials, who clarified that the individual had been released. The shooting occurred approximately 20 minutes into Kirk's speech, with a single shot fired from about 200 yards away. The campus was placed on lockdown as local and university police coordinated the response and investigation into the high-profile killing.</p>

          <p>This article examines President Trump's increasing use of military and federal law enforcement, arguing it reflects a pattern of authoritarian behavior that undermines democratic norms. It discusses the deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., as a form of militarized policing that raises constitutional questions. The analysis also touches on foreign policy actions, such as raids on allied companies and covert operations, suggesting they are driven by ego rather than strategic interest. The piece warns that such actions could set dangerous precedents for future administrations and normalize the use of force for political ends.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The typical peak season for freight shipments into the U.S. ahead of the holidays has failed to materialize this year, with trade slowing to a crawl. Imports from China have seen a sustained 27% year-over-year decline for three consecutive weeks, and overall ocean freight bookings are flat. The slowdown is attributed to the U.S.-China trade war, which prompted retailers to front-load inventory earlier in the year, and a subsequent decrease in new orders. Key product segments like furniture, toys, and electronics have seen the largest reductions, signaling a potentially weak outlook for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent immigration raid on a Hyundai electric-car plant in rural Georgia is being analyzed as a significant strategic misstep. The operation, which was the largest worksite raid in Homeland Security's history, resulted in the arrest of 475 foreign workers, mostly South Korean nationals. The article suggests that targeting a major foreign investment in a Republican-leaning area undermines the administration's own economic goals. This action appears to conflict with efforts to encourage foreign companies to build manufacturing facilities and create jobs in the United States.</p>

          <p>A plan to build a 50-home gated community on the shore of Big Bear Lake has been approved by San Bernardino County supervisors, sparking opposition from conservation advocates. The development, known as Moon Camp, is located less than a mile from the nest of Jackie and Shadow, a pair of bald eagles with a large online following. Opponents from the nonprofit Friends of Big Bear Valley argue the construction and increased human activity will disrupt a prime foraging habitat for the eagles and other local wildlife. The group has vowed to continue its fight to stop the project.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article examines the controversy surrounding the slogan "Never again," sparked by a social media post from the Holocaust Museum LA that applied the sentiment universally. The author traces the phrase's complex history, from its use by anti-fascist prisoners at Buchenwald to its adoption by Zionist and Jewish nationalist movements. The piece argues that the fierce backlash against the museum's universalist message reflects a modern trend of recasting the slogan as an exclusive property of Jewish suffering. This shift is often used to defend Israeli state actions and reject solidarity with other persecuted groups.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal crash of an Air India flight in June, which killed 241 of the 242 people on board, the airline's CEO stated the carrier is embracing a "new normal" with an enhanced focus on safety. The preliminary investigation into the crash of the Boeing Dreamliner pointed to pilot confusion over fuel cutoff switches. While the full investigation is ongoing, the airline has conducted a "significant safety pause" to reinforce its procedures. The CEO affirmed this renewed safety culture is proceeding alongside the carrier's massive modernization and fleet expansion efforts.</p>

          <p>As the mortgage market cools and the Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts, homeowners and buyers may be able to secure interest rates below 6%. This article outlines several strategies, including considering adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently average just under 6% for a 7/1 ARM. Diligently shopping around among different lenders can also yield significantly lower-than-average rates. Finally, strategically timing the market around Federal Reserve announcements could provide small windows of opportunity for locking in a more favorable rate. (not investment advice)</p>

The actions by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu test the limits of U.S. influence over its allies and adversaries.

John Cowen, 31, allegedly ran across the room and lunged at Thomas Carey with a knife, reportedly because he "felt cheated" that other competitors used an online app to practice. The victim was treated for a stab wound to his bicep. A judge has ruled Cowen, a Cambridge maths graduate, unfit to stand trial due to being "seriously mentally unwell," and a jury was tasked only with determining the facts of the incident.</p>

The report highlights the deep economic integration between the two nations, with bilateral commerce growing nearly fivefold over the past two decades. While this trade has generated a significant surplus for Brazil, the study also warns of the risks of over-reliance on a single partner. The majority of Brazil's exports to China are concentrated in just three commodities: soybeans, iron ore, and oil.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a federal judge's ruling that temporarily blocked the firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had previously granted an injunction, stating that Cook's removal would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act and that maintaining the Fed's independence was in the public's interest. President Trump moved to fire Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a governor, based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. The legal battle is seen as part of a broader effort by the president to exert influence over the central bank's decisions.</p>

The plaintiffs assert their dismissals were unlawful and have degraded national security by removing experienced leaders.
