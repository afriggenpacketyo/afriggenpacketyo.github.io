        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least 42 Palestinians were killed in Gaza by Israeli military actions, including some who were waiting for aid trucks. The violence occurred as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have reportedly stalled, with both the U.S. and Israeli delegations being recalled from talks. The humanitarian situation is dire, with the UN warning of famine and reports of children, like a 5-month-old infant, dying from severe malnutrition. International pressure is mounting on Israel to alleviate the crisis, though aid delivery remains heavily restricted.</p>

          <p>Director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed that a sequel to the 2002 hit film 'Bend It Like Beckham' is in development. Speaking to the BBC, Chadha stated that the recent success of women's football, particularly England's Lionesses, makes it an ideal time to revisit the characters. She is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and the FIFA Women's World Cup. Chadha hopes to reunite the original cast, including Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, for what could be another film or a television series.</p>

          <h2>USAID Analysis Finds No Evidence of Widespread Hamas Aid Diversion in Gaza</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:29:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A USAID analysis of over 150 incidents found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in Gaza, challenging claims made by the Trump administration. The report examined incidents between October 2023 and May 2024, prior to the U.S. agency ceasing its independent operations. The findings have been strongly contested by both the Israel Defense Forces and the U.S. State Department, who maintain that significant looting and diversion of aid by Hamas occurs, though they have not provided public evidence to support these widespread claims.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Texas have developed a non-invasive wearable sensor that continuously monitors a person's hydration levels. The device uses bioimpedance, sending a small electrical current through the arm to measure tissue hydration, and transmits the data to a smartphone. This technology could provide a real-time, accessible alternative to traditional methods like blood or urine tests. The creators believe it has significant potential for athletes, individuals with chronic health conditions, and anyone at risk of dehydration, especially in extreme heat.</p>

          <p>India demonstrated strong resistance against England on the fourth day of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, closing on 174-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After losing two early wickets, an unbroken partnership between Shubman Gill (78) and KL Rahul (87) frustrated the English attack. Earlier, England captain Ben Stokes scored his first century in over two years, a knock of 141 that helped his team to a formidable total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's determined performance has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this analysis, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen argues that airdropping aid into Gaza is an act of desperation that will not solve the growing hunger crisis. Drawing on his experiences covering past conflicts in Iraq and Bosnia, he describes airdrops as a crude, inefficient, and potentially dangerous process that delivers far less aid than truck convoys. He points out that pallets can land in dangerous areas or on top of shelters, and the small amount of aid can incite violent competition among starving people. The article concludes that only a ceasefire and unrestricted ground access can truly address the man-made starvation.</p>

The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the legislative majority it lost in the last election. For the recall to succeed, it required support from over a quarter of eligible voters with more 'yes' votes than 'no' votes, a threshold that was not met.

          <p>The question of how much coffee is healthy remains complex, with experts advising that the right amount depends on the individual. Recent studies have linked daily coffee consumption to benefits like healthy aging and improved heart health, while others show risks for those with hypertension or potential links to dementia. Most health experts, including the FDA, recommend a general limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, equivalent to about four cups of coffee. They stress the importance of moderation and being mindful of personal tolerance and effects on sleep or anxiety.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan men who were expelled by the U.S. to El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison have been freed and are sharing accounts of horrific abuse. Lawyers for the men state they endured 'state-sanctioned torture,' including regular beatings, humiliation by guards, and inhumane living conditions with dirty water and constant light. Their release was part of a prisoner exchange deal between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments. These testimonies provide the first detailed inside look at the brutal conditions within the prison, which human rights groups have heavily criticized.</p>
