          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted raids across Los Angeles, resulting in numerous arrests and sparking widespread protests throughout the city. The raids targeted locations in Westlake, downtown L.A., and South L.A., leading to the arrest of over 100 individuals this week. Protests centered around the Federal Building in downtown L.A., with demonstrators alleging detainees were being held there. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported additional protests in Paramount, where federal law enforcement officers were conducting another operation, and Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West President David Huerta was arrested while protesting. The events drew criticism from local leaders and prompted responses from federal officials regarding immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offensive struggles continued as they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals 2-1 in a walk-off defeat. The Dodgers left 12 runners on base and failed to capitalize on opportunities with runners in scoring position, going hitless in 12 at-bats. Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a strong performance, pitching six scoreless innings with nine strikeouts, but the Dodgers' inability to drive in runs ultimately cost them the game. The Cardinals secured the win with a single off Dodgers reliever Ben Casparius in the ninth inning, adding to the team's woes as they prepare for a series against the San Diego Padres.</p>

Kenyan President William Ruto made a request for forgiveness from Tanzania amidst these allegations.

          <p>Charlotte Edwards, the new head coach of England's women's cricket team, began her tenure with a clean sweep over the West Indies in both T20 and one-day international matches. While this victory provides a positive start, it's important to note that England has historically dominated home bilateral series but struggled in major tournaments. The real test for Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt will come with tougher challenges, such as the upcoming series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. The question remains whether this "new" England team can perform under pressure when it truly matters.</p>

          <p>The feud between President Trump and Elon Musk has the potential to create new uncertainties and divisions within the Republican Party ahead of the midterm elections. Musk's criticisms of Trump's policies and his apparent departure from Trump's inner circle could undermine the party's efforts to pass key legislation. Some Republicans worry that Musk's social media presence and potential shift in political donations could negatively impact the party's chances in the upcoming elections.
