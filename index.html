        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shanghai-based AI startup MiniMax has introduced its first reasoning model, MiniMax-M1, designed to challenge DeepSeek's R1 model by using less than half the computing power for reasoning tasks involving 64,000 tokens or fewer. MiniMax claims that M1 matches the performance of leading global models from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic in areas such as mathematics, coding, and domain knowledge. The M1 model is built on the 456-billion-parameter MiniMax-Text-01 foundational model and employs a hybrid mixture-of-experts architecture to reduce compute costs, similar to DeepSeek's approach, while also using Lightning Attention to speed up training and reduce memory usage. This launch signifies the intensifying competition among Chinese tech companies to develop advanced AI reasoning models.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the U.S. fell by 0.9% in May, exceeding economists' expectations of a 0.6% drop, signaling a sharp pullback in consumer spending amid concerns about the economy. Declines were noted in gasoline sales, building materials, and auto sales, while online sales and furniture stores saw increases; Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that families are becoming more selective about their spending due to wariness of higher prices. Despite improved consumer sentiment surveys, the ongoing trade war and geopolitical tensions have contributed to consumer caution, leading to a slowdown in retail activity. This data point suggests a potential moderation in economic growth after a slow first quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener is introducing the 'No Secret Police Act' to ban law enforcement, including federal agents, from covering their faces during public interactions and require them to display identifying information. This move comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) increases arrests in California, leading to protests and civil unrest. DHS officials have criticized the proposal, arguing that it endangers ICE officers who are facing increased assaults and doxxing attempts. The debate highlights the tension between state and federal authority, immigration enforcement, and concerns about transparency and accountability in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The PGA Tour has announced Brian Rolapp, a top NFL executive, as its next CEO, succeeding Jay Monahan, who will step down at the end of 2026 after a decade in the role.

This transition comes amid ongoing discussions about a potential merger with Saudi-backed LIV Golf, which has overshadowed Monahan's efforts to secure investments and create equity opportunities for players.

          <p>Dame Louise Casey is advocating for a national inquiry into grooming gangs in England and Wales, following her report on group-based child sexual abuse. Casey urges openness and scrutiny from those giving evidence, with the aim of creating a "national reset" on the issue. She also addressed concerns about the ethnicity of perpetrators, emphasizing the need for calm and careful data analysis, noting that while child sexual exploitation suspects are disproportionately of Asian heritage, general child abuse is not. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has committed to implementing Casey's 12 recommendations, including reviewing convictions of victims and making ethnicity data collection mandatory.</p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures, including flight reductions and pausing aircraft retrofits, as weaker-than-expected travel demand makes achieving break-even operating margins in 2025 unlikely. CEO Joanna Geraghty informed staff that the airline is relying on borrowed cash and needs to find ways to increase revenue after a failed acquisition of Spirit Airlines. The carrier is also assessing its leadership team structure for greater efficiency, and had recently announced a new partnership with United Airlines. These measures indicate the ongoing challenges faced by airlines in navigating fluctuating travel demands and maintaining profitability.</p>

Boelter served on a state board with Hoffman for more than six years, and investigators are exploring whether the suspect knew Hoffman or Hortman personally.

          <p>The deployment of active-duty U.S. military forces in Los Angeles is a rare event, reminiscent of the 1992 riots, but parallels can be drawn to the period between 1957 and 1968 when the military patrolled U.S. soil on eight occasions. These deployments, primarily to enforce desegregation and quell riots, resulted in few fatalities due to military restraint, which was fostered by bipartisan consensus and clear rules of engagement. However, today's political climate lacks such consensus, and the current deployment of Marines without accompanying military police trained in crowd control is a departure from past practices. The article explores the historical context of these deployments, highlighting the importance of restraint and the potential dangers of blurring the lines between military and police roles.</p>

They recommend strategies for investing in gold, such as maintaining a long-term outlook, leasing out gold, and considering gold mining mutual funds.

          <p>The US Army showcased robot dogs during the 250th anniversary parade in Washington, highlighting the military's pursuit of technological superiority in autonomous combat. The US Marine Corps also uses robot dogs for patrol and reconnaissance, particularly in dangerous missions like detecting explosives. China has invested heavily in similar technology, with the People's Liberation Army deploying quadruped unmanned ground vehicles (Q-UGVs) in various operations. Q-UGVs offer advantages over UAVs and wheeled UGVs in urban combat scenarios, navigating indoors and overcoming obstacles like rubble and stairs.</p>

          <p>Savings experts advise opening certificate of deposit (CD) accounts sooner rather than later, as rates are expected to decline due to potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. They recommend shopping around for the best rates, especially when a CD is nearing maturity, and considering community banks and credit unions. Experts suggest choosing short-term CDs for better rates or long-term CDs to protect against rate drops, and understanding the risks of early withdrawal penalties. Additionally, CD laddering is recommended as a strategy to balance short- and long-term rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study reveals that six out of ten advertising boards during the 2024 Brazilian football league season featured ads for sports betting or gambling, more than double the share compared to 2019. This prevalence has led to a spike in gambling addiction, particularly among lower-income Brazilians, with beneficiaries of Bolsa Familia spending approximately R$3 billion on online gambling last year. Brazilian clubs have become heavily reliant on gambling sponsorships, with all 20 first-division clubs displaying at least one gambling sponsor on their kits. New regulations have been introduced, but stricter measures are being discussed in Congress, including a ban on gambling advertisements during event broadcasts.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail sales experienced a sharp decline in May, dropping 0.9% as consumers grew more cautious after a spending surge in March to avoid anticipated tariffs. This decrease follows a 0.1% dip in April and is attributed to a significant drop in auto sales, as Americans had previously increased their car purchases to beat President Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles. Despite cooling inflation and low unemployment, consumer confidence has decreased, resulting in reduced spending at home and garden centers, electronics stores, and grocery stores. Online retailers, clothing stores, and furniture stores saw sales increase.</p>

          <p>China has accused the US of "pouring oil" on the conflict between Israel and Iran and maintains it has no appetite to be actively involved, due to its limited power projection capabilities in the Middle East. Expert William Figueroa notes that China's focus remains on dialogue and de-escalation, while its economic relationships and diplomatic role could serve as a bridge. However, he believes that the limited exposure to the conflict means China is unlikely to involve itself directly, particularly when an action carries high costs and offers little benefit. China's stance is that Iran has the right to civilian nuclear energy.</p>
