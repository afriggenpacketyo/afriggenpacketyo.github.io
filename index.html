        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a high-stakes summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping advocated for stronger, mutually beneficial relations with the European Union amidst global geopolitical tensions. However, EU leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, emphasized the urgent need to address a significant and growing trade imbalance, calling the current situation an "inflection point." The talks highlighted underlying friction over issues like Chinese industrial oversupply, tariffs on electric vehicles, and China's stance on the war in Ukraine, revealing mismatched objectives between the two economic powers. The summit was notably shortened, reflecting the fragile nature of current EU-China relations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 05:04:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla experienced another month of declining market share in Europe, dropping to 2.8% in June from 3.4% the previous year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. This marks the sixth straight month of decline, with new car registrations falling by nearly 23% year-on-year. The trend is attributed to robust competition from Chinese automakers like BYD and European giants like Volkswagen, as well as potential reputational damage from CEO Elon Musk's public activities. Analysts suggest Tesla may be transitioning from a market leader to a more niche brand in the increasingly competitive European electric vehicle space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK and India are finalizing a major free trade agreement aimed at boosting the British economy by an estimated £4.8 billion annually and creating over 2,200 jobs. The deal will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, while making Indian textiles and jewelry cheaper in the UK. A key component of the agreement is a new plan to combat illegal migration and enhance intelligence sharing. The UK government has defended a provision extending national insurance exemptions for temporary workers, stating it aligns with existing agreements and does not undercut British labor.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing to revoke the Environmental Protection Agency's 2009 "endangerment finding," a crucial determination that classifies greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. This finding serves as the legal basis for numerous federal regulations on emissions from power plants, vehicles, and the oil and gas industry. The administration argues the original finding was flawed and imposes excessive costs, aiming to dismantle key climate policies and promote fossil fuel production. Environmental groups and critics contend the move prioritizes fossil fuel interests over public health and established science, setting the stage for a significant legal battle.</p>

          <p>President Trump's long-standing opposition to wind energy, which began with a dispute over turbines near his Scottish golf course, has now translated into significant U.S. policy with global consequences. The administration has actively worked to curtail renewable energy projects, culminating in legislation that guts federal support for wind and solar power. This policy shift is projected to eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, deter billions in investment, and increase carbon emissions as the nation leans more heavily on fossil fuels. Critics argue this approach undermines U.S. competitiveness in green technology, ceding leadership to countries like China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive new study challenges the common belief that a sedentary lifestyle is the main cause of rising obesity rates. Researchers compared the daily calorie expenditure of people across diverse cultures, from hunter-gatherers to office workers, and found that total energy burn is surprisingly similar across groups despite vast differences in physical activity. This suggests our bodies compensate for increased activity by reducing energy spent on other background functions. The findings provide strong evidence that changes in diet, particularly the rise of ultra-processed foods, are the principal factor behind the global obesity epidemic, not a collective decline in exercise.</p>

          <p>A new law has initiated a major overhaul of the U.S. federal student loan system, most notably phasing out the generous Biden-era SAVE repayment plan by 2028. The legislation introduces tighter borrowing limits, particularly for graduate students and parents, and consolidates the numerous repayment options into two new plans: a standard, mortgage-style plan and an income-based Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). While the new RAP plan offers some benefits like waived interest, it also requires a minimum monthly payment from all borrowers, potentially impacting those with the lowest incomes. These changes will significantly alter the landscape for millions of current and future borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

While the city's mayor sees it as a sensible measure for criminals, the plan has drawn criticism from parties like the Greens.</p>

          <p>Renewed fighting has broken out between Thai and Cambodian forces along their shared border, resulting in the deaths of at least nine civilians and injuring more than a dozen others. The clashes, which involved rocket and artillery fire, occurred near ancient temples in a disputed area where the borders of Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos meet. Both governments have blamed each other for initiating the violence, with Thailand deploying F-16 fighter jets in response. Cambodia has requested an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to address what it calls "unprovoked military aggression" by Thailand.</p>

          <p>Court documents reveal that Pedro Arrupe, the late former worldwide leader of the Jesuit order and a candidate for Catholic sainthood, was warned about a priest's history of sexual molestation before his ordination. Despite being informed in 1977 that Donald J. Dickerson had been accused of molesting two minors and making advances on a third, Arrupe allowed the ordination to proceed. Dickerson was later accused of sexually assaulting other minors, including a student at a Jesuit university. The revelations, emerging from a lawsuit, raise serious questions about Arrupe's judgment and the church's handling of abusers.</p>

          <p>In a move to address its rapidly aging population and stimulate the economy, China is planning to provide direct fiscal support to seniors through subsidy coupons. The program will issue monthly electronic vouchers, worth between 500 and 800 yuan, to seniors assessed as physically disabled to help cover costs for care services like meal assistance and rehabilitation. This policy marks a rare use of direct subsidies for China, which has typically avoided cash-style handouts. The initiative aims to ease the financial burden on families, encourage the use of professional senior care, and unlock domestic consumption.</p>

          <p>The former assistant who filed a lawsuit against Kanye West, also known as Ye, is now in hiding out of fear, according to her attorney. Lauren Pisciotta's lawsuit accuses the rapper of sexual harassment, stalking, and sexual assault during her employment. Her lawyer stated that she has deleted her online presence and is suffering from the ordeal. The lawsuit was amended to include claims of "swatting" incidents, where false emergency calls were made to her property, which she alleges West organized. West has denied the claims, calling them "fantasy fiction" as the civil case proceeds.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, former city traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interbank lending rate quashed by an appeals court. The ruling, which deemed the original convictions "unsafe," is a major development in one of the biggest scandals of the financial crisis era. This decision is expected to pave the way for at least seven other convicted traders to appeal their own cases. The outcome has also prompted calls from senior politicians for a public inquiry into the scandal and the role senior bank managers played.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has affirmed a lower-court ruling that blocks President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled 2-1 that the administration's plan to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of non-citizens or temporary residents is unconstitutional. The decision keeps a nationwide injunction in place, arguing that the order violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. This marks the first time an appeals court has weighed in on the matter, bringing the contentious issue one step closer to a potential review by the Supreme Court.</p>
