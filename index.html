          <p>Mexico is suing Google for changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps, following Trump's executive order. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that the lawsuit was filed due to Google's alteration of the oceanic basin's label, impacting Mexico and Cuba. Mexico argues the 'Gulf of America' label should only apply to the U.S. continental shelf. The article details Mexico's prior attempts to urge Google to maintain the original name, reflecting a dispute over geographic designation and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Newly released records detail key moments in a federal corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, including warrants authorizing searches of phones and potential seizure of electronic devices. The investigation, which began in August 2021, focused on the mayor's fundraising and connections to the government of Turkey. Federal agents considered seizing Adams's devices at the New York City Marathon but instead approached him later, and affidavits suggest Adams may have obstructed efforts to obtain his personal cellphone. The article notes that the charges against Adams were ultimately dismissed after the Trump administration intervened, sparking controversy.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, a move seen as a symbolic stand against Beijing's growing military pressure. However, he has faced criticism for allegedly sidestepping Japan’s wartime atrocities and minimizing the role of the Republic of China in the Allied victory. Lai emphasized the importance of unity among democratic countries against modern authoritarian threats, warning of a 'new authoritarian bloc' without explicitly naming Moscow or Beijing.</p>

          <p>The UK steel industry has received some relief following President Trump's decision to lift 25 percent tariffs on steel exports to the United States. The tariffs had posed a significant threat to the struggling British steel industry, which faces challenges from weak demand, foreign competition, and high costs. While the removal of tariffs is a positive development, uncertainties remain regarding products shipped to the U.S. via European Union countries. The article highlights the cautious optimism within the industry and the need for stability in trade policy.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies are increasingly shifting their manufacturing operations to Vietnam in order to avoid President Trump's high tariffs on Chinese goods. This relocation trend has accelerated recently, with factories in Vietnam ramping up production and e-commerce platforms assisting companies in finding manufacturing alternatives. Vietnam is attractive due to its shared border with China and a large, young workforce. However, Vietnam faces challenges in managing this influx and negotiating trade deals with the U.S. to prevent China from using it as a backdoor for exports.</p>

          <p>A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies, part of a cost-cutting drive led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The ruling favors federal employee unions, who argued that the administration's reorganization and downsizing efforts exceed its legal authority. The restraining order affects 20 federal agencies, preventing further layoffs or administrative leave for workers while the case is considered. The Trump administration argues that the cuts are designed to reduce bureaucratic bloat and save taxpayer money.</p>

          <p>China reported a drop in consumer prices in April, raising concerns about deflation amid ongoing trade tensions and high tariffs. The national consumer price index (CPI) edged down by 0.1 percent year on year, slightly better than economists' predictions. The trade war has contributed to this deflationary pressure, leaving Chinese manufacturers with mounting stockpiles of unsold goods. The article notes that while negotiations with the United States are possible, tariffs remain high, stifling bilateral trade.</p>

The judge cited 'very substantial' claims that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when her student visa was revoked.

Ozturk's release allows her to return to her studies and community at Tufts, while her legal challenge to her confinement continues.</p>
