          <h2>States Launch Lawsuit Against Trump Administration Over New Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 16:13:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dozen states, led by New York, are suing President Trump's administration to block the newly imposed tariffs on foreign imports, arguing that the president lacks the constitutional authority to arbitrarily impose such taxes. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, claims that the tariffs, including those targeting China, Canada, and Mexico, disrupt the American economy and overstep presidential power, which is constitutionally reserved for Congress. Arizona's Attorney General emphasized that these tariffs are effectively a tax increase on consumers. The suit comes after similar legal action from small businesses challenging the tariffs' legality.</p>

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue, with same-store sales declining for the first time since 2020, attributed to a slowdown in consumer spending and adverse weather conditions.

          <p>YouTube is celebrating its 20th anniversary, marking two decades since the first video was uploaded, and is projected to become the largest media company by revenue in 2025, outperforming Disney. Analysts estimate its value between $475 billion and $550 billion, highlighting its dominance in the streaming market. YouTube's success is attributed to its user-generated content model and subscription offerings like Premium, Music, and YouTube TV, which are key growth drivers. As Google's core search business faces competition from AI chatbots, YouTube's robust growth is seen as a crucial hedge and a significant contributor to Alphabet's overall revenue.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a rally fueled by President Trump's remarks about tariffs and the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell.

          <p>Republican lawmakers have introduced the Better Enforcement of Grievous Offenses by Unnaturalized Emigrants (BE GONE) Act, aiming to strengthen penalties against illegal immigrants convicted of sexual assault. The bill seeks to expand the definition of "aggravated felonies" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, codifying key aspects of President Trump’s "zero-tolerance" border policy. Sponsors emphasize the bill's timing during Sexual Assault Awareness Month and cite data showing a significant number of illegal immigrants on ICE's non-detained docket have sexual assault convictions. The legislation intends to provide Homeland Security officers with more tools to identify and deport sexually violent illegal immigrants.</p>

The mandate comes as Google seeks to cut costs and invest heavily in artificial intelligence, with some teams explicitly linking return-to-office demands to ongoing cost-cutting efforts.

          <p>Following a deadly attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India announced it was downgrading diplomatic ties with Pakistan and suspending a crucial water treaty. The Indus Waters Treaty, negotiated in 1960, governs the use of water from six rivers flowing through both countries. India's foreign secretary stated the treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan ceases its support for cross-border terrorism. Pakistan's defense minister denied involvement, attributing the attack to internal unrest within India.</p>

The proposal aims to increase pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has consistently rejected Russia's occupation of Ukrainian lands.</p>

          <p>A federal judge indicated her inclination to permanently block a Trump administration executive order targeting the law firm of Perkins Coie, citing concerns about its constitutionality. Judge Beryl Howell compared the administration's targeting of law firms to McCarthyism and the "Red Scare" era. The executive order sought to strip security clearances from the firm's lawyers and restrict their access to federal buildings, citing the firm's previous representation of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. The judge questioned the administration's justification for the order and expressed frustration with the Department of Justice's response to a temporary restraining order.</p>
