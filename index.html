          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has incorporated over 6,000 new words in the past year, primarily influenced by social media and celebrity culture. Among the notable additions are "skibidi," a versatile term from a viral YouTube series, and "delulu," a derivative of delusional. Other entries like "tradwife," "broligarchy," and "mouse jiggler" reflect evolving societal trends and remote work practices. The dictionary's lexical program manager emphasized that only words expected to have lasting power are included, capturing the dynamic evolution of the English language.</p>

          <p>Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems, related to the network's airing of false claims about the 2020 election. This settlement follows a similar, larger payout by Fox News to Dominion for its election coverage. The lawsuit accused Newsmax of broadcasting conspiracy theories from figures like Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell, alleging Dominion's equipment was compromised. This resolution avoids a trial and addresses one of the final outstanding defamation cases concerning the election's integrity.</p>

Despite the name change, MSNBC's leadership assures that its journalistic focus and commitment to audiences will remain unchanged.

          <p>Bitcoin's price tumbled to $115,255, a 2% drop, following a record high last week, as broader macroeconomic concerns triggered over $500 million in crypto liquidations. Higher-than-expected July wholesale inflation data raised doubts about a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, impacting investor sentiment. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's clarification that the strategic bitcoin reserve would be limited to forfeited assets also contributed to the downturn. Despite the pullback, analysts view this as a healthy cooldown, supported by continued institutional adoption and strong ETF inflows. (not investment advice)</p>

While the Trump administration acknowledges initial communication delays, it asserts that consistent attorney contact has since been established.

This move aims to provide Doak with more first-team opportunities, having played sparingly for Liverpool since 2022.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major experiment in rural Kenya reveals that unconditional cash transfers of $1,000 to low-income families drastically cut infant and child mortality rates by nearly half. The study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that cash payments were particularly effective in reducing deaths during birth and the immediate post-natal period. This impact is attributed to improved access to healthcare facilities and better nutrition, as families no longer had to choose between medical care and basic necessities. The findings suggest cash aid can be as impactful as traditional medical interventions in saving young lives.</p>

While the Trump administration suggests progress on a 'land swap' and European security guarantees, Russia's core demands, including severe caps on Ukraine's military and cessation of Western aid, remain unchanged. The article argues that a credible security guarantee for Ukraine would require a massive military build-up, creating a battlefield reality that convinces Putin further aggression is futile.

          <p>Tennessee Republican Rep. Andy Ogles has sparked controversy by suggesting Donald Trump should receive a third presidential term and a Nobel Peace Prize, and be allowed to 'run D.C. as long as he wants.' His comments on X, made ahead of Trump's diplomatic meetings, were quickly flagged with a Community Note clarifying the 22nd Amendment's two-term limit. Critics, including former political figures, condemned Ogles for seemingly violating his oath to support the Constitution. The incident highlights ongoing debates about constitutional adherence and the nature of political discourse.</p>

          <h2>Premier League Analysis: Liverpool's Defensive Vulnerabilities Emerge in Opening Weekend</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The opening weekend of the Premier League season highlighted Liverpool's defensive vulnerabilities, particularly their susceptibility to counter-attacks, a stark contrast to their previous season's record. Despite attacking reinforcements, the team's balance appears off, with misplaced midfield passes leaving the defense exposed. While sloppy passing is a factor, the analysis suggests Liverpool's commitment of numerous players to attack leaves too few defenders back. Manager Arne Slot may need to adjust full-back and central midfielder positions to provide better protection against counter-attacking sides. The tactical shifts will be a key storyline for their season's performance.</p>

          <p>While Hurricane Erin is currently a major storm threatening the eastern U.S., its direct impact is not expected in the UK. However, the remnants of the hurricane are forecast to bring unsettled weather, including wet and windy conditions, to the UK next week. Meteorologists clarify that reports of a '600-mile wall of rain' are misleading, as such weather systems are typically large but do not produce continuous sheets of rain. The high pressure system currently over the UK will shift, leading to a change in weather patterns by mid-week.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has issued a stern warning to its citizens, particularly government and military personnel, against obtaining mainland Chinese identification documents. Under amended regulations, Taiwanese individuals who acquire mainland Chinese household registration or ID cards could automatically lose their Taiwanese citizenship and be disqualified from public service. This move by Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior aims to tighten control and address concerns about dual loyalties, reinforcing the island's distinct identity and governance.

          <p>The trend of 'job-hopping' has been replaced by 'job hugging,' where workers hold onto their current positions due to a stagnant labor market. Consultants at Korn Ferry describe this as a response to low rates of hires, quits, and layoffs, reflecting worker uncertainty about finding new employment. While remaining in a job long-term isn't inherently negative, experts warn it could lead to sacrificed earnings growth and career stagnation. This shift also makes it harder for new entrants to the workforce, signaling a broader economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the transition poses substantial challenges for small businesses, many of whom face steep tax hikes, increased administrative burdens, and a need for new accounting skills.

          <p>China is closely observing U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to resolve the Ukraine war, particularly following the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. Beijing welcomed the contact between the U.S. and Russia, calling for an early peace agreement. Experts note that the summit, where Trump appeared to shift towards urging Ukrainian territorial concessions, signals to China that 'everything's up for negotiation,' aligning with Beijing's preference for setting political values aside in international dealings. While China's approach to the Ukraine war is unlikely to fundamentally change, the interactions offer Beijing insights into Trump's negotiation style and potential leverage.</p>
