Chinese companies like Unitree, a notable competitor to Tesla's Optimus, demonstrated significant capabilities and won multiple awards. The event highlights China's strategic focus on becoming a global leader in the humanoid robotics industry by 2027, with the government actively promoting technological development and competition. This initiative is seen as crucial for testing and refining the robots' real-world skills.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has invoked the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act to scrutinize wind energy projects, citing the threat turbines pose to these birds. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to enforce the law, a move critics suggest is aimed at hindering renewable energy development rather than genuine conservation. While wind turbines do kill hundreds of eagles annually, other threats like cats, buildings, and climate change are far more significant. The administration's focus is viewed as ironic given its simultaneous efforts to weaken other environmental protections.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, joined by several European leaders, to discuss a potential end to the war with Russia. In a shift from his previous stance, Trump stated that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for a peace deal, drawing parallels to other agreements he has brokered. The meeting was more cordial than their last encounter, with Zelenskyy expressing gratitude for U.S. efforts. Trump expressed optimism about achieving a lasting peace and indicated he would call Russian President Vladimir Putin following the discussions.</p>

          <p>House Democrats in Texas have returned to the state capitol, ending a two-week quorum break that had halted legislative business. Their return allows the Republican-led legislature to resume its push to redraw the state's congressional maps, a move that could grant the GOP up to five additional U.S. House seats in the 2026 elections. The Democratic caucus stated their return would enable them to build a legal case against what they call a discriminatory map. This development is part of a larger national battle over redistricting, with Democratic-led states like California considering their own countermeasures.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms' stock experienced a downturn following a report that the company is planning another restructuring of its AI division, its fourth in six months, raising investor concerns. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly's shares remained stable despite its main competitor, Novo Nordisk, announcing a price reduction for its popular diabetes drug, Ozempic. Analysts suggest the price cut primarily affects the cash-pay market, which is less critical for diabetes treatments compared to obesity drugs due to broader insurance coverage. This development occurs as markets await key retail earnings and remarks from the Federal Reserve chairman. (not investment advice)</p>

Among the new entries are terms like "skibidi," a versatile word from a YouTube series, and "delulu," a slang term for delusional that has even been used in political discourse. Other additions include "tradwife," reflecting a social media trend of embracing traditional gender roles, and "broligarchy," used to describe powerful male tech leaders. Lexicographers noted that these words were added based on their perceived staying power in the English language.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, "Saturday Night Live" cast member Bowen Yang reflected on his journey to the show, which he never considered a realistic goal despite being voted "Most Likely to be on SNL" in high school. As the child of Chinese immigrants who moved from French Canada to Colorado, he used pop culture as a way to quickly assimilate and learn English. Yang also discussed co-hosting the popular podcast "Las Culturistas" and his experience playing JD Vance on SNL, a role he initially resisted but approached with serious preparation. He shared personal anecdotes, including hiding his sister's copy of "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" as a youth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from Bankrate reveals that despite wage increases, the average American's earnings have lagged behind inflation by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years, eroding purchasing power. The study highlights that educators have experienced the most significant gap, while workers in sectors that saw post-pandemic demand, such as leisure and hospitality, have fared better. This persistent financial strain is reflected in public sentiment, with a majority of Americans feeling their income has not kept up with the rising cost of living. The findings underscore ongoing economic pressures on households nationwide. (not investment advice)</p>

The agency advises consumers to immediately stop using any fake dolls and to purchase only from reputable sellers to ensure authenticity. Real Labubu dolls, sold by Pop Mart, can be identified by a holographic sticker, a QR code, and specific design details like the number of teeth.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has expressed his opinion that the artificial intelligence market is currently experiencing a bubble due to excessive investor excitement. While he maintains that AI is a profoundly important technological development, he compared the current overexcitement to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, where a kernel of truth led to widespread overvaluation. His comments align with growing concerns from other financial experts who have warned that investment in AI is moving too quickly. Despite this, OpenAI's revenue is growing rapidly, and the company is preparing for a new stock sale at a significantly higher valuation.</p>

Altman noted that China's progress, particularly with open-source models, was a significant factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models.

          <p>Gateway Church, one of the largest congregations in the U.S., has officially installed Daniel Floyd as its new lead pastor. The transition comes 14 months after founding pastor Robert Morris stepped down amid allegations of child sexual abuse, for which he now faces criminal charges in Oklahoma. In his first sermon, Pastor Floyd acknowledged the weight of the moment and promised to lead with integrity, stating it was time to "turn the page." The church and its former pastor are also involved in ongoing civil lawsuits related to defamation and retirement payments, marking a complex period of change for the institution.</p>

          <p>Although Hurricane Erin, a major Category 4 storm, is not forecast to make a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland, its effects are prompting serious safety measures along the East Coast. The National Hurricane Center warns of life-threatening surf and rip currents from Florida to Massachusetts, with waves potentially reaching over 20 feet in some areas. In North Carolina's Outer Banks, mandatory evacuations have been issued for visitors on Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands due to the high risk of coastal flooding that could make key highways impassable for days. The storm is expected to pass between Bermuda and the U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>The recent £40 million transfer of academy graduate Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa to Newcastle has highlighted growing fan frustration with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). These financial regulations, which limit club losses, incentivize teams to sell homegrown players because their transfers represent pure profit on the books, helping clubs comply with spending limits. This trend has led to an increasing number of fan-favorite, locally developed players being sold, a practice that football finance experts describe as effective for accounting but detrimental from a footballing and cultural perspective.</p>

At 91, Dwight recently became the oldest person to travel to space, fulfilling a journey that began in 1961 when he was selected for astronaut training by President John F. Kennedy. After facing prejudice and resigning from the program, he built a successful career in business and art, creating over 130 memorials dedicated to Black history. A bill introduced by Colorado lawmakers seeks to award him the nation's highest civilian honor for his trailblazing achievements.</p>

This high level of investment is driven by record-breaking deals, such as Liverpool's £100 million signing of Florian Wirtz.

          <p>U.S. solar energy stocks saw a rise after the Trump administration released new rules for clean energy subsidies that were more manageable than many investors had anticipated. The Treasury Department's updated guidelines narrowed the definition for when a project is considered "under construction" to qualify for a 30% federal tax credit, now requiring physical work to have started. While some in the industry criticized the change, analysts noted that the rules were not as stringent as feared, particularly as they left the four-year window to complete projects unchanged, providing relief to the sector.

The research, published in JAMA Network Open, also found that 41% switched from less effective methods like condoms. The findings suggest that removing the prescription barrier is successfully reaching people who face the greatest obstacles to reproductive healthcare, including the uninsured, younger individuals, and those in rural areas. The most common reason cited for choosing the over-the-counter option was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The era of the "Great Resignation" appears to have ended, replaced by a trend consultants are calling "job hugging," where employees hold onto their current positions due to economic uncertainty. The rate at which workers voluntarily leave their jobs has fallen to its lowest consistent level since 2016, reflecting decreased confidence in the labor market. This stagnation is driven by a cooling job market, slower hiring rates, and CEO plans to shrink rather than expand workforces. While providing stability, experts warn that this trend could lead to career stagnation and slower wage growth for employees. (not investment advice)</p>
