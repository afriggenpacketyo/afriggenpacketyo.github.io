          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk's announcement of a new political party, labeling the idea "ridiculous" and a source of "disruption and chaos." Trump's comments on social media suggest a significant falling out between the two, who were previously allies. The dispute intensified following disagreements over a recent tax and spending bill, which ended electric vehicle credits, a policy Musk had championed. This public feud marks the end of their political bromance, which had seen Musk support Trump's re-election and serve in his administration.</p>

          <p>An Australian woman, Erin Patterson, has been convicted of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by intentionally serving them a meal with poisonous death cap mushrooms. After a nine-week trial that garnered national attention, a jury found her guilty of three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. The prosecution argued the act was a deliberate poisoning, while the defense maintained it was a tragic accident. Patterson now faces a potential life sentence for the 2023 crime that resulted in the deaths of her in-laws.</p>

The company, which designs specialized chips for AI inference, aims to meet the growing demand for AI services and the push for "sovereign AI" in the region. This move places Groq among other U.S. tech firms increasing their investment in Europe, particularly in the Nordics, known for renewable energy and favorable climates for data facilities. The expansion will allow European businesses to access Groq's high-speed inference capabilities locally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded there is no evidence of a "client list" of associates connected to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The memo, reviewed by ABC News, also states that investigators found no new evidence to predicate charges against any uncharged third parties in his sex trafficking network. Furthermore, the review reaffirmed the official finding that Epstein's death in custody was a suicide, aiming to counter widespread conspiracy theories. The department indicated it will not release further records to avoid perpetuating unfounded speculation.</p>

          <p>Hopes for a breakthrough in the Gaza conflict are rising as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the U.S. for talks with President Donald Trump. A U.S.-sponsored proposal for a 60-day ceasefire and hostage release is under discussion, though significant differences between Israel and Hamas remain. The recent regional conflict with Iran is seen by some analysts as creating a more favorable environment for a deal, potentially giving Netanyahu more leverage to agree to terms. However, both Palestinians in Gaza and the families of Israeli hostages express only cautious optimism amid the ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>Across Europe, the growing influence of the financial sector in the housing market is driving up prices, making homes unaffordable for working and middle-class residents and fueling political discontent. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have increasingly treated housing as a lucrative asset class, acquiring vast portfolios and prioritizing profits over tenants' welfare. This has led to soaring rents, precarious living conditions, and rising inequality, contributing to the rise of far-right parties. This analysis argues that decades of privatization and deregulation have enabled this corporate capture, creating a systemic crisis.</p>

          <p>A research team from Fuzhou University in China has developed a novel vision sensor using semiconductor "quantum dots" that can adapt to extreme changes in light faster than the human eye. This new system is designed to overcome the limitations of current technology, offering faster computation with lower energy consumption. The sensor mimics the human visual system's ability to adjust to different light conditions and remember those settings for quicker future adaptation. This breakthrough could have significant applications in fields requiring robust and efficient visual processing technology.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, author Jessie Cole explores her relationship with her younger brother, who was mostly non-verbal as a child, leading her to act as his translator. She reflects on how their bond was shaped by shared grief after family tragedies, during which time her brother found his expressive voice through playing the guitar. The essay contrasts her own processing of trauma through writing and memory with her brother's, whose past is largely erased by it. Ultimately, she describes how she has learned to listen to the rich, emotional language of his instrumental music.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to at least 81 fatalities and an ongoing search for more than 40 missing individuals. The Guadalupe River rose to unprecedented levels, devastating several areas, including Camp Mystic, a children's summer camp where campers and a counselor are among the dead or missing. President Trump has issued a major disaster declaration for Kerr County to aid the extensive rescue and recovery operations. Officials have confirmed deaths across multiple counties, with the total expected to rise as search efforts continue in the ravaged region.</p>

          <p>In the wake of devastating flash floods in central Texas that have killed nearly 80 people, questions are being raised about whether officials provided adequate warnings to the public. The Guadalupe River rose with unexpected speed and severity, catching many, including those at a girls' summer camp, by surprise. Some local officials stated they had no reason to expect such a catastrophic event, while the National Weather Service defended its forecasting, noting that flood watches and warnings were issued hours in advance. The tragedy has sparked a debate over the effectiveness and reach of emergency alert systems in rural areas.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's vow to create a new "America Party" faces formidable legal, logistical, and financial challenges, according to election law experts. The process involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are heavily biased toward the two major parties and often require extensive signature gathering and litigation. While Musk's vast wealth could fund such an effort, building a nationally recognized party is a multi-year project that would likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The initiative follows a public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill.</p>

          <p>An SUV crashed into a Domino's Pizza restaurant in Herriman, Utah, rupturing a gas line and causing a massive explosion that destroyed the building. Two occupants of the vehicle were rescued by bystanders just minutes before the blast engulfed the area in flames. The crash was part of a three-vehicle accident, and multiple people were hospitalized, though no injuries were reported from the explosion itself. The building, which also housed a Jimmy John's and a Supercuts, sustained significant damage, but no one was inside the businesses at the time of the incident.</p>
