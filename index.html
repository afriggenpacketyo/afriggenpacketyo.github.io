          <p>President Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to order the deportation of Venezuelan migrants suspected of gang affiliation.  A federal judge swiftly issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the deportations and highlighting the controversial nature of the president's action.

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the Trump administration from deporting immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.  The ACLU filed a lawsuit arguing the act's misuse, as it's typically invoked during wartime. The judge's ruling temporarily halts deportations, pending further legal proceedings.</p>

          <h2>UK Government May Abandon Plan to Freeze Disability Benefits</h2>

          <p>The UK government is considering abandoning plans to freeze Personal Independence Payments (PIP), a disability benefit, following opposition from Labour MPs.  While eligibility criteria are expected to be tightened, dropping the freeze could prevent a damaging parliamentary vote.  The government aims to cut billions from the welfare budget, but the PIP decision reflects internal political pressures.</p>
