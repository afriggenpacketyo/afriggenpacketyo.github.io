          <p>Following the U.S. strikes on Iran's key nuclear sites, Iranian dissident groups have renewed their calls for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Reza Pahlavi, the son of the last Shah, stated that the attacks resulted from the regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons. Maryam Rajavi, the president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, urged Khamenei to step down and allow Iran to transition to a democratic, non-nuclear republic with gender equality. These statements reflect the deep divisions within Iran and the ongoing struggle for political change.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S.'s direct involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, analysts believe the U.S. will maintain its long-term strategic focus on containing China in the Indo-Pacific. While the U.S. has repositioned forces in response to the Middle East conflict, including temporarily shifting assets away from the Indo-Pacific, Washington has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to prioritizing strategic resources on China. Observers note that the decision to strike Iran expands US military engagement in Middle Eastern warfare, but the main focus of strategic resources will remain on China.</p>

Cass advocates for a new strain of economic populism that embraces American manufacturing and empowers workers, moving away from corporate interests and market fundamentalism. He criticizes the focus on consumption as the ultimate goal and emphasizes the importance of values like family and community. Cass acknowledges that while the Republican Party is shifting in this direction, there's still a disconnect between rhetoric and policy.</p>
