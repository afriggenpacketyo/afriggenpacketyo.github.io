          <h2>Assisted Dying in Canada: A Moral Tightrope Walk</h2>

          <p>Canada's increasingly liberal assisted dying laws are raising ethical concerns.  The case of April Hubbard, a 39-year-old with debilitating pain, highlights the complexities, as she chooses assisted dying despite not being terminally ill. Critics argue this represents a 'slippery slope', potentially leading to the devaluation of disabled lives and inadequate care.  Conversely, proponents emphasize patient autonomy and the alleviation of unbearable suffering.</p>
