          <p>Google has entered into an agreement with Elementl Power to fund the development of three new nuclear sites, each with a capacity of at least 600 megawatts, to meet the increasing energy demands of data centers, particularly with the rise of AI. Google will provide early-stage capital for site permitting, interconnection rights, and contract negotiations, with the option to purchase power once the sites are operational. This collaboration aims to add 10 gigawatts of nuclear power to the grid by 2035, aligning with the growing need for reliable, baseload energy to support AI and technological innovation. Amanda Peterson Corio, global head of data center energy at Google, emphasized the importance of advanced nuclear technology in strengthening power grids and meeting the demands of AI advancements.</p>

          <p>In his first broadcast interview since leaving office, former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. criticized President Trump's handling of the war in Ukraine, his dealings with global allies, and defended the timing of his withdrawal from the 2024 campaign. Biden expressed concern over Trump's approach to international relations, citing Trump's calls to rename the Gulf of Mexico and acquire Greenland as examples of behavior unbefitting a president. He condemned Trump's suggestion that Ukraine cede Crimea to Russia as "modern day appeasement" and voiced worries about Europe losing confidence in America's leadership. The former president also defended his decision to exit the 2024 race, asserting it wouldn't have changed the outcome and that Kamala Harris was a strong candidate.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, but revenue fell short of projections, leading to a stock dip. Revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $11.53 billion, while net income rose to $1.78 billion, a significant increase from the previous year's loss. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed optimism about future growth, projecting gross bookings between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion for the current quarter. The company is facing an FTC lawsuit over its Uber One subscription service, which Khosrowshahi disputes, and is also pushing into autonomous vehicle technology, viewing it as a major opportunity. Uber's largest business segments, mobility and delivery, saw bookings increase year over year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering eliminating the Energy Star program, a 33-year-old energy efficiency certification for appliances that has saved American consumers over $500 billion in energy costs. The plan was announced at an EPA meeting, citing a reorganization effort. The EPA claims it is reorganizing to better advance the agency's core mission, but didn't specifically address the Energy Star program. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse criticized the move, arguing it would force Americans to buy less efficient appliances.

          <p>President Trump criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom after Newsom proposed a federal film tax credit to "Make America Film Again." Newsom's request followed Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S., aiming to revive the American film industry, which has faced challenges in recent years. Trump claimed the industry has been "decimated" by other countries and Newsom's "gross incompetence." Despite the criticism, Trump expressed a fondness for Newsom and recalled providing water to California during wildfires. He also criticized the California High-Speed Rail project, calling it a costly and unnecessary endeavor.</p>

Despite facing threats and interference, the family provided evidence of Hezbollah's control, highlighting instances where officials admitted Fakhoury was detained at Hezbollah's request. While grateful for the judgment, the family believes the settlement was unfair and hopes to use the case to seek sanctions against Lebanese officials collaborating with Hezbollah and Iran.</p>

These emails, often using empathetic language, allow customers to avoid Mother's Day-related promotions, suggesting the brand views them as individuals, not just consumers. The author notes that these opt-outs are good business because email is a profitable marketing channel, and they may keep people from unsubscribing. The article concludes that while well-intentioned, the idea that people can simply opt-out of pain or regret is unrealistic, as grief and other emotions are ever-present.</p>

          <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers have traded wide receiver George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys after a volatile three-year stint marked by both talent and immaturity. Pickens, known for his dynamic plays but also emotional outbursts, was traded along with a 2027 sixth-round pick for a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick. The Steelers' acquisition of DK Metcalf in March made Pickens expendable. Pickens joins a Cowboys offense seeking a downfield threat to complement CeeDee Lamb, despite his history of emotional struggles on the field.</p>

          <p>Despite lingering economic uncertainty and slightly decreased mortgage interest rates, weekly mortgage demand surged by 11%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Applications for home purchases rose 11% and were 13% higher than the previous year, driven by a surge in conventional loans. Refinance applications also increased by 11%, driven by Veterans Affairs loans. The housing market has been slow due to potential buyers' fears about tariffs, but real estate agents still report strong demand. The Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting could further influence mortgage rates.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Indian defence ministry stated the strikes were part of a "commitment" to hold those responsible for the April 22 attack accountable. Pakistan, which denies involvement, described the strikes as "unprovoked" and claimed to have shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. The strikes have heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, with conflicting reports emerging about the targeted locations and casualties.</p>

          <p>With credit card interest rates remaining high, pursuing debt forgiveness can make sense for some seniors, but it won't be the right move for everyone. Experts say that this tactic may be a smart option for seniors with high medical expenses, low or limited income, or no significant assets. However, debt forgiveness may not be a smart move for seniors with assets or those who want to use credit in the future. Credit card debt forgiveness can hurt credit scores, trigger tax consequences, and potentially complicate estate planning.</p>

          <p>Greystone Capital Management sold its position in Franklin Covey Co. during the first quarter of 2025, citing near-term environmental uncertainty and reduced guidance from the company. The firm's prior estimates of cash flows were incorrect, and a loss of confidence in management, combined with better current opportunities, prompted the decision. Despite recognizing Franklin Covey's potential, Greystone believes AI stocks offer greater promise for higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The investment firm cited a government contract cancellation and declining revenue for Q2 2025 for Franklin Covey as a key factor in their decision to move to the AI sector.</p>

The half-ton spacecraft, intended to land on Venus, never left Earth's orbit due to a malfunction. Experts estimate it could land anywhere between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. While the risk of it hitting someone or something is small, it cannot be completely excluded. The spacecraft's heat shield may be compromised, but if it remains intact, a half-ton metal object will fall from the sky.</p>
