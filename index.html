          <p>Following the U.S. and China's agreement to suspend most tariffs for 90 days, President Trump stated he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook, who purportedly intends to increase Apple's investments in the United States. Trump suggested Cook would be building more plants in the U.S., potentially reaching $500 billion in investments. Apple had previously announced plans to invest $500 billion to expand U.S. operations, including assembling AI servers in Houston. The easing of trade tensions between the U.S. and China is expected to benefit Apple, which relies on China for much of its production and sales.</p>

Prime Minister Netanyahu credited Alexander's release to military and political pressure exerted by President Trump, while Trump expressed joy at Alexander's return home.

          <p>As gold prices hover near record highs, investors are considering whether to sell their gold investments. While selling could yield substantial profits, especially for those who bought before 2025, it also means losing a reliable portfolio diversifier that typically holds value during market instability. Selling is relatively easy due to numerous gold buyers, but investors would need to find another hedge against inflation. The article advises investors to carefully weigh these factors, considering selling a portion of their gold to secure profits while retaining some for portfolio diversification.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to slow flights at the airport to address these issues and the Trump administration aims to install new fiber-optic cables to improve data transmission.

This fast-tracked resettlement has drawn criticism from immigrant rights activists who view it as unfair given the suspension of refugee admissions from other countries. President Trump asserted that a "genocide" was occurring against white farmers, claims widely discredited. Critics argue this move represents a double standard and serves an extremist agenda, while South Africa denies any persecution of its white citizens.</p>

Despite the ceasefire, India has suspended a water treaty, escalating tensions further. Prime Minister Modi ruled out discussions on the treaty, stating talks would focus solely on Kashmir and terrorism.

The report notes that the decrease in the tariff rate is primarily due to lower rates on Chinese imports, with the U.S.-U.K. trade deal having minimal impact on average tariff rates.</p>

          <p>Counter-terrorism police are investigating a "suspicious" fire at Prime Minister Keir Starmer's house in north London. The fire, which caused damage to the property's entrance, occurred in the early hours of Monday, but no one was injured. Starmer, who resides at his official residence in Downing Street, still owns the property, which is currently rented out. Police are treating the incident as suspicious due to the property's previous connections with a high-profile public figure.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of staff, including veterinarians and lab workers, have left the USDA's animal health arm due to the Trump administration's push for resignations. This exodus raises concerns about the agency's ability to respond to animal disease outbreaks, such as the ongoing bird flu outbreak and the encroachment of New World screwworm. State officials fear slower response times and reduced responsiveness to local veterinary needs. The remaining staff also face bureaucratic hurdles, with purchases over $10,000 requiring approval from the Department of Government Efficiency.</p>
