          <p>A Harris's hawk, notorious for attacking residents in Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has found a permanent home with a local falconer. The bird, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," had dive-bombed around 50 people, leading to one hospitalization. Falconer Wayne Housden captured and trained the hawk, investing around Â£1,000 to build an aviary. Housden plans to keep the hawk and hopes to release it in the autumn, ensuring it will not be abandoned again, and he intends to bring Bomber Harris to the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival in August. The article notes that the hawk was likely a captive-bred bird that had been loose for over a year.</p>

          <p>Shein's anticipated London IPO is facing further obstacles, with the fast-fashion giant now reportedly considering a Hong Kong listing after failing to gain approval from Chinese regulators. The company has been under intense scrutiny regarding allegations of forced labor and breaches of consumer protection laws, including misleading sustainability claims and fake discounts. The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods and similar potential measures in the EU and UK have compounded Shein's challenges. The company has faced an uphill battle in its listing ambitions as it seeks to shake allegations over the use of forced labor.</p>

          <p>The collapse of a glacier in the Swiss Alps and the rapid melting of glaciers worldwide are underscoring the significant impacts of climate change. Glaciers, which store 70% of the world's freshwater, are melting at twice the rate measured two decades ago, affecting water supply, infrastructure, and sea levels. Communities relying on glacial melt are facing water shortages and increased risk of flooding from glacial lake outbursts. The article highlights the need for strategies to adapt to these changes, such as early warning systems and artificial glaciers, while emphasizing the importance of slowing rising global temperatures.</p>

          <p>A top UN official, Tom Fletcher, has accused Israel of subjecting people in Gaza to forced starvation, which he classifies as a war crime. Fletcher states that food is being held at the borders while the population inside Gaza is starving, allegedly to put pressure on them. He calls on Prime Minister Netanyahu to disavow statements made by Finance Minister Smotrich about displacing the Gazan population. Fletcher also addresses his previous claim about 14,000 babies potentially dying, acknowledging the need for precision in language but reiterating the urgency to save lives in Gaza, and he rejects claims that Hamas is stealing large amounts of food aid.</p>

As a child, Musk created a video game called Blastar, and at 24, he co-founded Zip2, which sold for $300 million. He also launched a perfume called Burnt Hair and co-founded X.com, which later became PayPal. Musk's persona partly inspired Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Iron Man, and despite popular belief, he didn't start Tesla but was an early investor and later CEO. Finally, Musk aims to create an "everything app" similar to WeChat through his acquisition of X.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Dallas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee after finishing as runner-up the previous year. Despite an early mistake in the final round when he nearly misspelled the word "commelina," Zaki recovered to correctly spell the winning word, "eclaircissement." Zaki's enthusiastic and joyful approach to spelling set him apart from other competitors. He attributed his near-miss to overemphasizing speed during study sessions. The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, and Zaki's victory adds to the trend of Indian American spellers dominating the competition.</p>

          <p>A New York court ruling against blanket tariffs imposed by President Trump has created uncertainty for the UK's trade deal with the US. The ruling, which is currently stayed by an appeals court, does not affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are the UK's most affected industries. While the UK has secured a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, this deal has not yet been implemented. The ruling blocks Trump's imposition of 10% tariffs on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision, making future planning difficult for businesses.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK saltmarshes as "sinks" that lock away climate-warming greenhouse gases. The report calls for these tidal habitats to be included in the UK's official inventory of carbon emissions and removals. The study, conducted with the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, used greenhouse gas monitoring stations on Hesketh Out Marsh to demonstrate how saltmarshes capture carbon dioxide. The UK has lost 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, but there is growing interest in restoring and protecting these valuable ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly entering into mega drug-licensing deals with multinational companies, driven by cost savings and a shift away from raising funds through share sales. These deals often use a newco structure, combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising via a newly established corporate vehicle. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential deals worth up to US$5 billion for its drug candidates, including a targeted cancer therapy. This trend reflects a broader strategy for Chinese biotech firms to leverage their intellectual property amid depressed valuations.</p>

The festival has seen the introduction of the Pyramid stage, partnerships with organizations like CND, and periods of extreme weather, including the "year of the mud" in 1997 and severe flooding in 2005. Security has been enhanced with the installation of a "super fence" in 2002 to prevent gatecrashers. The festival has also embraced diverse musical genres, with Jay-Z becoming the first hip-hop headliner in 2008, and this year's festival will be the last before a fallow year.</p>

He notes that full-blown financial sanctions, such as cutting China off from Swift, would inflict serious damage on the system itself. Lian suggests that if China were excluded from Swift, countries with ties to China would shift to using China's Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), undermining Swift's importance.</p>

The Trump administration insists that it has other options for imposing tariffs if it does not prevail in the case.
