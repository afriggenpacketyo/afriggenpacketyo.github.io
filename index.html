Progress is being made on fentanyl concerns, but addressing US concerns regarding excess capacity, subsidies, and transshipments will pose significant challenges.

The article notes the removal of Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C., and the abandonment of Justice Department oversight agreements for police forces accused of racial bias. President Trump's administration is setting the tone of racial discourse, championing white grievance and dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. While some argue this is a necessary correction, others see it as an intentional resurgence of old power structures, despite lasting impacts from the police reform movement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" has emerged, emphasizing emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This approach focuses on creating a safe environment where children feel comfortable expressing emotions, asking questions, and being their authentic selves. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, avoid shaming, and view misbehavior as stress signals rather than defiance. The framework encourages parents to do their own internal work to become less reactive and more compassionate, leading with calm authority while welcoming even the biggest emotions.</p>

          <p>Firefighters have made significant progress in containing the Inn fire in Mono County, near Yosemite National Park and Mammoth Mountain, increasing containment to 15%. The fire, which began on Thursday, prompted evacuations in Mono City and Lundy Canyon, but improved weather conditions allowed CalTrans to reopen Highway 395 to one-way traffic and the Mono County Sheriff‚Äôs Office to downgrade evacuation orders to advisories. Containment efforts focused on clearing lines with bulldozers and hand-digging lines in rugged terrain. Fire officials expect mild weather in the coming days, minimizing the likelihood of additional road closures or evacuation orders.</p>

A luxury jet was donated by Qatar for Mr. Trump‚Äôs use in his official capacity and for his presidential library. Despite these actions, there has been a normalization of moneymaking schemes, with Democrats struggling to gain traction without the usual mechanisms of official review. (not investment advice)</p>

Under the current system, federal judges are protected by the U.S. marshals service, managed by the justice department.
