          <p>During the U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska, First Lady Melania Trump sent a hand-delivered letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to prioritize the protection of children worldwide. The letter, shared by the U.S. President on social media, appeals to a shared sense of humanity, stating that all children are born innocent and dream of safety and love, regardless of nationality or politics. The first lady's message frames the protection of future generations as a transcendent goal that would serve not just Russia but all of humanity, positioning it as a bold vision for peace.</p>

          <p>As the NFL season approaches, the Los Angeles Rams are facing significant concerns over the health of their starting quarterback, Matthew Stafford. The 37-year-old veteran has been sidelined by a back issue, preventing him from practicing or throwing throughout training camp, and the team has been tight-lipped about his status. With the season opener just weeks away, backups Jimmy Garoppolo and Stetson Bennett have been taking first-team snaps. Stafford's prolonged absence casts serious doubt on the team's prospects, as his presence is considered crucial for them to be a legitimate Super Bowl contender.</p>

          <p>After fleeing Texas to deny Republicans a legislative quorum for a controversial redistricting plan, Democratic lawmakers are starting to return to the state. The Democrats' departure temporarily halted a special session called by the governor to redraw congressional maps in a way that would likely create five new Republican-leaning seats. Having successfully run out the clock on the initial special session, the lawmakers are returning as a new one begins, though GOP officials have threatened them with arrest to compel their attendance. The situation gained national attention, prompting a counter-redistricting effort in California.</p>

          <p>Air Canada was forced to suspend its plans to restart operations after its flight attendants' union defied a government-issued back-to-work order, continuing a strike that has affected over 130,000 travelers daily. The Canada Industrial Relations Board had ordered the 10,000 striking employees to return, but the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) stated its members would remain on picket lines. The union is demanding a fairly negotiated contract, criticizing the airline for relying on government intervention. The airline now aims to resume flights on Monday evening as the dispute over pay and working conditions continues.</p>

Her statement comes as Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban, citing the group's targeting of arms companies and other disruptive activities as going beyond legitimate protest.</p>

          <p>A U.S. special envoy announced a significant development following a presidential summit with Russia, claiming Moscow has agreed to allow the United States and European nations to provide Ukraine with security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This potential concession, described as a first, could be a key component in a peace agreement to end the long-running war. The announcement comes ahead of meetings between the U.S. president, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and European leaders to discuss the framework for such guarantees and other terms for a potential peace deal.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, is now broadening his appeal to non-Democratic voters as he launches his general election campaign. In a recent speech, Mamdani focused on affordability and the government's role in meeting citizens' "material needs," sharing anecdotes about registered Republicans and others who were unable to vote for him in the primary but could in November. He is positioning his campaign as a growing movement capable of reaching more New Yorkers and demonstrating that local government can effectively address their concerns.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the U.S. may press Ukraine to surrender the Donbas region for peace, this article examines the potential impact of such a move. Ceding the mineral-rich territory, where Ukraine still controls about 30% of Donetsk at a high human cost, is viewed by many Ukrainians as a tragic betrayal. While polling shows strong opposition to formally surrendering land, the population is also deeply fatigued by the war, creating a difficult choice between territory and human lives. Any potential agreement would likely require robust, tangible security guarantees to be acceptable to the Ukrainian public.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Dr. Alieu Kamara, the first and only neurosurgeon in Sierra Leone, a country of eight million people. Previously, patients with severe head and spine injuries had no hope for treatment unless they were wealthy enough to travel abroad. The story highlights the grassroots international effort, involving nonprofits like Mission Brain and a network of surgeons, that facilitated Dr. Kamara's training and equipped a hospital to perform complex procedures. The successful completion of the country's first-ever spine surgery on a paralyzed patient marks a monumental step forward for the nation's healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel participated in a nationwide strike, blocking roads and closing businesses to demand a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the release of all remaining hostages from Gaza. The demonstrations, organized by hostage families, reflect growing public frustration after 22 months of war and fears that further military action could endanger the hostages. While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right cabinet members criticized the protests, arguing they benefit Hamas, demonstrators insisted that a negotiated deal is the only way to bring the captives home safely. Police used water cannons and made dozens of arrests as tensions rose.</p>

          <h2>China's Anti-Corruption Drive Extends to Senior Officials from Ethnic Minorities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 10:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent investigations and expulsions of several high-ranking officials from China's ethnic minority communities signal a shift in the country's approach to elite politics. Observers note that the downfall of cadres like Qizhala, a former Tibetan chairman, and Liu Hui, a former Hui chairwoman, suggests that the previous leniency sometimes afforded to non-Han officials is diminishing. This reflects a broader campaign by the Communist Party to enforce strict political discipline and anti-corruption measures uniformly across all ranks, regardless of an official's ethnic background, altering the dynamics of ethnic affairs governance.</p>
