          <p>Reports indicate that the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) directed broadcasters to avoid showing crowd disruptions or reactions to former President Donald Trump's attendance at the U.S. Open men's final. The USTA stated it regularly asks broadcasters to avoid focusing on off-court disruptions. ESPN, the U.S. broadcaster for the event, confirmed it would acknowledge Trump's presence but otherwise cover the match as usual. This directive has sparked discussion about media coverage and the presence of political figures at major sporting events.</p>

          <p>In the third one-day international match, Jacob Bethell scored his first professional century with 110 runs, helping England reach a formidable total of 414-5. Following this strong batting performance, fast bowler Jofra Archer took four wickets in a formidable opening spell, dismantling South Africa's batting lineup. South Africa was ultimately bowled out for just 72 runs, resulting in a record-breaking 342-run victory for England. Although the series was already lost, the win provided a significant morale boost for the English team.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Kansas Senator Roger Marshall, a former OB-GYN, defended HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s role as a "disrupter" at the CDC, aiming to increase transparency and address public distrust. Marshall argued that not every person needs every vaccine, advocating for parental and doctor discretion in vaccination decisions, specifically questioning the necessity of the Hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. He contrasted this approach with what he described as a "one-size-fits-all" policy, stating that individual medical circumstances should guide vaccination choices.</p>

          <p>The Campbell Soup Company has announced it will eliminate all artificial colors from its extensive portfolio of food and beverage products by August 2026. This decision comes in response to a call from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for food manufacturers to remove synthetic dyes by 2027. Campbell's, which owns brands like V8 and Goldfish, plans to use natural sources like paprika and beet juice for coloring, a practice already in place for its Goldfish crackers. The company joins others like Nestle and Kraft Heinz in shifting away from synthetic ingredients.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has confirmed that the government is exploring the use of additional military sites to accommodate asylum seekers as part of its plan to move them out of hotels. This "all of government effort" aims to accelerate the process of ending hotel usage, which has become costly and a source of public protest. The announcement comes as the number of people crossing the English Channel continues to rise, presenting a significant challenge for the new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood. The government is also considering other "non-military" options, such as prefabricated buildings on industrial land.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Panic Over New Tariffs May Overlook Broader Economic Strengths</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent elimination of the "de minimis" tariff exemption for purchases under $800 is causing concern for some small businesses that rely on international goods. However, this article argues that the panic may be misdirected, as the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected. The larger economic picture, including a strong labor market and high middle-class net worth, suggests the economy can likely absorb the resulting price increases. The focus, it suggests, should be on overall economic health rather than the specific impact of this tariff change. (not investment advice)</p>

The 12-hour journey is believed to be the world's longest in such a vessel and aims to highlight fungal materials as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in marine equipment. The boat was created by cultivating a network of wild Ganoderma polychromum mycelium on a hemp substrate inside a fiberglass mold. The project seeks to inspire further innovation in the field of sustainable biomaterials.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade showcased a range of advanced weaponry, including new drones, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and directed-energy systems, highlighting the rapid progress of its military modernization. This technological surge is attributed to a strategic shift towards fostering competition among both state-owned and private defense contractors. By encouraging a more dynamic and experimental research and manufacturing ecosystem, particularly in fields like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), China has accelerated its development of futuristic military capabilities. The variety of new and unidentified drone models on display exemplifies this competitive innovation.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have reported that 890 people were arrested during a demonstration in London protesting the UK government's ban on the group Palestine Action. The majority of arrests were for supporting a proscribed organization under the Terrorism Act, with some also arrested for assaulting police officers. Organizers from Defend Our Juries stated the protest was peaceful and accused the police of making false claims about violence. The government proscribed Palestine Action in July, making support for the group a criminal offense, following an incident where activists damaged military aircraft.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study analyzing data from nearly 15 million people across Denmark, Taiwan, and the United States has found a consistent pattern of couples sharing the same mental health diagnoses. This phenomenon, known as "spousal correlation," was observed across multiple generations from the 1930s to the 1990s for disorders like depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. The trend suggests that people with similar psychiatric challenges tend to form partnerships. Researchers theorize this could be due to shared understanding, similar environments, or the limiting effects of social stigma on dating prospects.</p>

As the river shifts south, it is moving away from the Colombian town and fueling a conflict over the sovereignty of Santa Rosa, a river island inhabited by Peruvians but claimed by both nations. The potential loss of river access is critical for Leticia, which relies on boat traffic for supplies and trade.

The defense argues they were providing essential humanitarian aid to a family in distress, whose life was threatened by illegal pushbacks from Polish border guards.

While the US team will be disappointed, their performance showcased promising young talent that signals a bright future for the program. Standout players like 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored six tries in the tournament, represent a new generation expected to lead the team into the next World Cup cycle in four years.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most crucial things parents can do for their child's long-term development. Consistent, deep sleep is essential for a baby's physical, mental, and emotional growth and is linked to better concentration and emotional regulation later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment with white noise, involving both parents in settling the baby, and ensuring the baby is well-fed and burped. He stresses that while routines are helpful, flexibility is key to reducing parental stress.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's rhetoric reveals his increasing and frequent use of hyperbole, particularly the phrase "never seen anything like it" and its variations. This signature expression is applied to both positive and negative situations, from economic growth to crime rates, often without factual basis. Communication experts suggest this reflects a worldview where everything is presented in extreme terms, justifying equally extreme responses and governance. The use of this phrase has become more common during his second term, reflecting a presidency that is less restrained than his first.</p>
