          <p>A new report from Climate Central indicates that climate change has nearly doubled the number of "pregnancy heat-risk days" in the U.S., increasing the likelihood of complications such as preterm birth. Extreme heat puts additional stress on the heart and increases the risk of dehydration, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. Experts recommend staying cool by avoiding exertion, seeking shade, and utilizing cooling centers. These concerns are amplified by cuts to surveillance and resource programs related to heat safety under the Trump administration's cost-cutting initiatives.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's Adoption of Lab-Leak Theory for COVID-19 Sparks Controversy</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has embraced the lab-leak theory as the confirmed origin of COVID-19, using it to justify budget cuts and policy changes. This stance contrasts with the scientific community's uncertainty and past characterizations of the theory as right-wing propaganda. Experts express concern that the administration's policies will hinder research and international collaboration, while the appointment of hard-liners could politicize the study of pandemic origins. Critics argue that the administration is punishing biomedical researchers based on speculative claims.</p>

          <p>The UK government has imposed sanctions on Daniella Weiss, a far-right Israeli settler leader, and paused free trade negotiations with Israel in response to policies in the West Bank and Gaza. Weiss, known as the "godmother" of the settler movement, has been sanctioned for actions threatening violence against Palestinian individuals. The UK government stated it cannot advance discussions with the Netanyahu government due to egregious policies. The move follows a joint statement from the UK, France, and Canada calling on Israel to halt military operations and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>

          <p>Judith Levine argues that the Trump administration is using its assault on government to retaliate against women, citing actions such as defunding programs that support victims of domestic and sexual violence, and rescinding funding for maternal mortality studies. Levine contends that these policies disproportionately harm women and people of color, particularly those working in government jobs. She asserts that Trump's actions are driven by personal and political misogyny, targeting reproductive healthcare, safety nets, and legal protections for women.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that oil companies have been strategically funding cultural institutions, youth organizations, and athletic groups to improve their public image amid rising climate change awareness. Documents reveal that the American Petroleum Institute sponsored a workshop for the Girl Scouts, while BP and Shell have partnered with museums and sporting events. Internal communications highlight the value companies see in these partnerships for overcoming "low credibility and trust" and shielding against reputational threats.

          <p>SAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood actors' union, has filed an unfair labor practice charge against Epic Games, alleging the company replaced actors' work with AI-generated voices without notice. The union, which has been on strike against major game companies since July, claims Epic Games failed to bargain in good faith. The dispute centers on concerns around the use of unregulated artificial intelligence and the rights of members to control the use of their digital replicas. The charge comes as Epic Games is also engaged in a legal battle with Apple, resulting in Fortnite's removal from iPhones and iPads.</p>

The explosion gutted the American Reproductive Center, though none of the facility's embryos were damaged. Bartkus, who died in the blast, reportedly tried to livestream the incident. Authorities are exploring his motives, with evidence suggesting he held views against procreation and that life is meaningless. Some people with extreme anti-procreation views have a lack of purpose and a bleak feeling about their own lives.</p>

          <p>The New York Fed warns that the resumption of student loan collection efforts could cause financial spillovers, potentially leading to late payments on other debts. As disposable income decreases due to student loan repayments, borrowers may struggle to meet other financial obligations. Monthly collections on defaulted loans may reduce disposable personal income between $3.1 billion and $8.5 billion a month, according to research by JPMorgan. The delinquency rate for student loan balances has spiked after a five-year pause on collections ended.</p>

The agency will require clinical trials demonstrating safety and effectiveness for healthy adults and children, while accepting immunogenicity data for high-risk groups. The new guidance reflects a shift away from the "one-size-fits-all" approach and aligns with other high-income nations that limit vaccine recommendations to older adults or those at high risk. The new guidance comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, overhauls the nation's health agencies and U.S. immunization policy.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's declining poll numbers, Democrats are struggling to translate his losses into their own gains. Voters disillusioned with Trump are not necessarily flocking to the Democratic Party, and congressional Democrats remain unpopular. Factors contributing to this include a lack of perceived credibility as an alternative, a distrust of government and political parties, and a wait-and-see approach from some voters. To capitalize on Trump's declining popularity, Democrats need to address these challenges and present themselves as a viable and trustworthy alternative.</p>

          <p>A new study challenges the theory that dark streaks on Mars are evidence of flowing water, suggesting instead that they are likely caused by dry processes such as wind and dust deposition. Researchers used machine learning to analyze over 86,000 satellite images of slope streaks and recurring slope lineae, finding that they were more often associated with high wind speeds and dust deposition. The findings cast doubt on claims that these areas could be habitable, allowing for safer exploration without contamination concerns.</p>
