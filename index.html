          <p>Paramount Global is implementing a 3.5% reduction in its U.S.-based workforce, impacting several hundred employees, as part of ongoing cost-cutting measures. This decision follows previous job cuts and spending reductions outlined in a go-forward plan presented by the company's CEOs last June. The layoffs are also occurring as Paramount seeks regulatory approval for its proposed merger with Skydance Media, a move aimed at addressing the challenges posed by the decline of traditional pay-TV and macroeconomic headwinds. The company acknowledges the difficulty of these changes but emphasizes their necessity for positioning Paramount for future success, with potential impacts on the workforce outside the U.S. over time. Optimism about the company's future prospects remains cautiously optimistic amidst these restructuring efforts. </p>

          <p>A 31-year-old educational assistant was fatally stabbed by a 15-year-old student at a school in Nogent, France, prompting national mourning and government mobilization to combat crime. The attack, which also left a police officer slightly injured, has been condemned by President Emmanuel Macron as part of a "senseless wave of violence" affecting French schools. Education Minister Elisabeth Borne visited Nogent to support the school community and police. In response to growing concerns about violence, the Education Ministry has implemented bag checks at some schools, confiscating 186 knives and detaining 32 individuals over a two-month period this spring, underscoring the critical threat of bladed weapons among children. The incident highlights the ongoing efforts to enhance school safety and address violence in educational settings. </p>

          <p>Indian customs officers intercepted a passenger arriving from Thailand at Mumbai airport, seizing nearly 100 live and deceased animals, including lizards, sunbirds, possums, tarantulas, and tortoises. The passenger aroused suspicion due to "signs of nervousness." This seizure follows a similar incident earlier in June, where dozens of venomous vipers were discovered in checked-in baggage from Thailand. Wildlife trade monitor TRAFFIC has warned about a troubling increase in trafficking driven by the exotic pet trade, noting that over 7,000 animals have been seized along the Thailand-India air route in the past three and a half years. While Mumbai customs officers typically seize gold, cash, or cannabis, the rise in wildlife seizures indicates a growing demand for exotic pets. </p>

          <p>Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was deported from Israel after Israeli forces intercepted a Gaza-bound aid boat she was traveling on with 11 others. The Israeli foreign ministry stated that Thunberg departed Tel Aviv for France after agreeing to be deported.

The vessel, Madleen, was attempting to deliver a "symbolic" amount of aid to Gaza in defiance of Israel's maritime blockade and highlight the humanitarian crisis there. Despite the interception, the aid, including baby formula and medicine, will be transferred to Gaza through official channels. </p>

          <p>A school shooting in Graz, Austria, resulted in multiple fatalities, including the perpetrator, prompting a large-scale police deployment to the BORG DreierschÃ¼tzengasse high school. Graz Mayor Elke Kahr described the event as a "terrible tragedy," while Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker expressed the nation's deep shock and grief. Police have confirmed that the situation is under control and there is no further threat to the public, believing the assailant acted alone. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen lamented the transformation of schools into places of death and violence. Firearms violence is rare in Austria due to tightly regulated gun ownership laws, which prohibit automatic weapons and require special permits for other firearms. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hummingbird feeders can be a valuable supplementary food source for these tiny birds, especially during migration, but dirty feeders can be deadly. Spoilage of sugar water leads to microbial growth, causing infections like candida, which swells the birds' tongues and hinders feeding. Wildlife rehabbers frequently rescue hummingbirds with feeder-related infections, emphasizing the need for regular cleaning and nectar replacement. To maintain a healthy feeder, use a 1:4 sugar-to-water ratio, avoid additives, and clean the feeder every one to three days, scrubbing with vinegar or hydrogen peroxide if mold is present. Planting native wildflowers is another way to support local hummingbird populations. </p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has contacted UEFA to seek clarity regarding Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League, citing concerns over potential breaches of multi-club ownership rules. The issue centers on John Textor, who owns a 43% stake in Crystal Palace and a 77% stake in Lyon, with both clubs qualifying for the same European tournament. UEFA regulations prohibit any individual or entity from holding a majority of voting rights at two clubs in the same competition. Forest, which finished seventh in the Premier League and earned a Europa Conference League play-off spot, could potentially benefit if Palace is deemed ineligible for European competition. </p>

          <h2>United States Schedules Four Executions This Week Amid Renewed Push for Death Penalty</h2>

          <p>Four executions are scheduled to take place across the US this week in Alabama, Florida, and South Carolina, marking a significant increase in killings as Donald Trump has pushed to revive the death penalty. These executions are occurring in Republican-run states where past executions have been marred by controversy and allegations of botched procedures. The increased pace of executions contrasts with declining public support for the death penalty and concerns about the methods used. The upcoming executions have sparked renewed debate about capital punishment and its application in the United States. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband defended the government's initial decision to cut winter fuel payments for pensioners and the subsequent partial reversal. He argued that Chancellor Rachel Reeves had to take measures to stabilize the economy, creating the "room for manoeuvre" to extend the payment to more pensioners this winter. The revised policy will provide payments to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of Â£35,000 or less. The Conservative shadow chancellor criticized the initial cut, while the Liberal Democrat leader highlighted the hardship faced by pensioners. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying thousands more troops to Los Angeles amid ongoing protests against immigration raids, prompting strong condemnation from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who labeled the move a "deranged fantasy." The deployment includes 700 US Marines and an additional 2,000 National Guard troops, escalating tensions in the city. Protests have spread to other US cities, with demonstrators decrying the immigration policies. The legal basis for the troop deployment is being challenged by Newsom, who argues it violates the US Constitution and California's sovereignty. </p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine policy. Kennedy claims this "clean sweep" is needed to restore public confidence in vaccine science, alleging the panel has conflicts of interest and is a "rubber stamp" for vaccines. This move follows other changes made by Kennedy, including stopping routine Covid-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. The overhaul has raised concerns among health policy experts about the potential for politicized recommendations and increased distrust in the CDC. </p>

The resurgence of religion among Gen Z challenges assumptions about the continued decline of faith in society. </p>

This decision has been criticized by California's Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass as an unnecessary escalation.

          <p>The article explores the phenomenon of recession indicators, both traditional and unconventional, and their potential to signal an upcoming economic downturn. From the "Hemline Index" to sales of men's underwear and frozen pizza, people have long sought informal signs of economic trouble. The popularity of recession indicators on social media reflects a broader anxiety about the economy. While economists may not rely on these indicators, the article suggests that widespread concern about a recession can itself become a self-fulfilling prophecy by influencing consumer behavior. </p>
