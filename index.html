          <p>The parents of Tom Phillips, who was killed by police in September, have issued their first public apology for the "trouble, inconvenience, loss of privacy and property" caused by their son. Phillips had evaded authorities for nearly four years after disappearing with his three children into the New Zealand wilderness in 2021. They stated they did not support his actions and expressed sorrow for the ordeal, while police investigations into the shoot-out that injured an officer and led to Phillips' death are ongoing. One of his children was with him during the shoot-out and helped locate the other two children.</p>

          <p>China Three Gorges Corporation has launched a pioneering thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, featuring two towers feeding a single turbine system, a global first. The plant utilizes nearly 27,000 mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto 200-meter towers, melting and storing salt at high temperatures to generate steam for turbines, ensuring continuous power even after sunset. This innovative dual-tower design is reportedly 25% more effective than single-tower systems, optimizing energy capture and reducing mirror requirements for significant cost savings. The development marks a significant advancement in renewable energy technology and efficiency.</p>

          <p>Citi's venture capital arm, Citi Ventures, has invested in BVNK, a stablecoin infrastructure company, as major U.S. banks increasingly engage with the cryptocurrency and digital asset sector. BVNK's technology facilitates global transactions using stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to fiat currencies and backed by real-world assets. The investment highlights stablecoins' potential for faster, cheaper, and 24/7 cross-border payments, with nearly $9 trillion in transactions over the past year. The U.S. GENIUS Act is seen as fostering a more favorable regulatory environment, encouraging banks like Citi and JPMorgan Chase to explore issuing their own stablecoins and tokenized deposits.

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a protégé of Shinzo Abe and potential new leader, is expected to continue "Abenomics" policies, which could weaken the yen and potentially draw criticism from former U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump has historically accused Japan of currency manipulation to gain trade advantages. While the yen has recently weakened to psychologically sensitive levels around 150 against the dollar, analysts suggest Takaichi will likely exercise caution to avoid straining U.S.-Japan relations. Concerns over imported inflation also pressure her to accept potential interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan, despite her previous opposition, to curb rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Approximately 500 National Guard troops from Texas and Illinois have been deployed to the Chicago area to protect federal agents and facilities, sparking a legal battle. Illinois state and Chicago city leaders have filed a lawsuit, arguing there's no crisis warranting the deployment and challenging the Trump administration's authority. A federal judge is set to hear arguments on a temporary restraining order, with legal experts suggesting the order may be granted, though appeals are likely. This situation highlights a novel instance of inter-state National Guard deployment and raises questions about federal versus state sovereignty, with previous similar deployments in Portland being blocked.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asserts that Europe faces a concerted "hybrid warfare" campaign, citing recent drone incursions, cyberattacks, and election interference as non-random harassment. While not directly blaming Moscow for all incidents, she emphasized Russia's intent to sow division, a charge Moscow denies. Hybrid warfare blends conventional military methods with subversive tactics, designed to disrupt and undermine adversaries without overt conflict. Incidents, including sabotage of infrastructure and airspace violations, have significantly increased since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting European nations to bolster security and defense against these "twilight of deniability" threats.</p>

This move comes amidst ongoing trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington, with China already adding several rare earths to its export control list earlier this year. The restrictions could significantly impact the U.S., which mines rare earths but lacks sufficient processing facilities, as China dominates 61% of production and 92% of refining globally.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace plan, confirmed by Israeli officials, Hamas, and mediator Qatar. This initial agreement aims to end the two-year war, facilitate the release of all hostages, and see Israeli troops withdraw to an agreed line. The deal is expected to involve the release of about 20 Israeli hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. While a significant step towards de-escalation, contentious issues like Hamas's demilitarization and Gaza's future governance remain unresolved, indicating further complex negotiations ahead.</p>

          <p>U.S. embassy social media accounts on Chinese platforms have fallen silent, with a message stating they will not be regularly updated due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.

The silence of the embassy accounts sparked widespread discussion among Chinese social media users, many of whom used the occasion to critique the American political system.
