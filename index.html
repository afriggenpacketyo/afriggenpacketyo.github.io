          <p>Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian is collaborating with Olympic gold medalist Tara Davis-Woodhall to launch Athlos, a new women's-only track and field competition. The initiative aims to increase visibility and investment in women's sports, with its first event scheduled for October in New York City's Times Square. Ohanian, inspired by his wife Serena Williams's career, seeks to address the under-appreciation of these athletes between Olympic cycles, while Davis-Woodhall championed the inclusion of field events to ensure comprehensive coverage.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic legislators, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, has introduced a bill aimed at preventing illegal price gouging by large corporations. The proposed legislation would empower the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to prosecute companies that exploit market shocks, such as inflation or new tariffs, to excessively raise prices. The bill would also mandate increased transparency from companies with over $100 million in revenue regarding their pricing changes, costs, and profit margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Washington Commanders have reportedly reached a one-year agreement with veteran edge rusher Von Miller, the NFL's active leader in career sacks. This move aims to strengthen the team's defensive line following a successful season where they reached the NFC Championship Game. Miller, 36, joins a defense that already includes Dorance Armstrong and Deatrich Wise Jr., adding experienced depth to their pass rush. The signing is part of an active offseason for the Commanders, who have also made significant acquisitions on offense.</p>

The MPs, who now sit as independents, were part of a rebellion against proposed welfare changes. One suspended MP, Rachel Maskell, stated the action was due to her work on disability reforms but affirmed she would continue to support the government. The move has sparked debate within the Labour Party about leadership style and the tolerance of internal dissent.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent legislative rollback of green-energy subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act is a beneficial, albeit partial, reform. The author contends that such subsidies distort markets, favor established companies, and represent cronyism rather than effective climate policy. While acknowledging that some fossil-fuel subsidies also exist and should be eliminated, the article asserts that green energy receives disproportionately larger subsidies, and this recent cut of approximately $500 billion is a move toward a more neutral tax code.

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer will begin selling their blockbuster blood thinner, Eliquis, directly to patients at a discount of more than 40%. The new program bypasses insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, reducing the monthly cost from about $606 to $346 for uninsured or self-pay patients. This move comes amid increasing pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices, although the discounted price remains significantly higher than the negotiated price for Medicare set to take effect next year.

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a "major disaster" under the Stafford Act, which would unlock federal FEMA funding for affected communities. The bill aims to provide resources for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects, as heat waves are currently not explicitly eligible for disaster declarations. The proposal faces an uphill battle, with some, including a former FEMA administrator, arguing that extreme heat is already implicitly covered and that existing mitigation grants are the more appropriate tool.</p>
