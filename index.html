          <p>Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg share a fondness for Iain M. Banks's Culture series, a socialist science fiction saga, which is ironic considering their capitalist tech billionaire status. The Culture series depicts a post-scarcity society valuing empathy, pluralism, and social cooperation, diametrically opposed to Silicon Valley's ethos. In the Culture, AI handles governance, freeing citizens for leisure, contrasting with the demanding work environments of Amazon, Meta, and Tesla. The series critiques capitalist tech billionaires through the character Joiler Veppers, a villain who exploits his wealth to manipulate media, suppress labor, and commit sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Three major wildfires are raging north of Duluth in northeastern Minnesota, prompting a state of emergency. Crews are also battling large wildfires in Canada's Manitoba and Ontario provinces. As of Wednesday, the fires in Minnesota cover about 30,000 acres, with the Munger Shaw Fire nearly 100% contained. The Jenkins Creek Fire and Camp House Road Fire are being managed jointly as the "Brimson Complex." The Camp House Road Fire has destroyed over 150 structures, including cabins and homes.</p>

          <p>A recent inflation surprise suggests the economic outlook could be gloomier than expected. While pay rises are outpacing price increases for many workers, inflation has risen to 3.5% in the 12 months to April, higher than in France or Germany. Higher energy and water bills, along with rising food and service costs, have contributed to the increase. Economists expect inflation to remain below 4% but may not fall back to 3% until next year, potentially leading the Bank of England to limit interest rate cuts. The government's policies and global trade uncertainties could further impact inflation.</p>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for high-risk groups, such as seniors, but will require extensive clinical trials before approving them for broader use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. Vaccine makers must conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials for approval in healthy individuals aged 6 months to 64 years. The FDA is urging new studies in adults aged 50 to 64 and children under 5. This new framework comes ahead of a key meeting to decide on updating the strain used in next season's shots.</p>
