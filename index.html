        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank has set the yuan's daily fixing rate against the US dollar at a two-month high, reflecting the dollar's recent decline to a multi-year low. This movement is driven by expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve later in the year and concerns over US tariff policies. While a potential trade truce between the US and China was signaled after talks in London, some analysts remain cautious about the dollar's ability to sustain gains. The currency's weakness is also attributed to worries about US debt levels, lending relative strength to the yuan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An appeals court has temporarily blocked a judge's order that would have returned control of National Guard troops to California Governor Gavin Newsom. The original order found that President Trump's deployment of the Guard to quell anti-immigration protests exceeded his authority. The appeals court will hear the case on Tuesday, while Governor Newsom previously criticized the deployment as an authoritarian overreach. The White House, however, argued that the district court's decision usurped the President's authority as Commander in Chief.</p>

          <p>Despite rising tensions and Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe Tehran is unlikely to disrupt oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz. Blocking the strait, a vital artery for global oil shipments, would likely trigger further retaliation and negatively impact Iran's relationship with China, its largest oil customer. Experts also suggest that physically closing the strait may be impossible due to its width and the presence of the US Fifth Fleet. While attacks on tankers or mining the strait remain possibilities, a full-scale blockade is considered improbable.</p>

          <p>A new David Attenborough film, "Ocean", starkly reveals the plunder of the seas, particularly by the fishing industry. The film's release coincides with a proposed ban on bottom trawling in some marine protected areas (MPAs), however, the film emphasizes the need to reverse the presumption of exploitation in favor of prioritizing protection. The film argues that the default position should be protection, from which some fishing activities are permitted only in the least fragile areas, as this would maximize spillover effects and allow fish populations to thrive.</p>

          <p>Japan has strongly condemned Israel's attack on nuclear and military sites in Iran, expressing regret over the military action despite ongoing talks for a peaceful resolution. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya called for utmost restraint from all parties involved to prevent further deterioration of the situation. Japan, heavily reliant on Middle Eastern oil imports, has traditionally maintained friendly relations with both Iran and Israel. The Japanese government is deeply concerned about retaliatory attacks and is taking measures to ensure the safety of its nationals in the region.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged to a near two-month high following Israeli airstrikes on Iran, as geopolitical tensions drive demand for safe-haven assets. The market reaction reflects growing unease that a broader confrontation could disrupt global energy supplies and stoke inflation. Brent crude futures climbed 5%, while West Texas Intermediate futures rose by the same margin, with concerns that the conflict could disrupt flows through the Strait of Hormuz. Recent data showing elevated jobless claims and muted producer price inflation have increased speculation that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates, making non-yielding assets such as gold more attractive to investors.

India has substantial REE reserves, holding the world's third-largest share, but it lacks advanced separation and refining technology compared to China, the U.S., and Japan.
