        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports indicate that the Israeli military has conducted a series of strikes in and around Tehran, the Iranian capital, and other areas within Iran, though the specific targets remain undisclosed. This action follows Israel's claim of intercepting a suspicious aerial target launched from Iran, raising tensions in the region. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) issued an urgent evacuation advisory to residents near Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, citing intentions to target military infrastructure in the area. The strikes coincide with planned meetings involving European leaders to discuss the ongoing situation with Iran, further complicating diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Zillow report suggests that carefully chosen interior paint colors can significantly boost a home's sale price, potentially adding up to $2,600 to the final value. The study, based on a survey of thousands of homebuyers, identifies olive green as the most desirable kitchen color, with buyers willing to pay up to $1,600 more for kitchens featuring this hue. Classic navy walls in bedrooms are also highly sought after, potentially increasing the sale price by an estimated $1,815, while dark gray living rooms are favored over lighter colors, potentially boosting offers by around $2,600; conversely, bright and playful colors may deter buyers and decrease a home's value.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are employing 'tariff engineering,' a legal practice involving altering product materials or dimensions to reclassify items under lower-tariff harmonized system codes. This strategy allows companies to reduce duty liabilities by strategically designing products to fit into more favorable tariff categories. For example, some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum elements or switch synthetic materials for cotton to qualify for lower duties. However, heavily-regulated industries like automotive and aerospace face greater challenges due to extensive validation and approval requirements for even minor changes; this practice dates back to the 1880s and is still used today.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to US media reports, Donald Trump has approved plans to attack Iran but has not yet made a final decision on whether to proceed with the strikes. The decision to hold off on initiating strikes is reportedly contingent on Iran's willingness to abandon its nuclear program, according to a senior intelligence source. Trump is considering a US strike on Fordo, an underground uranium enrichment facility in Iran, while Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected Trump's demand for unconditional surrender. Israel has also launched attacks on Iran, targeting missile sites and nuclear facilities, with Iran responding by firing hypersonic missiles; no serious damage was reported in Israel.</p>

The recall affects 4-liter, 6-can capacity mini-fridges sold online between June 2019 and June 2022.

CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that United States Steel Corp. is of growing strategic importance, especially with the likelihood of continued high U.S. tariffs on steel products. Hashimoto believes that Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel will benefit the U.S. economy, although he doubts trade levies will revitalize its manufacturing sector. The company finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary, following Trump's reversal of initial opposition. Nippon Steel has agreed to invest around $11 billion by 2028 and maintain U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh, with the U.S. government retaining veto power over key management decisions.

          <p>As Israel and Iran exchange missile strikes, American students and tour groups in Israel are making plans to evacuate, with some expressing mixed feelings about leaving. The U.S. Embassy in Israel initially announced evacuation flights and cruise ships for American citizens, but the State Department later stated it had no such announcement. Some students are exiting through Jordan or by boat to Cyprus, while others are awaiting further instructions from the U.S. government. Despite the danger, some Americans are hesitant to leave, citing meaningful connections and positive experiences in Israel.</p>

The study indicates that the remaining "carbon budget" has shrunk to 130 billion tonnes, largely due to continued record emissions. If global CO2 emissions remain at current levels, this budget will be exhausted in roughly three years, potentially committing the world to exceeding the Paris agreement target. The current rate of warming is about 0.27C per decade, and long-term warming could be brought back down by removing CO2 from the atmosphere, but reliance on these technologies should be approached with caution.</p>
