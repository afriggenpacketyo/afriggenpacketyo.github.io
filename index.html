          <p>American Airlines reported a smaller-than-expected loss for its third quarter, significantly outperforming Wall Street's forecasts. The airline also provided an optimistic outlook for the fourth quarter, projecting earnings between 45 and 75 cents per share, well above analyst expectations. This positive financial performance led to a surge in the company's stock. The improved forecast suggests the airline is navigating challenges like domestic flight oversupply more effectively than anticipated.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions with quantum computing firms like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum to acquire equity stakes in exchange for federal funding. This move aligns with Washington's strategy to invest in industries critical to national security, following similar investments in rare earths company MP Materials and semiconductor firm Intel. Such unprecedented government intervention outside of a financial crisis signals a shift towards greater state involvement in strategic technologies. Experts view quantum computing as vital for its economic and security implications, particularly in competition with China.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised fresh US and EU sanctions against Russia, calling them a vital step to increase pressure on Moscow. The US sanctioned Russia's two largest oil firms, while the EU approved its 19th package, banning imports of Russian liquefied natural gas. Russia has warned of a "painful response" if the EU seizes frozen assets, claiming immunity to the measures. European leaders are also expected to agree on funding Ukraine through 2027 and advance a loan plan using Russian assets, signaling continued Western support.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has confirmed that the "existing structure" of the White House East Wing will be torn down to make way for a new $250 million ballroom. This marks a significant expansion of the construction project, which began with demolition on Monday. The announcement has intensified criticism from conservationists and opposition politicians, who argue the historic building should have faced more scrutiny. Trump defended the transparency of the project, stating it is fully funded by himself and donors, with military involvement, and that the East Wing has undergone many changes over time.</p>

          <p>House Democrats are requesting comprehensive details from President Trump regarding the controversial White House ballroom project, citing concerns over transparency, funding, and the physical and ethical integrity of the administration. Led by Rep. Robert Garcia, Democrats expressed alarm over decisions made in "complete secrecy" and the demolition of the East Wing. They have requested architectural plans, a detailed budget, a list of all donors, and legal justifications for the structure. This request underscores mounting political opposition and demands for accountability regarding the privately funded, expanding renovation project.</p>

          <p>An opinion column critically analyzes President Trump's actions, including the demolition of the White House East Wing for a ballroom and military strikes against alleged drug traffickers, as indicative of a "Louis XIV era" of impunity. The author argues these actions, from the symbolic to the murderous, demonstrate Trump's disregard for legal constraints and congressional oversight. The piece highlights concerns over the lack of evidence for his claims regarding the sea strikes and the potential for illegal orders. It urges voters to continue protests against what it describes as monarchical overreach.</p>

          <p>A cancer survivor shares her experience developing lymphedema, a chronic and often misunderstood disease, after treatments for breast and ovarian cancer. Despite warning her doctor, she developed the condition, which affects over 10 million Americans and has no known cure. The article highlights the "silence" surrounding lymphedema, its misdiagnosis, and lack of provider education. The author advocates for candid conversations with doctors, personal risk assessment, early intervention, and increased funding for research, stressing that surviving cancer can lead to a lifelong battle with other conditions.</p>

          <p>Director Nia DaCosta and actress Tessa Thompson have collaborated on "Hedda," a daring adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler," which premiered at TIFF. The duo, who met at Sundance labs a decade ago, describe their working relationship as built on complete trust. DaCosta's adaptation makes significant changes, including gender-flipping a key character and setting it in 1950s England, injecting themes of gender, race, and sexual identity. Thompson's performance is praised for its intelligence and unpredictability, marking a unique opportunity for a woman of color in such an iconic role.</p>

          <p>Legendary director John Carpenter, at 77, discusses his recurring nightmares about closed theaters and his philosophical views on death, believing energy disperses and returns to "stardust." Despite his directorial career receding, his musical influence, characterized by synthy, hypnotic scores, continues to grow, impacting modern artists. Carpenter, who now tours with his music, attributes his initial stage fright to a high school incident but credits his drummer for helping him overcome it. He expresses gratitude for music as a "blessing" that offers a different kind of fulfillment than the pressures of filmmaking.</p>

          <p>Scott Cooper's "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere" is reviewed as a character study rather than a typical music biopic, focusing on Bruce Springsteen's contemplative period leading to his 1982 album "Nebraska." Jeremy Allen White embodies Springsteen, capturing his intense soulfulness in a performance that symbolizes the artist. The film delves into the isolating and transformative creative process, showcasing how Springsteen synthesized personal memories and external influences to produce the album. While praised for its process-centric approach and authentic style, the review notes it meanders towards the end, losing some footing.</p>

          <p>Californians purchased a record 124,700 zero-emission and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, marking the highest quarterly sales since 2008. This surge was driven by consumers rushing to utilize expiring federal tax incentives of up to $7,500, which were eliminated under President Trump's budget cuts. The cessation of these credits raises concerns about maintaining momentum for clean car goals, as EVs remain more expensive than gas-powered alternatives. State officials are exploring new ways to encourage EV adoption following the federal policy changes and deregulation efforts.</p>

The Trump administration had previously suspended research funding over alleged civil rights violations.

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered a new species of pachycephalosaur, named Zavacephale rinpoche, in southeast Mongolia, representing the earliest definitive pachycephalosaur ever found. This "magical" specimen, unearthed with a remarkably complete skeleton, fills a critical gap in the early evolution of dome-headed dinosaurs. The juvenile dinosaur, about the size of a German shepherd, reveals new insights into the species, including tiny hand bones and fully developed domes for head-butting at a young age. The fossil will be preserved in Mongolia, contributing significantly to paleontology.</p>
