          <p>ABC has indefinitely pre-empted "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after host Jimmy Kimmel made comments suggesting supporters of Donald Trump were politicizing the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Major broadcast groups like Nexstar and Sinclair also pulled the show, citing the remarks as offensive and not in the public interest. The move has drawn criticism from free speech advocates and unions like the WGA and SAG-AFTRA, while being praised by figures like Donald Trump and the FCC chairman, sparking a national debate on censorship and broadcast standards.</p>

          <p>A man in his 40s has died and a woman of the same age is receiving hospital treatment after both sustained gunshot wounds in Clissold Park, north London. Metropolitan Police were called to the scene on Wednesday evening and have since recovered a firearm. Authorities are treating it as an isolated incident, believing the two individuals were known to each other, and have stated there is no wider risk to the public. The park remains closed as the investigation into the distressing event continues and police work to contact the victims' relatives.</p>

          <p>Beijing has reportedly expanded its halt on purchases of Nvidia's AI chips, effectively freezing the American tech giant out of the Chinese market. This decision reflects China's increasing confidence in its domestic semiconductor capabilities, with companies like Huawei developing powerful alternatives. Analysts suggest the move is also a strategic negotiation tactic, aiming to gain leverage in broader trade discussions with the United States while simultaneously pushing for technological self-sufficiency. This development intensifies the ongoing tech rivalry between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is set to visit Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Madrid, with discussions expected to highlight differing approaches to the Israeli-Gaza conflict. While both leaders have criticized Israel's military actions, Spain has taken a more proactive stance, joining a genocide case at the ICJ and imposing an arms embargo. Germany has so far resisted imposing significant sanctions on Israel. This meeting occurs as the EU considers broader punitive measures, placing the two nations' contrasting foreign policies in sharp focus amid ongoing European security and political discussions.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government has announced £150 billion in investment commitments from U.S. firms, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. This initiative, aimed at creating over 7,600 jobs and strengthening economic ties, includes major pledges from tech giants like Microsoft and Google, as well as a £90 billion commitment from Blackstone. The announcement comes as Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Trump meet with investors to discuss economic deals. However, this positive development is contrasted by some domestic firms slowing investment and certain pharmaceutical companies halting UK plans, citing a challenging business environment.</p>

          <p>China's National Immigration Administration reported that foreign nationals made 15.89 million visa-free entries between January and August, accounting for approximately two-thirds of all international arrivals. This surge is largely driven by visitors from Southeast Asian countries, with a significant increase noted following a reciprocal visa-free agreement with Malaysia that took effect in July. Since the agreement, Malaysian passport holders have made 180,000 trips to China. The data indicates a successful effort by Beijing to reopen its borders and encourage tourism and business travel post-pandemic.</p>

After a convincing 2-0 victory against Japan, Pochettino defended his experimental approach, arguing that a reset with new players and tactics was necessary to build depth and energy for the upcoming World Cup. While the team has faced key player absences and inconsistent outcomes, the process has allowed new talent to emerge and has fostered a renewed sense of hunger.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk appears to be deeply intertwined with a nihilistic and ironic online meme culture, according to an analysis of the messages engraved on the alleged shooter's bullet casings. In an interview, CNN correspondent Elle Reeve explains that the ideologically inconsistent and game-referencing inscriptions reflect a detached, 'very online' mindset where violence is performed for an in-group audience. This phenomenon, seen in other recent shootings, suggests the act was not driven by a clear political ideology but by a desire to become a meme and generate discourse within dark, insular internet communities.</p>

Factors such as drought, high operational costs for ranchers, and reduced foreign imports have severely constrained supply. While ranchers are currently benefiting from record-high cattle prices, the high costs are deterring them from expanding their herds. New data suggests that after years of strong demand, shoppers are finally beginning to resist the steep prices, with spending on ground beef starting to plateau.</p>

          <p>A federal judge's ruling in the government's antitrust case against Google has attempted to address the company's monopoly in internet search without stifling its competitiveness in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. While the ruling imposes some restrictions, such as banning exclusive search engine deals, some analysts fear it does not go far enough to check Google's power, given its vast data advantage for developing AI. The case highlights the limitations of applying century-old antitrust laws to rapidly evolving technology, prompting calls for more proactive and modern regulatory frameworks to govern the AI industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the formation of a federal task force, including the National Guard, to be sent to Memphis, Tennessee, to combat crime, mirroring a recent deployment in Washington, D.C. While Tennessee's Republican governor supports the move, the city's Democratic mayor has expressed dismay, stating he did not request the troops. Legal experts and civil liberties advocates worry that such deployments are normalizing the use of the military for domestic policing, testing the limits of presidential power and challenging long-standing norms that separate military and civilian law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Evidence in the assassination of Charlie Kirk, including meme-laden engravings on bullet casings, suggests the alleged shooter was motivated by a desire for notoriety within online subcultures rather than a coherent political ideology. Researchers argue that the act was a form of "performative violence," designed to generate discourse and emulate other high-profile shooters. The suspect's alleged text messages, joking about a manifesto and the online reaction to the engravings, reinforce the theory that the killing was deeply influenced by an internet culture that blurs the lines between real-world violence and online spectacle.</p>

The board argues that after his sustained political pressure on the central bank to lower rates, Trump "owns the outcome now for good or ill." The editorial warns that if his economic policies, such as tariffs and mass deportations, lead to sustained inflation and stagnant real wages, voters will notice. This analysis positions the economy as a key vulnerability for Trump, removing his ability to blame previous administrations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Italian protest song "Bella Ciao," found engraved on a bullet casing linked to Charlie Kirk's alleged killer, has a rich and complex history as a global anthem of resistance. While widely known as an anti-fascist hymn from World War II, its origins are debated, with possible roots in 19th-century folk songs of female rice paddy workers. The song's simple, catchy melody has allowed it to be adapted by various movements worldwide, from leftist and feminist protests to its recent popularization in the Netflix series "Money Heist," demonstrating its enduring power as a portable symbol of freedom.</p>

While some nations like Denmark and Spain support an ambitious 90% emissions cut by 2040, others including Hungary and Poland fear the economic impact.
