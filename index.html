          <p>President Vladimir Putin presided over a Victory Day parade in Moscow, commemorating the Soviet triumph over Nazi Germany, with leaders from China, Brazil, and other nations in attendance. The parade, the largest since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, showcased military strength. Despite Russia's call for a three-day unilateral ceasefire, Ukraine rejected it as a theatrical show, highlighting the deep divisions caused by the ongoing conflict. The event underscored Russia's efforts to rally support from the 'global south' amid Western criticism and justify the invasion by falsely accusing the Ukrainian government of Nazism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Western sanctions impact Russia's economy, China has become a crucial economic partner, with bilateral trade soaring. China has increased its purchase of Russian oil and gas and provided access to manufactured goods and technologies. Experts suggest that without China's support, Russia's armed forces would likely struggle to continue their military campaign. Despite US secondary sanctions, China's economic support has been vital for Russia's resilience. Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow for Russia's Victory Day Parade highlighted the deepening ties between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Trade Data Reveals Shift in Global Goods Flow Amid US Tariffs</h2>

          <p>New Chinese government data indicates that the trade war is reordering the flow of goods around the world. While shipments to the United States plunged by 21 percent in April, exports from China jumped overall, driven by trade to other countries in Southeast Asia. This suggests a front-loading of the supply chain and a redirection of trade as Chinese factories seek alternative markets to offset the impact of US tariffs. The data highlights the challenges and adjustments in global trade dynamics due to escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Migratory birds are facing challenges due to climate change, which is altering their migration patterns and threatening their survival. Rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events are impacting their food sources and habitats. Warmer temperatures can also cause birds to shorten their routes or abandon their original habitats, leading to conflicts with resident animals. The article emphasizes the importance of protecting migratory birds through international treaties and creating bird-friendly environments. Without these efforts, the disappearance of migratory birds could impact agriculture and the food chain.</p>

While President Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports remains in place, the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium. The deal has cut car tariffs to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, with steel and aluminum tariffs scrapped. This is an agreement which has reversed or cut some of those tariffs on specific goods, but months of negotiations and legal paperwork will follow.</p>
