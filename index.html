          <p>A New York jury found Sean Combs not guilty of the most severe charges he faced, including running a criminal enterprise and sex trafficking. The verdict prompted an emotional reaction from the hip-hop mogul, who fell to his knees in the courtroom. However, he was convicted on two lesser felony counts of transporting individuals to engage in prostitution. Combs, who had been detained since September, gestured to his family after the verdict, seemingly indicating he would be coming home soon.</p>

          <p>Following his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, a federal judge denied Sean Combs' request for bail ahead of his sentencing. The judge, Arun Subramanian, cited Combs' "propensity for violence," specifically referencing the 2016 hotel surveillance video showing him assaulting his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. The ruling means Combs will remain in federal detention. An attorney for Ventura stated she is at peace with the verdict and may provide a victim impact statement at sentencing.</p>

          <p>A recent poll from the University of California Irvine suggests that former Vice President Kamala Harris would be the favored candidate in the 2026 California gubernatorial race, should she decide to run. The survey shows Harris with 41% support against a generic Republican opponent and leading a field of announced candidates with 24%, despite a large number of undecided voters. Her high name recognition is a significant advantage, with only 5% of Californians unfamiliar with her, a stark contrast to other contenders.

          <p>The UK government has announced a long-term plan to "fundamentally rewire" the National Health Service in England by moving more care out of hospitals and into local communities. The strategy involves creating a network of approximately 200 new neighborhood health centers staffed by a mix of healthcare professionals. These hubs aim to handle a majority of outpatient services, such as scans and follow-up appointments, by 2035. While the government says the plan will reduce hospital waiting lists, nursing and medical unions have raised concerns about staffing and funding for the new services.</p>

          <p>A new book has sparked debate among analysts about whether Apple has become overly dependent on China for its manufacturing and supply chain. The book argues that Apple made a "calamitous mistake" by consolidating its operations within what it calls a "ruthless, authoritarian surveillance state." However, some experts counter that Apple had few realistic alternatives and that participating in China's wave of innovation was essential to becoming the company it is today. The discussion highlights the complex relationship between multinational corporations and China's economic and political landscape.</p>

          <p>An analysis of prices at major U.S. department stores like Macy's and Nordstrom indicates that the cost of consumer goods such as footwear and apparel is rising, reflecting the impact of President Trump's tariffs. Data shows that footwear prices, in particular, have increased by as much as 4% since the beginning of the year. The article notes that the recent trade deal with Vietnam, which imposes a new 20% tariff, will likely exacerbate this trend, as Vietnam is a major manufacturing hub for the apparel and footwear industries.

          <p>The B-2 bomber pilots who conducted a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities are expected to maintain a low profile during a planned July Fourth visit to the White House. President Trump, who invited the pilots to be honored as heroes, has claimed the mission "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. However, for security reasons, no public ceremony is planned and the pilots' identities will not be disclosed. The visit follows a dispute over the mission's effectiveness, with initial intelligence assessments suggesting a more limited setback for Iran than the President has asserted.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized a new trade agreement with Vietnam that will impose a 20% tariff on goods imported from the country, President Trump announced. This rate is lower than the 46% levy that was previously threatened. The deal also includes a much steeper 40% tariff on products that are made in other countries and then routed through Vietnam in a process known as "trans-shipping." In exchange, the agreement reportedly grants the U.S. zero-tariff access to sell American products in Vietnamese markets, a key goal of the administration's trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>
