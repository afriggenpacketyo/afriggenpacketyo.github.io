          <p>A 65-year-old grandmother, known as 'Gangsta Debbs,' has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for orchestrating a massive drug trafficking operation. Deborah Mason recruited her children and other relatives to distribute cocaine worth up to £80 million across England, funding a lavish lifestyle that included designer accessories for her cat. The Metropolitan Police tracked the family's activities for seven months, observing numerous drug handovers and cash collections. The judge condemned Mason for corrupting her family rather than setting a positive example, with other family members also receiving lengthy prison sentences for their roles in the conspiracy.</p>

          <p>Syria's interim government announced plans to send a new military force to the southern Suweida province to stop deadly sectarian violence between Bedouin and Druze communities. The clashes have reportedly resulted in over 700 deaths, with government troops previously accused of committing extrajudicial killings against Druze civilians. Amid the escalating conflict, the US ambassador to Turkey reported that Israel and Syria have agreed to a ceasefire, a claim not yet publicly confirmed by either nation. The UN has called for an end to the bloodshed and accountability for widespread human rights violations reported in the region.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old man from Cardiff is suffering from severe physical and psychological trauma after being attacked by three dogs while protecting a friend and her baby. William Newbury sustained injuries that resulted in the loss of use of two fingers, forcing him out of work and causing significant financial strain. His story highlights a broader trend, with police data showing a rise in dog attacks across England and Wales and thousands seeking medical treatment annually. Survivors like Newbury face long-term challenges, including mental health struggles and the need for ongoing support to cope with the aftermath of such violent incidents.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have developed a new method to produce CAR-T cell therapies directly within the human body, potentially making the advanced treatment for blood cancers and other diseases more accessible and affordable. This innovative gene therapy approach avoids the costly and complex process of engineering cells in a lab, which can currently exceed $139,200 per treatment. Researchers from a Wuhan-based hospital successfully used this in-vivo technique on four patients with multiple myeloma, a common form of blood cancer. The breakthrough, published in The Lancet, could significantly reduce costs and simplify the delivery of this promising immunotherapy worldwide.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for severe weather, with the Met Office issuing an amber warning for thunderstorms and torrential rain expected to cause dangerous flash flooding across southern and eastern England. Forecasters predict that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, leading to a high likelihood of property flooding, transport disruptions, and power outages. The risk is amplified because recent heatwaves have left the ground dry and unable to absorb the intense downpour effectively. A less severe yellow warning is also in place for other parts of England and Scotland, urging public caution.</p>

          <p>Italy is facing a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate has fallen to the lowest level ever recorded, with an average of just 1.18 babies per woman. This trend is causing towns like Fregona in northern Italy to empty out, threatening the viability of local services like primary schools. Despite government initiatives such as cash bonuses and tax breaks, many Italians find the support insufficient to overcome the challenges of high childcare costs and career instability. Experts suggest that without massive changes in social services and an increase in immigration, Italy's population will continue to shrink and age, posing significant economic challenges.</p>

The findings, published in a peer-reviewed journal, offer a possible explanation for why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis after their initial treatment appears successful. The research team also identified that combining chemotherapy with specific drugs could inhibit this process in mice.

          <p>Chinese technology firms are increasingly leveraging open-source AI to compete with dominant U.S. companies like OpenAI and Google, which often restrict access to their most advanced models. Companies such as DeepSeek have released powerful, free-to-use large language models that are redefining the global AI landscape and fostering a collaborative development community. This open-source movement provides a viable alternative to the closed systems of Silicon Valley, unleashing a wave of new applications in China and gaining support from developers worldwide. Analysts suggest this trend poses a significant challenge to Western tech supremacy.</p>

          <h2>State Audit Reveals California's Workplace Safety Agency is Critically Understaffed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 21:51:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California state audit has found that the Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is suffering from "critical weakness" due to severe understaffing, hindering its ability to protect the state's 19 million workers. The audit revealed a 32% vacancy rate in the last fiscal year, leading to the agency closing complaint and accident reports without proper on-site inspections. When inspections were conducted, documentation was often poor, and fines were sometimes improperly reduced. The findings echo long-standing criticism that the agency is failing to enforce safety standards, particularly as its responsibilities grow due to climate-related workplace hazards.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal. The suit alleges the newspaper published a false and malicious article claiming Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter, including a crude drawing, to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump vehemently denies authoring the letter and accuses the defendants of attempting to inextricably link him to the disgraced financier. The lawsuit targets the media mogul, corporate executives, and the two reporters who wrote the story, escalating a conflict over media reporting and the Epstein investigation.</p>
