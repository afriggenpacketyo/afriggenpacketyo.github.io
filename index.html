        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group, two of the largest owners of local TV stations in the U.S., have announced they will not air "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following the host's return to ABC. The decision stems from comments Kimmel made linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to the MAGA movement, which the station owners deemed inappropriate. This preemption affects dozens of ABC affiliates nationwide and comes amid pressure from the FCC, whose chairman suggested broadcasters' licenses could be at risk for not operating in the "public interest." The situation highlights growing tensions between national networks and their local affiliates over controversial content.</p>

          <p>During meetings at the United Nations General Assembly, President Trump stated that NATO nations should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace. In a separate meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump praised him as a "brave man" and discussed efforts to end the war, with Zelenskyy supporting the call for Europe to cease buying Russian oil. Domestically, Trump abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with top congressional Democrats regarding government funding, calling their proposals "unserious and ridiculous." This move significantly increases the likelihood of a government shutdown as the September 30 deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that equity prices appear to be "fairly highly valued" by many metrics. Speaking in Rhode Island, Powell explained that the central bank monitors overall financial conditions to ensure its policies are achieving their intended effects. His comments follow a recent market rally spurred by the Fed's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate, which has pushed major stock indices to record highs. Despite noting the high valuations, Powell also stated that he does not believe this is a period of elevated financial stability risks, suggesting a balanced view of the current market environment.</p>

          <p>Country music star Kenny Chesney paid a heartfelt tribute to his friend and collaborator, songwriter Brett James, who died in a plane crash at age 57. The tragic accident, which occurred in North Carolina, also claimed the lives of James's wife, Melody Carole Wilson, and his stepdaughter, Meryl Maxwell Wilson. James was a prolific songwriter, known for co-writing major hits like Carrie Underwood's "Jesus, Take the Wheel" and many of Chesney's own songs.

          <p>President Trump made public statements cautioning pregnant women against using Tylenol, suggesting a link to autism that goes beyond available scientific evidence and the official position of his administration's health agencies. During an event, Trump repeatedly said, "Don't take Tylenol," while acknowledging he was offering his personal "common sense" opinion rather than that of doctors. In contrast, the FDA noted that while an association has been studied, a causal link has not been established. Major medical groups, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, pushed back, calling the claims "irresponsible" and emphasizing that acetaminophen is considered the only safe painkiller during pregnancy.</p>

As part of the shift, Amazon plans to convert five of the existing Fresh locations into Whole Foods stores, the upscale supermarket chain it acquired in 2017.

          <p>Recent actions by the Trump administration, including warnings about a supposed link between Tylenol and autism and chaotic updates to vaccine guidance, are fueling concerns about ideology overriding science in public health policy.

Public health experts worry that this politicization creates a vacuum of clear guidance, leaving parents uncertain about how to protect their children.

Campbell draws parallels between Kimmel's current situation and his own legal battles over his album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be," where he successfully fought obscenity charges and set a precedent for free speech. He argues that if Kimmel concedes to pressure from the FCC and station owners pulling his show, it will set a dangerous precedent for all media.

According to her spokesperson at the time, the apology was sent after Epstein made a "menacing and nasty" phone call in which he threatened to "destroy" her and her family for describing him as a paedophile in an interview. The revelation of this email has prompted several charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust, to sever ties with the Duchess.

The lawsuit claimed that airline employees failed to follow their own protocols when the man, Jesus Plasencia, showed initial stroke symptoms at the gate, with the pilot dismissing concerns and clearing the flight for takeoff. A second, more severe stroke occurred mid-flight, but the crew did not divert the plane, delaying critical medical care for nearly eight hours. As a result, Plasencia is now unable to speak or write and requires constant care.</p>

In August, a judge dismissed his claim, ruling that the newspaper had successfully defended its reporting on the grounds of truth and public interest. During the hearing, Clarke stated that he has lost his work, savings, and ability to support his family, but the judge ruled the payment was appropriate for pursuing a "false case."</p>

However, he also expressed concern about the high uncertainty surrounding the path of inflation, acknowledging that policymakers face a difficult balancing act.

However, critics argue the exorbitant fee will harm American innovation by making it prohibitive for universities, nonprofits, and smaller companies to hire essential foreign researchers and specialists.

The agency is now targeting a launch as early as February 2026, ahead of its previous April schedule, citing that preparations are proceeding well. The 10-day mission is a critical step in NASA's program to return humans to the lunar surface. The push comes amid a renewed sense of a "second space race," as China advances its own lunar program with the goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by 2030.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association predicts that Americans will face higher costs to heat their homes this winter, with the average energy bill expected to increase by 7.6% to $976. Households relying on electricity could see a 10.2% jump, while natural gas users may face an 8.4% increase, far outpacing general inflation. The rising costs are attributed to grid maintenance expenses, higher natural gas prices, and increased electricity demand. This follows a summer of record-high air-conditioning bills, compounding financial strain on households already dealing with record levels of debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a period of strengthening earlier in the year, the growth of single-family home rents began to slow in July, potentially signaling that landlords are adjusting to consumers' financial struggles.

Monthly growth was also significantly weaker than historical averages for July. While markets like Chicago still show robust growth, others like Miami have cooled dramatically, with the southern Florida city seeing no annual rent growth at all after a pandemic-era surge.

          <p>President Trump's recent address to the United Nations General Assembly is being described as a bizarre and incoherent performance that alienated allies and embarrassed the nation. During the speech, Trump repeated false claims about his administration's accomplishments, attacked clean energy as a "con job," and bragged about his approval ratings and campaign merchandise sales. His remarks were a departure from his 2018 speech where diplomats laughed at his boasts; this time, the tone was more serious, reflecting a global recognition of his strained relationship with reality. The speech underscored a vision of American foreign policy that is increasingly isolated and unpredictable.</p>

          <p>President Trump has abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, significantly increasing the probability of a government shutdown on October 1. Trump announced the cancellation on social media, stating that a meeting would not be productive after reviewing what he called the Democrats' "unserious and ridiculous demands" in their funding proposal. Democratic leaders accused the president of throwing a "tantrum" and running away from negotiations, asserting that he will be responsible for any resulting shutdown. With both chambers on recess, there is no clear path forward to pass a funding bill.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults are embracing a mindset dubbed "financial nihilism," turning to high-risk speculative investments like meme stocks, crypto, and sports betting. This trend is driven by a widespread feeling that traditional paths to wealth, such as homeownership and stable careers, are increasingly out of reach due to soaring costs, debt, and a tight job market. Rather than pursuing slow, steady growth, these individuals are "swinging for the fences" in hopes of a life-changing windfall. This behavior is seen by some experts not as irrational, but as a logical response to an economic system they feel has left them behind.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal research grants to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) that had been frozen. The judge ruled that the administration likely violated federal law by not providing specific procedures or explanations for the funding cuts, which were related to allegations of civil rights violations. The administration has been using its control over federal funding to pressure elite universities over issues like campus antisemitism and diversity initiatives. This ruling concerns hundreds of medical research grants, including studies on Parkinson's disease and cancer recovery.</p>
