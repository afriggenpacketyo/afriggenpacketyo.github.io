        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Negotiations in Geneva aimed at creating a landmark, legally binding treaty to combat plastic pollution have concluded without a final agreement. Delegates from 184 countries were deadlocked on key issues, particularly whether to impose mandatory caps on new plastic production, a measure opposed by oil-producing nations and the plastics industry. Despite disappointment from many nations and environmental groups, the latest draft is seen as a basis for future talks, as the world continues to grapple with over 400 million tons of new plastic produced annually.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Danish brewer Carlsberg has noted a significant shift in consumer drinking habits, with cost-conscious buyers increasingly choosing either premium or economy beers over traditional core brands. This "bifurcation" is squeezing mid-range products as the global consumer experiences a spending pause, leading to declining sales volumes for major brewers. The trend also shows a preference for at-home consumption over more expensive bar and restaurant options, reflecting broader macroeconomic headwinds affecting the beverage industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With about one-third of adults experiencing insomnia, which is often exacerbated by summer heat, several evidence-based strategies can improve sleep quality. Regular daytime exercise has been shown to increase sleep duration and melatonin production, while reducing stress. Experts also recommend avoiding caffeine within nine hours of bedtime and reducing screen time before sleep, as bright lights can disrupt natural sleep cycles. While the popular "4-7-8" breathing technique lacks rigorous scientific backing, many find it anecdotally effective for calming the nervous system and promoting faster sleep.</p>

Trump has expressed cautious optimism, suggesting he will know quickly if the meeting will be productive and stating there is a "25% chance of failure." German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged Putin to take the talks seriously, while emphasizing that any peace agreement must involve Ukraine and be negotiated without preconditions, placing the future of the conflict at the center of the high-stakes diplomatic discussions.</p>

          <p>A new study from Tsinghua University reveals that China has produced over one billion tonnes of textile fibers in the last four decades, an amount roughly equivalent to twice the total human mass on Earth. This massive output has cemented China's role as a dominant force in the global textile industry, accounting for more than half of the world's processing capacity. However, the research also highlights significant environmental challenges, noting that China's textile waste recovery rate is only 17%, with most of it being downcycled into lower-quality products.</p>

          <p>The arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, for a peace summit has elicited strong and divided reactions from the local community. Many residents, including Ukrainian-Americans, protested the meeting, expressing disgust that Putin was welcomed on U.S. soil and sadness that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy was not invited. Others, however, voiced hope that the talks could bring an end to the destructive war in Ukraine, reflecting the complex emotions surrounding the high-stakes diplomatic event in a state with historical ties to Russia.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of deliberately trying to sabotage the peace summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin.

          <h2>Analysts Suggest Putin Will Exploit Trump's Weaknesses in High-Stakes Negotiations</h2>

          <p>As Vladimir Putin meets with Donald Trump, analysts believe the experienced Russian leader will leverage his deep knowledge of the conflict's details against Trump's more transactional and less detail-oriented style. Putin's strategy is likely to involve exploiting Trump's desire for a quick resolution and public credit, potentially by offering superficial concessions. The Russian delegation's inclusion of economic and defense ministers also suggests Putin may tempt Trump with deals on trade or arms control to secure a peace agreement favorable to Moscow's terms.</p>

          <p>An Australian man who murdered Emma Lovell, a British immigrant, during a home invasion on Boxing Day in 2022 will be eligible for release sooner after a successful appeal. The attacker, who was 17 at the time, had his non-parole period reduced from 70% to 60% of his 14-year sentence, cutting his minimum time served by 17 months. The Queensland Court of Appeal cited the man's early guilty plea, genuine remorse, and troubled upbringing as reasons for the reduction, a decision in a case that previously sparked outrage and led to stricter youth crime laws.</p>

The man's death has intensified criticism of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, which opponents argue terrorize communities and create dangerous, chaotic situations that put lives at risk.</p>

          <p>President Trump falsely asserted that crime in Washington D.C. is at an all-time high as his administration's federal takeover of the city's policing escalates. The federal operation has included deploying National Guard troops, clearing homeless encampments, and establishing law enforcement checkpoints, leading to protests. As part of the takeover, Attorney General Pam Bondi has named the head of the DEA as the city's "emergency police commissioner," a move local officials have decried as an unlawful power grab that undermines the city's autonomy.</p>

The main points of contention in the contract negotiations are wages, which the union describes as "poverty wages," and compensation for unpaid work time.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that state Democrats will advance a plan to redraw their own congressional district maps, a direct response to a Republican effort in Texas to create new maps favorable to the GOP. The move, which would override California's independent redistricting commission, is designed to "neuter and neutralize" the Texas plan and would only take effect if a Republican-led state implements a partisan mid-cycle gerrymander. Newsom has called for a special election to approve the new map, escalating a national political "arms race" over redistricting.</p>

          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with its protagonist, Carrie Bradshaw, single once again, an ending that some critics are calling more true to the character than the original "Sex and the City" finale. After becoming a widow and navigating new relationships, the show ends with Carrie accepting a future that may not include another great romance, instead reaffirming that friendships are the most enduring soulmates. While the spin-off was often criticized, its conclusion is seen as a daring and fitting bookend for a cultural touchstone.</p>
