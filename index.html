          <p>Xaviar Babudar, known as "ChiefsAholic," was sentenced to 32 years in Oklahoma prison for robbing a Tulsa-area bank, to be served after his federal prison term. Babudar apologized in court to the victims of the December 2022 robbery of the Tulsa Teachers Credit Union in Bixby, Oklahoma. He is already serving over 17 years in federal prison for 11 bank robberies across seven states, stealing nearly $850,000 to fund his social media presence and gambling addiction. The Tulsa County District Attorney sought a life sentence for Babudar, but the judge ordered the state sentence to run concurrently with the federal sentence.</p>

          <p>The political landscape in the Philippines is once again dominated by the power struggle between the Marcos and Duterte families. President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. and Vice-President Sara Duterte are engaged in a bitter feud, intensified by recent mid-term elections. The results weakened Marcos' authority, with only six senators from his alliance elected, while four are in the Duterte camp. The deterioration of their relationship includes impeachment attempts against Duterte and criminal charges filed against her, with Sara being the frontrunner for the next presidential election, potentially seeking vengeance against the Marcos family.</p>

What began as a health kick in 2017 spiraled into excessive exercising, minimal eating, and avoidance of social situations involving food. After nearly fainting at work, he was advised to take time off, and faced the threat of being sectioned under the Mental Health Act if he didn't improve. Suppiah, now 41, managed to turn things around, but not without significant difficulty.</p>

UBS now projects China's GDP growth in 2025 could climb to between 3.7% and 4%, up from a previous estimate of 3.4%.

Despite optimism among tech entrepreneurs, concerns remain about whether technological progress alone can overcome these economic imbalances.

While headline changes suggest a shift to 30% tariffs on Chinese goods and 10% on American exports, these rates do not include previous tariffs from earlier trade war iterations. The effective tariff rate for Chinese exporters is estimated at around 50%, factoring in both new and existing duties.

However, a broad decline in interest rates now poses a challenge to these fintechs, raising doubts about the sustainability of relying on heightened income. Some fintechs are diversifying revenue streams to reduce dependence on interest and card fees, and those with diversified income or strong customer monetization are better positioned to weather economic changes (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Michael Ratney, former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, argues for a reevaluation of perceptions towards the country, highlighting its significant transformation. Despite concerns about human rights and political dissent, Saudi Arabia has made strides in social and economic reforms, including dismantling guardianship laws and investing in renewable energy. Ratney emphasizes that Saudi Arabia's success is in America's interest, citing shared ambitions in AI, renewable energy, and regional stability. He suggests easing export restrictions on advanced chips and defense systems to foster cooperation, while addressing concerns about American citizens' treatment in the kingdom.</p>

          <p>Ryan McCarthy, former Secretary of the Army, discusses the need for the Army to adapt to new threats, particularly from China, by focusing on border security and missile defense. He details the efforts during the Trump administration to modernize the Army by redirecting funds towards advanced weaponry and establishing the Army Futures Command. McCarthy criticizes the Biden administration for allowing these efforts to wane and emphasizes the importance of streamlining weapons acquisitions and empowering commanders to make decisions. He advocates for Congress to provide greater funding flexibility to enable the military to adapt to evolving technologies.</p>

          <p>A woman named Kate discovered her husband had been drugging and sexually assaulting her for years, taking photographs while she was asleep. After his confession, she initially hesitated to report him, but later went to the police after her health deteriorated. The investigation revealed that he had confessed to a psychiatrist about drugging his wife for sexual purposes. Despite initial rejection, the Crown Prosecution Service eventually charged him. He was found guilty of rape, sexual assault by penetration, and administering a substance with intent, and sentenced to 11 years in prison.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is ending gender transition treatment for transgender troops, implementing President Donald Trump's plan to remove transgender individuals from the U.S. military. The Defense Department is prohibiting new hormone treatments or surgical procedures for transgender troops, and one service member described the move as "the latest slap in the face." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth expressed his opposition to taxpayer funding for such treatments, and the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the administration to implement its ban on transgender troops.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-China tariff cuts, even if temporary, could alleviate concerns about Christmas present supplies. Retailers typically place orders months in advance, and the sudden doubling of tariffs in early April threatened to disrupt production. The 90-day window may prevent a Christmas disaster for retailers, according to analysts. However, duties aren't completely gone, as tariffs imposed earlier in the year remain in place. The total weighted average U.S. tariff rate on Chinese products is estimated at 43.5%, and some companies have had to raise prices to offset the impact.</p>

          <p>A study analyzing seismic waves from marsquakes detected by NASA's InSight lander suggests the presence of liquid water just a few kilometers beneath the Martian surface. The research, led by a Chinese team, revealed a mysterious zone in the planet's crust best explained by water-saturated rock. If confirmed, this underground layer could hold a significant amount of water, potentially matching Mars' missing water. This discovery could reshape understanding of Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines how German companies are reevaluating their investments in the United States due to trade tensions. Despite investing three times as much in the U.S. as American companies do in Germany, German firms are growing more cautious. Surveys indicate that German manufacturers are pulling back from investing in the U.S. and are more gloomy about their futures there. While some companies like Haribo have committed to local production, others are keeping investments at home, hoping for improved conditions under a new German government.</p>
