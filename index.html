          <p>The eastern United States is experiencing a severe heat wave, with several cities reporting record-high temperatures due to a "heat dome" phenomenon. New York City's JFK Airport reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time since 2013, and other cities like Boston and Baltimore are also facing soaring temperatures. Hospitals are seeing an increase in heat-related illnesses, and public transportation is experiencing disruptions. Over 150 million people are under heat warnings, prompting utilities to urge customers to conserve power, while electronics stores report a surge in air conditioner and fan sales. The National Weather Service predicts some relief by the weekend, though conditions will remain hot. </p>

          <p>Japan and NATO have agreed to enhance their collaboration to address pressing global security challenges, including the Middle East crisis, Russia's war in Ukraine, and North Korea's abductions of Japanese nationals. During discussions between Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in The Hague, both parties affirmed their commitment to elevating cooperation across various sectors, notably in defense industries. SBI Shinsei Bank plans to repay the remaining 230 billion yen in public funds received after the collapse of its predecessor, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, following Japan's asset price bubble. An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.0 hit Akuseki Island in the Tokara island chain in southwestern Japan, following more than 330 quakes recorded around the chain since Saturday.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has voiced his discontent with both Israel and Iran, alleging violations of the ceasefire he brokered, as indicated by satellite images revealing damage to Iran's Fordo nuclear facility following U.S. strikes. Despite announcing the ceasefire, Trump stated that both countries had "violated" the agreement. The president and his administration also contested an early intelligence report that suggested the U.S. strikes only marginally delayed Iran's nuclear program.

          <p>A study led by China suggests that a global solar-wind energy network could meet the world's energy demands by 2050, producing three times the necessary power at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The researchers propose a network that leverages regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents. They acknowledge that establishing such a system requires navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises, such as the Ukraine war. The study highlights that successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease the economic burden of decarbonization, and provide resilience against conflict and climate extremes. </p>

          <p>IVF patients are being cautioned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after Apricity Fertility went bust, leaving many without treatment or refunds. These online concierge companies act as middlemen between patients, donors, and doctors but are not regulated by the fertility watchdog. Patients like Syreeta Sandhu lost significant amounts of money when Apricity ceased operations, highlighting the risks involved. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) is calling for stronger laws to protect patients using these services. </p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling she was unfairly sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza. Lattouf claimed the ABC cut short her stint as a fill-in radio presenter due to her political views and lobbying from pro-Israel groups. The ABC argued her post breached its editorial policy, but the court found that she was sacked for her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. She was awarded damages of A$70,000. </p>

The deal addresses a $12-billion budget deficit through borrowing, tapping reserves, and shifting funds. The agreement reduces the expansion of state-sponsored healthcare to undocumented immigrants and reinstates asset limit tests for Medi-Cal enrollees. The budget also includes $750 million to expand the California Film and Television Tax Credit, and the deal is expected to serve as a precursor to more challenging financial discussions about additional reductions in the months ahead. </p>

          <p>A preliminary US intelligence assessment reportedly found that Iran's nuclear program has only been set back by a few months following US strikes on Iran's key nuclear facilities, according to Reuters.

The assessment is at odds with US President Donald Trump's assertions over the weekend that the US strikes had "fully obliterated" Iran's nuclear program.

          <p>Andrew Biscay, 40, was arrested in Madera County, California, on suspicion of impersonating a U.S. Marshal and other felonies. Deputies found a self-manufactured firearm, a makeshift uniform, and other crude law enforcement equipment in his possession. The arrest comes amid increased concerns about individuals impersonating law enforcement officers in California. Authorities have asked anyone who suspects they may have encountered an individual falsely identifying themselves as law enforcement to contact the Sheriff’s Office. </p>
