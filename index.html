            <p>Global markets experienced a significant upswing after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for most countries, excluding China, where tariffs were increased to 125%. Japan's Nikkei 225 index led the surge with a 9.1% jump, reflecting investor relief. Despite the global rally, U.S. futures indicated a downward trend, and oil prices also declined, suggesting some underlying economic concerns. Treasury Secretary Bessent clarified that the 10% tariff on nearly all global imports would remain, and that China was a huge exception, with Trump saying tariffs are going up to 125% against its products.

            <p>A UK parliamentary committee is advocating for a 5% levy on streaming services' UK subscription revenues to bolster the British TV production industry, with concerns that the rise of streaming platforms is overshadowing independent British producers and potentially limiting the creation of uniquely British content. The proposal aims to ensure that streaming giants contribute to the funding of dramas with specific relevance to British audiences, but industry representatives argue that such a levy could stifle investment in UK content and increase costs for consumers. The call for support comes amid a reported decline in domestic high-end TV productions in the UK, highlighting the need for intervention to safeguard the industry's future.</p>

            <p>Following President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian accused the U.S. of using tariffs as a weapon for selfish gains, a move he characterized as against the whole world. Lin emphasized that Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, now at 84%, are intended to protect the Chinese economy and the common interests of the international community. He asserted that trade wars have no winners and that the U.S.'s actions lack international support and are doomed to fail. The escalating trade tensions highlight the growing rift between the two economic superpowers.</p>

            <p>Chinese economists suggest that the escalating US-China trade war, marked by unprecedented tariff levels, is evolving into a test of economic resilience for both nations, with the US imposing a 125% tariff on Chinese imports and China retaliating with an 84% levy on US goods. Zheng Yongnian of CUHK-Shenzhen emphasized that the competition is about building industrial systems with strong economic resilience to secure a dominant position in the long term. Economists also suggest that China needs to implement stronger government stimulus measures to boost domestic demand in order to navigate the turbulent economic environment created by the trade war.</p>

            <p>A recent WHO report reveals that a woman dies every two minutes due to failures in maternal healthcare, with 260,000 maternal deaths recorded in 2023, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. Health organizations warn that cuts to international aid by the US and the UK are jeopardizing progress in reducing maternal mortality rates, with potential reversals in countries dependent on US-funded programs. The report highlights inequalities in maternal mortality rates between high- and low-income countries, with half of all maternal deaths occurring in Nigeria, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Pakistan, prompting calls for increased investment and political commitment to prevent these preventable deaths.</p>

            <p>Carjackings are on the rise in the United States, with Washington, D.C., experiencing the highest vehicle theft rate in 2023, fueled by teenage carjackers and international crime rings shipping stolen luxury vehicles overseas, particularly to West Africa. Soft-on-crime policies in major cities are seen as contributing to the problem, with thieves facing minimal penalties if caught. Stolen vehicles are often moved through ports in New York and New Jersey, then shipped overseas with falsified documentation, making them difficult to trace. Interpol is increasing efforts to combat the international sale of stolen cars, but the problem persists due to local gangs and corrupt officials in destination countries.</p>

            <p>A long-standing narrative suggests that NBA coach Tom Thibodeau overplays his starters, leading to increased injury risk, but a deeper analysis of injury data reveals no clear or consistent pattern showing Thibodeau-coached players are more prone to injury than others. While injury spikes occurred during his tenure with the Bulls, they were largely attributed to specific players like Derrick Rose and Richard Hamilton, rather than a widespread trend. NBA injury data is complex, but the study found that injuries have been rising across the league for over a decade, regardless of coaching style, playing time, or load management, suggesting that other factors, such as increased basketball activity before the NBA, may be contributing to the trend.</p>

While the U.S. has long participated in military exercises in Panama, the idea of a longer-term rotational force is politically sensitive for Panama, which views sole ownership of the canal as a source of national pride.

            <p>Isa Guha describes Charlotte Edwards as a mesmerizing batter with an ability to predict what was coming, making it difficult to plan her dismissal. As captain, Edwards faced challenges early on but led by example, eventually guiding England to unprecedented success, including both the T20 and 50-over World Cups in 2009. Guha emphasizes Edwards' ability to make tough calls to protect the team and her empathetic approach, suggesting she will bring a clear vision and won't hesitate to make difficult decisions as head coach.</p>

            <p>Paul Mullin, Wrexham's star striker, has faced an unusual season marked by injuries and limited playing time, with only nine starts and a significantly lower goal tally compared to previous seasons. Despite his past successes and celebrity connections, Mullin has struggled to regain his form after recovering from back surgery, leading to increased competition from new signings. While Mullin's contributions have been celebrated, the arrival of new strikers and the team's focus on winning have limited his opportunities, highlighting the ruthless nature of professional sports.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices have declined for a second consecutive month, while producer price deflation has deepened, as Chinese exporters prepare for further challenges amid an escalating trade war with the U.S. The consumer price index slid 0.1% year-on-year in March, and producer prices fell for the 29th straight month, dropping 2.5% year-on-year, prompting economists to anticipate a divergence between consumer and producer prices. The data signals a potential inflection point driven by policy stimulus measures aimed at boosting consumption, but deflationary pressure in producer prices is likely to persist due to uncertainties surrounding oil prices and external demand.</p>

            <p>Despite anticipated economic challenges stemming from the intensifying tariff war between Washington and Beijing, many Chinese citizens express support for Beijing's retaliatory measures and a firm stance. Frustration and concern are prevalent among Chinese surveyed, with some viewing China as a target regardless of its actions, leading to widespread support for Beijing's decision to retaliate with 84 per cent tariffs on all US products. The resolve to fight "to the end" underscores a unified sentiment among many Chinese in the face of escalating trade tensions.</p>

            <p>A New York jury has awarded $1.68 billion in damages to 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse and other crimes over a 35-year period. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed in Manhattan in 2022 after New York state instituted a one-year window for people to file lawsuits over sexual assault claims even if they took place decades ago. The verdict included $280 million in compensatory damages and $1.4 billion for punitive damages to the plaintiffs, marking one of the largest jury awards since the advent of the #MeToo movement. It is about taking power back from the abusers — and their and enablers — and returning it to those he tried to control and silence.</p>

            <p>Analysts warn that despite President Trump's 90-day pause on punitive levies, the recent market chaos is likely just the beginning, with no shift in his overall objectives, as tariffs on imports from China were raised to 125 per cent. Stephen Olson of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, cautioned this means the world’s two largest economies remain locked in a dangerous, intensifying trade war. Victor Gao, vice-president of the Beijing-based think tank Centre for China and Globalisation said, “It will cause a lot of pain not only to China and the US, but to other countries.”</p>
