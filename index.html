            <h2>Alaskan Lawmakers Grapple with Market Instability Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Alaska's lawmakers are facing budgetary challenges due to market volatility caused by President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies and a subsequent drop in oil prices. The uncertainty has intensified existing debates over the allocation of funds between the annual oil-wealth fund check for residents and essential services like education. With the legislative session nearing its end, lawmakers are struggling to find consensus on raising taxes or addressing recurring budget deficits, further complicating the state's financial situation. Some leaders hope the tariffs could incentivize countries to invest in Alaska's proposed liquefied natural gas project. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. Department of Education is moving to withhold federal funds from Maine after the state refused to sign a Title IX resolution agreement that would ban transgender athletes from competing in girls' sports. Maine's Assistant Attorney General asserted that Title IX does not prohibit transgender girls from participating on girls' sports teams, citing federal court rulings. The Department of Education will initiate administrative proceedings to terminate Maine's K-12 education funding and refer the case to the Department of Justice. The dispute stems from President Trump's executive order banning transgender athletes from women's sports.</p>

            <p>President Trump's recent pause on tariffs has sparked confusion and uncertainty among economists and businesses, with some likening the situation to 'the boy who cried wolf.' The administration's inconsistent messaging and shifting justifications for tariffs have eroded confidence in trade agreements and created a chilling effect on cross-border transactions. While the pause has averted immediate supply chain chaos, the long-term economic costs of erratic policymaking and heightened tensions between the U.S. and China remain a significant concern. Economists warn of potential stagflation and the risk of overlooking the importance of the service sector in the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A now-infamous Swedish eco-retreat, once celebrated as a model of sustainable living, has been exposed for environmental crimes and financial misconduct. The owners reportedly fled to Guatemala, leaving behind unpaid taxes, neglected animals, and improperly disposed waste. This scandal has shaken Scandinavia and raised questions about the authenticity of sustainable tourism, challenging the notion that eco-friendly projects can thrive amidst high taxes and bureaucracy. The incident serves as a reminder to critically assess seemingly idyllic representations of sustainable living and be wary of taking Instagram images at face value.</p>

            <p>Some American tourists in Paris are expressing feelings of shame and embarrassment due to President Trump's recent actions on global trading tariffs. Some tourists are taking measures to conceal their nationality, such as covering up American flags on their clothing, fearing they may be treated differently. This sentiment reflects a broader transatlantic rift, with a decrease in French tourists traveling to the U.S. and increasing pessimism among French expatriates living in the country. However, some still support President Trump's actions, viewing them as necessary for national sovereignty.</p>

While the Chinese owners would remain shareholders for now, the government's actions suggest a move towards public ownership to safeguard infrastructure, jobs, and the UK's steel-making capability.

            <p>The U.S. House is reevaluating its voting rules following a push by Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna to allow proxy voting for new parents. Luna's initial proposal, intended as a minor rule change, escalated into a partisan standoff, uniting younger lawmakers and raising questions about accommodating working parents. Despite facing opposition from Republican leadership, Luna collaborated with Democrats to draft a new proposal extending proxy voting to all new parents for 12 weeks. The debate highlighted the challenges of adapting outdated rules to modern realities and the evolving needs of members of Congress.</p>
