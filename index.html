            <p>Following the U.S.'s implementation of substantial tariffs on Chinese products, Beijing has responded by imposing an 84% tariff on goods imported from the United States, escalating the ongoing trade war between the two economic powerhouses. This retaliatory measure comes after President Trump's decision to impose a 104% tariff rate on China, a move he described as necessary to correct trade imbalances. The escalating tensions have triggered significant losses in the stock market, raising concerns about the potential economic consequences of the trade war. This situation is creating uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Germany's centrist parties, including the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Christian Social Union (CSU), and Social Democratic Party (SPD), have finalized a coalition agreement to form the country's new government.

CDU leader Friedrich Merz is expected to become Germany's next chancellor, facing pressure to avoid excessive concessions to the SPD.

            <p>The acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Melanie Krause, plans to resign following the agency's agreement to share taxpayer data with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The deal, signed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, allows DHS access to taxpayer information, prompting worries about taxpayer privacy and potential impacts on tax collections from undocumented workers.

            <p>The bond market is experiencing unusual volatility, with prices plummeting and yields spiking, despite growing fears of a recession. The 10-year Treasury yield briefly surpassed 4.5%, reaching its highest level since February, while the 30-year Treasury yield hit a high not seen since November 2023. This market behavior is confounding Wall Street, as investors typically flock to bonds as a safe haven during economic downturns. The sell-off is attributed to President Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from China, which are creating economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The government maintains that the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (Ravec) has the authority to determine security levels, and that its chair is well-placed to make informed decisions.

            <h2>California Prison Drug Tests Yield False Positives, Impacting Parole Decisions</h2>

            <p>Thousands of drug tests used in California prisons last year are suspected of producing false positive results, potentially jeopardizing parole requests. The issue stems from a switch in reagents by Quest Diagnostics, leading to a significant spike in positive opiate tests. While prison officials have acknowledged the problem, they have yet to clear affected individuals' records or reverse the consequences they faced. Attorneys argue that the unreliable tests should not influence parole decisions, as they can unfairly impact incarcerated individuals' chances of freedom.</p>

            <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon believes a U.S. recession is a likely outcome due to President Trump's tariff policies, which are roiling financial markets. He noted the significant decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and its potential impact on consumer confidence and spending. Dimon, who previously supported tariffs, now encourages the U.S. to negotiate trade deals to avoid further market deterioration. JPMorgan economists expect a mild contraction of 0.3% in U.S. GDP this year. (not investment advice)</p>
