          <p>A recent 60 Minutes report highlighted the growing popularity of egg freezing among young women, detailing the medical procedure where eggs are harvested, frozen, and stored for future use. The article discusses the high costs associated with egg freezing, averaging around $12,000 to $13,000 per cycle, with additional expenses for storage and later IVF procedures. While some companies are beginning to offer egg freezing as a benefit, the majority of women still pay out of pocket. Doctors emphasize that egg freezing does not guarantee pregnancy, and women should be aware of the drop-off rates at each stage, from thawing to implantation.</p>

          <p>As egg freezing becomes more prevalent, some experts, like Vardit Ravitsky, caution against viewing it as a guaranteed solution to delaying childbearing. The article emphasizes the high costs, both financial and emotional, associated with egg freezing, noting that a single cycle can cost upwards of $12,000, with additional storage and fertilization fees. Ravitsky also points out the risks associated with pregnancy at an older age, highlighting that success is not assured, as illustrated by stories of women whose frozen eggs did not result in a viable pregnancy. The article also raises concerns about the commercialization of fertility services, with private equity firms potentially creating warped incentives for doctors.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent executive orders targeting law firms with connections to investigations or legal cases involving him or his allies are raising concerns about the rule of law. The orders threaten to bar attorneys from courthouses and federal agencies and cancel contracts of law firm clients, leading to potential financial ruin. Nine major firms reportedly made a deal with the White House, agreeing to provide nearly $1 billion in legal services to causes supported by the firms and Trump. Critics argue that these actions are unprecedented and undermine the right to legal representation, potentially leading to a chilling effect on lawyers taking cases against the administration.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's civil rights division is investigating the Hennepin County prosecutor's office in Minnesota over a policy that instructs staff members to consider "racial disparities" in plea negotiations. The investigation will determine if the policy illegally considers race as a factor in prosecutorial decision-making. The inquiry stems from a memo in which prosecutors were told to be aware of racial or age considerations in plea negotiations and sentencing. The Justice Department's investigation comes amid a tumultuous time for the civil rights division, with numerous resignations and demands for new types of investigations.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would talk to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about making Canada the 51st state, but didn't expect to use military force. However, regarding Greenland, Trump said, "Something could happen with Greenland, I'll be honest," citing national and international security needs. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in securing U.S. control of Greenland. He also claimed that the U.S. subsidizes Canada and that North America would be "beautiful" without the U.S.-Canadian border.</p>
