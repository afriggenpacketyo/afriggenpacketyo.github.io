          <p>A state-backed Chinese think tank, Xinhua Institute, suggests four core principles to resolve disputes in the South China Sea, emphasizing consultation, rules-based co-management, mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposition to external interference. The report asserts China's commitment to managing tensions and exercising restraint. These principles were initially presented in 2002 through an agreement with Asean. The proposal comes amidst increasing face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels, particularly near contested shoals and reefs, exacerbating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has called on the police to "do their bit" regarding funding, advocating for modernization and embracing technology. This comes as the Home Office and Treasury negotiate the upcoming Spending Review.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to outline departmental spending plans for the next three to four years, amidst warnings that not all departments will receive their desired funding levels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the suggestion of deploying US Marines in response to immigration protests as "deranged behavior," following a statement from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Tensions in Los Angeles escalated after immigration raids led to clashes between protesters and law enforcement, with tear gas deployed and property damage reported. While Trump promised to send in the National Guard, Newsom confirmed the federal government was "moving to take over" the state's National Guard, a move he deemed inflammatory. The Los Angeles mayor stated that the National Guard has not yet been deployed.</p>

          <p>An opinion article discusses how China's perception of the United States' threat of "peaceful evolution" has diminished, referencing Mao Zedong's warnings about American conspiracies to subvert the Communist Party. The author notes that while Mao feared the influence of Western values, China has since become a major economic power. The US has shifted away from nation-building and lecturing other countries on governance. This shift marks a significant change in the dynamics between the two nations, as China increasingly challenges America's superpower status.</p>

However, the book contains score-settling with establishment figures and fails to address Musk's criticisms of Trump's policies. Gingrich also touches on historical events, such as the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and claims credit for Trump's alignment with conservative figures, while also revealing differences on issues like Iran and immigration.</p>

          <p>The deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles following immigration raids is seen as more than just an effort to quell protests. The move is interpreted as a message to Democratic-run cities that resist the mass deportation of immigrants. It suggests a strategy of retribution against places that oppose the administration's immigration policies. This action raises concerns about the use of federal power to target areas with differing political views.</p>

          <p>Italians are voting in referendums on changes to citizenship and labor laws, triggered by an NGO-led grassroots campaign. The vote includes questions about reducing the residency requirement for citizenship applications for non-EU residents and enhancing worker protections against dismissal. While the center-left Democratic Party supports the measures, the governing right-wing coalition led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is urging abstention, hoping to prevent the 50% turnout required for the results to be binding.

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget includes cuts to Pell Grants, potentially reducing college access for low-income students. The maximum Pell Grant for the 2026-2027 academic year would be at its lowest level in more than a decade, impacting the lowest-income families. Experts warn that these cuts could force students to drop out or take on more debt to complete their degrees. The Pell program relies on both mandatory and discretionary funding, and a projected shortfall has led to the proposed cuts.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's spending bill, known as Section 899, is causing concern on Wall Street due to its potential impact on foreign investors. The measure would allow the U.S. to impose a new tax of up to 20% on foreigners with U.S. investments if their home country levies "unfair foreign taxes" against U.S. companies. Analysts warn that this "revenge tax" could limit foreign investment and increase withholding taxes on passive investment income. The Investment Company Institute has expressed concerns about the potential limitations on foreign investment to the U.S.</p>
