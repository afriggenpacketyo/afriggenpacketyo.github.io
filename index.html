        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has instructed the Department of Commerce to develop a census that excludes undocumented immigrants, a move with significant constitutional and logistical challenges. The U.S. Constitution mandates a decennial count of all persons for congressional apportionment, and the Census Bureau has already been planning the 2030 census for years. This directive revives the contentious debate over adding a citizenship question, which was previously blocked by the Supreme Court but could be revisited with a longer legal runway. Critics worry this could lead to significant undercounts of minority populations, affecting political representation and federal funding.</p>

          <p>Rocket and lunar lander manufacturer Firefly Aerospace experienced a successful public debut on the Nasdaq, with its stock jumping over 50% to open at $70 per share. The company raised $868 million in its IPO, pricing shares well above the expected range, which values the company near $10 billion. This strong performance reflects growing investor confidence in the space technology sector, following Firefly's recent successes, including a NASA-funded moon landing and a contract backlog of $1.1 billion. The event marks another high point for the tech IPO market in 2025.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has begun detaining dozens of migrants who crossed the English Channel under a new pilot scheme with France. The "one in, one out" deal allows the UK to return migrants who arrive on small boats to France, with the first returns expected within weeks. In exchange, the UK will accept an equal number of vetted asylum seekers from France. The government has stated that anyone arriving by boat is now eligible for immediate detention and return, a policy aimed at deterring illegal crossings, which have risen significantly this year.</p>

          <p>On prediction markets, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has emerged as the new favorite to become the next Fed chair, with his probability crossing 50% on Kalshi. This surge followed reports that President Trump's advisors are impressed with Waller's openness to adjusting monetary policy based on forecasts. Waller, a Trump appointee, recently dissented from the Fed's decision to hold rates steady, a dovish stance that could be seen as favorable to investors and the administration's goals for lower interest rates.

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Firing of BLS Commissioner an Act Not Even Nixon Dared</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical analysis comparing President Trump's recent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner to President Nixon's conflict with the agency in 1971. While a furious Nixon ordered an investigation into BLS officials he believed were disloyal, he stopped short of directly firing the commissioner due to the political norms of his time. The author argues that Trump's public dismissal of the commissioner over allegedly "rigged" job numbers represents a more direct and unconstrained abuse of presidential power than Nixon attempted.</p>

          <p>The political conflict over Texas's redistricting plan has escalated sharply, as Republican Senator John Cornyn announced the FBI has agreed to help locate Democratic state lawmakers who fled to Illinois.

This development follows a bomb threat that forced some of the Democrats to evacuate their hotel, highlighting the extreme political polarization and security risks now surrounding the dispute over electoral boundaries.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order that will direct the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets like cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate in 401(k) retirement plans. This move aims to broaden investment options for Americans within their defined contribution plans, which are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The order is considered a major victory for the alternative asset industry, which has long pushed for greater access to the trillions of dollars held in U.S. retirement accounts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In light of a new executive order promoting alternative assets in retirement plans, cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are gaining attention as a way for long-term investors to access the asset class. These funds, which have seen record inflows this year, offer exposure to digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum without requiring investors to directly manage a crypto wallet. Financial experts advise that while these ETFs offer convenience, investors should be cautious to distinguish between standard funds and riskier leveraged products designed for short-term trading.

          <p>U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren have formally requested internal documents from UnitedHealth Group concerning a program that financially rewards nursing homes for reducing hospital transfers. The inquiry follows investigative reporting and whistleblower allegations that the healthcare giant may be prioritizing its bottom line over the safety of nursing home residents. The senators are specifically concerned that the bonus metric does not differentiate between avoidable and necessary hospitalizations, potentially creating an incentive to withhold critical care from vulnerable patients.</p>

Google is currently facing major federal antitrust and labor lawsuits, and the senators worry the company might settle the censorship case to secure favorable outcomes in those proceedings.</p>

          <p>The global oil market seems to be discounting President Trump's threats to impose heavy "secondary tariffs" on countries that purchase Russian energy exports. Despite a looming deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, oil prices fell, indicating that traders may view the threats as a negotiating tactic. Analysts suggest that the administration is unlikely to enforce measures that would significantly raise global oil and U.S. gasoline prices, a key concern for the president, making a full-scale tariff implementation appear improbable.
