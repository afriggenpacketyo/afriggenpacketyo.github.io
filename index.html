          <p>A Wyandotte County sheriff's deputy was shot and killed in Kansas City, Kansas, while responding to a domestic violence call. The nine-year veteran, Elijah Ming, was assisting a woman in retrieving her belongings from a home when a man inside opened fire without warning. The suspect, who also fired at other responding officers, was wounded in a subsequent gunfight and surrendered after a brief standoff. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is leading the probe into the incident, which has been described as a senseless act of violence by local officials.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics announced a major, long-term contract valued at $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors through December 2033. The South Korean tech giant did not disclose the name of the counterparty, citing a confidentiality request to protect trade secrets. This significant deal comes as Samsung aims to bolster its foundry business, where it manufactures chips for other companies, and compete more effectively in the AI chip market. The announcement led to a more than 2% rise in Samsung's shares during early trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to the distribution of child sexual abuse material in "Operation Grayskull." The network had over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files, leading to at least 18 convictions of key administrators and users. One main figure, described as a significant purveyor of such material, was sentenced to life for possessing an enormous collection of images and videos depicting the sexual assault and abuse of children. Officials are touting the operation as a major victory against online child exploitation.</p>

          <p>In response to rising violence in prisons, specially trained staff in men's jails across England and Wales will be equipped with Tasers in a new trial. The move comes as new figures reveal over £20 million has been paid in compensation for assaults on staff and prisoners over five years. The Prison Officers' Association supports the trial, calling it long overdue, while the Prison Governors' Association expresses caution about a wider rollout due to potential risks. The government says the trial aims to provide staff with the necessary tools to ensure safety and maintain order.</p>

          <p>A tariff simulator from The Observatory of Economic Complexity projects that the new U.S.-EU trade deal, which imposes a 15% tariff on most European goods, will cause a dramatic shift in global trade flows. The model forecasts a 46% drop in global exports to the U.S. by 2027 compared to recent years, while U.S. exports are expected to rise. According to the analysis, countries will likely rewire trade relationships away from the U.S., with China, Canada, and Mexico seeing the largest decreases in exports to America. Logistics experts warn this could lead to higher import costs and reduced product diversity for U.S. consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's political landscape is experiencing a significant shift with the surge of the far-right Sanseito party, which increased its seats from one to 15 in recent elections. The party's "Japan First" platform, echoing Donald Trump's rhetoric, has capitalized on public frustration over inflation, stagnant wages, and a perceived increase in problems associated with tourism and immigration. Analysts suggest this rise in populism, a rare phenomenon in Japan's historically stable democracy, challenges the long-governing Liberal Democratic Party. The movement reflects a growing desire for change, particularly among younger voters disillusioned with the current political establishment.</p>

          <p>An archaeological site in Keeladi, a village in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, has become a center of political and historical debate. Excavations have unearthed artifacts suggesting a literate, urban civilization existed there as early as 580 BCE, challenging the long-held narrative that urbanization in India was primarily a northern phenomenon. Proponents claim the findings prove the antiquity of Tamil civilization and its independent development. The issue has fueled the north-south political divide, with accusations that the federal government is attempting to suppress findings that bolster Tamil pride and identity.</p>

          <p>Human rights organizations in Argentina, including those working to document the crimes of the 1976-1983 military dictatorship, are facing mass layoffs and funding cuts under President Javier Milei's new administration. Agencies located at the former ESMA detention center, now a UNESCO World Heritage site, have seen their staff dramatically reduced. This includes the National Archive of Remembrance and groups like the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo. The austerity measures have sparked protests and fears that the country's decades-long efforts toward truth, memory, and justice are being deliberately undermined.</p>

He explained that while subjects like hospice care or bail reform are not inherently funny, comedy can be a powerful tool to illuminate entrenched systemic problems. Oliver, now a U.S. citizen, views his criticism of his adopted homeland as an act of love aimed at encouraging improvement.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes report revisits the story of Mariana Eva Pérez, who has found her brother, Guillermo, who was stolen at birth during Argentina's military dictatorship. Guillermo was born in the ESMA death camp in 1978 to their mother, Patricia Roisinblit, who was subsequently killed; he was then illegally given to a military-affiliated family. While a DNA test confirmed their relationship, the reunion has been fraught with complexity as Guillermo has struggled to reconcile his past with his new identity.

          <p>An investigation by journalist Miriam Lewin and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo successfully located a Skyvan plane used for "death flights" during Argentina's military dictatorship. The aircraft, used to drop political prisoners into the Atlantic Ocean, was found in the U.S. being used for skydiving excursions. By obtaining the plane's flight logs, the investigators were able to document its clandestine missions, providing crucial evidence for the 2017 trial that convicted dozens of military officials for crimes against humanity. The plane has since been returned to Argentina and now serves as a memorial.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri's victory at the Belgian Grand Prix highlighted the fine margins in the McLaren team's internal championship battle with Lando Norris. Piastri secured the win by taking the lead from Norris at the start, using the slipstream advantage up to Les Combes, a move Norris failed to prevent due to a less-than-perfect restart and first corner. The race also turned on pit strategy, with Piastri's team making a timely call for medium tires while Norris opted for a different strategy on hards. Despite a late charge, a few small errors by Norris cost him crucial time.</p>

The Lionesses won after all three of their knockout matches went to extra time, with two being decided by penalty shootouts, including the final against Spain. They led for less than five minutes total across the entire knockout stage, relying on late-game heroics and effective use of substitutes to secure victory. While some opponents felt England was lucky, their ability to fight to the end and execute under pressure proved to be the decisive factor.</p>

He posits several reasons for the sell-off, including the company's complex structure, the distant timeline for its planned three-way split, and a market preference for industrials with more data center exposure. Cramer argues the decline is an overreaction and an opportunity, drawing parallels to past situations where he sold stocks like Oracle and Emerson too early.

Investigators stated that while a motive is still undetermined, the terrorism charge is justified because the mass, random nature of the attack was intended to instill fear in the wider community.</p>

This result is the fourth-largest opening of the year and provides a significant boost for Marvel. The strong performance, alongside the recent success of DC's "Superman," suggests that audience appetite for well-made superhero films remains high, challenging the narrative of "superhero fatigue."</p>
