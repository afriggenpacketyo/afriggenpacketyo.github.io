          <p>Researchers have identified a unique genetic mutation in horses that allows them to produce significantly more energy with less cellular damage than other mammals. This mutation, a nonsense mutation in the KEAP1 gene, was initially thought to be detrimental, but subsequent mutations allowed horses to bypass the stop codon, resulting in enhanced energy production and antioxidant capabilities. This may explain their exceptional athletic abilities.</p>
