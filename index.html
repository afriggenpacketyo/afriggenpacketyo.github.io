          <p>The New York Giants selected Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter as the third overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, addressing a key defensive need. Carter, the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, is expected to bolster the Giants' defensive line alongside Brian Burns, Dexter Lawrence, and Kayvon Thibodeaux. Despite health concerns regarding a previous foot injury, Carter received a positive medical update, easing worries about his immediate availability. As a Philadelphia native and former Eagles fan, Carter now faces his childhood team as an NFC East rival. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has confirmed that ICE agents arrested Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil without a warrant, citing "exigent circumstances." Khalil's attorneys are challenging his deportation case, arguing that the warrantless arrest was unlawful. Khalil, a Syrian-born immigrant with legal U.S. residency, was arrested in early March. He is one of several foreign-born students arrested by ICE in recent months, raising concerns about the administration's targeting of pro-Palestinian protesters.</p>

          <p>Taylor Fresh Foods, a California produce supplier, is facing lawsuits from nine victims of a November E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce. The outbreak, which killed one person and sickened at least 88, was not publicly disclosed by the FDA. The lawsuits allege that Taylor Farms originated the "defective and unreasonably dangerous" food products. Taylor Farms denies being the source of the outbreak. The FDA's decision not to publicize the outbreak has drawn criticism.</p>
