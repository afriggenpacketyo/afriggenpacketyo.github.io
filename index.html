          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 81 deaths, with more than 40 people still missing. The Guadalupe River rose with shocking speed, heavily impacting Kerr County and a children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, where several campers and a counselor remain unaccounted for. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the area, and search and rescue operations are continuing around the clock as officials grapple with the scale of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government is set to change the law to provide statutory bereavement leave for parents who experience a miscarriage at any point during pregnancy. Currently, this legal right is only available for pregnancy loss that occurs after 24 weeks. The amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will ensure that parents have a legal right to take time off work to grieve, a move welcomed by campaigners and the Miscarriage Association as a significant acknowledgment of pre-24-week loss.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's announcement of a new 'America Party' faces a daunting reality, according to a legal analysis of the U.S. political system. Launching a new national party involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state ballot-access laws, which are often designed to favor the two major parties. The process would require immense financial resources to fund signature-gathering efforts and inevitable legal challenges, making it a multi-year project that is nearly impossible to establish by the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>A 2007 business venture by Donald Trump, 'Trump Steaks,' failed to find a market and was discontinued after just two months. The line of USDA Prime beef was sold exclusively through the Sharper Image catalog and QVC, but suffered from a combination of high prices and limited accessibility. Ultimately, poor consumer reviews that criticized the steaks for being bland and having a grainy texture led to dismal sales, marking a swift and high-profile failure for the brand before it ever gained traction.</p>
