          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in March 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft was stranded in Earth orbit and has been slowly spiraling back ever since. Experts predict the re-entry will occur around May 10th, but the exact location remains unknown, though it will be between 52 degrees north and south latitude. Despite the spacecraft's protective heat shield, which was designed to survive the Venusian atmosphere, there is a small chance some parts could survive the re-entry and reach the surface, although the risk of injury on the ground is considered low.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade policies are characterized by rapid shifts and reversals, creating uncertainty for businesses and global markets. Recent examples include fluctuating stances on tariffs for strollers and movies, as well as contradictory statements about the importance of trade deals. While initially emphasizing tariffs as a primary tool, the administration later unveiled a trade agreement with the UK, only to concede that certain details were yet to be finalized. This inconsistency extends to China, where Trump has oscillated between aggressive tariffs and potential reductions, leaving businesses struggling to adapt to the ever-changing landscape.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is seeking an apology from the Football Association after being sanctioned for remarks made to a transgender woman opponent during a friendly match. Vaughan questioned the player's gender and raised concerns about fairness and safety with the referee, leading to a six-match ban for improper conduct. An FA appeal board later found the initial hearing unfair, quashed the ruling, and ordered a new process, but the case was dropped after the complainant withdrew. Vaughan states the case has significantly impacted her life and feels the FA put her through unnecessary stress.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, partner of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, has raised millions for a new AI-driven biotech startup called Haemanthus, aiming to improve medical testing. Holmes, currently serving an 11-year sentence for fraud, is reportedly advising Evans on the project, though her exact role is unclear. The company is focused on Raman spectroscopy, a technology with potential applications in diagnosing diseases like ALS and cancer. Haemanthus hopes to reduce the cost and expand the availability of this technology, but is still in the early stages of development, and Holmes is not planning to take a formal role helping Evans run the company.</p>

          <p>Mexico is suing Google for changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, following an executive order by former U.S. President Donald Trump. The Mexican President, Claudia Sheinbaum, argues that the change affects Mexican territory and sovereignty, as the gulf is shared between the U.S., Mexico, and Cuba. Google's policy is to follow the official names used by each country, resulting in the Gulf being labeled differently depending on the user's location. The lawsuit comes after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Gulf of America Act to codify Trump's order.</p>

          <p>The end of the "de minimis" rule, which allowed low-value packages from China to enter the U.S. tax-free, has caused panic among online shoppers and concerns for businesses. President Trump's decision to eliminate the exemption, coupled with increased tariffs, has led to a surge in online spending as consumers rush to purchase items before the changes take effect. Some businesses warn of potential failures for smaller firms, while shoppers brace for price hikes and shortages. The move is intended to level the playing field for traditional retailers but is expected to disproportionately impact lower-income households.</p>

          <p>Newark, N.J. Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility during a visit with members of New Jersey's congressional delegation and charged with trespassing. Baraka claims he was there to support the Congress members touring the facility, not to protest, and that he was never told to move from the space he was in. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says the Congress members "stormed the gate" at the facility, while the Congressmembers claim Baraka's arrest was an act of intimidation.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has strategically positioned China to dominate global supply chains, aiming to counter foreign pressure through economic dominance. This approach involves increasing exports, subsidizing key industries, and implementing economic warfare tactics like export controls. While this strategy has given China leverage in the trade war with the U.S., it also carries costs, including strained relations with trading partners and potential job losses due to tariffs. Xi's focus on state control and strategic industries may hinder the growth of domestic consumption and limit the potential of Chinese businesses and consumers.</p>
