          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson rallied House Republicans during a private call, asserting their lead in the government shutdown messaging war and urging continued pressure on Democrats. He encouraged lawmakers to spend the upcoming week in their districts, informing constituents about the shutdown's implications and maintaining a unified front. Johnson expressed confidence that the shutdown would conclude swiftly if Republicans "hold the line," commending their cohesion. He indicated the House would only reconvene after Senate Democrats approved their short-term spending bill, which would keep spending levels flat for seven weeks, aiming to force an agreement and prevent further "Democrat disruptions" while criticizing Democratic counter-proposals.</p>

          <p>Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Virginia Attorney General, is facing widespread bipartisan condemnation after inflammatory text messages from 2022 recently resurfaced. In the messages, Jones used violent and extreme language, including hypothetically stating he would shoot then-Republican Speaker of the House of Delegates Todd Gilbert over figures like Adolf Hitler or Pol Pot. Jones has since issued a deep apology, taking full responsibility for his words and reaching out to Gilbert and his family. High-profile politicians from both parties, including Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Abigail Spanberger and Vice President J.D. Vance, have swiftly denounced his remarks, with some calling for his campaign to end due to the severity of the comments.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new goalkeeper, 23-year-old Senne Lammens, made his debut to a mixed reception, with fans humorously comparing him to legendary keeper Peter Schmeichel. Despite securing the team's first clean sheet of the season, his performance featured some early mishaps, though he ultimately made two crucial saves that demonstrated confidence. Manager Ruben Amorim explained that Lammens' delayed introduction was to allow him to adapt to a new country and training environment, acknowledging the immense pressure on goalkeepers. While Lammens' performance offered a positive note, Amorim emphasized the team's ongoing struggle for consistent momentum, with upcoming fixtures critical for his managerial future.</p>

          <p>A woman was shot by US Border Patrol agents in Chicago amidst an aggressive and militarized immigration enforcement operation, drawing outrage from local civic groups and opposition from Illinois Democrats. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson indicated the shooting happened after agents felt threatened by approaching vehicles, characterizing the gunfire as "defensive." This incident follows a recent fatal shooting of a Mexican immigrant by federal agents in a Chicago suburb. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the Trump administration's plan to federalize 300 National Guard troops in the state for immigration enforcement, calling the demand "absolutely outrageous and un-American" and asserting it's about "control," not public safety.</p>

          <p>Turkey faces a delicate balancing act regarding its significant energy dependence on Russia, with over 66% of its oil and 41% of its natural gas imports coming from Russia last year. US President Donald Trump and G7 nations have pressured Turkey to reduce these purchases, especially as Russia sells oil at discounted prices due to sanctions. While Turkey has not yielded to these demands, it is quietly pursuing a strategy of diversification, signing long-term LNG contracts with US and Australian firms. This move also aims to improve strained relations with the US, though Turkey's reliance on Russia for other energy sources, like its nuclear power plant project, ensures continued complexity.</p>

Piano technicians note that millennials, facing housing struggles, are less likely to purchase expensive instruments for their homes. However, digital pianos are offering a more affordable and space-saving alternative, providing accurate sounds and functional keys that benefit new learners. Experts express optimism for a resurgence in piano playing, believing that people will eventually seek musicality and emotional expression beyond constant screen interaction, suggesting a future where digital instruments serve as a vital gateway to the broader world of music.</p>

Despite Trump's explicit call for Israel to halt bombing, Gaza officials reported continued airstrikes and artillery shelling in the territory.

Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes confirmed that officers are working extended shifts, with assistance from other forces, to reassure the city's Jewish population and broader communities. The attack involved Jihad Al-Shamie driving a car into people outside a synagogue before being fatally shot by armed police; one victim was also tragically hit by police gunfire. Six individuals have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offenses. Meanwhile, a pro-Palestine march in the city center sparked controversy, with police questioning its appropriateness given the recent tragedy.</p>

The company, founded in 1962, had attempted to restructure with $3.45 billion in fresh financing to combat declining sales and numerous opioid-related lawsuits.

          <p>Costco has partnered with Novo Nordisk to offer GLP-1 anti-obesity medications like Ozempic and Wegovy to its members at approximately half the usual cost. Through its prescription program, members with a valid prescription can purchase a four-week supply for $499, an offer exclusively for those paying out of pocket due to limited insurance coverage. This move addresses soaring drug prices and increasing demand, which has led to a rise in cheaper, compounded versions and calls for stricter federal oversight. Costco's entry into the market aims to boost access to the authentic medications, as public familiarity and usage of semaglutide for weight loss continue to grow.</p>

          <p>The tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III, one of the largest in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, has been opened to the public in Luxor after two decades of extensive Japanese-led renovation work. Dating back over 3,000 years, the site suffered severe deterioration, requiring incredibly delicate restoration efforts from more than 260 specialists. First discovered in 1799, its contents, including the sarcophagus, were looted centuries ago. The tomb features a 36-meter-long, 14-meter-deep, downward-sloping passageway and main burial chambers for the king and queens Tiye and Sitamun. Its exquisite wall paintings are considered among the finest surviving from the royal tombs of the Eighteenth Dynasty.</p>

          <p>A senior Ukrainian intelligence official, Oleh Alexandrov, claims China is providing Russia with satellite intelligence to enhance Moscow's missile strikes inside Ukraine. Alexandrov stated there is evidence of high-level cooperation in satellite reconnaissance, enabling Russia to identify and further explore strategic objects for targeting, including those benefiting from foreign investment. This accusation follows earlier claims by President Volodymyr Zelensky in April that China was supplying weapons and gunpowder to Russia and producing weapons on Russian territory. These allegations, if true, would indicate a deeper level of Chinese involvement in supporting Russia's war efforts, escalating geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Analysts on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed the ongoing government shutdown, highlighting President Donald Trump's political motivations and broader strategic goals. Ashley Parker suggested that while Trump might not have chosen the shutdown, he publicly believes it benefits him and Republicans politically, viewing it as an "opportunity for the deconstruction of the administrative state." However, she noted an understanding within his orbit that such an aggressive approach could lead to significant political blowback. The panel's discussion centered on why this particular shutdown might be different, emphasizing Trump's eagerness for a political fight and his long-term agenda beyond immediate funding disputes.</p>

A U.S. official viewed Hamas's response positively, with details like weapons decommissioning potentially starting as early as next week. Following Hamas's statement, Trump urged Israel to "immediately stop the bombing of Gaza" to ensure safe hostage release, expressing belief that Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE." Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's office confirmed preparations to implement the first phase of the plan for immediate hostage release, with negotiations between Israeli and Hamas delegations expected to begin in Egypt soon to finalize details.</p>

          <p>UCLA basketball player Xavier Booker is undergoing a career reboot, transitioning from power forward to center after transferring from Michigan State. The 6-foot-11 former McDonald's All-American averaged modest numbers in his previous two seasons, often playing on the perimeter. UCLA coach Mick Cronin emphasized the need for Booker to develop traditional big-man skills like pick-and-roll defense, rim protection, and finishing above the rim. Booker, who has gained weight and fully embraced the coaching, believes playing center will be highly beneficial for his future career, combining his existing shooting ability with new post moves and impressive rim-to-rim speed, making him a unique asset.</p>

          <p>Great Western Railway (GWR) has been fined £1 million for breaching health and safety law, following the fatal injury of passenger Bethan Roper in 2018. Roper, 28, tragically died after her head struck a tree branch while she leaned out of a droplight window near Bath. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) prosecuted GWR, asserting the company was aware of the inherent risks associated with droplight windows and had failed to implement identified safety measures from a risk assessment conducted two months prior to the incident. Since this preventable tragedy, the wider rail industry has introduced significant measures to prevent passengers from leaning out of such windows while trains are in motion.</p>

Anthony Salisbury, a top deputy to Stephen Miller, was observed discussing the plan via Signal in a public place, with images of his messages obtained by a newspaper. The messages revealed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sought explicit presidential authorization due to concerns about potential backlash from deploying a top-tier quick reaction force domestically. This incident marks the latest in a series of embarrassing leaks by the Trump administration, previously including sensitive military strike discussions.
