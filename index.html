        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court for emergency access to the Social Security Administration's systems via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). A federal judge previously blocked this access, citing Privacy Act concerns and violations of agency rulemaking processes, arguing that it exposed a 'wide fissure' in the expectation of privacy. The administration is appealing after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined to halt the injunction, with the case raising significant questions about government access to citizens' personal information.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent election results in England indicate significant challenges for the Labour Party, which has seen its support wane since its landslide victory ten months ago, particularly due to unpopular decisions regarding winter fuel allowance and Personal Independence Payment eligibility. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party's struggles continue, with Reform UK making substantial gains and capitalizing on voter dissatisfaction. The Liberal Democrats and the Greens are also benefiting from the main parties' unpopularity, with the era of two-party dominance appearing to be under strain as voters seek change and fragmentation increases.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman's former chief of staff, Adam Jentleson, voiced concerns about the senator's well-being in a letter to his doctor, citing 'warning signs' of a potential mental health relapse and risky behaviors. Jentleson's letter, obtained by The New York Times, detailed Fetterman's alleged failure to adhere to his medical plan, including skipping doctor appointments and medication, leading to erratic behavior. These concerns have reportedly been echoed by other former staff members, with reports of Fetterman's driving habits and mood swings causing anxiety. Fetterman has dismissed these claims, asserting that his doctors and family affirm his well-being, while his spokesperson questioned the motivations behind publicizing the letter.</p>

The dismissal comes after the election of a Republican governor in Puerto Rico and amid media attacks against climate-accountability litigation, raising questions about political influence on legal strategies.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Patterson, a former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater, warns that foreign investors are losing faith in the U.S. due to tariff policies and concerns about the weaponizing of capital markets.

Patterson estimates a potential $1.2 trillion sell-off, representing a notable portion of the S&P 500's market capitalization, although she emphasizes that this capital flight will occur gradually.</p>
