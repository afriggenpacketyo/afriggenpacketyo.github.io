          <p>French actor GÃ©rard Depardieu was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on the set of a film in 2021, receiving an 18-month suspended sentence, marking a significant moment for France's #MeToo movement. The court's decision follows a four-day trial where Depardieu denied the accusations, though his account of the events was deemed unconvincing by the judge. This verdict arrives amidst a backdrop of over twenty women accusing Depardieu of sexual misconduct, with this being the first case to reach trial, highlighting the ongoing reckoning within the French film industry regarding sexual misconduct and abuse of power. The article notes the trial had been delayed from October 2024 due to Depardieu's health problems.</p>

Launched in early March, Manus AI quickly gained attention for its ability to handle complex tasks, becoming a prominent AI startup in China. The decision to open registrations follows a $75 million funding round led by Benchmark Capital, a U.S. venture capital firm, which values Manus at $500 million. The U.S. Treasury Department is reportedly reviewing Benchmark's investment, and Manus is providing users with initial and daily credits to encourage service use.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has temporarily reduced tariffs on Chinese imports, providing relief for businesses but also creating a rush to import goods within the 90-day window. The tax on Chinese imports to the U.S. will decrease from 145% to 30%, while China's tariff on U.S. goods will drop from 125% to 10%. Business owners are attempting to expedite shipments to the U.S. while the lower tariffs are in effect, but there are concerns about potential freight rate increases. Despite the temporary relief, uncertainty remains about the tariff landscape after the 90-day period, prompting businesses to explore alternative manufacturing locations.</p>

          <p>Farmers in Texas are facing challenges due to a prolonged drought and complications in Mexico's ability to uphold a nearly 80-year-old agreement to send water to the U.S. from the Rio Grande. The water dispute has resulted in significant financial losses for Texas farms, leading to pressure from President Trump on Mexico to deliver water, including the threat of tariffs. Despite recent commitments from Mexico to make immediate deliveries, the long-term water scarcity issue persists, affecting crops and industries along the border.

          <p>Financial technology firms, initially impacted by interest rate hikes, saw profits rise as higher rates boosted net interest income; however, they now face a key test as interest rates decline. Fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo benefited from higher net interest income in 2024, but the sustainability of this income is now in question. A broad decline in interest rates raises doubts about the long-term viability of relying on heightened income, potentially exposing vulnerabilities in some fintechs' business models. Some fintechs are diversifying their revenue streams to reduce reliance on interest and card fees, offering services like crypto trading and mobile plans.</p>

          <p>Palestinian photojournalist Hassan Aslih was killed in an Israeli air strike on the emergency department of Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, medical sources and eyewitnesses say. Aslih, who was being treated for injuries from a previous Israeli strike, was targeted in what witnesses described as a drone attack on the hospital's surgical wing. The Israeli military had previously accused Aslih of involvement in the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. The strike in April killed Aslih's colleague Helmi al-Faqawi and wounded several other journalists.</p>

          <p>Japanese auto giant Honda missed fourth-quarter earnings estimates as operating profit plunged 76%, with the company bracing for the full impact of U.S. tariffs and currency fluctuations. The company's projected net profit saw an even deeper cut at 70.1% lower, plunging to 250 billion yen, while revenue is expected to fall 6.4% to 20.3 trillion yen. Honda explained that the impact of tariff policies worldwide would be very significant on its business, with the frequent revisions making it difficult to formulate an outlook. The company also changed its dividend policy from a dividend payout ratio to a "dividend on equity."</p>

Community property, acquired during the marriage, typically goes to the surviving spouse, who can then decide how to distribute it. The article suggests exploring trust agreements, such as QTIP or A-B trusts, to ensure both spouses' wishes are honored and to minimize tax implications for the heirs. (not investment advice)</p>
