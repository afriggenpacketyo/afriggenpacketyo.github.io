          <p>Swiss food conglomerate Nestlé has dismissed its CEO, Laurent Freixe, after an investigation confirmed he had an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate. The company stated the dismissal was effective immediately, as the relationship constituted a conflict of interest and a violation of its code of conduct. The inquiry was reportedly initiated through a whistleblower channel, reinforcing the company's stated commitment to its governance values. Long-time executive Philipp Navratil has been appointed as the new CEO to ensure strategic continuity and maintain performance momentum.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement officials are alerting the public to an increase in phone scams where fraudsters impersonate court or sheriff's department officials. These scammers falsely claim the victim has missed jury duty and faces an imminent arrest warrant, demanding immediate payment via wire transfer or gift cards to resolve the issue. The article emphasizes that legitimate court summons are sent by mail and no government agency will ever demand payment over the phone to avoid legal trouble. It advises individuals to hang up on suspicious callers, verify any claims by contacting local authorities directly, and report the scam attempt.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's attempt to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi on the final day of the transfer window has failed despite the clubs agreeing on a deal worth at least £35 million. The 25-year-old was set to complete a medical and finalize a long-term contract with the Premier League champions. However, the transfer was ultimately called off because Crystal Palace was unable to secure a suitable replacement in time before the deadline. The club had aimed to sign two new defenders before sanctioning Guehi's departure, a condition they could not meet.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, 'The Smashing Machine,' features a transformed Dwayne Johnson as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr, chronicling his battle with substance abuse and the existential crisis following his first professional loss. The review praises Johnson's serious, non-satirical portrayal and highlights strong supporting performances, particularly from Emily Blunt as Kerr's girlfriend, Dawn. While the film is described as a solid drama that effectively captures moments of vulnerability, it is noted for not reaching the tragic depths of similar sports biopics. The movie is seen as a compelling watch for fans of the sport and a showcase for Johnson's dramatic range.</p>

          <p>A group of nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has publicly criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering American health. In an op-ed, they argue that his actions, including firing key personnel, promoting unproven treatments, and dismantling vaccine advisory panels, are undermining the nation's public health system. The former leaders, who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations, state that these moves leave the U.S. vulnerable to future pandemics and other health threats.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on pharmaceutical companies to release data to "justify the success" of their COVID-19 medications, stating he wants answers immediately. His demand comes as the Food and Drug Administration limited the approval of new vaccines to high-risk individuals and follows major leadership upheaval at the CDC, which he attributes to the controversy over vaccine efficacy. Trump's comments insert him into the ongoing conflict between HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the public health establishment.

          <p>According to an analysis of federal data, the number of immigrant workers in the United States has decreased by 1.2 million during the first seven months of the Trump administration. This decline is attributed to stricter immigration policies, increased enforcement, and a slowdown in border crossings. Economists express concern that this labor shortage could negatively impact key sectors of the economy that rely heavily on immigrant labor, such as agriculture, construction, and healthcare. The reduction in the workforce could also complicate the Federal Reserve's understanding of the labor market and lead to production delays and crop waste. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of the U.S. freight market indicates that tariffs on Chinese goods are creating a significant downturn for the American trucking industry. By increasing the cost of imports, tariffs reduce the volume of goods arriving at U.S. ports, which in turn leads to a decrease in demand for trucks to transport those goods inland. Freight data shows that both inbound ocean container volumes and outbound truckload tenders are trending downwards, suggesting a potential freight drought. This situation poses a severe risk for small carriers and owner-operators, who are most vulnerable to falling spot market rates and reduced freight availability. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers analyzing thousands of animal bones from southern France found that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species such as foxes and deer became smaller. In contrast, domesticated animals like cattle, sheep, and chickens grew larger due to increased human control and selective breeding for specific traits. The findings underscore the profound and lasting impact of human activities on the natural world over the past millennium.</p>

A spokesperson for Rayner has maintained that she properly paid all relevant taxes and has acted appropriately.</p>

          <p>The intense fan debate over the romantic storyline in the series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has escalated into online hostility, prompting the show's cast and network to intervene. Passionate fans, divided into "teams" supporting different characters, have begun targeting the actors with threats and harassment. In response, Prime Video launched a social media campaign reminding viewers to "Start Acting Normal Online" and reinforcing its zero-tolerance policy for bullying. A psychiatrist weighs in, suggesting this behavior reflects a blurring of lines between fiction and reality and may stem from a societal void in genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>Algerian Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif is legally challenging a decision by World Boxing to mandate gender testing for her to remain eligible for competition. The ruling followed significant controversy and debate surrounding her and another fighter during the 2024 Paris Olympics. Khelif has filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), seeking to be declared eligible for the upcoming World Boxing Championships without undergoing the test. While CAS has dismissed her request to suspend the testing mandate until the case is heard, the appeal itself will proceed.</p>

The suspect allegedly disguised himself as a food delivery courier to carry out the shooting. The killing of the high-profile politician, who was a vocal advocate for Ukrainian independence and sovereignty, is being investigated as the latest instance of targeted political violence since Russia's full-scale invasion.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a significant bilateral meeting at a regional summit in China, signaling a deepening of their strategic partnership. The meeting comes as India faces steep new tariffs from the United States, imposed by President Trump in retaliation for New Delhi's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. This economic pressure from Washington appears to be pushing India to work more closely with Russia and China. During their talks, Modi and Putin emphasized their "special and privileged" relationship and discussed strengthening cooperation in trade, energy, and security.</p>

          <p>In its UK financial report, denim giant Levi's has identified "rising anti-Americanism" as a key business risk that could negatively impact its sales. The company suggested that this sentiment, which it links to the consequences of Trump administration tariffs and policies, might lead British consumers to favor national or European brands over American ones. This is one of the first instances of a major U.S. brand openly acknowledging the potential for political blowback to affect consumer behavior in the UK. The warning was listed alongside other market challenges like inflation and competition from retailer's own-label products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Scottish government has scrapped peak-time fares on its nationalized rail service, ScotRail, in a significant trial aimed at simplifying ticketing and boosting passenger numbers. The move, which drastically reduces the cost of commuter-hour travel, reflects changes in travel patterns since the pandemic, with officials stating there is now sufficient capacity on the network. This initiative has sparked a debate on whether England, Wales, and Northern Ireland could follow suit. While passengers welcome cheaper tickets, experts are divided on whether such a change would lead to overcrowding on busy routes or require fare increases elsewhere to cover lost revenue.</p>

The threat jeopardizes a fragile trade truce established earlier in the summer and has caught EU policymakers by surprise.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his legal authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs on most of the country's trading partners. The court found it unlikely that Congress intended to grant the president unlimited power to set tariffs. However, the ruling has been temporarily stayed, leaving the tariffs in place to give the Trump administration time to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
