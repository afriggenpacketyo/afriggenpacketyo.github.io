          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 11:38:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major international postal services, including Royal Mail and Germany's DHL, are temporarily suspending some deliveries to the United States. This action comes in response to a new executive order signed by President Trump, which eliminates the global import tax exemption on low-value parcels, effective August 29. While gifts under $100 remain duty-free, other packages will now face tariffs, prompting carriers to halt services until compliant systems are in place. The US administration claims this change will combat deceptive shipping practices, illegal material, and duty circumvention, which they allege have been abused to send illicit drugs. This article highlights the immediate disruption as companies like Royal Mail and Deutsche Post work to adapt their systems for the new regulations, with Etsy also suspending shipping label purchases for affected carriers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its controversial policy of deporting undocumented migrants from the US to third countries, with Uganda becoming the latest African nation to accept a deal. This article highlights that the agreement builds on earlier schemes with South Sudan and Eswatini, despite concerns about human rights records and the capacity of these nations, like Uganda, which already hosts Africa's largest refugee population. Human rights groups raise alarms about sending migrants to countries with political and human rights crises, such as Eswatini, the last absolute monarchy in Africa. Some African officials see these deals as a way to diversify partnerships and potentially secure benefits from the Trump administration, while Nigeria has explicitly rejected such proposals.</p>

          <p>The FBI conducted searches at the Maryland home and downtown Washington D.C. office of former National Security Advisor John Bolton, confirming court-authorized activity related to a classified documents investigation. President Trump, who claimed to learn of the search via TV, criticized Bolton as "not very smart" and "unpatriotic," while Justice Department officials publicly affirmed the principle that "NO ONE is above the law." This article provides context, recalling Bolton's previous legal battles with the Trump administration over his memoir, "The Room Where It Happened," which faced a criminal inquiry for allegedly disclosing classified information. The Biden administration had closed that investigation and dropped a lawsuit against him.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's press office has adopted President Trump's aggressive social media tactics, including all-caps posts, nicknames, and satirical memes, to troll the former president and his allies. This article reports that Fox News hosts, typically supportive of Trump's online behavior, expressed dismay and called Newsom's style "childish" and "performative confrontational." Newsom's approach has garnered significant online engagement and followers, with even Steve Bannon acknowledging his "Trumpian vision of fighting." The governor justifies his actions by stating that if his mockery bothers people, they should look to the original source, highlighting the perceived double standard in media reactions to political online conduct.</p>

          <p>With record-high home equity, Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are popular for home improvements and debt consolidation, but experts warn of significant risks when maxing them out. This article explains that HELOCs have variable interest rates, meaning monthly payments can become unaffordable if rates rise, straining household budgets. Maxing out a HELOC can also negatively impact credit scores due to high utilization and increase the risk of foreclosure if payments are defaulted. Financial experts advise creating a repayment plan, prioritizing principal payments, and monitoring interest rate changes. Alternatives like refinancing to a fixed-rate home equity loan, cash-out refinance, or even personal loans can help mitigate the risks associated with putting one's home as collateral.

          <p>Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's younger brother and a Tesla board member, publicly stated that Elon "deserves to be paid" by Tesla, as the company navigates a legal dispute over its CEO's compensation package. Elon Musk receives no salary or cash bonuses, instead being compensated through performance-based stock options. This article notes that Tesla recently granted an "interim" pay package of 96 million shares, worth approximately $29 billion, without a shareholder vote. This interim award is intended to apply if a previous $56 billion package from 2018, the largest in US history, is overturned on appeal by a Delaware judge. Investment groups are now questioning the legality of this new package under Nasdaq listing policies, highlighting ongoing corporate governance concerns.</p>

This article follows Erik's parole denial the previous day, which was primarily attributed to his prison behavior, including policy violations and drug use, rather than solely the original crime. Both brothers' sentences were recently reduced, making them eligible for parole under youth offender law, as they maintain they acted in self-defense due to alleged physical, sexual, and emotional abuse from their parents. The Los Angeles County District Attorney continues to oppose their release, asserting they have not taken full responsibility and have lied about the abuse claims.</p>

This article reports on a recent fatal shooting of a Palestinian activist by a settler, which barely registered in Israeli media, and the surge in settler violence since October 7. Israeli officials are criticized for failing to address the situation, while the US, under the Trump administration, has reversed sanctions on violent settlers.

It highlights how figures like Dana Perino, who typically excuse Trump's behavior, expressed dismay at Newsom's similar tactics. The article suggests Newsom's parodies act as a mirror, forcing Trump's supporters to confront how his actions appear to others, and exposing their hypersensitivity despite their "Fuck your feelings" rhetoric.

          <p>The US labor market is exhibiting an unusual trend where annual wage growth for "job stayers" has surpassed that of "job switchers" for six consecutive months. This article reports that this reversal, typically seen only around major economic downturns like the Great Recession, signals an underlying weakness in the labor market. Economists explain that fewer job openings and a depressed "quits rate" indicate workers are "job hugging" rather than seeking better opportunities, often accepting lower wages if forced to switch. This suggests a loss of bargaining power for workers and a "frozen" market, especially impacting the long-term unemployed. (not investment advice)</p>
