          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been in talks with Japanese officials, emphasizing Japan's advantageous position in AI development due to its robotics and industrial manufacturing leadership. Huang stressed the necessity of significant energy infrastructure investments to support the growing demands of AI, particularly data centers. Japan is currently balancing the energy needs of these centers with the challenges of restarting nuclear reactors and increasing fossil fuel imports, as the country considers investing in a large liquefied natural gas project in Alaska to secure its energy future. The discussion highlights the critical intersection of AI advancement and energy sustainability. Optimism score: 75</p>

          <p>China's restrictions on critical metal exports to the US are taking a toll, with exports of key minerals plummeting and some shipments halting entirely, according to recent data. This move is seen as retaliation for US tariffs on Chinese goods, placing increased pressure on US manufacturers reliant on these rare earths. China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain, essential for producing everything from smartphones to military equipment, is being leveraged amidst ongoing trade disputes. The US-bound exports of tellurium and tungsten have seen dramatic declines, and shipments have ceased for molybdenum powder and bismuth products. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>The UK government will publish the nationalities of foreign criminals living in the country for the first time, revealing data on their crimes and deportation status. This move is seen as evidence that the Labour government has responded to pressure to disclose these figures, with official data showing over 19,000 foreign offenders awaiting deportation. The government insists that this change is due to improvements in data collection, while critics argue that the public deserved to know this information long ago. The most common nationalities of foreign criminals are expected to be Albanians, Romanians, and Poles, with common offences including drug production, theft, and assault. Optimism score: 55</p>

          <p>The weakening US dollar has presented central banks worldwide with a complex challenge: whether to devalue their own currencies to maintain export competitiveness or risk higher inflation. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower import costs, it also complicates export competitiveness and could invite retaliatory measures from the US. Many central banks are hesitant to devalue their currencies due to the risk of stoking inflation and causing capital flight. For now, avoiding a currency war appears to be the preferred course of action, as central banks seek to balance economic stability with global trade pressures. Optimism score: 60</p>
