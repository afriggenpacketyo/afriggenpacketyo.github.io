          <p>In a solemn ceremony at Historic St. Mary's City, the remains of 65 of Maryland's earliest Catholic settlers were reinterred more than 300 years after their original burials. The event, attended by the Archbishop of Baltimore, aimed to honor these forgotten founders who pioneered religious liberty in North America. Researchers studied the remains, gaining insights into colonial life before their respectful return to a new burial vault in a reconstructed 17th-century chapel. The ceremony highlighted the settlers' legacy of tolerance and coexistence, a message organizers emphasized as relevant today.</p>

          <p>The White House has dispatched senior envoys to Egypt to help finalize a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, following Hamas's acceptance of key parts of a U.S.-proposed peace plan. President Trump stated the parties are "very close" to a deal, which includes the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a phased Israeli withdrawal. Despite the diplomatic push, Israeli strikes continued in Gaza, resulting in dozens of Palestinian casualties. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed hope for the return of all hostages soon but maintained that Hamas would be disarmed either diplomatically or militarily.</p>

          <p>This article details the investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus in Hillsboro, Oregon, focusing on the police's search for a crucial piece of evidence: a maroon minivan. Believed to be the primary crime scene, the van was used by the suspect, Dr. Steven Milner, to attack Fandrich before he was staged in his own vehicle. Investigators tracked the "burner" vehicle to a tow company, only to discover it had been sold to a scrapyard and crushed just a week before they arrived. The loss of this key forensic evidence presented a significant challenge for prosecutors in the case against Milner.</p>

          <p>Germany's Munich Airport experienced two separate shutdowns within 24 hours due to confirmed drone sightings near its runways, impacting thousands of passengers and causing significant delays. The incidents are part of a larger pattern of mysterious drone overflights at critical infrastructure sites across several European Union countries, raising security concerns. While authorities have not identified the operators, the events have prompted European interior ministers to discuss a coordinated drone detection and defense strategy. A similar incident involving possible balloons also led to a temporary closure of Vilnius International Airport in Lithuania.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests US is Lagging in Global Electric Vehicle Adoption</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent record sales, the United States is falling behind other major markets like China and Europe in the transition to electric vehicles. The article attributes this lag to weaker government support, higher average costs for EVs, and the absence of low-cost Chinese brands due to high tariffs. A recent sales boom was largely driven by a government tax credit that has now expired, leading analysts to predict a significant drop in demand. The differing policy approaches between the Biden and Trump administrations have created uncertainty, potentially further slowing investment and adoption in the American EV industry.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland, ruling that the administration's justification did not meet the high legal standard for such an action without the governor's consent. Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, stated that the protests in the city were not disruptive enough to warrant military intrusion into civil affairs. The ruling, which prevents the deployment of 200 soldiers for at least 14 days, was celebrated by Oregon officials as a defense of state sovereignty and the rule of law. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

The proposal is based on the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, which allows for special designs for the semiquincentennial.

Developed in the late 1970s to replace the Mirage III, the jet is known for its speed, maneuverability, and effectiveness in both high-altitude and low-speed flight. Production was handled across several Dassault facilities in France, with final assembly and testing in Mérignac. While the Mirage 2000 has been a mainstay for the French Air Force and several export customers, it is now being succeeded by the more advanced Dassault Rafale fighter.</p>

          <p>The nation of Fiji is experiencing one of the world's fastest-growing HIV epidemics, with cases increasing elevenfold in the last decade, prompting the government to declare a national crisis. The surge is largely attributed to a rise in intravenous drug use, particularly crystal meth, and associated high-risk behaviors like needle sharing and "bluetoothing," where blood is drawn and injected into another person. Health officials and NGOs report that young people, some as young as 10, are being affected. A lack of needle-syringe programs and education is exacerbating the problem, with experts warning the true number of infections is likely much higher than official figures suggest.</p>

The article explores this cultural shift, noting that people are drawn to the sense of community and camaraderie that forms while waiting in line with like-minded individuals. Psychologists attribute the appeal to the release of dopamine from the anticipation of a reward, especially for exclusive or hard-to-get items.

          <p>The article examines "freshers' flu," the common wave of illness that spreads among students at the start of the academic year. Immunologists explain it is not a single virus but an assortment of common colds that thrive when thousands of people from different areas mix in close quarters like lecture halls and dorms. The illness often feels worse than a typical cold because students' immune systems are compromised by stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. While not typically serious, the combination of new viral exposures and a weakened immune response makes it a difficult rite of passage for many new university attendees to avoid.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration Policy on Detaining Immigrant Youth Turning 18</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued a temporary restraining order to stop the Trump administration from keeping unaccompanied immigrant children in custody after they turn 18. The policy would have seen these young adults transferred to adult ICE detention centers rather than being released to less restrictive settings like with relatives or foster families. The judge ruled that this practice violates a 2021 court order. This decision is another legal setback for the administration's controversial immigration policies, which advocates argue are causing chaos and harm to vulnerable young people.</p>
