          <p>Newark, N.J. Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested at the Delaney Hall ICE facility during a protest with New Jersey's congressional delegation, sparking outrage from Gov. Phil Murphy. Baraka and other lawmakers have criticized the facility's safety and legality, alleging permit violations and inspection obstruction by the private prison company. The Department of Homeland Security denies these allegations, stating the facility houses dangerous criminals and that protesters, including members of Congress, "stormed the gate," disrupting operations and endangering law enforcement and detainees. This article reports that the situation is ongoing, with officials and lawmakers offering conflicting accounts of the events leading to the arrest.</p>

The company's revenue forecast fell short of analyst expectations, raising concerns about profitability despite the growth in Gross Merchandise Volume attributed to these loans.

          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the traditional 60-40 portfolio is no longer viable due to increasing longevity and the need for greater equity exposure.

The article cites data on rising healthcare costs and insufficient retirement account balances among older Americans, emphasizing the importance of adapting investment strategies to accommodate longer lifespans.

          <p>President Trump intends to sign an executive order aimed at discouraging criminal enforcement of regulatory offenses, with the goal of easing the burden on small businesses. The order would require agencies to publicly list regulatory violations that could lead to criminal charges and provide guidance on prosecution circumstances. Prosecutors would be discouraged from filing charges not on the lists or those lacking proof of criminal intent, with exceptions for immigration and national security. This article highlights the long-standing criticism from conservatives and business groups regarding the reach of federal criminal statutes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco appears poised to temporarily block the Trump administration's sweeping overhaul of the federal government, citing potential violations of the Constitution. The judge asserted that while the president has authority to seek changes at agencies, significant transformations require congressional cooperation. The lawsuit, filed by labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments, argues that Trump's efforts to restructure and dismantle the federal government without congressional approval are unlawful. This article details the arguments presented by both sides and the judge's concerns about protecting the power of the legislative branch.</p>
