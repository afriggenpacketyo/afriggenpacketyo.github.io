          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu is issuing a 4.4 billion yuan (US$618 million) dim sum bond to secure lower financing costs for its artificial intelligence ambitions. This move comes as the company faces a challenging financial period, having recently reported a 2% drop in total revenue and a 34% fall in net profit for the second quarter. The bond issuance is part of a larger trend of companies utilizing China's relatively low interest rates, with a record US$43.8 billion in dim sum bonds sold this year. This marks Baidu's second such bond issuance as it seeks to bolster its operational flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 03:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's recent shift in rhetoric to defend the importance of vaccines, breaking with his previous alignment with vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The change reportedly came after Kennedy faced intense criticism from Republican senators, including doctors, during a tense Senate hearing.

          <p>French artificial intelligence firm Mistral AI has achieved a valuation of nearly $14 billion following a new Series C funding round. Dutch chip-equipment manufacturer ASML was the lead investor, injecting 1.3 billion euros to secure an 11% stake in the Paris-based company. This investment more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation and highlights the continued massive flow of capital into the AI industry. Existing investors like Nvidia and Andreessen Horowitz also participated, reinforcing Mistral's position as a key European competitor to American AI giants like OpenAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a one-year prison sentence, determining his previous six-month stay in a hospital did not count as time served. Thaksin, an influential but divisive figure in Thai politics, was transferred to a hospital for health reasons just hours after returning from self-exile to begin a sentence for corruption. The court found this transfer to be unlawful, stating he was not in a critical condition that warranted it. The ruling addresses public criticism that the powerful billionaire was receiving preferential treatment.</p>

Ishiba announced his departure after securing a trade deal with the United States that reduced tariffs on Japanese car imports. While China's foreign ministry described the resignation as an internal affair, analysts anticipate that Japan's new leader will likely continue the country's current policy of viewing China as a strategic competitor. The transition in leadership comes at a time of already rocky relations between the two East Asian powers, and the direction the new government takes will be closely watched.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the modern populist right in both the U.S. and the UK is actively trying to rewrite history to justify eroding democratic rights. The author points to the Trump administration's efforts to remove "divisive" exhibits from Smithsonian museums and Reform UK's call for a more "patriotic" curriculum as examples of creating a narrow national narrative. This reframing, the article contends, serves as an ideological gateway for policies that dismantle protections for vulnerable communities, such as diversity initiatives and asylum seeker rights. The author concludes that resisting this requires building solidarity among targeted groups to defend the democratic expansions of the 20th century.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is set to commission its massive Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a nearly $5 billion hydropower project that has been a source of national pride and regional tension for over a decade. The project, funded primarily through domestic bonds and public donations, is expected to double the country's electricity output. However, it has faced strong opposition from downstream nations Egypt and Sudan, who fear it will severely reduce their water supply from the Nile River. The article also highlights unanswered questions about the human cost of construction, citing a report that as many as 15,000 people may have died during the 14-year project.</p>

          <p>Police in New Zealand have released the first photos of a remote campsite where Tom Phillips hid with his three young children for years while on the run. The discovery came after Phillips was killed in a shootout with police, during which an officer was seriously injured. Two of the children were found at the campsite hours later, after the third child, who was with Phillips when he died, helped authorities locate it. Phillips had disappeared with the children in late 2021 after losing a custody battle, sparking a nationwide manhunt that has now concluded tragically.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has released documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, including a "birthday book" from 2003 containing a page attributed to Donald Trump. The book, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, lists Trump in the "Friends" section, and the released page features a note with a signature resembling his. The White House has vehemently denied that Trump wrote or signed the letter, calling it "fake" and part of a "smear" campaign. The release has intensified scrutiny of the connections between the late convicted sex offender and numerous powerful figures, with Trump's legal team vowing to continue litigation against media outlets that reported on the letter.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an enhanced immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz," targeting what it calls "criminal illegal aliens." The move drew a sharp rebuke from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who stated they received no prior notice and accused the Trump administration of focusing on "scaring Illinoisians" rather than genuine public safety coordination. The operation was announced in honor of a woman killed by an undocumented immigrant in a drunk driving crash. The action follows a controversial social media post from President Trump threatening to "clean up" the city.</p>

          <p>A US congressional committee has publicly released a collection of documents from the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, providing a deeper look into his network. The trove includes his personal address book, his will, and a 238-page "birthday book" from 2003 with messages from friends, including notes attributed to Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, and one from UK Ambassador Lord Mandelson. The release has renewed focus on Epstein's connections to powerful individuals, though being mentioned in the documents does not imply wrongdoing. The White House has denied the authenticity of the Trump note, while Lord Mandelson has expressed regret for his association with Epstein.</p>

The No. 10 pick in the 2024 draft, McCarthy grew up in the Chicago area and delivered a clutch performance when it mattered most. For the Bears, rookie quarterback Caleb Williams threw for one touchdown and ran for another in his first game under new coach Ben Johnson.</p>

          <p>A former head of security at WhatsApp, Attaullah Baig, has filed a whistleblower lawsuit against parent company Meta, alleging "systemic cybersecurity failures" that could compromise user privacy. The suit claims that Baig discovered that approximately 1,500 WhatsApp engineers had unrestricted access to sensitive user data without adequate monitoring, a potential violation of a 2020 FTC privacy settlement. Baig alleges that after he raised these concerns to leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, he faced retaliation and was eventually fired under the guise of poor performance. Meta has disputed the claims, stating Baig was dismissed for poor performance and that his allegations are distorted.</p>

          <p>The upcoming election for the Labour Party's deputy leader, following Angela Rayner's resignation, is being viewed as a crucial indicator of the party's ideological direction under Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The contest comes after a cabinet reshuffle that many perceived as a shift to the right, causing unease among the party's left wing. The tight timetable for nominations is seen by some, like MP Richard Burgon, as a "stitch up" to favor a leadership-approved candidate. The outcome will be closely watched to see if members elect a constructive critic who can act as a voice for the grassroots, or a loyalist aligned with the current government's trajectory.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has voiced serious concern that the country could be forced to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), similar to the 1976 sterling crisis. She warned that without a clear plan for economic growth from the Labour government, the UK is in a "doom loop" of rising taxes and unstable public finances, pointing to rising government bond yields as a worrying indicator. Badenoch offered to work with Prime Minister Keir Starmer on cutting welfare spending to avert such a crisis. A Labour source dismissed the offer, stating the Conservative government had "crashed the economy" and had a "brass neck" to offer advice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes President Trump's "Chipocalypse Now" social media post, which threatened immigration enforcement in Chicago using imagery from the film "Apocalypse Now." The author argues this is an example of "memetic warfare," where serious threats of authoritarian action are cloaked in the guise of harmless, pop-culture-inspired jokes to disarm criticism. The article contends that this tactic allows the administration to float dangerous ideas and attack political opponents while claiming critics are simply humorless. The author concludes that such messaging, which led to the announcement of "Operation Midway Blitz," is a serious threat to democratic norms and should not be dismissed as a joke.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the frequent inclusion of large Boeing aircraft orders in trade deals negotiated by the Trump administration with countries like South Korea, Japan, and the UK. Analysts suggest several reasons for this pattern: the high-profile, high-value nature of aircraft makes for a visible and symbolic win for the president. For partner countries, purchasing planes is a politically palatable way to reduce their trade surplus with the U.S., as it doesn't harm sensitive domestic industries like agriculture or steel. Furthermore, with a growing global demand for air travel and long production backlogs, these deals are also pragmatic, fulfilling a real need for new aircraft.</p>
