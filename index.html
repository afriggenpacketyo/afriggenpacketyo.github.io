          <p>Karol Nawrocki, backed by the previous right-wing governing party, has been elected as Poland's president, posing challenges to Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to advance his liberal agenda. Nawrocki's victory signifies a setback for the centrist government and will likely lead to increased political tensions within the country. The new president's conservative stance could potentially hinder Tusk's ability to implement key policy changes and reforms. The political landscape in Poland is expected to become more complex with differing ideologies at the helm of the executive and legislative branches.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are spearheading a decade-long collaboration to create a comprehensive genomic atlas of Southeast Asia, addressing the historical underrepresentation of the region in the Human Genome Project. The SEA3K data set, published in Nature, includes genome sequencing for 3,023 individuals from six countries, covering five language families and 30 ethnic languages. The study revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical challenges and distinct Denisovan ancestry linked to Russia's far east. This initiative aims to rectify the omission of mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) populations, which contributed a mere 1.57 per cent to global genomic databases prior to this research.</p>

          <p>CNN data reporter Harry Enten highlighted a concerning trend for President Donald Trump: the increasing popularity of the acronym "TACO," which stands for "Trump Always Chickens Out." The term refers to Trump's tendency to announce tariffs, causing market plunges, and then back down, leading to market jumps. Enten noted that searches for Trump and "TACO" have surged, indicating that the phrase has entered the mainstream and could damage Trump's reputation as someone who follows through on his promises.</p>

          <p>Monday's front pages are largely focused on Sir Keir Starmer's strategic defence review, with some questioning the feasibility of the plans. The Telegraph reports that the Defence Secretary seemed to backtrack on a pledge to boost military spending to 3% of GDP by 2034. Several papers also highlight the record number of migrants crossing the English Channel, with the Daily Express quoting the defence secretary as saying small boat smugglers are running a 'taxi' service. Other headlines include a study suggesting exercise is better than drugs to keep cancer at bay and the fifth anniversary of the organ donor opt-out law in England.</p>

          <p>Stocks of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson and its affiliate Brickworks surged after announcing a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. A new company listed in Sydney will acquire all outstanding shares of both firms, creating an entity with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers, but critics argued it suppressed shareholder value. The move is seen positively by investors, simplifying the structure and adding scale to create a more investable company (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Mexico has become the first nation in the world to hold an election for the judicial system, a move championed by President Claudia Sheinbaum and her predecessor. Supporters believe this is needed to overhaul the judicial system, which is known for corruption and inefficiency, but critics say the vote will politicize the judiciary in a country plagued by crime and gang violence. Turnout appeared to be low as many voters struggled to choose from hundreds of largely unknown candidates, and some voters said they felt pressured to vote or disillusioned with the corrupt system.</p>
