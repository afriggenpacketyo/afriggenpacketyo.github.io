          <p>A passenger train derailed in Russia's Bryansk region, bordering Ukraine, after a bridge collapsed due to an explosion, resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries. Regional governor Alexander Bogomaz confirmed the incident, stating that seven people died and over 60 were injured, including children. The train was traveling from Klimov to Moscow when the explosion occurred, leading to the derailment, and Russian investigators later reported a second bridge collapse in the Kursk region.

          <p>Dana Chandler was convicted of the 2002 murders of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, and his girlfriend, Karen Harkness, after a series of three trials, with the most recent trial having Chandler represent herself. The case, featured on "48 Hours," explores the complicated relationship between Chandler and Sisco, marked by a bitter divorce and allegations of stalking. Evidence presented included recorded conversations where Chandler expressed violent thoughts about Sisco and testimony from their children detailing her stalking behavior. Despite the lack of forensic evidence directly linking Chandler to the crime scene, the prosecution argued that her obsession and jealousy motivated the murders, and Chandler is scheduled to be sentenced on June 3, 2025.</p>

          <p>A history enthusiast using a metal detector has led archaeologists to the location of a medieval monastery in Derome, Sweden, thanks to a peculiar symbol identified on an old map. GÃ¶ran Bengtsson, the hobbyist, noticed a strange rectangle on 18th-century maps, labeled as "Klosterkullen" or "monastery hill" on a 1760 map, and archaeologists confirmed the site using ground-penetrating radar, revealing walls of probable monastery ruins. The discovery, dating back to the late 1100s, is believed to be the original site of Ã…s Abbey, a large monastery managed by the Cistercian religious order, and the walls uncovered are roughly 6.5 feet thick, believed to be remains of pillar foundations.</p>

          <p>Top tennis players, including Alex de Minaur and Iga Swiatek, are increasingly voicing concerns about the unsustainable physical demands of the tennis calendar, leading to burnout and shorter careers. De Minaur attributed his early French Open exit to feeling burned out, while Jack Draper raised concerns about the mental toll on top players. Casper Ruud criticized the rankings "rat race," and the ATP and WTA Tours have acknowledged these concerns, stating that player health and wellbeing are a priority. The need for a solution to alleviate the strain on players is becoming more urgent as the sport's physical demands continue to rise.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study across 30 European countries indicates that while parenthood provides a greater sense of meaning in life, it often leads to lower life satisfaction, particularly for mothers. Sociologists Marita Jacob and Ansgar Hudde found that parents, regardless of nationality or social status, reported feeling their lives were more fulfilled compared to childfree individuals. However, the level of life satisfaction depended significantly on factors such as living situations and family policies within their respective countries, with Scandinavian nations showing less disparity between parents and non-parents. The study also highlights that greater gender equality and societal support for families contribute to higher parental satisfaction levels.</p>

          <p>Despite playing a significant role in the protests that led to the impeachment of South Korea's former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, many women now feel their voices are being ignored in the upcoming election, and the two main candidates have been largely silent on gender equality issues, and a third candidate with anti-feminist views has gained popularity among young men.
