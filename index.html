It notes that despite currently high rates and a limited housing inventory, securing affordable options is still possible, especially for borrowers with a strong credit score and overall application. Current average rates include 6.39% for a 30-year mortgage and 6.67% for a 30-year refinance. The article also offers practical advice on how to secure better rates, such as strengthening one's credit profile and shopping around among different lenders, and discusses important factors like loan terms and fees.

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has criticized Rolex for hosting President Donald Trump at the U.S. Open, suggesting it could be an attempt to secure lucrative tariff exemptions for Swiss products. Warren's letter to Rolex's CEO questioned if the company is adopting a strategy seen with Apple and Nvidia, which announced domestic investments after Trump's return to the White House, potentially benefiting from their leaders' relationships with him. This incident follows Trump's August announcement of a 39% levy on Switzerland's exports, a rate higher than those for the European Union and United Kingdom, which is expected to force Swiss watchmakers to hike prices. The senator expressed concern that the timing indicates an effort to curry favor with the President for special-interest exemptions, highlighting a pattern of leaders potentially gaining special treatment.</p>

          <p>Republicans on the Small Business Committees are pushing to eliminate Biden-era rules that mandate 10% of federal contract resources for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Senator Joni Ernst's INNOVATE Act aims to replace current legislation, ensuring grants are awarded based on merit rather than DEI considerations, citing examples of what she deems wasteful spending. Concurrently, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed concern to Maryland Governor Wes Moore over the state's potential use of race and sex in awarding contracts for the Francis Scott Key Bridge rebuild. Duffy warned of legal ramifications, referencing the Civil Rights Act, as the Trump administration monitors the project's contract allocation.</p>

          <p>The remains of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," a woman found dead in 1946, were exhumed in Oregon this week as authorities work to solve the state's oldest unidentified person case. Her dismembered remains were discovered in a burlap sack along the Williamette River, with additional remains and clothing found later that year. Despite national attention, the woman was never identified, and critical evidence went missing in the 1950s. The Oregon State Police's Human Identification Program located her likely burial site, and the exhumation aims to utilize advanced forensic testing to finally identify her and bring resolution to the nearly 80-year-old case.</p>

Retailers are projected to add fewer than 500,000 positions in the final quarter of 2025, marking a 16-year low and an 8% decrease from the year-ago period. This cautious approach is attributed to looming tariffs, persistent inflationary pressures, and companies increasingly relying on automation and permanent staff instead of large seasonal hires. The muted hiring reflects a broader slowdown in the job market and consumer spending pressures, with consulting firms forecasting reduced holiday gift spending and "underwhelming" sales growth.

          <p>A suspect in his 40s has been arrested in southern England in connection with recent cyberattacks that disrupted air travel at several major European airports, the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) announced. This arrest, made late Tuesday, is a positive step, though the investigation remains in its early stages. Airports including London's Heathrow, Dublin, Brussels, and Berlin experienced days of disruption due to "third-party ransomware" affecting software from Collins Aerospace, a US defense giant subsidiary. The incident forced airport employees to conduct manual check-ins and baggage drops, leading to numerous delays and cancellations, underscoring the significant and persistent global threat posed by cybercrime.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's 2025 UN General Assembly speech was met with silence and stony faces from world leaders, a notable contrast to the laughter his 2018 address provoked. Body language expert Peter Collett noted that delegates are now taking Trump more seriously, viewing him as a global entity whose "erratic actions" are a source of concern rather than amusement. Trump's body language, including his slow movements and dominant gestures, is consistently designed to portray him as the "top dog." Despite incendiary remarks on immigration and globalism, the audience maintained a muted response, reflecting a changed political zeitgeist where his pronouncements are no longer perceived as a joke.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's UN General Assembly speech, particularly his focus on Russia's war in Ukraine, is being analyzed for its potential implications for China. Trump mentioned China several times, notably accusing both China and India of funding the ongoing war by continuing to purchase Russian oil. He threatened to impose "very strong rounds of powerful tariffs" on Russia if it doesn't agree to a peace deal, believing it would quickly stop the bloodshed. Observers suggest that Trump's comparatively softer rhetoric towards China in this context, focusing on Russia's actions, could signal a potential pullback from Washington's confrontational stance towards Beijing, offering China a reason for optimism.</p>

The article describes Trump as "unfiltered and unleashed," contrasting it with his previous, more prepared UN appearances. Highlights include his complaints about a teleprompter and escalator, a decades-old grudge about a UN renovation bid, and lengthy tirades against immigration and climate change. The author concludes that Trump's performance aimed for attention and adoration, even through fear and chaos, presenting a dark narrative of existential threats to Western nations.</p>

          <p>Italy's Defense Minister Guido Crosetto condemned an apparent drone attack on the Global Sumud Flotilla heading towards Gaza and dispatched an Italian naval ship for potential rescue operations. Crosetto emphasized the importance of protecting peaceful demonstrations under international law. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani urged Israel to ensure the safety of Italian citizens aboard the convoy, despite Italy's government not supporting the activists and considering the Israeli blockade lawful. Israel has warned the flotilla against breaching its naval blockade, calling for aid to be unloaded at an Israeli port, while activists reported multiple drone attacks in international waters.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that China has become Southeast Asia's leading external partner, surpassing the United States in influence across the region, largely due to its significant economic clout. The Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia Influence Index gives China a one-point lead over the US, identifying it as the most influential power in six of the region's eleven countries. While the region diversifies to avoid dependence on any single power, several nations remain highly exposed to China in sectors like tourism, investment, and trade. China is the region's primary export market and accounts for a substantial portion of its imports, solidifying its economic dominance.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Addie E. Citchens' debut novel, "Dominion," which portrays a fictional Mississippi Delta town grappling with sexual repression within a strict Black church culture. The story follows two women, Diamond and Priscilla, connected by their love for a teenager named Wonder, whose increasingly reckless behavior is shaped by his father's rigid religious views on sexuality. The novel highlights how attempts to control desire can lead to destructive outcomes, as seen in Wonder's violent reaction to a queer encounter. The article praises the book's clear message but suggests some characters could be more fleshed out, calling it a complicated parable rooted in messy reality.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To ensure trustworthy financial advice, individuals should ask prospective advisors if they are a fiduciary, according to financial experts. A fiduciary is legally obligated to act in the client's best interest, a standard not all financial professionals follow, as some adhere only to a "suitability" standard. Failing to work with a fiduciary can lead to higher fees and misaligned advice, potentially costing clients tens of thousands of dollars over time. Fiduciaries must disclose conflicts of interest and how they are compensated, creating alignment with client goals. Resources like the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure site and professional organizations can help find fee-only, fiduciary advisors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has declared Russia sees "no alternative" to continuing the war in Ukraine, rejecting US President Donald Trump's recent remarks that Ukraine could regain all its lost territory. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed Trump's "paper tiger" characterization of Russia and denied the war was aimless, blaming the US and EU for not addressing Russia's security concerns. This stance comes after Trump appeared to shift his rhetoric following a meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, suggesting Ukraine could win with European and NATO support. Meanwhile, Germany expressed hope Trump's statements would increase pressure on Moscow, and the EU plans higher tariffs on Russian oil.</p>

Although winds were not as strong as during the Lahaina disaster, Paia is similarly surrounded by dry brush.

          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) like Teslas often offer significant fuel cost savings compared to gasoline-powered cars, particularly when contrasted with less efficient vehicles such as a Chevy Silverado pickup truck. This article details a cost breakdown, highlighting that Teslas generally have much better miles per gallon (MPG) equivalent, even when comparing the Cybertruck to electric Silverados. Based on average residential electricity rates and typical monthly driving distances, Tesla owners can expect substantial savings on fuel costs, with the majority of EV charging occurring at home. This comparison underscores a key financial advantage of switching from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles to electric models.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung is pushing for an ambitious constitutional reform to allow future presidents to serve two consecutive four-year terms, replacing the current single five-year limit. The initiative aims to synchronize presidential and National Assembly elections, promoting policy continuity and accountability. However, achieving the required two-thirds parliamentary majority and national referendum approval faces significant opposition, particularly regarding proposed changes on sexual minority rights and North Korea. While many presidents have favored similar reforms, the current political scientist notes the challenges, though polls suggest over 60% public support for these changes, aiming for greater delegation of power within the government.</p>

This action follows a BBC investigation revealing migrants undertaking long, expensive journeys, with one asylum seeker reporting a £600 taxi ride for a 250-mile trip to a GP. The Home Office currently does not track these figures, and public transport is often not presented as an option. The controversy highlights broader issues within the asylum system, including cramped hotel conditions and illegal working, prompting calls from politicians across the spectrum for better fiscal management and an end to hotel use for housing migrants.</p>
