          <p>This article details reports of Ukraine drafting soldiers with severe, pre-existing mental health conditions, including personality disorders. It explores systemic loopholes, such as patient privacy preventing military doctors from accessing psychiatric histories, that allow these individuals to be deemed fit for service. The piece highlights the significant danger this practice poses, as stressed soldiers with untreated conditions could be a threat to themselves and their entire units on the battlefield. This situation has led to thousands of complaints from soldiers' families and calls for reform from human rights advocates.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler is positioned to win his first Open Championship, holding a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final round at Royal Portrush. A victory would mark the third leg of a career Grand Slam for Scheffler, who has a history of winning after holding a 54-hole lead. Despite early charges from competitors like Rory McIlroy, Scheffler’s steady, bogey-free third round of 67, highlighted by an eagle, allowed him to pull away from the pack. He aims to join an elite group of players to win three different major championships before the age of 30.</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford, who has been out of favor at Manchester United, is reportedly close to securing a loan move to FC Barcelona. The deal is seen as a potential solution for both the player, who has long expressed a desire to play for the Spanish club, and for Barcelona, which has been seeking to strengthen its attack. The article explores the context of Rashford's declining role at United under manager Ruben Amorim and Barcelona's strategic and financial motivations for pursuing a loan deal. Despite Rashford's inconsistent form, Barcelona is reportedly willing to take a risk on his potential to be a major asset.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their series against Australia with a 27-19 victory in Brisbane, though the match dynamics raised some concerns. The Lions established a dominant 24-5 lead early in the second half, making the contest feel one-sided and dampening the atmosphere. However, as the Lions made substitutions, their performance level dropped, allowing Australia to score late tries and make the final score more respectable. Analysts suggest that while the Lions secured the win, the lack of consistent intensity from both sides left questions about the competitiveness of the series going forward.</p>

          <p>On the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler, Germany is reflecting on the legacy of the 'Operation Valkyrie' plot. The article details the failed bombing by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and the subsequent collapse of the coup, which led to the execution of around 200 conspirators. It also explores the shifting historical perception of these men, who were initially seen as traitors but are now largely honored as heroes. However, modern historians also critically examine their late timing and authoritarian, rather than democratic, vision for a post-Hitler Germany.</p>

This move follows public pressure for more transparency in the case.

          <p>This article provides an analysis of the AI defense company BigBear.ai, comparing its potential to that of the industry giant Palantir. While BigBear.ai's stock has seen significant gains, the article points to its financial instability, including inconsistent gross margins and mounting net losses. In contrast, Palantir demonstrates strong revenue, high margins, and profitability. The analysis concludes that despite some investor optimism, BigBear.ai's current financial state makes it an unlikely challenger to Palantir's dominant position in the defense tech sector.

          <p>Ahead of an election for Japan's upper house, far-right nationalist parties are gaining traction by focusing on anti-immigration rhetoric, challenging the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. These parties, such as Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan, are capitalizing on public concerns about unruly tourists and crimes attributed to foreigners. They advocate for policies that restrict immigration and rely on Japanese labor, echoing populist 'Japan First' sentiments similar to movements in the U.S. and Europe. This comes as Japan faces significant labor shortages due to a declining birthrate and aging population.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have released new CCTV footage in the investigation into the 2024 murder of 15-year-old Rene Graham. The teenager was shot and killed at a music festival in a Ladbroke Grove park. The newly released video shows the suspected killer entering the park and later chasing a second individual with a gun in his hand. Detectives believe people in the community know the identity of the person responsible, and the charity Crimestoppers is offering a £20,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction.</p>

          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the 2024 building collapse in the town of George, which killed 34 construction workers, was 'entirely preventable'. The investigation revealed multiple failures, including the use of substandard materials and the ignoring of serious safety concerns and structural cracks that were evident long before the tragedy. A minister stated that work should have been stopped after a safety officer resigned in protest over the issues. The findings have led to calls for criminal accountability for those found negligent in the disaster.</p>

          <p>On 'The Ramsey Show,' a pregnant stay-at-home mom called for advice, revealing that her family struggles to afford groceries despite a $156,000 annual income. She explained that her husband spends hundreds of dollars monthly on tobacco and marijuana, straining their budget. Host Dave Ramsey challenged the caller to address the situation as a potential addiction issue rather than a simple budgeting problem. He and his co-host questioned the financial and marital dynamics at play, urging her to confront the deeper issues of money control and her husband's need for help.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is making a surprisingly quick recovery from a left knee bone bruise he suffered in early July. Initially expected to be out for about six weeks, Muncy is already running, playing catch, and taking swings without significant discomfort. The team is now optimistic that he will return to the lineup much sooner than anticipated. Muncy's absence has been felt by the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled in the past few weeks, underscoring his importance to the team's success.</p>

The ceremony took place at the Diamond League meeting in London in front of a large home crowd. The team was elevated from silver to gold after the winning U.S. team was disqualified following a 2008 doping confession by American runner Antonio Pettigrew. The belated presentation offered a moment of public recognition and justice for the British athletes after a long process of investigation and medal reallocation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has reportedly revoked the U.S. visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court judges as part of an escalating campaign to support former president Jair Bolsonaro. This action follows President Trump's announcement of 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports. The moves are in response to the court's prosecution of Bolsonaro for an alleged coup attempt. Brazilian President Lula condemned the visa revocations as 'unacceptable external interference' and an 'affront to the Brazilian judiciary and national sovereignty,' vowing that the nation's institutions would not be intimidated.</p>

          <p>A federal filing reveals that Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, registered itself as a 'small disadvantaged business' with the U.S. Small Business Administration. This designation, which can provide preferential access to federal contracts, is intended for companies majority-owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The filing was made in April, shortly before a funding round valued the company at $9 billion. A company spokesperson stated the box on the form was checked erroneously and has since been corrected, and that Neuralink has never received any federal benefits.</p>
