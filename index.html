          <p>One person was killed and several others were wounded during a shooting incident at Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Saturday night. Authorities swiftly detained a person of interest, and after reviewing surveillance footage, police confirmed there was only one shooter involved. The tragic event occurred during a wedding reception, prompting a temporary shelter-in-place order for nearby areas, which has since been lifted. Police have reassured the public that there is no ongoing threat, as the investigation into the exact circumstances and number of victims continues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed five new bills aimed at limiting the scope of federal immigration enforcement within the state. Key legislation, the No Secret Police Act, bans on-duty federal and local law enforcement, including ICE, from wearing face coverings and mandates clear identification. This move challenges federal authority following a Supreme Court ruling on immigration stops, with the Department of Homeland Security criticizing the laws as "despicable" and endangering officers. The bills also protect children in schools and patients in hospitals from enforcement without warrants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Sundowning" describes a common dementia symptom where individuals experience increased confusion and disorientation during late afternoon and evening hours. Neuropsychologists explain this condition, affecting about one in five dementia patients, often peaks in middle stages and can lead to anxiety, restlessness, and sleep disturbances. While no clear cause is identified, disrupted circadian rhythms, pain, and environmental factors are believed to contribute. Experts advise managing symptoms through consistent routines, proper lighting, medication reviews, and minimizing overstimulation to enhance patient comfort and safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his nomination of senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, following the abrupt resignation of Erik Siebert. Siebert's departure came amid pressure from the Trump administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James in a mortgage fraud investigation. Trump explicitly stated he fired Siebert due to his refusal to prosecute James and his support from Democratic senators. Halligan, who previously served on Trump's legal team, will lead an office embroiled in political turmoil.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his strong desire to regain control of the strategically significant Bagram air base in Afghanistan, asserting its importance due to its proximity to Chinese nuclear weapons facilities. This declaration has swiftly drawn pushback from both Beijing and the Taliban government, who emphasized Afghanistan's national sovereignty and called for all parties to play a constructive role in regional peace and stability. The article highlights concerns that Trump's persistent push for the base could significantly escalate tensions and potentially create a new flashpoint in the ongoing geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China.

          <p>Elon Musk forecasts that by 2030, artificial intelligence and robots will largely replace human jobs, leading to a future of "universal high income" and "sustainable abundance." He envisions a society where everyone enjoys superior medical care, food, housing, and transportation, contrasting this with merely a universal basic income. While Musk expresses optimism about machines creating an efficient, prosperous society, critics question the feasibility of funding such a system and the political challenges involved in its implementation, given existing economic and governmental struggles.</p>

          <p>Violent anti-immigration protests in The Hague, Netherlands, resulted in clashes between rioters and police, leading to 30 arrests and two officer injuries. Protesters blocked a major highway, set a police car on fire, and vandalized the office of the centrist D66 political party. Both caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing leader Geert Wilders condemned the "shameless violence." The unrest occurs just weeks before a general election, called after Wilders' party withdrew from the governing coalition over migration policy disputes, highlighting deep societal divisions.</p>

          <p>Jane Austen's classic novel "Emma" has been adapted for the 21st-century stage at London's Rose Theatre, transforming the protagonist into an Oxford dropout meddling in her friends' online dating lives in Essex. Playwright Ava Pickett's modern take explores themes of self-worth derived from social media validation and the complexities of toxic dating apps. The adaptation features a younger George Knightley and emphasizes female friendships, while retaining Emma's core characteristics. This contemporary interpretation aims to resonate with modern audiences by reflecting current societal challenges and relationship dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many UK university students are grappling with severe financial hardship, forcing them to take on extensive part-time work or endure long commutes, as maintenance loans fail to cover basic living costs. Research indicates that maximum annual loans cover only about half of a fresher's expenses, leading to students like Tianna Hunkins working 30-hour weeks and Faith Webb commuting 90 minutes each way. Universities are adapting by offering flexible learning options and advocating for the reintroduction of maintenance grants to alleviate this growing burden on students.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a popular muscle-boosting supplement, is being increasingly studied for its potential cognitive benefits, including improving short-term memory, mood, and focus, particularly in individuals experiencing brain fog. While primarily known for enhancing athletic performance, emerging research suggests creatine may help the brain produce more energy, especially for those under stress or with dietary deficiencies. Experts emphasize that more studies are needed to fully understand its effects and optimal usage. Known side effects are generally mild, but individuals with kidney conditions should consult a doctor before use.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the United Kingdom's intention to recognize a Palestinian state in September, contingent on Israel agreeing to a ceasefire and committing to a two-state solution. This marks a significant shift in British foreign policy, influenced by growing pressure from Labour MPs and international allies. While government sources believe it will impact the situation on the ground, critics dismiss the move as "gesture politics" that rewards Hamas and creates diplomatic friction with the US. The decision reflects internal party pressures and broader global sentiment regarding the conflict.</p>

He indicated that discussions are underway and did not rule out sending troops to retake the base. Afghan officials have voiced opposition to a renewed US presence, while current and former US officials caution that re-occupying Bagram would be a massive undertaking, akin to a re-invasion. Such a move would require extensive troop deployment, advanced air defenses, and face threats from various militant groups and potentially Iran.</p>
