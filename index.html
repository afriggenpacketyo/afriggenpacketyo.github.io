          <p>Pro-Palestinian demonstrators at Columbia University were taken into custody by New York City Police officers after occupying Butler Library, resulting in clashes with public safety officers and some injuries. The university requested NYPD assistance due to disruptions inside and outside the building, citing safety concerns and the presence of non-affiliated individuals. Demonstrators had stormed the library, vandalizing property and hanging banners, while a large crowd gathered outside. University officials condemned the disruptions to academic activities during pre-final exams reading week, and Gov. Kathy Hochul emphasized the right to peaceful protest while condemning violence and vandalism. The university is already under pressure from the Trump administration regarding federal funding and policies related to campus protests.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the West is at a critical juncture, with the actions of leaders like President Trump accelerating the unraveling of the Western world order. The article draws parallels to historical empires undone by hubris and divisiveness, highlighting concerns about tariffs, attacks on NATO allies, and the undermining of democratic norms. It suggests that these policies are eroding the fundamentals of US and Western economic and security dominance, leading to a loss of faith in the Western project.</p>

          <p>Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied Columbia University's Butler Library in an attempt to reignite the protest movement from the previous spring, resulting in a standoff with security and, eventually, intervention by the New York City Police Department. The protesters, who renamed the library, faced resistance from security, leading to a chaotic scene both inside and outside the building. The university administration condemned the disruption to academic activities and called for disciplinary action against those involved. The protest occurred amid ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and Columbia over the handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and allegations of harassment against Jewish students.</p>
