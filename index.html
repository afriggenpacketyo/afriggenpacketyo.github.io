          <p>In his Independence Day speech, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi advocated for national self-reliance, particularly in energy and defense, amidst US tariff threats over India's Russian oil purchases. He framed dependence on other nations as a threat to freedom and vowed to protect India's agricultural interests. Modi also issued a stern warning to Pakistan, stating that India would no longer tolerate "nuclear blackmail" and referencing recent military confrontations over Kashmir.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun canceling numerous flights in anticipation of a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could ground the airline by Saturday. The carrier reported an unusual number of flight attendants not showing up for work, exacerbating the cancellations that are expected to affect over 100,000 customers. The dispute centers on wage and labor issues, with the union rejecting the airline's offer and a proposal for binding arbitration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's approach to global trade is fundamentally challenging the core principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO), creating uncertainty within the international system. This article argues that beyond the immediate pain of tariffs, the greater damage lies in the erosion of established rules like the 'most favored nation' clause, which ensures equal trade concessions for all members. This abandonment of multilateralism is forcing countries to reconsider their trade strategies in a system that appears increasingly directionless.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, for a critical summit aimed at finding a path to end the war in Ukraine. The meeting, held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, comes after previous negotiation rounds failed to produce a breakthrough. The White House has framed the discussion as a "listening exercise," downplaying expectations for an immediate ceasefire, while Trump himself has acknowledged a significant chance the meeting may not succeed.</p>

          <p>At just 20 years old, undefeated British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma is set to face his most significant challenge yet against veteran Dillian Whyte in Saudi Arabia. Hailed for his speed, power, and southpaw stance, Itauma has quickly amassed a record of 12 wins with 10 knockouts, drawing considerable hype. A victory over a well-known former title contender like Whyte would serve as a major breakthrough, potentially positioning him for a world title shot within the next year.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing for a nearly 20% increase in the number of data centres, with almost 100 new facilities planned, largely driven by the growth of artificial intelligence. While the government views this expansion as critical national infrastructure, concerns are mounting over the immense energy and water consumption required to power and cool these facilities. Experts warn of potential impacts on consumer utility bills and the environment, as many new centres are planned in water-stressed areas.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withhold federal funding from institutions with DEI initiatives. The judge stated the guidance created a "sea change" in regulation, causing educators to fear punishment for lawful and beneficial speech, though she did not rule on the merits of DEI policies themselves.</p>

          <p>New home prices in 70 major Chinese cities fell by 0.3% in July, matching the previous month's sharp decline and indicating that government stimulus efforts have not yet revived the property market. Despite measures like lower mortgage rates and eased purchasing restrictions, consumer demand remains weak as people prioritize saving over investing in real estate. This ongoing slump continues to place immense pressure on property developers, who have been grappling with a severe liquidity crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After winning the Premier League title in his first season, Liverpool manager Arne Slot now faces heightened expectations following a summer spending spree that could exceed £300 million. The club has made several high-profile signings, including Florian Wirtz for £116m, fundamentally shifting the team's outlook from rebuilding to dominance. This significant investment means that anything less than a serious challenge for both the domestic title and the Champions League would now be considered a disappointment.</p>
