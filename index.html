          <p>Federal law enforcement agencies issued an intelligence bulletin warning of potential violence against Jewish and Israeli institutions and their supporters in the U.S. The memo, issued by the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the National Counterterrorism Center, cites recent attacks in Boulder, Colorado, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania as potential motivators for further violence. The bulletin advises security partners to remain vigilant for threats, noting that online messaging promoting violence by foreign terrorist organizations and their supporters could compel threat actors motivated by various ideologies to engage in violence. The agencies also warned that foreign terrorist organizations have pushed content encouraging violence regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, which is one of many factors that has influenced the radicalization of violent extremists. The alert comes amid heightened tensions and increased security concerns within the Jewish and Israeli communities across the nation. </p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling over a dozen flights daily because tariffs are hindering its ability to accept delivery of new Embraer 175 regional jets. The airline stated it would not immediately accept delivery of two aircraft to avoid incurring extra tariff-related costs, impacting Horizon Air, its regional subsidiary. President Trump's tariff agenda has disrupted supply chains, forcing companies to raise prices, with the aviation industry also warning of the levies' effects. Without the new aircraft, Alaska Airlines must cancel 14 flights a day through July, affecting routes served by Horizon in the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, California, Colorado, Utah, and western Canada. The airline is working to accommodate affected guests on alternative travel plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been returned to the U.S. to face federal charges. He faces one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens, detailed in an indictment unsealed in Nashville. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia after being presented with an arrest warrant. Abrego Garcia's attorney argues that his client is being punished before having a chance to defend himself and that the charges are an abuse of power. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia conspired to bring migrants from Latin American countries to the U.S. between 2016 and 2025, transporting them through Mexico and into Texas, and devising cover stories for law enforcement. </p>

          <p>Jacques DeGraff, a Democratic political strategist and Fox News contributor, described the feud between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as "unprecedented" compared to past Trump disputes. DeGraff noted that Musk is uniquely positioned, having played a significant role in Trump's election. The dispute has implications for both parties, with Tesla stock dropping significantly and potential political consequences for the GOP's budget package. DeGraff believes the split could allow other players to deviate from the party line, while GOP strategist Dallas Woodhouse suggests the feud is unimportant to most Republicans. The public falling out between two powerful figures is bound to have rippling effects in the political and business realms. </p>

          <p>The government is struggling to cut the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, with plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. This figure is only marginally less than the £2.3bn spent in 2024/25, with the money largely used to cover accommodation costs. The Home Office stated its commitment to ending asylum hotels and speeding up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money. Critics argue that diverting foreign aid to cover domestic costs undermines the purpose of alleviating poverty and supporting humanitarian efforts overseas. The scale of government aid spending on asylum hotels has meant huge cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities across the world. </p>
