          <p>E.l.f. Beauty is planning to acquire Hailey Bieber's skincare brand, Rhode, for up to $1 billion, aiming to expand its presence in the skincare market.

Rhode, launched in 2022, has quickly grown, generating $212 million in revenue in the past year and plans to launch in Sephora stores; Bieber will remain as Rhode's chief creative officer.

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's shares increased significantly on Wednesday, despite the retailer lowering its profit forecast due to an anticipated $50 million impact from tariffs. The company now projects full-year earnings per share between $9.50 and $10.50, down from the previous range, and reduced its operating margin forecast. While the guidance includes the impact of tariffs on imports from China and other countries, Abercrombie reported fiscal first-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, with sales rising to a record high of $1.10 billion. The company is diversifying its sourcing network and seeking expense reductions to offset the tariff impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>HP's shares dropped 15% after the company reported second-quarter results that exceeded revenue estimates but fell short on earnings and guidance, partly due to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The company's outlook reflects added costs driven by these tariffs, though HP is working to mitigate them by expanding its manufacturing footprint outside of China. HP's CEO, Enrique Lores, stated that the company has increased production in Vietnam, Thailand, India, Mexico, and the U.S., expecting to fully mitigate the trade-related costs by Q4. The company reported a revenue increase of 3.3% year-over-year, but net income decreased from the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

The company anticipates approximately $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, though this figure is reduced due to export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. Despite political tensions, Nvidia's growth is fueled by the demand for its AI chips, essential for applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. CEO Jensen Huang noted the strong global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure, with net income increasing 26% to $18.8 billion, and revenue rising 69% to $44.06 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An ostrich farm in British Columbia, facing a cull of nearly 400 birds due to avian flu concerns, has garnered support from Trump administration officials, including Robert F Kennedy Jr and Dr. Mehmet Oz. Kennedy has urged Canadian officials to consider studying the ostriches for bird flu antibodies, offering support for research efforts. Dr. Oz offered to re-home the birds on his Florida ranch, which the farm declined due to Canadian quarantine orders. Canadian officials maintain the cull is necessary to prevent the virus from mutating and spreading, as the farm had confirmed cases of avian flu in December and January.</p>

This success, along with Ghost's No. 1 LP "SkeletÃ¡," suggests a resurgence of metal in mainstream music, driven by devoted fanbases and streaming numbers comparable to pop artists. Industry experts attribute this trend to the bands' ability to build online communities and create immersive experiences, appealing to a new generation of genre-agnostic listeners. The rise of these bands may also reflect a broader cultural shift towards escapism and a reaction against overexposure in the digital age.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Emil Bove III, a former criminal defense lawyer and top Justice Department official, to be a federal appeals judge. Bove's nomination has drawn scrutiny due to his role in purging career officials and his involvement in dropping bribery charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The nomination requires confirmation in the Senate, where he is expected to face opposition from Democrats. Bove's supporters highlight his experience as a prosecutor in national security cases, while critics focus on his controversial actions at the DOJ.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has condemned Israel's new aid operation in southern Gaza following a chaotic launch where thousands of Palestinians rushed a food distribution site, leading to Israeli forces firing warning shots. The new system, designed to bypass the UN and Hamas, has been criticized for violating humanitarian principles and potentially politicizing aid. UN officials claim the Israeli vision would replace hundreds of distribution sites with only four, requiring Palestinians to travel miles through Israeli troops to obtain aid.

          <p>Consolidating credit card debt could be a smart financial move in June 2025, as credit card interest rates are likely to remain high while rates on alternatives like home equity borrowing products could fall further. With credit card interest compounding daily, consolidating with a HELOC or debt consolidation loan can save interest costs and allow for larger payments toward the principal. Borrowers should consider speaking with a financial advisor or debt relief servicer to create a personalized debt consolidation plan that fits their needs and budget. (not investment advice)</p>
