          <p>Despite a ceasefire agreement announced by U.S. President Trump, Israel claims Iran violated the agreement by launching missiles, prompting a forceful response. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the IDF to continue attacking Tehran, while Iran denies launching missiles after the ceasefire. First responders reported an Iranian missile hitting Beersheba, resulting in four deaths and approximately 20 injuries. The Israeli military reported intercepting missiles launched from Iran, and despite these events, Trump urged both countries not to violate the ceasefire. The situation remains tense as both sides trade accusations and warnings, casting doubt on the viability of the agreement.</p>

          <p>Spanish authorities are investigating the discovery of multiple bodies in the Mediterranean Sea with their hands and feet bound.

Investigators believe the migrants may have been tied up and thrown into the sea during a dispute with smugglers. This discovery highlights the dangers and cruel realities faced by migrants attempting to cross from North Africa to Europe, as the investigation seeks to identify the victims and determine the causes of their deaths.</p>

          <p>A Vox article explores the potential impact of declining deep reading habits on American politics, suggesting a shift back to pre-literate modes of cognition. Sustained engagement with long-form text activates cognitive capacities, while the average American reads fewer books than ever. Some theorists believe the digital age's modes of thought increasingly resemble those of pre-literate oral cultures, impacting commitment to pluralism and rational self-government. The article suggests that while digital media has its benefits, it may be impacting the way that voters and citizens think about rational self-government.</p>

This event reflects China's shift towards a more proactive defense strategy and foreign policy amid increasing geopolitical rivalry, especially with the United States.

European allies are increasing defense spending to meet Trump's demands, with NATO reaching an agreement for nations to boost spending to five percent of their GDP, excluding Spain. Trump stated he doesn't think the U.S. needs to hit the 5% target but that other nations should, and Rutte said NATO would stand behind the U.S. after Iran launched a counterstrike on its air base in Qatar. Rutte also defended the U.S. strikes on Iran, emphasizing that Iran should not possess nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian criticizes the Democratic establishment's support for Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race, arguing that it mirrors Trump's vulgarity and disregard for the public. Cuomo, who resigned due to sexual misconduct allegations, is described as a Democratic Trump, with endorsements from centrist Democrats and attacks on his progressive challenger, Zohran Mamdani. The author argues that Democrats are abandoning decency by supporting Cuomo and squandering the talents of other candidates. This is a moral failure and a failure of imagination, the author argues, as it is not clear that the embrace of masculine bullies will be politically wise.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, is campaigning to become the next mayor of New York City. Cuomo is considered a centrist with backing from wealthy donors, and he is facing a challenge from Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing state representative endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Groups supporting Cuomo have spent millions attacking Mamdani, portraying him as a dangerous choice for mayor. Cuomo's campaign focuses on his experience and promises to reduce crime and build affordable housing, while critics highlight the allegations that led to his resignation.</p>

          <p>Senator Chris Murphy has been on an intellectual journey, influenced as much by the Trumpist right as by the Sanders left. He has come to think that the Democratic Party can regain working-class support only by calling out the powerful corporate villains who he believes are to blame for the country’s problems. Murphy started with Why Liberalism Failed, by the Notre Dame professor Patrick Deneen, and started spending time listening to the Red Scare, and reading Curtis Yarvin, and going through the stuff that the Claremont Institute was producing.  He has come to feel that the new right—skeptical of free-market libertarianism and eager to use state power to impose its values on American institutions, including Big Business—was asking the right questions, even if its answers were alarming.</p>

          <p>President Trump's popularity is declining, with disapproval rates increasing after high-profile policy moves, including responses to immigration protests and trade tariffs. The article suggests a "thermostatic" model of public opinion, where the public reacts negatively to big policy decisions. While the public is cooling on Trump, it is not necessarily warming to Democrats or liberal policy positions. With the US embroiled in a conflict with Iran, it is unclear if this trend will hold, but the article suggests that military action against Iran was already unpopular before the US got involved.</p>

          <p>Aggressive immigration raids carried out by masked federal agents in unmarked vehicles are creating problems for local law enforcement agencies in Los Angeles. Police have little insight into the federal enforcement actions and often have to deal with the aftermath, including protests and residents' questions. Incidents of agents pointing guns at civilians and the use of untraceable vehicles have raised concerns about accountability and potential for misidentification. Local officials are calling for more transparency and coordination to avoid accidental confrontations and ensure public safety.</p>
