          <p>The Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, equipped with the world's largest digital camera, has released its first images of star nurseries and galaxies, showcasing unprecedented clarity. The observatory's telescope and camera will conduct detailed images of the southern hemisphere sky for a decade, creating an ultra-wide, ultra-high-definition, time-lapse record of the cosmos. Among the first images are composite photos of the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula, both star birthplaces within the Milky Way, as well as the Virgo Cluster, which comprises up to 2,000 galaxies. The observatory will begin its Legacy Survey of Space and Time later this year, tracking asteroids and interstellar objects.</p>

          <p>The National Terrorism Advisory System has issued a bulletin warning of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. While there are no specific, credible threats at this time, the bulletin cautions about potential low-level cyberattacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and possible attacks against U.S. networks by actors affiliated with the Iranian government. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators to attack targets in the U.S., citing previous disrupted Iranian-backed plots since 2020. The State Department has also issued a worldwide alert for Americans traveling abroad, advising increased caution due to potential demonstrations against U.S. citizens and interests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have found the first evidence that subatomic particles from cosmic rays may be affecting the efficiency of error correction techniques in quantum computing. The scientists monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons, fundamental subatomic particles produced by cosmic rays, and gamma ray-induced particle disturbances. They observed quasiparticle bursts leading to correlated errors induced by muons, separating the contributions of muons and gamma rays. These findings could be significant for the scaling of quantum processors and the design of fault-tolerant quantum computing systems, potentially improving the stability and accuracy of quantum computations.</p>

The 29-year-old, who retired from judo earlier this month, won gold in the men's 100-kilogram judo event at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and finished seventh at the Paris Games. Wolf, born to a Japanese mother and American father, is already a popular media personality and follows in the footsteps of Naoya Ogawa, who also transitioned from judo to professional wrestling after winning a silver medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. His move into professional wrestling marks a new chapter in his athletic career.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Russia's response is being closely watched, but analysts believe Moscow is unlikely to offer significant assistance to its ally Iran. While Iran has supported Russia with military drones in the Ukraine war, Russia may have limited resources to reciprocate. Russia also needs to balance its relationship with Iran against its desire to re-establish ties with the U.S. under the Trump administration. So far, Moscow's response has been muted, calling on Iran and Israel to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the crisis, reflecting its delicate position in the escalating conflict.</p>

Home Secretary is expected to present a statement to Parliament to proscribe the group as a terrorist organization. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley stated that while the right to protest is essential, actions supporting Palestine Action go beyond legitimate protest. The planned protest is supported by 35 groups, but the Met Police chief says that until the group is proscribed, the Met has no legal power to prevent the protest, though conditions will be imposed to prevent disorder.</p>

He highlighted that the damage extended far below ground level, even to structures deeply embedded in rock and shielded from flames. Several B-2 bombers were used in the strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with over 125 aircraft participating in the mission. The president emphasized the precision of the strikes, asserting that the biggest damage occurred deep underground, reinforcing the effectiveness of the operation.</p>

          <p>Iran's parliament has reportedly approved a measure to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil supplies, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. This decision, which now rests with the country's national security council, risks alienating Iran's neighbors and trade partners, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports. Experts suggest that closing the strait could provoke hostilities and damage Iran's own economic interests, as it would disrupt oil supplies and potentially invite retaliation against its oil production and export infrastructure. While the move raises geopolitical tensions and the specter of higher energy prices, its implementation remains uncertain.</p>

Gold is expected to benefit from geopolitical shocks, while Chinese assets could remain relatively shielded.

          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP), driven by pressure from the U.S. The 5% target includes 3.5% for pure defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure like cyber warfare capabilities. While some member states are committed to reaching this milestone, others struggle to meet the existing 2% threshold agreed upon a decade ago. The U.S. is seeking concrete plans and commitments, while some European allies may attempt to dilute the pledges, leading to potential clashes at the upcoming summit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite being the most sanctioned nation on Earth since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia's economy has shown remarkable resilience. In 2024, the Russian economy outgrew all G7 nations, expanding by 4.3%, driven by record military spending and stable oil exports diverted to China and India. However, inflation remains high, interest rates have soared, and companies face worker shortages, leading to warnings of a potential recession. While some analysts predict a mild downturn, others suggest the economy could be headed for collapse, though the unemployment rate remains low. (not investment advice)</p>

Oil prices have risen due to the potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for global oil supplies. The U.S. Secretary of State has called for China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait.</p>

While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors.
