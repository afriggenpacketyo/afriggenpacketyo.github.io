          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Chinese President Xi Jinping has approved a deal designed to allow the social media app TikTok to continue its operations within the United States. Speaking to reporters, Trump indicated that the approval from Xi was a significant step, though he suggested that the final signing of the agreement might still be a formality. The statement followed what Trump described as a "productive call" with the Chinese president, covering a range of topics. This development marks a potential resolution to the long-standing national security concerns surrounding the popular video-sharing platform's ownership and data practices.</p>

The aircraft, a Cirrus SR22T registered to James, crashed under unknown circumstances after taking off from Nashville, Tennessee. James was a celebrated figure in the music industry, known for co-writing hits like Carrie Underwood's "Jesus, Take the Wheel," and his death has prompted an outpouring of grief from artists like Underwood and Jason Aldean.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bill Simmons, CEO of The Ringer, has characterized the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel from ABC as an act of political censorship rather than a consequence of 'cancel culture.' He pointed to reports that ABC executives feared retaliation from the Trump administration over Kimmel's controversial comments linking the suspected assassin of Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. Simmons stated on his podcast that such acts of censorship will likely continue throughout the Trump presidency but expressed confidence that prominent figures like Kimmel will always find a platform for their content. He affirmed his long-standing friendship with Kimmel while describing the current political discourse as the ugliest it has ever been.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A short-term government funding bill passed by the Republican-led House failed to advance in the Senate, leaving no clear path to avoid a shutdown before the October 1 deadline. The GOP measure, intended to fund the government until November 21, did not secure the necessary 60 votes, with Democrats opposing it over a lack of negotiation on their priorities. With both chambers now in recess until just before the deadline, the legislative standoff increases the likelihood of a government shutdown. President Trump acknowledged the possibility, stating the country could be "closed for a period of time."</p>

          <p>A vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has voted to soften its recommendation for the COVID-19 vaccine. The committee now advises that all Americans engage in "shared clinical decision-making" with a healthcare provider to determine if they should receive the shot, a departure from previous universal recommendations for everyone aged 6 months and older. The move has raised concerns that it may create confusion and access barriers, potentially lowering vaccination rates.

          <p>The Canadian government has banned the Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap from entering the country for upcoming performances, citing statements that allegedly endorse political violence and support for terrorist organizations. The decision references terror charges filed in the UK against band member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh for displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, which he denies. A Canadian official stated the group's actions are "dangerous endorsements of violence and hate," not legitimate artistic expression. Kneecap has condemned the ban as "deeply malicious" and threatened legal action, while the move was praised by the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs in Canada.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has revealed significant issues with counterfeit goods and fraudulent sellers on Walmart's third-party marketplace, a key driver of the company's e-commerce growth. The report found that lax vetting processes allowed sellers to use stolen identities of legitimate businesses to list fake, and potentially dangerous, products like health supplements and beauty items. Current and former employees stated that Walmart prioritized rapid seller onboarding to compete with Amazon, sometimes at the expense of safety and trust. In response to the findings, Walmart has reportedly begun to tighten its vetting procedures for sellers in the health and beauty categories.</p>

However, organizations named by Cruz, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, state that any funds received were used exclusively for environmental work within China.

This rhetoric diverges from letters by previous presidents, including Joe Biden and George W.

This is distinct from cable channels like CNN, which are not subject to the same licensing. While revoking a license is a complex process typically reserved for issues like obscenity or lack of local news, the administration is leveraging this authority to pressure networks over perceived political bias, an unprecedented application of this regulatory power.</p>

Analysts suggest the rise in longer-dated yields reflects expectations of solid GDP growth and slightly higher inflation, rather than just future short-term rates.

          <p>Shares of the online ticket marketplace StubHub have fallen significantly since its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, dropping 10% on Friday for a third consecutive day of losses. The stock is now down 21% from its initial public offering price of $23.50, giving the company a market capitalization of approximately $6.8 billion. StubHub's poor performance contrasts with the successful recent IPOs of other tech companies like Klarna and Figma. The company faces headwinds from new federal regulations requiring transparent ticket pricing and a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against its rival, Live Nation, over resale practices.</p>

          <p>Pattern Group, a leading third-party seller on Amazon, made its public debut on the Nasdaq, with its stock closing up 11% at $15.63 after pricing its IPO at $14 per share. The offering raised $300 million and valued the e-commerce accelerator at about $2.5 billion. Founded in 2013, Pattern helps over 200 brands, including Nestle and Panasonic, optimize their sales on major online marketplaces. The successful IPO comes as the market for tech offerings has rebounded, though the company noted in its prospectus that its heavy reliance on the Amazon platform and uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policy are significant risks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to introduce a new $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, which are used by companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers for jobs that are difficult to fill domestically. A White House official confirmed that President Trump is preparing to sign a proclamation implementing the substantial fee as part of a broader crackdown on immigration. The H-1B program is crucial for the technology sector, but it has faced criticism for allegedly enabling companies to hire foreign labor at lower wages. This new fee represents a significant increase from the current costs, which range from approximately $1,700 to $4,500 per application.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz sharply criticized FCC Chairman Brendan Carr for threatening ABC's broadcast license over comments made by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. On his podcast, Cruz compared Carr's warnings to tactics used by the mafia, calling them "dangerous as hell." While stating he was personally "thrilled" that Kimmel faced consequences, Cruz argued that it is a perilous precedent for the government to be in the business of punishing media outlets for speech it dislikes, warning it could ultimately harm conservatives. The stance puts Cruz at odds with former President Trump, who praised Carr and applauded Kimmel's suspension.</p>

In a recent interview, he classified Bitcoin among "the great property assets" of history, arguing its lack of cash flows makes it "perfect money." Saylor projects that Bitcoin's value will appreciate faster than the S&P 500 indefinitely, allowing it to serve as collateral for a new generation of digital credit instruments. He believes this will create a gateway for massive capital investment into the Bitcoin ecosystem from traditional finance. (not investment advice)</p>

The report projects the addition of 265 gigawatts of electricity supply by 2029, a substantial increase from previous estimates, creating a bullish outlook for industrial companies. This trend is expected to benefit firms like GE Vernova, which produces power-generating turbines, and Eaton, which manufactures essential electrical equipment for the grid and data centers.

The provision, part of recent legislation, allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually, but key details on eligibility have been pending. The new guidance confirms that workers in "specified service trades or businesses," such as healthcare and legal services, will not qualify for the deduction. Additionally, the agencies specified that automatic gratuities, such as those added for large parties at restaurants, will not be considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary payments.

          <p>Following another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, consumers have several relatively inexpensive options for borrowing money. A home equity line of credit (HELOC) currently offers one of the lowest average rates at 8.05%, making it more affordable than home equity loans, personal loans, and especially credit cards. Home equity loans provide the stability of a fixed rate, while personal loans offer an unsecured option that does not put a borrower's home at risk as collateral. The cooling interest rate environment may make variable-rate products like HELOCs even more attractive if the downward trend in rates continues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In remembrance of actor and director Robert Redford, this article explores a central theme of his work: the corrupting nature and ultimate hollowness of winning. From "Downhill Racer" to "The Candidate," Redford consistently portrayed characters whose athletic or political victories came at a great personal or ethical cost. This recurring motif was deeply personal, stemming from his own experiences as a young athlete and his subsequent disillusionment with a culture fixated on success above all else. His films and directing choices reveal an artist who understood that true substance is hard-won and that success must be handled with care to avoid becoming its slave.</p>

The Xbox Series S will now start at $399, while the Series X models will see a $50 increase.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. consumers are facing rising grocery bills due to a combination of three primary factors: tariffs, climate change, and agricultural labor shortages. According to food industry analyst Phil Lempert, the Trump administration's tariffs have directly increased the cost of imported goods like coffee, with companies passing these expenses on to shoppers. Climate change has shifted food production to other countries, while domestic immigration policies have contributed to a shortage of farm workers. These pressures are causing food prices to rise at their fastest monthly rate since 2022, forcing many consumers to seek out discounts and cut back on spending.</p>
