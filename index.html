        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a 5% decline to $4,588.85 on Monday, erasing gains made after reaching a new all-time high of $4,954.81 over the weekend. This pullback occurred as crypto assets, including Bitcoin, lost momentum gained from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hints at upcoming rate cuts, which had initially prompted a "risk-on" mode among investors. The shift in market leadership from Bitcoin to Ether, driven by regulatory tailwinds and institutional buying, has helped Ether sustain the $4,000 level this month. Despite recent outflows from Ether ETFs, the broader market remains influenced by macroeconomic signals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders openly discussed his frustration after being benched by head coach Kevin Stefanski before a game-winning drive in a preseason victory. Sanders, who struggled with five sacks earlier in the game, had hoped to lead the final two-minute drive but was replaced by Tyler Huntley, who secured the win. Stefanski defended his decision, citing the plan to play Huntley, who was later cut, and denying any intent to sabotage Sanders' development. The team has named Joe Flacco as the Week 1 starter, with the backup position still uncertain amidst other quarterback injuries.</p>

          <p>An Israeli strike on Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza Strip reportedly killed at least 15 people, including four journalists from international media outlets such as Reuters, Associated Press, Al Jazeera, and NBC. Gaza's Civil Defence stated that a second strike occurred as rescuers responded to the initial attack, causing further casualties. The Israeli military and prime minister's office declined immediate comment, while the UN's human rights office condemned the incident as a grave breach of international law. This event follows a previous incident two weeks prior where six journalists were killed near another Gaza hospital.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs, including Ozempic and Wegovy, are increasingly popular for weight loss and show promise for treating various conditions from cardiovascular disease to addiction. While effective, the long-term impact of these medications on human desire and emotion remains a significant unanswered question. Scientists are investigating whether these drugs can selectively suppress harmful compulsions without affecting productive desires or the experience of joy and pain. Experts caution against viewing them as a "wonder drug," emphasizing the need for more research into their effects on the brain's desire pathways and the importance of combining medication with behavioral changes for sustainable health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping sent independence day greetings to Ukraine, acknowledging 33 years of steady bilateral relations and cooperation. Ukrainian President Zelensky expressed appreciation for the congratulations, emphasizing mutual respect and the pursuit of peace and stability. This exchange comes amid international scrutiny of China's growing closeness with Russia since the invasion, with Beijing maintaining its neutral stance on the conflict.

          <p>A special election for Iowa State Senate District 1 pits far-right Republican Christopher Prosch, known for controversial statements, against Democrat Catelin Drey, a marketing executive focusing on affordability and reproductive rights. A victory for Drey would end the Republican supermajority in the state senate, potentially signaling a "blue wave" ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The article highlights the increasing importance of state legislatures in national issues and the Republican Party's embrace of extremism. Voters' frustrations with the cost of living and "wackiness" of current policies are central to the race's outcome.</p>

          <p>Foreign nationals are reportedly taking extreme measures, such as using "burner" phones and wiping social media, when traveling to the United States under the Trump administration. This comes after reports of visitors facing intense scrutiny and detention at the border, with devices being searched and entry denied based on political views or past online content. US Customs and Border Protection maintains that searches are for national security and not politically motivated, despite anecdotal evidence suggesting otherwise. The situation has led multiple countries to update travel advisories and prompted concerns about civil liberties and the US's international image.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that while crime rates, particularly violent crime, are decreasing in most major US cities, public fear of crime is paradoxically increasing. Donald Trump consistently exploits this fear with demagogic rhetoric, despite data showing declines in crime. The author contends that Democrats err by only citing statistics, as the lived reality of fear, fueled by media coverage, social media, and a general sense of disorder, holds more sway. To counter Trump's narrative, Democrats must acknowledge and address this pervasive fear, advocating for community-based solutions and well-resourced local policing rather than relying solely on data.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Democratic Party leadership is making a significant political miscalculation by ignoring its base's strong disapproval of Israel's military actions in Gaza. High-ranking Democrats, like Pete Aguilar, have participated in delegations to Israel and met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, despite widespread Democratic voter support for a permanent ceasefire and concerns about war crimes. The article suggests that financial influence from pro-Israel PACs sways politicians, but warns that this stance alienates voters, particularly those who supported Biden in 2020 but are now disaffected.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that fish, often considered simple-minded, may experience pleasure and actively seek it out, challenging previous assumptions focused primarily on their negative experiences. A study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, involving bluestreak cleaner wrasse and threadfin butterflyfish, found that butterflyfish preferred areas where they had been groomed by cleanerfish. Experiments with opioid-mimicking drugs and blockers suggest that the fish's opioid system mediates this pleasurable sensation, while a separate dopamine-related system drives their desire to seek it again. These findings prompt a reevaluation of fish welfare in aquariums and aquaculture.</p>

          <p>As measles surged in Texas, the Trump administration's interference reportedly hampered the CDC's ability to respond effectively, leading to the worst outbreak in over three decades. An investigation reveals that administration actions, including communications freezes, data censorship, and staff layoffs, created confusion and restrained CDC experts from assisting local health workers. This delayed response, coupled with misinformation about vaccines, contributed to the outbreak spreading across multiple states and Mexico, resulting in at least 16 deaths. The article underscores the dangers of political manipulation in public health and the critical need for unhindered scientific response during health crises.</p>

          <p>The fitness trend of wearing weighted vests is gaining popularity, with influencers claiming benefits for posture, weight loss, cardiovascular health, and bone and muscle growth. However, this article fact-checks these claims, revealing that current research does not significantly support their effectiveness for bone density and muscle strength. Experts state that traditional resistance training with weights is far more effective for building strength. While weighted vests can increase calorie burn and cardiovascular exertion, they are not a substitute for proven strength-building exercises. The article advises caution against marketing hype and emphasizes evidence-based fitness practices.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans' public education system has transformed into an almost entirely charter-based model, with significant improvements in test scores and graduation rates. Initially met with resistance, the shift granted schools greater autonomy, leading to better outcomes compared to the struggling pre-Katrina district. However, the article notes challenges like early "no-excuses" discipline, uneven access to quality schools based on socioeconomic status, and the pain of school closures. While the system has evolved through learning from mistakes, it remains a "work in progress," with ongoing debates about its future direction and ensuring equitable education for all.</p>

          <p>New York immigration courts are experiencing chaos and confusion due to increased federal law enforcement presence under the Trump administration, leading to a rise in arrests within courthouses.

The article describes a tense atmosphere with conflicting security protocols and incidents of aggressive behavior by federal agents. With a 3.7 million case backlog, fewer migrants are appearing for hearings, forcing them to choose between their liberty and pursuing their legal claims.</p>
