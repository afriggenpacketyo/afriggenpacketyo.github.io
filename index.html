        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) revealed that Desmond Holly, a 16-year-old Colorado school shooter, had been active on a "violent gore" website known for hosting white supremacist ideologies and graphic violence months prior to his attack. Holly, who died by suicide after injuring two students, was reportedly radicalized by an extremist network, with the site starting on Reddit before being banned. This article highlights a disturbing trend where multiple recent school shooters have frequented similar online platforms, which often glorify violence and reference other attackers. Experts emphasize the urgent need for increased funding in violence prevention and early intervention programs, advocating for early intervention to prevent interest in such harmful sites.</p>

          <p>China's recent Victory Day parade, notably attended by leaders like Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, was strategically orchestrated to convey a powerful message primarily to the Global South, rather than solely to Washington. This article posits that the event projected an image of an "axis of the excluded," presenting an alternative to Western-dominated international frameworks for middle powers navigating military development and seeking to avoid Cold War entanglements. Kim's carefully managed presence, his first multilateral appearance since the pandemic, signaled that Beijing offers diplomatic lifelines and legitimacy without requiring denuclearization or significant reform. The trilateral display aimed to reassure China's domestic audience, demonstrate viable alternatives to Western partnerships, and subtly signal the limitations of Washington's sanctions regime.</p>

          <p>Following the tragic killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration has reportedly asked Congress to approve an additional $58 million for security services, specifically to protect members of the executive and judicial branches. The request also supports more funding for congressional security, with further steps left to the legislative branch. This article highlights how Kirk's death, despite an unconfirmed motive, has fueled conservative anger and concern, leading to event cancellations and a heightened sense of political conflict. The broader context reveals a rapid increase in political violence in recent years, with over 520 plots and acts occurring in the first half of 2025, resulting in numerous casualties.</p>

          <p>East Los Angeles celebrated its 79th annual Mexican Independence Day parade with a powerful display of defiance and pride, even as the Trump administration's intensified immigration crackdown, bolstered by a recent Supreme Court ruling on "roving patrols," loomed. This article highlights the community's resolve, with many feeling compelled to attend and advocate for their rights, despite palpable fears that led some family members to stay home. Mayor Karen Bass publicly denounced the immigration raids as "abhorrent," underscoring Los Angeles' identity as a city of immigrants where targeting Latinos is unacceptable. The event, though potentially smaller in attendance, vibrantly showcased Latino joy and collective resistance against what many perceive as discriminatory enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Prominent Chinese scholar Zheng Yongnian contends that China must cultivate its own artificial intelligence knowledge system, asserting the need to transcend Western-centric frameworks.

This article emphasizes Zheng's conviction that the humanities and social sciences fundamentally determine the meaning of society and technology, urging China to fully embrace its secular civilization. By forging an indigenous knowledge system, China can assume a more fitting and influential role in the evolving international order, free from Western theoretical hegemony.</p>

This article details Mandelson's recent sacking after the publication of emails revealed his supportive messages to Epstein during his 2008 sexual offense charges. Business Secretary Peter Kyle indicated that Mandelson's appointment would have been "highly unlikely" had the full extent of his relationship with the convicted sex offender been known.

          <p>A significant number of drivers are finding themselves "underwater" on their auto loans, meaning they owe more than their vehicle's current market value, a situation now at a four-year high and complicating new car purchases. This article highlights that 26.6% of trade-ins in the second quarter of 2025 had negative equity, with the average amount owed being $6,754. This predicament is often exacerbated by consumers opting for longer loan terms, such as 84-month loans, and making smaller down payments. Financial experts recommend that consumers retain their current vehicle if feasible, or thoroughly research new loan options and consider purchasing guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance when trading in an underwater car. This trend reflects broader consumer financial challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

Over 400 medical facilities have shut down, a move the US justified by alleging funds were benefiting the Taliban, an accusation the Taliban denies. The humanitarian crisis is further exacerbated by the Taliban's severe restrictions on women's education and medical training, drastically limiting healthcare access for half the population and raising maternal mortality rates.</p>

BNPL services particularly appeal to consumers who either prefer not to use credit cards or have limited access to traditional credit.

          <p>The University of California, Berkeley, provided personal information for approximately 160 staff and faculty members to the Trump administration, as part of a federal investigation into campus antisemitism, a move that has ignited widespread outrage and comparisons to McCarthy-era purges. This article reveals that Judith Butler, a prominent Jewish feminist scholar and critic of Israel, was among those whose information was shared, describing it as an "enormous breach of trust." The university, acting under the direction of the UC Office of the President, disclosed this data in mid-August concerning individuals' "potential connection" to antisemitism allegations. Critics argue this action unfairly targets Muslim and Arab individuals supportive of Palestine, raising serious concerns about free speech, academic freedom, and the institution's commitment to privacy amidst political pressure.</p>

          <p>Barron Trump, the son of US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, has reportedly chosen to attend NYU's D.C. program, opting to remain close to his parents rather than enrolling at the main Manhattan campus. This article highlights that the NYU D.C. program, which integrates coursework with internships and professional opportunities tied to the government, is primarily designed for students pursuing studies in politics, public policy, or journalism. Although Barron was previously enrolled at the NYU Stern School of Business, his decision to relocate to Washington has fueled speculation about a potential change in his academic and career trajectory towards a more political path, particularly given his prior involvement in his father's campaign.</p>

The experience revealed that even when the U.S. was at its highest fire-preparedness level during the second fire, resources were critically depleted. Mayor Steve Botti, an experienced firefighter, stresses the imperative for a fundamental shift in how communities approach security, given that wildfires are becoming increasingly larger, more intense, and destructive due to climate change. The article concludes that communities must learn how to thrive in these fire-prone climates.</p>

The Venezuelan foreign ministry asserted that those who ordered the seizure are seeking an incident to justify escalating conflict and achieve "regime change" in Caracas, demanding an immediate cessation of these actions that threaten regional security and peace.
