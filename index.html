          <p>A recent dispute between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has intensified China's doubts regarding the stability of the U.S. president. Musk, previously a major Trump donor, criticized Trump, leading to retaliatory threats regarding government subsidies. This public falling out reinforces the perception in China that Trump is unpredictable and unreliable. According to observers, this could complicate negotiations and summit considerations between China and Trump, as China may remain cautious when dealing with what they view as a transactional leader. The situation reflects a broader concern within China about Trump's character and his tendency to use pressure tactics to maximize his own interests.</p>

          <p>Omar Pulido Bastida, an illegal immigrant with a prior robbery conviction and arrests for murder and assault, faces a federal assault charge after allegedly spitting on an ICE agent. The incident occurred during an attempt to arrest him for illegally re-entering the United States after prior deportation. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin criticized Los Angeles officials for prioritizing criminal illegal aliens over citizens. U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli condemned the disrespect shown to law enforcement officers, while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass defended the rights of immigrants. The arrest follows anti-ICE protests and riots in Los Angeles, with President Trump calling for increased arrests and mass deportations.</p>

Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, as well as the shooting of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. According to Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, Boelter went to the homes of four Minnesota state lawmakers with the intent to kill them. One lawmaker was not home, while another, State Senator Ann Rest, was alerted to Boelter's presence near her house, which she credits with saving her life. Boelter planned his attacks carefully, researching the victims and conducting surveillance on their homes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill proposed in California would make it a misdemeanor for local, state, and federal law enforcement officers to cover their faces while on duty. The bill aims to increase transparency and public trust in law enforcement by requiring officers to be identifiable by their uniform and name. Democratic state senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin argue that the proposal is necessary due to an increase in federal officers conducting raids while covering their faces and badges. The bill would exempt the National Guard, SWAT teams, and officers responding to natural disasters, focusing on accountability and preventing vigilante-style actions.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's opening match in the Club World Cup was played in front of a largely empty stadium, raising concerns about the tournament's appeal in the United States. Some observers attribute the low attendance to factors such as the Monday afternoon kickoff time, high ticket prices, and a lack of marketing by FIFA. American journalists suggest that the timing of the tournament, coupled with the upcoming World Cup, may have led fans to prioritize saving money for the latter event. FIFA's decision to handle the event in-house, without a local organizing committee, is also cited as a potential reason for the poor turnout, which could serve as a warning for realistic ticket pricing during next year's World Cup.</p>

Kennedy dismissed the committee members, claiming the panel was plagued by conflicts of interest and was a rubber stamp for all vaccines.

The proposed bill, dubbed the No Secret Police Act, aims to increase transparency and accountability amid protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies. Exemptions would be made for SWAT teams and officers wearing medical masks during natural disasters, but clear riot gear would be permitted. The lawmakers argue that the bill is necessary to prevent "secret police" behavior and ensure public trust in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The future of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction is uncertain as Senate Republicans unveil their tax plan for Trump's spending package. The SALT deduction has been a contentious issue since 2017, with a current law capping the deduction at $10,000. Raising the cap has been controversial, as the benefits would primarily go to higher-income households. According to IRS data, roughly 90% of filers use the standard deduction and do not benefit from itemized tax breaks, making any changes to the SALT deduction a complex political issue.
