          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and other political leaders have strongly criticized Elon Musk for his "abhorrent" comments at a far-right rally in London. Speaking via video, Musk called for a new UK election and warned that "violence is coming to you" due to "uncontrolled migration," urging people to either "fight back or you die." The remarks, made during an event organized by activist Tommy Robinson, have been labeled as dangerous and irresponsible, prompting calls for the government to review contracts with Musk's companies.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of space-based reconnaissance, a Chinese satellite has photographed an American satellite that was observing China's space assets. China's Jilin-1 satellite captured images of the U.S. WorldView Legion satellite, a maneuver seen by analysts as a strategic response to similar U.S. surveillance activities. This event follows a previous incident where the same U.S. satellite imaged a Chinese reconnaissance satellite, highlighting the escalating "tit-for-tat" nature of surveillance and counter-surveillance in the increasingly competitive space domain.</p>

She discussed the "taboo" nature of sex in her religious background and the guilt associated with it, suggesting she may handle the situation with discretion like previous show leads.</p>

          <p>Following the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, Vice President JD Vance has called for accountability for those who celebrate the act on social media. Guest-hosting Kirk's show, Vance encouraged listeners to "call them out, and hell, call their employer," framing it as a matter of civility against political violence. This statement comes as several individuals, including pilots and a Secret Service employee, have already been fired or placed on leave for their public comments about Kirk's death, sparking a debate over free speech and employer retaliation.</p>

          <p>Valentino Luchin, a 62-year-old distinguished chef in the San Francisco Bay Area, has been arrested on suspicion of robbing three different banks in a single day.

This is not his first encounter with such charges; in 2018, he admitted to robbing a bank, citing severe financial struggles after his acclaimed restaurant closed. In that previous case, he blamed his actions on the financial pressure of supporting his family.</p>

Drafted after the 2016 inquests finally cleared fans of blame, the law aims to establish a legal "duty of candour" and parity of legal funding to prevent other victims of state-related disasters from enduring a similar torturous journey for truth.</p>

          <p>While President Trump claims his deployment of federal forces has made Washington, D.C., a "CRIME FREE ZONE," the long-term sustainability of any crime reduction is questionable. The heavy-handed approach may be counterproductive, causing economic disruption as residents and tourists stay away and immigrant workers fear ICE enforcement. Furthermore, the crackdown could poison community-police relations, making residents less likely to cooperate with law enforcement in the future and potentially engineering more urban disorder once the federal surge ends.</p>

          <p>After a difficult first quarter, Tesla's stock has rebounded dramatically, rising 85% from its April low to turn positive for the year. The recovery was aided by renewed Wall Street optimism and a recent disclosure that CEO Elon Musk purchased approximately $1 billion worth of shares. Despite the surge, the company still faces challenges, including a multi-quarter sales slump due to an aging product line and increased competition. Leadership is attempting to shift investor focus toward future projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to a semiannual schedule, an idea he previously floated during his first term. In a social media post, he argued the change would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. While the proposal has been supported by figures like Warren Buffett, critics argue that less frequent reporting would reduce transparency and timely information for investors, who benefit from the current system.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut its benchmark interest rate, many homeowners wonder if their mortgage rates will fall. The Fed's rate directly influences short-term loans, but its effect on long-term mortgage rates is indirect. Fixed-rate mortgages tend to follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury note, which reflects broader economic conditions and investor sentiment about long-term inflation. While a Fed cut can influence the lending environment, markets have often already priced in the change, meaning homeowners may not see an immediate, significant drop in mortgage costs.

          <p>For homeowners looking to tap into their property's value, several options exist for borrowing funds like $50,000, each with distinct advantages in the current rate environment. A home equity loan offers the predictability of a fixed rate and stable monthly payments, making it easy to budget. Alternatively, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) provides a flexible, revolving credit line for ongoing or uncertain expenses, though often with a variable rate. Other options include a cash-out refinance, which could secure a lower rate but resets the mortgage term. (not investment advice)</p>
