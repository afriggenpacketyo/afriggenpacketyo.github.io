          <p>Former Treasury Secretary and Harvard president Lawrence Summers discusses President Trump's pressure campaign on higher education, particularly vilified universities like Harvard. Summers argues that Trump's tactics amount to "extortion," threatening billions in research funds, the status of foreign students, tax-exempt status, and academic freedom. He sees Trump's endgame as forcing universities to "bend the knee" and conform to his administration's demands.

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as highly damaging to relationships. This phrase conveys the message that the partner is not enough and someone else could do a better job. Over time, this comparison can lead to insecurity issues and questioning of one's worth. The phrase is often a symptom of a deeper issue: the fear of openly expressing needs. Open and direct communication is essential for a healthy relationship, fostering a sense of security and emotional closeness.</p>

          <p>This article follows Antonio Austin, a used car dealer in Oklahoma, as he struggles to keep his business afloat amid President Trump's tariffs, which are driving up costs and pushing his low-income customers deeper into financial crisis. Antonio sells to customers with bad credit and little savings, who rely on their cars to get to work and support their families. The tariffs have increased the cost of buying, refurbishing, and repairing cars, making it harder for Antonio to stay afloat and for his customers to afford transportation. The article highlights the human impact of economic policies on vulnerable communities.</p>

          <p>Israel's failure to intercept a Houthi missile targeting its main airport has exposed vulnerabilities in its defense systems despite US efforts to weaken the group. The missile strike caused a temporary shutdown of Ben Gurion Airport, prompting concerns about security and the Houthis' ability to strike distant targets. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed further attacks against the Houthis, analysts suggest the incident highlights the group's accuracy and ability to penetrate Israeli air defenses. The strike marks a major security breach and raises questions about the effectiveness of Israel's missile defense system.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war is posing a threat to the Panama Canal, a critical passage for U.S. East Coast-bound ocean freight. Due to Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, there has been a massive pause on U.S. imports from China. According to data from supply chain intelligence firm Project44, there has been a 300% increase in blank sailings from China to the United States since Trump's tariffs announcement on April 2. This decrease in containers and vessels can impact Panama Canal revenue, as the canal makes its money off of the number of vessel transits and containers moving through the waterway.</p>
