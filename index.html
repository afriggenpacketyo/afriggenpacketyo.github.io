          <p>Sacramento police have arrested a 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandezsantana, for allegedly firing multiple shots at the ABC10 television station building. The incident, classified as a drive-by shooting, resulted in at least three rounds striking a window, but fortunately, no injuries were reported among the station's employees. Hernandezsantana was identified through his vehicle and faces charges including assault with a deadly weapon and shooting into an occupied building. The motive for the attack is still under investigation, and the event has drawn condemnation from public officials as an assault on journalism and democracy.</p>

          <p>Mary "Maggie" Cleary has been named the new acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, replacing Erik Siebert who resigned amid political pressure. Siebert's departure followed concerns that he was being forced out for not bringing criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a frequent target of President Trump. The office has been investigating James for alleged mortgage fraud, an inquiry her lawyers describe as political retaliation for her own successful fraud lawsuit against Trump. Cleary, a conservative lawyer, takes over an office in a state of tumult due to the perceived political influence on prosecutorial decisions.</p>

          <p>Two Republican state senators in Oklahoma have introduced a bill that would mandate every public university in the state to build a memorial plaza featuring a statue of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The legislation describes Kirk as a "modern civil rights leader" and a "martyr," requiring schools to comply or face monthly fines equivalent to 1% of their budget. This proposal is part of a broader conservative effort to lionize Kirk, a move that has drawn criticism, including from Martin Luther King Jr.'s family, who reject comparisons between the two figures. The bill also includes provisions to protect the memorials from vandalism.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard reportedly revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals, including senior CIA officials, without prior notification to the White House. This action caused significant internal frustration, as it prevented a thorough vetting of the list and targeted career intelligence officers, some of whom were key advisors involved in sensitive operations. While a senior intelligence official claims Gabbard was acting on President Trump's directive to remove individuals involved in the 2016 Russia intelligence assessments, the move appears to have deepened tensions between the DNI's office and the CIA.

          <p>The White House has outlined a potential deal for TikTok's U.S. operations that would place its powerful algorithm under American control and give U.S. representatives a majority on the board. Under the proposed agreement, tech giant Oracle would manage the data and privacy for the app's 170 million American users, addressing long-standing national security concerns about its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. President Trump indicated he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have approved the deal, though Beijing has yet to confirm. This development marks a significant shift from previous calls for an outright ban, as the administration seeks to restructure the popular app's ownership and oversight.</p>

          <p>The threat of flash flooding is set to increase again in parts of the Southwest, including Southern California and Arizona, due to incoming monsoonal moisture. This follows recent deadly floods in the region, where a 2-year-old was tragically swept away in Barstow, California. Authorities are particularly concerned about burn scar areas, which are highly susceptible to dangerous debris flows. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle is intensifying and is expected to become a hurricane over the weekend. While not a direct threat to the U.S. mainland, Gabrielle will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order imposing a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas for high-skilled workers, a move that dramatically overhauls the program. This policy change directly impacts major tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft, which heavily rely on the H-1B program to hire specialized foreign talent and have recently been attempting to build closer ties with the Trump administration. The new fee is being criticized by some as a policy that will shrink the talent pipeline, while others praise it as a long-overdue reform to protect American jobs from being undercut. This action highlights a growing tension between the administration and the tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

This move follows a deadline set in July, conditional on Israel agreeing to a ceasefire and committing to a two-state solution, which ministers argue has not been met. The decision has been influenced by the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The policy change has drawn sharp criticism from the Israeli government and some Conservative politicians, who argue it rewards terrorism, while supporters see it as a necessary step to preserve the possibility of a long-term peace deal.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of California San Diego have made a significant discovery by observing diamond capsules undergo shock-induced amorphization for the first time. Using powerful lasers to simulate nuclear fusion conditions, they were able to precisely control the pressure that causes a diamond's atomic structure to collapse. This breakthrough provides a deeper understanding of how materials behave under extreme conditions, which is crucial for advancing nuclear fusion energy research. The findings could help scientists create the symmetrical implosions necessary to release fusion energy, a clean and nearly limitless power source that could reduce global reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of new laws aimed at limiting the impact of aggressive federal immigration raids in the state. The most prominent bill bans both federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing masks while on duty, a direct response to recent operations where masked agents detained individuals. Other new laws prohibit immigration agents from entering nonpublic areas of schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and require schools to notify families of any enforcement activity on campus. Newsom framed the legislation as a necessary pushback against the "secret police" tactics of the Trump administration, though the new laws are expected to face federal legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A cyber-attack targeting an electronic check-in and baggage system caused significant flight delays at several major European airports, including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The disruption affected software from Collins Aerospace, owned by RTX, forcing many airlines to switch to manual check-in processes and leading to long queues and passenger frustration. While the company stated the impact was limited and could be mitigated, hundreds of flights were delayed. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre is working with the affected parties to understand the full scope of the incident, which highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected aviation industry to digital system failures.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon, recently renamed the Department of War by the Trump administration, has issued a new memo formalizing significant restrictions on media access and reporting. Journalists will now be required to sign a document agreeing not to disclose classified or "controlled unclassified information" without formal authorization, effectively limiting the use of unnamed sources. The directive also states that all information, even if unclassified, must be approved for public release, and it curtails reporters' movements within the building by requiring official escorts in most areas. Press freedom advocates have condemned the new rules as a direct assault on independent journalism and government transparency.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in the Netherlands calling for stricter asylum policies turned violent as rioters clashed with police in The Hague. Protesters threw objects, set a police car on fire, and vandalized the office of the centrist D66 political party, prompting police to use tear gas and water cannons. The unrest, which involved a blockade of a major highway, occurred just weeks before the country's general election. Political leaders, including caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof and D66 leader Rob Jetten, condemned the violence as "completely unacceptable" and an attempt at intimidation by extremists.</p>

According to the Conejos County Coroner, the bodies showed no obvious signs of trauma or foul play, and autopsies are scheduled for Monday to determine the cause of death. The two experienced outdoorsmen were on an elk hunting trip when they disappeared, prompting a massive search effort after they failed to make contact. Their vehicle was found at a trailhead with camping gear still inside, raising concerns due to the bad weather in the area at the time.</p>

          <p>Correctional officers at the California Rehabilitation Center (CRC) in Norco are appealing to the state to reverse its decision to close the facility by 2026. In letters to the Attorney General, officers argue that the prison has available beds and effective rehabilitation programs that could help address the severe overcrowding in county jails, such as those in Los Angeles County. The state's corrections department (CDCR) cited the facility's older infrastructure and the lower-level classification of its inmate population as reasons for the closure. However, officers contend that the prison is cost-effective and that the buildings cited as outdated are not part of its core operations.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has expressed concern over the Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled worker visa applications, warning that it will have "humanitarian consequences" by disrupting families. As Indian nationals receive over 70% of these visas, the policy change is expected to have a significant impact. The White House has clarified the steep fee applies only to new applicants from outside the U.S. and not to renewals or current visa holders. The move comes amid tense trade negotiations between the two countries and has created considerable uncertainty for businesses and professionals who rely on the program. (not investment advice)</p>

The hospital is the only one in a nearly 60-mile radius and serves residents as well as numerous tourists visiting nearby national parks.

Title rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri will start in seventh and ninth place, respectively, after both made errors in the final session. Piastri's crash seemed to present an opportunity for Norris to gain a significant advantage, but he also made mistakes on his final lap, hitting a wall and failing to capitalize. The session's unpredictable nature was attributed to strong tailwinds and changing grip levels, which caught out over a quarter of the field.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh, author of "Love by Design," a lack of respect is a major red flag that can severely damage a romantic relationship over time. Disrespect can manifest in subtle ways, such as one partner consistently walking ahead of the other, or in more significant actions, like devaluing a partner's priorities, commitments, or identity. Nasserzadeh explains that such behavior can erode the other person's self-esteem and sense of self. She advises that if you feel disrespected, it is important to have a direct conversation with your partner to address the behavior and determine if change is possible.</p>
