          <p>Federal prosecutors are considering a non-prosecution agreement with Boeing regarding the 737 Max crashes, potentially abandoning a prior deal for a guilty plea. Lawyers for the victims' families expressed outrage, calling it a "backroom deal" that undermines accountability. Under the proposed agreement, Boeing would pay approximately $445 million to a crash victims' fund and invest in safety compliance, overseen by an independent consultant. The crashes, which occurred in Indonesia and Ethiopia, resulted in 346 deaths and a global ban on the 737 Max. The families plan to strongly object to the non-prosecution agreement, seeking a trial instead.</p>

          <p>President Trump acknowledged the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, stating that ‚Äúa lot of people are starving‚Äù under the Israeli blockade. This marks a notable shift from his administration's previous silence on the conflict, particularly given his close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump's comments came after meetings with Gulf Arab leaders who urged him to address the issue. The article notes that aid groups have warned of impending famine in Gaza, exacerbated by Israel's ongoing military campaign and blockade, while the United Nations-backed body that monitors starvation conditions in the world has warned this week that Gaza is at ‚Äúcritical risk of famine,‚Äù saying that 100 percent of the enclave‚Äôs two million residents face a malnutrition crisis.</p>

          <p>Direct peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators took place in Istanbul, resulting in an agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners each. The discussions, mediated by Turkey, primarily focused on Ukraine's demand for a cease-fire. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy accused Putin of being "afraid" to meet in person, demanding increased sanctions against Russia until serious diplomacy occurs. President Trump has also suggested that a solution to the conflict will only come through a one-on-one meeting between the U.S. and Russian leaders. The Vatican has offered to host future negotiations, but skeptics believe Putin is using the talks to manipulate Trump and pressure Ukraine into capitulation.</p>

Apple has requested that Epic Games resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront to avoid impacting "Fortnite" in other regions.</p>

          <p>Americans are currently facing unprecedented levels of credit card debt, impacting their financial well-being. While it is legally permissible to cease credit card payments, doing so carries significant repercussions. Creditors possess various legal avenues to recoup unpaid balances, and nonpayment can negatively affect your credit for years. Before discontinuing payments, explore options like hardship programs, credit counseling, or debt settlement, and consult with financial professionals to navigate the complexities of debt management.</p>

          <p>After major potential Republican candidates for key U.S. Senate races in 2026 passed on running, some Republicans are split on whether their party is struggling to recruit competitive Senate candidates. Some have also felt that candidates who appear too tied to Trump or too right-wing will struggle in statewide races even if they clear the primary, if the White House and Trump continue to face backlash toward policies and federal government cuts. Beating Jon Ossoff? That would be easy."</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment in the U.S. has slid to near-record lows, driven by increasing concerns that tariffs will lead to higher inflation. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index dropped to 50.8, the second-lowest reading on record. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 7.3%, while long-term expectations also ticked upward. Trade policy uncertainty, particularly related to tariffs, is dominating consumer thinking about the economy.</p>
