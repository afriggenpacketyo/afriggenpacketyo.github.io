            <p>Analysts warn that President Trump's recent 90-day tariff pause is merely a 'tactical retreat' and does not signify a shift in his overall trade objectives. Tariffs on Chinese imports have increased to 125%, intensifying the trade war between the two largest economies. This escalating conflict is expected to disrupt global supply chains and inflict economic pain on various countries, potentially leading to a much higher tariff world. One report suggests current tariffs could generate substantial tax revenue, but this would be nullified if China ceased exporting. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has postponed a planned vote on the Senate-approved GOP budget blueprint, citing dissatisfaction from a small group of members. Johnson intends to try again before the House adjourns for its April recess, aiming to secure a resolution or plan to address the concerns. The budget blueprint is meant to fund President Trump's agenda, and Johnson has been in communication with Trump about the situation. Some Republicans expressed frustration with the holdouts, accusing them of undermining Trump's agenda.</p>

            <p>A group of UK MPs is calling for a levy on streaming services' revenue to help fund British high-end TV production. The Culture, Media and Sport Committee suggests streaming companies pay 5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund. The report highlights the importance of distinctly British content and the risk of independent producers being crowded out. Netflix argues that levies diminish competitiveness and penalize audiences, while COBA warns that a levy could damage streamers' investment in the UK.</p>

Abrego Garcia, who had protected legal status, was deported despite a court order for his return. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt maintains that Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang and is unwelcome in the U.S. The Supreme Court has temporarily delayed the deadline for his return, as his wife is trying to bring him home.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices fell in March as the trade war with the US intensifies, with the national consumer price index dropping 0.1% year on year. This decline reflects the continued risk posed by deflation to the Chinese economy, as the trade war is likely to intensify downward pressure on prices. The Chinese government is expected to launch a stimulus to boost domestic demand amid the escalating trade war, which could mitigate the deflationary pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

The Southern Environmental Law Center claims xAI is operating an illegal power plant, causing significant air pollution in nearby residential neighborhoods. The group is calling for an emergency order to cease the use of the generators and penalize xAI for violating the Clean Air Act. The area near the facility has historically faced industrial pollution and has higher rates of cancer and asthma.</p>

            <p>A Delaware judge has ruled that Newsmax broadcast false and defamatory claims about Dominion Voting Systems' role in the 2020 presidential election. The judge found that Newsmax aired segments with inaccurate information that would likely cause viewers to think less favorably about Dominion. The lawsuit is set to go to trial later this month, where a jury will decide whether to award damages and whether the broadcasts were aired with "actual malice." Newsmax maintains it covered the issue fairly and never defamed Dominion.</p>
