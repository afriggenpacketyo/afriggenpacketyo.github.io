          <p>Swimming Australia has publicly refuted fabricated quotes circulating on social media platforms like Facebook and X, which were falsely attributed to Olympic champion Mollie O’Callaghan. The fake posts claimed O'Callaghan made disparaging remarks about transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and threatened to boycott the 2028 Olympics. The national sporting body confirmed that O’Callaghan was never interviewed on the topic and has requested that Meta remove the misleading content. This incident highlights the ongoing challenge of misinformation targeting high-profile athletes in sensitive cultural debates.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated he might authorize the delivery of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine if the war with Russia is not resolved. In discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump floated the idea of using the advanced offensive weapons as a threat to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin into negotiations. Trump stated he would potentially speak with Putin before making a final decision, framing the possible escalation as a strategic move to settle the conflict. The consideration comes as Russia continues its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Coastal communities in western Alaska are experiencing severe flooding and hurricane-force winds from the remnants of Typhoon Halong, leading to catastrophic damage. Entire homes have been swept from their foundations in villages like Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, prompting a large-scale rescue and disaster response involving multiple state agencies, including the Alaska National Guard. Governor Mike Dunleavy has expanded the state's disaster declaration to cover all affected areas. The storm has inundated roads and damaged infrastructure in a region where many communities are isolated and rely on limited transportation options.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has issued a forecast for a "winter-like" storm expected to hit Southern California from late Monday through Wednesday, bringing significant rainfall and potential commuter disruptions. Meteorologists predict rainfall totals of up to 1.5 inches in most areas and 3.5 inches in mountains, with possible thunderstorms and strong winds. A flood watch has been issued for recent burn areas due to the potential for high rainfall rates. This early-season storm arrives as La Niña conditions return, which typically signal a drier-than-average winter for the region.</p>

          <p>Actress Arianne Zucker has reached a settlement in her lawsuit against the producers of the soap opera “Days of Our Lives,” including Corday Productions and its owner, Ken Corday. Zucker’s 2024 lawsuit alleged she faced pervasive sexual harassment and discrimination from former executive producer Albert Alarr, and that she experienced retaliation after reporting his behavior. While the terms of the settlement were not disclosed, it concludes a high-profile dispute where Zucker claimed her pay was cut and her character was ultimately written off the show.

          <p>As he traveled to a peace summit in Egypt, U.S. President Donald Trump declared that the war in Gaza "is over," expressing confidence that a new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas will hold. The statement comes as Germany prepares to pledge at least €100 million for the reconstruction of the devastated region and plans to co-host an international conference on the matter. The peace agreement includes the expected release of all 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, marking a significant step toward resolving the two-year conflict.</p>

          <p>Former national security officials are raising alarms about the potential risks posed by Chinese entities acquiring U.S. farmland, particularly in locations near sensitive military installations. The concern is that these properties could be used for espionage, intelligence gathering, or even to stage sabotage operations against critical infrastructure or the electric grid. While Chinese nationals own less than 1% of foreign-held agricultural land, the strategic placement of these acquisitions has prompted 29 states to limit or ban such purchases. The Trump administration has also announced plans to increase transparency and penalties related to foreign ownership of American land.</p>

Sorkin also notes that financial regulations and consumer protections enacted after past crashes are being weakened, increasing risk for ordinary investors.

          <p>As adults navigate changing life stages like careers and family, maintaining friendships often becomes a challenge, leading many connections to fade over time. Psychologists advise being more intentional and creative, such as integrating friends into mundane activities like running errands to maintain in-person contact. Experts stress the importance of honest communication about one's availability and needs to avoid misunderstandings that can lead to "ghosting." They also recommend reframing socializing as a "muscle" that gets easier with practice and trusting that friends are more understanding than one might assume, thereby overcoming the common "liking gap" anxiety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are pioneering a new, non-invasive method to measure stress by using thermal cameras to monitor facial blood flow. Researchers have discovered that during stressful situations, a person's nose temperature drops as the nervous system diverts blood to the eyes and ears in a "fight or flight" response. This "nasal dip" provides a robust, objective marker of a person's stress level and how quickly they recover. The technique could become a valuable tool for managing harmful stress and monitoring the well-being of individuals who cannot communicate verbally, including infants and non-human primates.</p>

          <p>A massive class-action lawsuit has begun in the UK's High Court against five leading car manufacturers—Mercedes, Ford, Peugeot/Citroën, and Renault/Nissan—over allegations of cheating on diesel emissions tests. The case, part of the wider "dieselgate" scandal, accuses the companies of using "defeat devices" to artificially lower harmful nitrogen oxide emissions during testing scenarios. Lawyers representing 1.6 million car owners argue that customers were misled about their vehicles' environmental performance. The carmakers deny the accusations, but if the court finds against them, it could lead to significant compensation claims and reinforce concerns about corporate transparency.</p>

The IFS advocated for bolder, systemic reforms, such as overhauling property and capital gains taxes, to create a fairer and more growth-friendly system. The warning comes as the Labour government seeks to fund public services without breaking its campaign promise not to raise income tax, National Insurance, or VAT. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paramount has initiated a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a potential merger that would significantly reshape the Hollywood landscape, but its initial offer of around $20 per share has been rejected. Despite the rejection, talks between the two media giants are reportedly ongoing, with Paramount preparing a revised offer. The bid is backed by billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David, who recently acquired a controlling stake in Paramount. A successful merger could lead to major industry consolidation, potentially combining assets like the Warner Bros. film studio with Paramount and merging news divisions such as CNN and CBS News.</p>

          <p>Following a new ceasefire, hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans are beginning the journey back to their homes in the northern part of the enclave, only to find widespread destruction. Families are traveling on tractors and trucks along coastal highways, carrying what few belongings they have left, returning to neighborhoods that have been reduced to rubble after two years of war. Despite the hope brought by the truce and the impending release of hostages, the homecoming is a somber one, as residents confront the reality of their destroyed homes and devastated infrastructure. For many, the return is about reconnecting with their land, even if only ruins remain.</p>

          <p>A recent meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi signals a potential reset in the historically fraught relationship between the two Asian powers. With Modi expressing a commitment to "strategic autonomy" and preventing differences from becoming disputes, India appears to be hedging its bets as its relationship with the U.S. under President Trump becomes more strained. The leaders agreed to frame their nations as "partners" rather than "rivals," with plans to resume direct flights after a five-year halt. This diplomatic warming could represent a strategic pivot for India, seeking to build a coalition of eastern powers.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson was hospitalized with an orbital fracture after a bizarre pre-game accident in the locker room. Richardson was struck in the face by an elastic exercise band when the equipment used to contain it failed during warmups before the team's game against the Arizona Cardinals. The 23-year-old quarterback, who was the No. 4 overall pick in the 2023 draft, has had an NFL career marked by injuries and inconsistency. He is currently serving as the backup to starter Daniel Jones, who has led the Colts to a 5-1 record this season.</p>

          <p>Scotland's path to the 2026 World Cup finals will be decided in their last two qualification matches after a recent victory over Belarus secured them at least a second-place finish in their group. They are currently tied on points with Denmark, who hold a significant goal-difference advantage. To secure automatic qualification, Scotland likely needs a win against Greece in Athens, followed by another victory against Denmark at home in what could be a winner-takes-all showdown. A draw or loss in either game would likely send Scotland to the high-stakes play-offs in March to determine their fate.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is pressuring the UK government to provide answers regarding the recent collapse of an espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The prosecution was dropped after the Director of Public Prosecutions stated that necessary evidence from the government, which would refer to China as a national security threat, could not be obtained. Badenoch has accused the government of weakness and changing its story, demanding that a senior minister address Parliament to clarify who was responsible for the decision not to provide the evidence.

Chasing a target of 330, Australia completed their first-ever successful ODI chase over 300, a milestone for the historically dominant team. Healy's hundred, which came after a recent run of poor form, was instrumental in securing the three-wicket win and reinforcing Australia's status as tournament favorites.

Elsewhere, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the injury-plagued San Francisco 49ers, and the Indianapolis Colts staged a fourth-quarter comeback to defeat the Arizona Cardinals.
