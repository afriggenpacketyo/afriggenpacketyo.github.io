          <p>President Donald Trump announced a "massive" trade deal with Japan, featuring "reciprocal" 15% tariffs on Japanese exports to the U.S., a reduction from the previous 25% auto duties. The agreement, which Trump hailed as potentially the largest ever, includes a $550 billion Japanese investment in the U.S. and promises to open Japan's market to American cars, trucks, and agricultural products, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the auto tariff reduction, a crucial aspect for Japan's export-dependent economy, leading to a surge in Japanese auto stocks and the broader Nikkei 225 index. This deal could also strengthen Ishiba's leadership following recent election losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Djelika "Mami" Tounkara, a Malian basketball player, continues her fight for justice after reporting sexual assault by her former coach in 2021, which led to his jailing but also her removal from the national team. Despite receiving death threats and losing anonymity, Tounkara is determined to speak out to protect other young girls. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) recently ruled it lacked jurisdiction, sending her case back to FIBA's Ethics Panel, a decision her lawyers call disappointing. Tounkara seeks a systemic change to protect youth in Malian basketball, emphasizing that FIBA prioritizes business over player safety.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man, Terrance Lamar Bowie, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder and scene tampering in Shelby Township, Michigan, after a woman was found dead. Police responded to a hung-up 911 call from an apartment, where Bowie met officers and indicated a body was inside. A deceased 27-year-old female was then located in a bedroom. Authorities confirmed this was not a random act of violence, as the victim and Bowie knew each other. Bowie's bond was set at $2 million, with police chief Robert J. Shelide affirming the department's commitment to pursuing justice for violent crimes.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's new midfielder, Martin Zubimendi, is set to make his debut in front of fans against AC Milan in Singapore, 12 months after the club initiated efforts to sign him. The 26-year-old Spanish international, highly rated in Europe, turned down Liverpool last summer before Arsenal's "well-orchestrated plan" secured his £60m move from Real Sociedad. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed excitement about Zubimendi's defensive midfield role and impressive ability to process information. Zubimendi himself cited Arteta's "obsession" with details as a key reason for choosing Arsenal, despite the difficulty of leaving his former club.</p>

          <p>Civil society and opposition groups in Eswatini are outraged by the US deportation of five men to the absolute monarchy, with the largest opposition party calling it "human trafficking disguised as a deportation deal." The men, from various countries and convicted of serious crimes in the US, are to be held in Eswatini, raising concerns about legality, transparency, and safety. Critics demand the deal's public disclosure and suspension, fearing Eswatini is becoming a "dumping ground." US officials stated the men were "uniquely barbaric" and their home countries refused them, but human rights reports on Eswatini's judiciary and treatment of detainees add to the alarm.</p>

          <p>Columbia University is disciplining dozens of students, including suspensions and expulsions, for their involvement in pro-Palestinian protests that included occupying a library and encamping on campus in spring 2024. The university stated that disruptions to academic activities violate policies and will have consequences, emphasizing its commitment to its academic mission. This disciplinary action comes as Columbia attempts to restore $400 million in federal funding cut by the Trump administration, which accused the university of failing to address alleged antisemitism. Columbia has agreed to policy reforms, including overhauling its disciplinary process and adopting a new definition of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Singapore has once again secured the top position in the Henley Passport Index for 2025, allowing its citizens visa-free access to 193 countries. Japan and South Korea are tied for second place, while several European nations share the third spot. The index, which ranks passports based on the number of visa-free destinations, shows a "long-term downward trend" for the U.S. and UK passports, with the U.S. dropping to 10th place and the UK to sixth. This signifies a shift in global mobility power, as countries once considered the most powerful now face declining rankings in this widely followed assessment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several UK agencies involved in counter-terrorism, including Counter Terrorism Policing, MI5, and the National Crime Agency, have issued a joint warning to parents about children's vulnerability to online radicalization during summer holidays. They urge parents to discuss online safety and implement parental controls, citing increasing exposure to "extreme and obscene content" such as sexual violence, self-harm, and terrorist material. The agencies note a concerning trend of desensitization to such content among some children and a rise in young people investigated for terrorism-related offenses, emphasizing the ease with which youth can connect with dangerous radicalizing influences online.</p>

Speaking on MSNBC's "The Best People" podcast, Daniels linked potential economic hardships, such as increased grocery bills and car prices due to tariffs, directly to Trump's policies. A White House spokesman responded, calling Daniels an "out-of-touch left-wing Hollywood clown" and asserting that under Trump, markets are rallying, inflation is over, and wages are rising. Daniels also expressed regret over Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential election loss, believing she would have governed like Abraham Lincoln by surrounding herself with diverse opinions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered 13-million-year-old teeth marks on the leg bone of a "terror bird," suggesting the fearsome predator, taller than a human, was killed by an even larger reptile. Palaeontologists in Colombia matched the bite marks to an extinct caiman species, Purussaurus neivensis, a five-meter-long crocodile-like creature. The study, published in Biology Letters, provides rare evidence of an interaction between two ancient apex predators. While conclusive proof of the kill is elusive, the absence of healing marks indicates the terror bird likely died during the attack or was scavenged immediately after, offering new insights into ancient ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Federal judges in New Jersey used a rare power to sideline interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a personal attorney for President Trump, and appointed her top assistant, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the role. However, hours later, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the Justice Department had "removed" Grace, accusing the judges of threatening presidential powers. This move sparked condemnation from New Jersey's Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, who called Grace's firing a "blatant attempt to intimidate" and undermine judicial independence. Habba's brief tenure was marked by clashes with Democrats, and she faced an uphill battle for Senate confirmation.</p>

Holmes died after a TAVI procedure went wrong, leading to emergency surgery and complications. An unpublished Royal College of Physicians review, seen by the BBC, excoriated his care, rating it "very poor" and noting the original death certificate cited a "failed TAVI," unlike the second which omitted it. This case is part of a police investigation into 11 deaths at the hospital's TAVI service, which has a mortality rate above the national average, raising serious concerns about transparency and patient safety.</p>
