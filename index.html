          <p>Aryna Sabalenka, the world number one, began her French Open campaign with a decisive victory over Kamilla Rakhimova, winning 6-1, 6-0 in just one hour. Sabalenka demonstrated her dominance by winning nine consecutive games, showcasing her strong serving and powerful hitting. The three-time Grand Slam singles champion aims to improve upon her previous best performance at the French Open, a semi-final appearance in 2023. Sabalenka's performance justifies her position as one of the favorites to win the tournament and she is set to face either Jil Teichmann or Lucrezia Stefanini in the next round.

          <p>The Labour government's renationalization of South Western Railway (SWR) has sparked debate, as Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander admits she cannot guarantee cheaper train tickets. While the government aims to improve services and infrastructure, some members of the public are questioning the benefits of renationalization if prices remain high. Critics argue that the focus should be on affordability, citing the high cost of train travel compared to other European countries and alternative modes of transport. The first SWR service under public ownership departed from Woking, but passengers faced rail replacement buses due to engineering work. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration is under scrutiny for unprecedented levels of personal profit-making during his presidency, eclipsing previous ethical standards. The Trump family has reportedly amassed millions through ventures like cryptocurrency, real estate deals, and exclusive club memberships, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. A recent example is Qatar's donation of a luxury jet for Trump's use, valued at $200 million. Critics argue that Trump has normalized activities that would have previously triggered outrage and investigations, dismantling accountability measures and appointing loyalists to key positions. The article concludes that the public has become inured to the corruption of Donald Trump and his presidency because the president and his Republican Party have given the American public no choice in the matter.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is under scrutiny for its contradictory approach to border shelters assisting migrants, continuing to release individuals to these organizations even after suggesting their activities might be illegal. A letter from FEMA raised concerns about potential violations of smuggling laws, demanding detailed information from the shelters. Despite this, ICE continued to request shelter services, placing organizations in a difficult position. Some shelters, like Catholic Charities in Laredo, were forced to close due to financial losses after not receiving FEMA funding, highlighting the challenges faced by these organizations.

          <p>Venezuela is holding an election for governor and legislators in Essequibo, a region internationally recognized as part of neighboring Guyana, escalating a long-standing territorial dispute. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro is using the vote to stir nationalistic sentiment and bolster support for his government amid domestic dissatisfaction. The election is taking place despite a pending case at the International Court of Justice and warnings from Guyana. This move is seen as an attempt to divert attention from Venezuela's political and economic crises, while Guyana has tightened border security and strengthened military ties with the United States.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever coach Stephanie White has voiced strong criticism of the officiating after her team's narrow 90-88 loss to the New York Liberty. White highlighted a significant free throw disparity and questioned several calls in the final moments of the game, including a perceived foul on Caitlin Clark. Clark, despite a late surge, had the ball stripped away on the final play, leading to further dispute. The Fever, now 2-2, have lost two games by a combined three points, prompting concerns about their performance in close contests.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" is presented as an alternative to authoritative, authoritarian, and gentle parenting. This approach focuses on attuning to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without judgment, avoid shaming, and view misbehavior as a signal for support. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves doing inner work, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame. The goal is to create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves.</p>

While the study claims pollution from Mumbai's 1,000-odd wood-fired bakeries was as harmful to each resident as smoking 400 cigarettes, critics argue that it is unfair to target small businesses when larger sources of pollution exist. Bakers fear that switching to cleaner fuels would increase the price of pav, making it unaffordable for the working class. The article concludes that it's not just about the cost, pav bakers say.
