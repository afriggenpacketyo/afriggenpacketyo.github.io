          <p>Moscow's mayor reported that at least 10 Ukrainian drones were shot down on approach to the city, leading to temporary airport restrictions. Russian forces continued their strikes into Ukraine, with Ukraine reporting 49 drones and three missiles fired into the country, claiming to have neutralized 40 drones. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has framed Russia's attacks as proof that Putin is not genuine in his willingness to negotiate a peace deal, urging Western partners to increase pressure on Russia to ease maximalist peace demands. Zelenskyy emphasized the urgent need for concrete signals from the United States regarding air defense systems, thanking European countries for their supplies and underscoring the importance of joint air defense systems production for Europe's security. </p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's multi-trillion-dollar spending package, known as Section 899, is raising concerns on Wall Street. The House-approved measure would impose a new tax of up to 20% on foreigners with U.S. investments if their home country levies "unfair foreign taxes" against U.S. companies. Analysts warn that this "revenge tax" could have significant implications for the asset management industry, potentially impacting cross-border income and discouraging foreign investment. The Investment Company Institute has cautioned that the provision could limit foreign investment in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A top state regulator warns that the US gambling industry has become a "highway without speed limits," urging federal lawmakers to consider nationwide advertising rules and exclusion lists for problem gamblers. Jordan Maynard, chair of the Massachusetts gaming commission, highlights the rapid expansion of online sports betting since 2018 and the industry's resistance to proposed regulations. He emphasizes the need to balance protecting the legal betting market with shielding citizens from harm, amid concerns over underage gambling and the social impact of gambling's rise.

          <p>In Vietnam, the term "Cali"â€”referring to the Vietnamese diaspora in Californiaâ€”has become a derogatory term used by nationalists to criticize those who disagree with state policy. This sentiment has grown alongside rising nationalism, with signs of animosity toward perceived American influence. A U.S.-backed university faced attacks over suspicions of foreign interference, and a pop star was condemned for singing at an anti-communist activist's memorial. The Vietnamese government, which controls media and education, has bolstered nationalism, leading to harassment of dissenting views.</p>

          <p>A 180-foot section of the Santa Cruz Wharf collapsed after being battered by winter storms, prompting a debate about rebuilding in the face of climate change and sea level rise. City officials plan a $1-million partial repair, but a full restoration would cost about $14 million, contingent on state funding. The uncertainty in Santa Cruz reflects a broader issue along the California coast, where aging piers have sustained increasing damage from volatile seas. The partial repair will strengthen the broken end of the pier, but the reconstruction of the collapsed portion remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that near-shore tsunamis, triggered by earthquakes just offshore, pose a dire risk to California's coastal communities. Life-threatening waves could approach the coastline in as little as 10 minutes, leaving minimal time for alerts or evacuation. Data indicates potential tsunami heights of up to 5 feet in Marina del Rey, 7 feet in Manhattan Beach and San Pedro, 8 feet in Long Beach and Santa Monica Pier, and 30 feet on Catalina Island. A study identified nine densely populated areas with challenging evacuation conditions, emphasizing the need for preparedness and awareness of evacuation routes.</p>

          <p>A major tsunami poses a significant risk to the entire California coast, with over 680,000 people in tsunami hazard areas and potential damages of $12.6 billion. The article differentiates between "distant-source" tsunamis, originating from places like Alaska, and "near-source" tsunamis, which can arrive within minutes of a nearby earthquake. Southern California could see over 350 casualties from a distant-source tsunami if evacuation is delayed, while a near-source tsunami could bring waves up to 30 feet high in some areas. The Bay Area faces potential damages of over $6.5 billion from a distant-source tsunami, and the North Coast is highly vulnerable to tsunamis from the Cascadia subduction zone.</p>

          <p>Indigenous KawÃ©sqar fishermen in Chile say the salmon industry threatens their way of life by damaging ecosystems. Reinaldo Caro, one of the last KawÃ©sqar fishermen, decries the contamination of the seabed from salmon farms' waste and medication, noting the pristine waters have been severely impacted. Marine biologist Claudio Carocca highlights the vulnerability of these ecosystems to human activity, including the introduction of nonnative species and chemicals. Legislation is pending in Chilean congress to deem salmon farming incompatible with the KawÃ©sqar people's traditional way of life, potentially halting the industry's expansion in the area.</p>
