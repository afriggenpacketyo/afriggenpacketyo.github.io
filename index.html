          <p>Ukraine conducted a coordinated drone strike, dubbed "Spiderâ€™s Web," targeting airfields in five Russian regions, resulting in fires and damage to aircraft, including strategic bombers. The operation, which took 18 months to plan, was personally overseen by President Zelensky, according to the SBU. Russia confirmed the attacks, calling them a "terrorist act," and admitted that several aircraft caught fire. While Ukraine claimed significant damage, U.S. officials were skeptical of the extent of the destruction. The attack happened just before planned peace talks between Ukraine and Russia were set to begin Monday in Istanbul, which are backed by President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, who was charged with illegal voting at the University of Michigan, has fled the U.S. after admitting to registering and casting a vote in the 2024 general election. Despite a judge ordering him to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a Chinese passport. The FBI has charged him with flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. This case is one of a few instances of non-citizens voting in federal elections in modern history, with analysis finding only 30 suspected cases out of 23.5 million votes cast in the 42 jurisdictions reviewed.</p>

          <p>An immigration attorney in Los Angeles warns that President Trump's increased deportation efforts are causing fear among residents and citizens, with individuals being arrested and placed in expedited deportation proceedings upon leaving immigration court. While citizens should not fear questioning upon returning from travel, residents are subject to an officer's discretion when entering the country. Residents who stay outside the U.S. for more than six months may be considered to have abandoned their residency. The attorney advises residents with criminal records to consult with an immigration lawyer to assess their risk of deportation, and those with DACA or TPS status face similar risks when seeking advance parole to travel.</p>

She views the partial revocation of Chevron's license as a positive step, as Venezuela depends heavily on oil exports for its income.

Families are being displaced across the country due to a lack of affordable housing, impacting children's education and well-being.

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing criticism after approving a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation in rare circumstances for the "public interest." The law, aimed at increasing black ownership of land, has drawn opposition from US President Donald Trump and local political parties. The government maintains that compensation will be paid in most cases and that the law is necessary to rectify historical imbalances. Experts suggest that productive agricultural land will likely not be expropriated without compensation, and the government hopes the law will expedite land reform.</p>

          <p>Senior officials at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs have reportedly ordered VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking with the public. This decision follows the publication of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine co-authored by VA pulmonologists, warning that cancelled contracts, layoffs, and staff reductions jeopardize veterans' health. Veterans advocates view this as censorship by the Trump administration, limiting the ability of experts to share critical information about veterans' healthcare.</p>

          <p>Ernest Williams, a 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran, continues his decades-long fight to correct what he believes is an unfair military pension. Williams claims he was "robbed" of the pension he deserved due to a change in pension rules between his discharge date in 1970 and the discharge dates of others in 1972. Despite numerous appeals, the Ministry of Defence maintains that his pension reflects his "full and correct entitlement" based on the rules at the time. Williams hopes that by speaking out, he can bring attention to his case and find other affected veterans.</p>
