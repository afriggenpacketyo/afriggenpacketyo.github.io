          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that goods imported from the European Union and Mexico will be subject to a 30% tariff beginning August 1. The move comes after trade negotiations stalled, with Trump stating the new duties are necessary to address long-standing trade deficits. European leaders expressed strong disapproval, warning of potential countermeasures to protect EU economic interests if an agreement is not reached. The policy escalation adds to a series of new tariffs announced for other major trading partners, increasing global economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several companies, including London-based Better Dairy, are developing cheese using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk, without involving animals. While proponents claim the product tastes similar to traditional cheese and offers health benefits, it faces significant challenges. The plant-based food market has seen a recent decline, and consumers are concerned about cost and the ultra-processed nature of such foods. Despite these obstacles, startups are targeting a 2027 launch, hoping to overcome regulatory hurdles and win over consumers.</p>

          <p>A woman from Norfolk, England, has been reunited with the older brother she never knew she had after her father revealed a long-held family secret. Following her mother's death, Jess Basey-Fisher learned that her mother had given up a baby for adoption years before she met her father. Using ancestry websites, she tracked down her brother, Alistair Dalgliesh, who was living in Australia. The siblings connected emotionally, but soon after, Alistair was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, prompting Jess to travel to Australia to support him and make memories together.</p>

          <p>Florida lawmakers have conducted their first tour of the controversial 'Alligator Alcatraz' migrant detention facility in the Everglades following weeks of being denied access. The visit came after detainees and advocates raised alarms about inhumane conditions, including extreme heat, lack of clean water, and inadequate food. Democratic lawmakers described the conditions as "appalling," noting high temperatures and claims of detainees drinking from toilets. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the site stated they were satisfied with the conditions, with one senator calling the beds comfortable.</p>

          <p>Two individuals who were wrongly arrested and publicly accused of felling the iconic Sycamore Gap tree have shared their experiences of facing intense online abuse and public scrutiny. A former lumberjack and a 16-year-old boy were targeted by amateur online sleuths and named in the media before being cleared by police. The real culprits have since been convicted, but the wrongly accused men describe the period as heartbreaking and dangerous, highlighting the damaging effects of trial by social media. One man resorted to wearing a wig to avoid being recognized in his community.</p>

          <p>A music festival in Italy's Campania region has sparked controversy by inviting Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a known supporter of Vladimir Putin, to perform. Gergiev has been largely barred from European stages since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine for failing to condemn the war. The regional governor defended the decision, arguing that culture should not be influenced by politics. However, European parliamentarians, Ukrainian activists, and Russian opposition figures have condemned the invitation as unacceptable, calling Gergiev a cultural mouthpiece for the Kremlin's agenda.</p>

Many viewers now consume the show through short clips, recaps, and commentary online rather than watching the full nightly episodes.

This shift is embraced by some younger Chinese citizens who prefer a single life and see AI as a viable support system for their future.

The death toll has risen to at least 129, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River swelled to unprecedented levels. The disaster heavily impacted Camp Mystic, a summer camp where at least 27 campers and counselors died. President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration, and officials are facing scrutiny over the adequacy of weather warnings and evacuation orders.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of his long-time critic, comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland. In a social media post, Trump labeled O'Donnell a "threat to humanity." Legal experts quickly noted that the president has no authority to revoke the citizenship of a native-born American, a principle established by a 1967 Supreme Court ruling. O'Donnell responded on Instagram, stating, "I'm not yours to silence," and calling Trump "everything that is wrong with America."</p>

          <p>The granddaughter of a victim from the Air India Flight 171 crash in Ahmedabad says she cannot find peace until the root cause is determined and accountability is established. A preliminary report found that the fuel supply to both engines of the Boeing 787 was cut off moments after takeoff, causing the crash that killed all 260 people on board. Relatives of the victims described the report's findings as incomplete and heartbreaking. They are calling for more details, including the release of cockpit audio, to understand what led to the tragic incident.</p>

          <p>The trial of Erin Patterson, who was convicted of murdering three people with poisonous mushrooms, has captivated Australia and become a global true crime phenomenon. Patterson, herself an avid follower of true crime cases, hosted a lunch where she served beef Wellingtons laced with toxic death cap mushrooms. The case has spawned documentaries, podcasts, and intense online speculation, with spectators queuing daily for a seat in the courtroom. Experts note that the fascination is partly driven by the seemingly benign domestic setting of the crime and the fact that the perpetrator was a woman.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the British ambassador to the United States, has indicated that the 10% tariff on most UK goods imported into the U.S. is likely "here to stay." Speaking to the Sunday Times, he suggested that while the universal tariff will probably remain, there is still potential for negotiations in specific sectors. His comments come amid ongoing confusion over tariffs on British steel and a surprise announcement by President Trump of a 30% tariff on EU and Mexican goods. Mandelson also predicted that Trump would receive a "warm reception" during his upcoming second state visit to the UK.</p>

          <p>Campaigners and a UK Member of Parliament are calling for cosmetic and skincare ingredient lists to be in English instead of Latin to protect people with severe allergies. Currently, companies use the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), which relies on Latin-based names. This practice makes it difficult for consumers to identify potential allergens like nuts or wheat, which could trigger life-threatening reactions. While the industry association defends the Latin system for providing global consistency, critics argue it puts consumers at unnecessary risk and should follow the clearer labeling standards used for food.</p>

Sources indicate the dismissals include staff from former Special Counsel Jack Smith's probes into classified documents and the 2020 election, as well as prosecutors involved in January 6 cases. These terminations are reportedly being directed by a "weaponization working group" established by Attorney General Pam Bondi.

          <p>In what is being called the shortest call in the show's history, finance personality Dave Ramsey gave blunt advice to a listener of 20 years. The caller, a real estate agent named Chad, had $211,000 in cash and a remaining mortgage of $95,000, and asked for confirmation on whether to pay it off. Ramsey's immediate response was, "Good Lord. Pay it off today," ending the call in under a minute. The moment highlights Ramsey's core philosophy of eliminating debt to achieve financial freedom, prioritizing emotional peace over potentially higher investment returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions flared at the end of day three of the Test match between England and India, with India's players reacting angrily to what they perceived as time-wasting tactics by England's batters. Opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed the game, ensuring he and Ben Duckett would only face one over before the close of play instead of two. England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, dismissed India's complaints, pointing out that India's own captain, Shubman Gill, had caused a lengthy delay by receiving a massage on the field the previous day, suggesting such tactics are part of the game.</p>
