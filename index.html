        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump as much as 14% during its Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, with 90% of the funds allocated to constructing a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. This expansion aligns with the global push from Chinese EV makers, though it faces challenges due to tariffs imposed by the U.S. and EU. CATL's revenue experienced a slight dip due to intense competition in China's EV market, but net profit still increased by 15% year over year.</p>

          <p>The Cato Institute released a report indicating that at least 50 Venezuelan men deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration had legally entered the U.S. with government permission. This contradicts the administration's claim that only undocumented individuals were deported to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center. The Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration, allowing it to end legal protections for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, while a lower court appeal proceeds. Separately, former FBI Director James Comey dismissed criticism regarding an Instagram post, asserting it was not a threat against Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction in seven months, as a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions provide room for monetary easing. The 1-year loan prime rate was lowered to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This move is part of a broader package of stimulus measures aimed at boosting the economy, including reductions to deposit rates and mortgage rates under the nation's housing provident fund. Analysts predict further policy easing, with forecasts of additional lending rate cuts by year-end.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering acquiring a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as a temporary Air Force One due to delays in the delivery of new planes. The proposed arrangement, which initially involved purchasing the plane but evolved into a potential gift from Qatar, has drawn ethical concerns and questions about its financial practicality. Despite Qatar's willingness to donate the aircraft, significant costs would be incurred to retrofit it for presidential use, including security upgrades and communication systems. The decision-making process involved high-level coordination between Washington and Doha, with President Trump personally inspecting the plane in Florida.</p>

          <p>The Senate advanced a crypto regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act, after Democratic opposition initially blocked the measure due to concerns over ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family. The legislation aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. Despite concerns raised by Senator Elizabeth Warren regarding consumer risk and corruption, the measure moved forward with bipartisan support, with some Democrats advocating for clear rules to protect consumers and support responsible innovation.</p>

          <p>Coral reefs are losing their vibrant colors and transforming due to warming waters, a shift witnessed by divers like Jarrod Taylor off the coast of Honolulu. Rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae that give them their hues, leaving them as white skeletons. Marine scientist Greg Asner notes that 84% of coral reefs are under heat stress, with the situation particularly dire in the Caribbean and Florida. Efforts to educate tourists and implement underwater nurseries offer some hope for coral recovery, contingent on controlling fossil fuel emissions.</p>
