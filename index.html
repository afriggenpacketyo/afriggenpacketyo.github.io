          <p>The Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles has issued a safety advisory urging Chinese citizens in the area to be vigilant and prioritize their personal safety due to ongoing law enforcement actions targeting immigration-related protests. The advisory reminds citizens to monitor official announcements and media reports, avoid gathering sites and crowded areas, and refrain from going out at night or traveling alone. This follows the deployment of California National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to escalating clashes between protesters and immigration agents amid President Trump's immigration raids. The White House stated that Trump signed a memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the lawlessness in California. </p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is in talks with the Treasury to finalize her department's budget before Wednesday's Spending Review, despite an offer of above-inflation increases to police funding. Other ministers, such as Housing Secretary Angela Rayner and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood, have already reached agreements. Cooper's ally suggests she is following the Treasury's timetable, while some argue settling earlier would have secured a better deal. The police chiefs have been publicly lobbying for more money, emphasizing the need to maintain police numbers to meet policy commitments. The review is expected to boost spending for schools and scientific research, with potential impacts on policing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Almost 350,000 nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a 3.6% pay increase, with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) already dismissing the award as "grotesque." The vote is crucial in determining the next steps, which could include a ballot for strike action. The government says the pay rise will result in new starter nurses earning over Â£30,000 for the first time ever. The RCN argues that nursing staff have endured over a decade of pay erosion, resulting in nurses quitting, and that the government has once again put nursing at the back of the queue when it comes to pay.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is initiating a nationwide effort to arrest illegal immigrants after asylum hearings as they leave courtrooms, targeting those who have been in the United States for less than two years. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aims to expedite deportations by having immigration judges drop cases, allowing for immediate removal without a hearing. This initiative is likely to cause controversy, potentially discouraging migrants from attending asylum hearings. An immigration attorney believes the new DHS effort is a scheme for the Trump administration to easily and quickly boost illegal immigrant apprehension numbers. (not investment advice)</p>
