          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced a plan to eliminate net-zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea.  The focus will shift to maximizing extraction, aiming to fully utilize North Sea resources.  This policy marks a significant departure from previous Conservative climate commitments and contrasts with Labour's stance of phasing out oil and gas.  The government argues that exploring new fields won't lower energy bills or enhance energy security, and would only worsen the climate crisis.</p>
