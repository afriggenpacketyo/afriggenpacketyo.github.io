          <p>According to analysts, the Chinese government's efforts to control a damaging price war in the solar-equipment industry are beginning to show positive results. Initiatives, including proposed limits on power use for manufacturing, have led to a recovery in prices for solar products like polysilicon. This price stabilization is expected to help leading manufacturers return to profitability after experiencing significant losses for the past 18 months. The policy changes are seen as a move toward industry consolidation and market stability.</p>

          <p>The office of Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has removed a photo of him with Kellen McMiller, a participant in Chicago's "peacekeeper" community violence prevention program. Days after the photo was taken, McMiller was charged with murder in connection with a fatal crash-and-grab robbery at a Louis Vuitton store that resulted in the death of a 40-year-old man. At the time of the photo, McMiller reportedly had four outstanding arrest warrants, leading to criticism of the governor's office, which stated it was "extremely troubled" by the arrest.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed a block of 48 of Donald Trump's executive branch nominees simultaneously, employing new rules implemented by Republicans to overcome Democratic delays. The rule change allows for the confirmation of large groups of non-judicial, lower-level nominees with a simple majority vote, bypassing previous obstruction tactics. Democrats criticized the move as a power grab that rubber-stamps potentially unqualified nominees, while Republicans argued it was necessary to fix a broken process and properly staff the administration.</p>

Manager Eddie Howe praised his team's commitment and heart but lamented missed opportunities in the first half, stating that a great performance is needed to defeat a team of Barcelona's caliber.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing accusations of attacking free speech following ABC's suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. The suspension came after FCC Chair Brendan Carr made comments suggesting regulatory action if the network didn't address Kimmel's remarks about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. President Trump later stated that networks critical of him are "not allowed to do that," intensifying concerns that the administration is using government power to suppress dissenting media voices, a tactic common in autocratic regimes.</p>

          <p>With a September 30 government shutdown deadline approaching, House Republicans are planning to vote on a 52-day stopgap funding measure. Speaker Mike Johnson expressed optimism about its passage, urging party unity, though some hardline members have signaled opposition. However, Democrats have indicated they will vote against the bill, demanding the restoration of Medicaid cuts and an extension of Obamacare subsidies. The measure's success is uncertain, as it would also require bipartisan support to pass the Senate if it clears the House.</p>

          <p>The helicopter carrying U.S. President Donald Trump, known as Marine One, was forced to make an unscheduled landing at Luton Airport due to a minor hydraulic issue as he concluded his state visit to the UK. The White House confirmed the diversion was made "out of an abundance of caution" and that the president and first lady were safely transferred to a support helicopter. They continued their journey to Stansted Airport, where they boarded Air Force One to return to the U.S., arriving about 20 minutes behind schedule.</p>

          <p>A Senate Judiciary Subcommittee heard testimony from parents who attribute their children's suicides and mental health crises to interactions with generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Character.AI. Lawmakers and advocates are concerned that these AI models can act as confidants and, in some cases, provide harmful guidance on topics like self-mutilation and suicide. In response, OpenAI announced plans to implement an age-prediction system and parental controls, though critics argue these measures are long overdue and raise privacy concerns.</p>

          <p>A medical examiner has determined that a man in his 30s died from accidental blunt impact injuries after riding the Stardust Racers roller coaster at Universal Orlando's new Epic Universe theme park. The man was found unresponsive after the ride and was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Universal stated it is cooperating with the investigation and has kept the attraction closed since the incident. The conclusion has raised further questions from theme park safety experts about how such injuries could have occurred on the ride.</p>

          <p>The suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" has triggered calls for a public boycott of parent company Disney, network ABC, and major station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair. The suspension followed pressure from the FCC chairman over Kimmel's monologue about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Advocacy groups and online activists are framing the issue as state-sanctioned censorship and an attack on the First Amendment, urging consumers to use economic pressure to protest what they see as media companies yielding to authoritarian demands.</p>

          <p>The British secret intelligence service, MI6, is launching a secure portal on the dark web to recruit new agents, with a particular focus on attracting sources within Russia. The platform, named Silent Courier, is designed to allow potential spies to contact the agency securely and discreetly with sensitive information. This move is part of an effort to use modern technology to bolster national security and stay ahead of adversaries. The initiative follows a similar strategy employed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) last year.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to designate the loose affiliation of anti-fascist activists known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." In a social media post, the president also recommended that those who fund the movement be thoroughly investigated. This move follows a similar threat made during his first term in 2020 that was never legally formalized. The announcement comes amid heightened rhetoric from the administration against what it terms "radical left political violence" following the recent assassination of a conservative activist.</p>

          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has been assigned a U.S. Secret Service protective detail, a move that is uncommon but not unprecedented for the role. The decision comes in the wake of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which has intensified conversations about the safety of high-profile public figures. During Donald Trump's first term, then-press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was also temporarily given a security detail after being confronted at a restaurant. Congress is currently considering additional funding to increase security for government officials.</p>

          <p>For the first time in their history, the Los Angeles Dodgers will sell over 4 million tickets in a single season, a rare milestone in Major League Baseball. The team, which has led the league in attendance every year since 2013, will officially cross the threshold during its final regular-season game. This achievement is attributed to the team's consistent on-field success and a star-studded roster, which was further boosted by the off-season signing of global superstar Shohei Ohtani. No MLB team has reached the 4-million mark since 2008.</p>

          <p>Oversight officials and civil rights advocates in Los Angeles County are criticizing a new policy that requires them to get pre-approval from a county executive office before communicating with the press or other government officials. The policy states it is meant to ensure messaging aligns with county priorities and maintains a unified voice. However, members of commissions that oversee the county jails and the Sheriff's Department argue it is a transparent attempt to stifle independent oversight and control the narrative around ongoing issues like poor jail conditions.</p>
