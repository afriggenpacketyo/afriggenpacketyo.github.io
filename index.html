          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. remains in the hospital for precautionary checks after his victory over Conor Benn in a legacy fight. The promoter, Ben Shalom, emphasized that these measures are taken seriously due to past incidents involving Eubank Jr., referencing Nick Blackwell's brain bleed in 2016 and Michael Watson's brain damage in 1991. The fight was a highly anticipated event, with both fathers of the fighters having a storied history in boxing, and present to witness their sons' bout. Eubank Sr. had previously criticized the match-up and the health risks to his son.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite his historically low approval among Ukrainians, President Trump's recent remarks questioning Putin's continued aggression have provided a glimmer of hope. Trump questioned why Putin would continue to attack Ukraine while the U.S. is attempting to broker peace. This statement has resonated with Ukrainians who fear being forced into a disadvantageous peace deal, particularly one that compromises their NATO aspirations and recognizes Crimea as Russian territory. The remarks follow a deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv, prompting Trump to directly address Putin with a demand to stop. Optimism for Ukrainians has increased given Trump's vocalization.</p>

          <p>A head-on collision on the Tohoku Expressway in Nasushiobara, Japan, resulted in the deaths of three people and injuries to ten others. The incident was caused by a 42-year-old driver traveling in the wrong direction, first colliding with another vehicle before a fatal head-on crash with a 56-year-old man. A subsequent rear-end collision involving a truck occurred due to the resulting traffic jam, claiming the life of a 60-year-old woman. Police are investigating the cause of the initial wrong-way driving and have arrested the truck driver for negligent driving resulting in death and injury.</p>

          <p>Archaeological excavations in Guinea-Bissau have unearthed physical evidence of the kingdom of Kaabu, a civilization previously known primarily through the oral traditions of griots, West African storytellers. The kingdom, which existed from the 15th to 19th centuries, was reportedly never visited by Europeans, adding to its mystique. Archaeologist Sirio Canós-Donnay and her team uncovered the capital city of Kansala, confirming details passed down through generations of griots' songs. This discovery highlights the importance of oral history and provides a tangible link to a significant African kingdom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Museums are increasingly collaborating with major commercial art galleries to support contemporary art exhibitions, a trend that raises questions about the influence of commercial interests on art history. A recent analysis examined over 350 solo exhibitions in New York's biggest art museums over the past six years, revealing the scale of these partnerships. This shift raises concerns about the potential for galleries to shape the narrative of art history and the selection of artists showcased in prominent institutions. The traditional role of curators in maintaining scholarly independence is being challenged by this growing reliance on commercial support.</p>

          <p>The MAGA movement has developed a distinct aesthetic, characterized by stark gendered looks and often featuring visible plastic surgery, reflecting a broader political philosophy. For men, the look often includes clean-shaven faces or beards, close-cropped hair, and bulky builds, while women often sport long, wavy hair, full lips, and defined brows. This aesthetic, described as "extreme," is seen as a callback to different eras and is often paired with extreme policies. The connection between these looks and policies serves as a distraction from the underlying realities of the political agenda.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin judge, Monica Isham, is threatening to boycott holding court in response to the arrest of Judge Hannah Dugan by federal authorities. Dugan was arrested for allegedly obstructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and shielding a migrant from them. Isham stated that she would not allow anyone to be taken from her courtroom by ICE without due process, comparing such actions to sending individuals to a concentration camp. This stance has sparked controversy, with some criticizing Isham's ultimatum, while others defend her position on constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>The Green Party is urging the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to withdraw its interim guidance on single-sex spaces, deeming it "ill-considered and impractical."

Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer argues the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination and contradicts Britain's tradition of tolerance.

These policies, framed as moral imperatives, divert attention from the real drivers of distress: poverty, housing instability, systemic racism, and a broken healthcare system.

Doge, created by an executive order, has been cutting spending and staff across government agencies, leading to concerns about its impact on public services and data privacy.

          <p>Car ramming attacks, where vehicles are used as weapons, have become a global concern, with incidents occurring in various locations and often lacking clear motives. Sociologists suggest that these attacks can be "imitative" events, offering a model for others to replicate. Prevention strategies include restricting access to vehicles, strengthening identification requirements, and redesigning urban areas to separate roads and footpaths. Understanding the motivations behind these attacks remains challenging, but addressing the potential for copycat incidents is crucial for enhancing public safety.</p>
