          <p>A Florida woman named Amber Meade endured months of excruciating pain after a foot surgery, which was eventually diagnosed as chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare and incurable disorder. The condition, which can occur after nerve injuries, is difficult to diagnose and treat, often requiring a multi-faceted approach including physical therapy and medication. After finding a specialized physical therapist and undergoing ketamine infusions, Meade has been able to regain some functionality and improve her quality of life, though she still manages the lifelong condition.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 4% year-over-year decrease in its second-quarter operating earnings, falling to $11.16 billion. The decline was primarily influenced by lower insurance underwriting profits, though other sectors like railroad and energy saw gains. The company reiterated significant concerns about the potential negative impact of U.S. tariffs on its diverse business operations and investments. Warren Buffett's conglomerate also saw its cash reserves slightly decrease to $344.1 billion.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted the Trump administration's policy of summarily expelling migrants at the southern border without allowing them to seek asylum. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled that while the administration can deny access to the asylum system itself, it cannot ignore U.S. laws requiring consideration for other humanitarian protections, such as "withholding of removal" and relief under the Convention Against Torture. This decision narrows a lower court's ruling but affirms that the president cannot unilaterally suspend all forms of humanitarian protection for migrants fearing persecution.</p>

          <p>Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, erupted for the second day in a row, sending smoke and volcanic material miles into the sky. The powerful explosions blanketed nearby villages with debris and gravel, though no casualties have been reported. The volcano has been on its highest alert level since June, with authorities expanding the exclusion zone due to the increased frequency and intensity of its eruptions. Indonesia is located on the "Ring of Fire" and is home to 120 active volcanoes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area based on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The court agreed that such factors alone do not constitute reasonable suspicion for detaining individuals to check their immigration status, a practice that violates the 4th Amendment. The decision stems from a lawsuit over raids by the Trump administration that sparked widespread fear in the region's large Latino community.</p>

          <p>Hamilton, Ohio, a town revitalized by an influx of immigrants over the past two decades, now faces a climate of fear due to a stringent immigration crackdown. The local Butler County jail, run by an outspoken anti-immigration sheriff, profits from detaining individuals on immigration-related charges, creating anxiety within the community. The article highlights the tension between the positive economic and cultural contributions of immigrants and the repressive enforcement policies that threaten their stability and sense of belonging in their new home.</p>

          <p>Imprisoned sex-trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell is exploring several legal and political strategies to secure her release, including cooperating with the Justice Department. Her legal team is simultaneously appealing her conviction to the Supreme Court, seeking congressional immunity, and pursuing potential clemency from the Trump administration. Experts suggest these moves are a multifaceted effort to leverage her knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein's network for her own freedom, though the likelihood of success through any single path remains slim.</p>

          <p>An investigation into a major air battle between Pakistan and India in May found that a key factor in Pakistan's success was an Indian intelligence failure regarding the range of Chinese-made PL-15 missiles. Pakistani J-10C jets were able to shoot down at least one of India's advanced Rafale fighters from a distance greater than Indian pilots anticipated, giving Pakistan the element of surprise. The incident highlighted the effectiveness of Pakistan's "kill chain," which integrated Chinese hardware with other surveillance assets to gain a battlefield advantage.</p>

          <p>A growing number of major Jewish American groups, including traditionally staunch defenders of Israel, are publicly expressing deep concern over the worsening humanitarian crisis and risk of famine in Gaza. Organizations like the American Jewish Committee and the Reform movement have issued statements urging Israel to increase the flow of aid to Palestinian civilians, reflecting a significant shift in discourse within the community. This trend aligns with declining U.S. public support for Israel's military actions and highlights a generational divide among American Jews on the issue.</p>

          <p>This opinion column pushes back against the notion that the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 NBA championship, won in the Orlando "bubble," is less legitimate than other titles. The author argues that dismissing the victory ignores the immense courage and mental fortitude required for players to compete while isolated during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The piece contends that the unique challenges, including playing without home-court advantage despite having the best record, make the championship worthy of an exclamation point, not an asterisk.</p>

          <p>Colombia's former president, Álvaro Uribe, has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery, marking the first time a Colombian head of state has been convicted in a criminal trial. The court found him guilty of paying jailed paramilitaries to retract testimony linking him to the formation of right-wing militia groups during the country's civil war. The landmark verdict was hailed by human rights groups as a blow against impunity, though Uribe's supporters claim the case is politically motivated.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is replacing its iconic Humvee, a military workhorse for 40 years, with a new, lighter vehicle designed for modern warfare. The new Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) is essentially a stripped-down, all-terrain truck based on a commercial Chevrolet Colorado, making it faster, cheaper, and easier to repair. This shift reflects the Army's strategic move away from heavy armor, which was crucial in Iraq and Afghanistan, toward speed and agility to counter threats like lethal drones on future battlefields.</p>
