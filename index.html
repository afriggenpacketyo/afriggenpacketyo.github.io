The trip includes attending the 12th joint meeting of the China-Italy government committee and the fourth round of the China-Switzerland strategic dialogue. This visit follows a recent decision by Rome to extend an olive branch to a state-backed Chinese group, Sinochem International Corp, a major shareholder in Italian tyremaker Pirelli, suggesting a potential warming of economic relations.</p>

          <p>Heavy monsoon rains in Nepal have triggered devastating landslides, lightning, and flash floods, leading to the deaths of at least 22 people, with another 12 reported missing. The eastern Ilam district was hit particularly hard, where multiple villages were swept away and 18 fatalities occurred, including six members of a single family. The severe weather has also disrupted domestic flights and blocked major highways, complicating rescue and relief operations as authorities work to assist those affected.</p>

In response to the proximity of the attacks, neighboring NATO member Poland scrambled its fighter jets to secure its airspace, highlighting the escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to give police broader authority to impose conditions on recurring protests, following a day of demonstrations that resulted in nearly 500 arrests. The new powers will allow senior officers to consider the "cumulative impact" of past protests, potentially leading to restrictions on location if an area has been repeatedly targeted. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the move is about balancing the right to protest with community safety, particularly in light of recent tensions and a deadly synagogue attack.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the fall of longtime leader Bashar Assad, though the process is not a direct popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210 assembly seats will be chosen by electoral colleges in various districts, while the remaining third will be appointed by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa. The elections are seen as a test of the interim government's commitment to inclusivity, especially concerning women and minorities, as the country navigates a complex political transition after years of civil war.</p>

          <p>Despite record electric vehicle sales in the last quarter, the United States continues to trail other major markets like China and Europe in the transition to electric transportation. Analysts suggest a recent sales boom was driven by a government subsidy that has now expired, with automakers like Ford and GM expecting a significant drop in demand. Factors contributing to the slower adoption in the U.S. include weaker government support, higher average EV prices, and the effective exclusion of low-cost Chinese brands due to high tariffs.
