          <p>Miao Hua, a senior general who previously directed the People's Liberation Army's ideological work, has been officially removed from China's powerful Central Military Commission. This action follows his expulsion from the National People's Congress two months prior, signaling a significant development in a wide-ranging anti-corruption investigation within the military. His removal from the country's top military body underscores the ongoing campaign to address high-level graft within the armed forces. The Chinese defense ministry had already removed his photo from its senior leadership webpage in late May.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its welfare reform plans, reversing a key proposal to cut Personal Independence Payments (Pip) for existing disability benefit recipients. The original plan aimed to save Â£5 billion annually by 2029-30, but the U-turn means changes will now only apply to new claimants starting in November 2026. This reversal is estimated to cost between Â£2.5 billion and Â£3 billion, more than halving the anticipated savings from the welfare bill. The decision raises questions about fiscal stability but provides relief to hundreds of thousands of current claimants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan experienced a dramatic increase in tariffed rice imports in May, with volumes reaching 3.5 times the total for the entire 2024 fiscal year. This surge, totaling 10,605 tons, was primarily driven by soaring domestic rice prices and a supply shortage, which led consumers and businesses to seek cheaper alternatives from abroad. The United States was the largest supplier of this imported rice, which is subject to a high tariff as it falls outside Japan's tariff-free quota. Experts suggest this trend may temper as the government releases stockpiles but could resume if domestic prices remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a massive recall of over 1.2 million power banks due to fire risks, Chinese electronics firm Anker Innovations has announced a strategic partnership with Amperex Technology Limited (ATL), a known supplier for Apple. Anker will initially purchase 45 million lithium-ion batteries from ATL to secure its supply chain and rebuild consumer trust. The recall was attributed to defective battery cells from a previous supplier, which Anker has since ceased business with. This move represents a significant pivot for Anker as it aims to ensure the safety and quality of its products.</p>

          <p>The German parliament has approved a measure to suspend family reunification for refugees holding subsidiary protection status for a minimum of two years. This policy change directly impacts a large group, predominantly from Syria, who are not granted full refugee status but cannot be returned to their home country due to serious risks. The government argues that the country's integration capacity has reached its limit, justifying the suspension. However, human rights organizations criticize the decision, warning of severe psychological distress for separated families and the potential to push individuals towards unsafe, irregular migration routes.</p>

Additional support for the market came from a de-escalation of conflicts in the Middle East, which encouraged investors to take on more risk.

The levels of these metals, particularly lead and nickel, were found to be alarmingly high, presenting a significant cancer risk and exceeding safety limits.

          <p>Following a series of technical outages, staffing shortages, and a fatal midair collision, the debate over whether to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system has been reignited. While the Trump administration previously pushed for privatization in 2017, the current focus is on a multi-billion dollar investment to modernize the FAA's existing infrastructure. Proponents of privatization point to models in Canada and Europe as potentially more efficient, while opponents argue that the U.S. system is too large and complex for such a change. For now, industry groups appear to be coalescing around the modernization plan rather than pursuing a divisive privatization fight.</p>

          <p>Health policy experts are warning that the number of uninsured Americans could significantly increase if budget legislation proposed by the second Trump administration is enacted. According to the Congressional Budget Office, one version of the bill could cause 10.9 million people to lose health insurance by 2034, with that number potentially rising to 16 million if ACA tax credits expire. The proposed legislation includes major rollbacks in federal support for Medicaid and stricter eligibility rules, representing a historic shift in U.S. health policy. This could force more people to pay for care out-of-pocket, leading to delayed treatments and poorer health outcomes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission is growing increasingly frustrated with China's negotiation tactics ahead of a crucial trade summit, using a "stinking fish" analogy to describe the situation. Brussels feels that Beijing's primary demands involve the EU paying to remove retaliatory measures that China itself imposed in the first place. These include tariffs on EU brandy, which were a response to European duties on Chinese electric vehicles, as well as probes into dairy and pork products. This dynamic has created a tense atmosphere, with European diplomats feeling they are being asked to reward China for ceasing punitive actions.</p>

          <p>Despite being employed, 826,000 people in Germany required supplementary state benefits in 2024, an increase of 30,000 from the previous year. Critics argue this demonstrates that the country's minimum wage is too low to cover the rising cost of living, particularly rent, even for full-time workers. Economists counter that the issue is often not the hourly wage but the low number of hours worked, as most recipients work part-time. This is frequently due to a lack of adequate childcare, trapping many, especially women, in part-time roles and perpetuating their reliance on government support.</p>

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) attributed the sharp decline primarily to new 25% U.S. tariffs, which caused exports to the American market to halve as some automakers halted shipments. Production was also impacted by factory retooling for electric vehicle manufacturing.

          <p>The Women's Euro 2025 tournament will be hosted by Switzerland from July 2 to July 27, featuring 16 national teams competing across eight stadiums. World Cup champions Spain are considered top contenders, alongside finalists from 2022, Germany, and defending champions England, who are dealing with several key injuries. The tournament will showcase stars like Spain's Aitana Bonmati, Germany's new captain Giulia Gwinn, and England's striker Alessia Russo. UEFA has significantly increased the prize money for this year's event, though it still remains a fraction of the total awarded for the men's tournament.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Warns China of Geopolitical Risks from US Being Drawn into Conflicts by Allies</h2>

          <p>A prominent Chinese foreign policy expert has warned that Beijing should be alert to the risk of the United States being drawn into military conflicts by its allies. Yan Xuetong of Tsinghua University commented that the Trump administration's foreign policy is accelerating a trend of deglobalization, leading to increased military conflicts and global uncertainty. His remarks came in the context of a recent U.S. one-off military operation and subsequent ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This perspective suggests a view from Beijing that the actions of U.S. partners could inadvertently escalate tensions and create a more volatile international environment.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals How China Bypasses Sanctions to Remain Top Buyer of Iranian Oil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 02:51:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite extensive U.S. sanctions on Tehran, China remains the top importer of Iranian oil by utilizing a sophisticated shadow supply chain. Analysts report that China buys discounted Iranian crude through a system involving ship-to-ship transfers in international waters, fake tanker location broadcasting (spoofing), and a payment system denominated in Chinese yuan to bypass the U.S. dollar. This allows China's independent "teapot" refineries to acquire oil at a significant discount compared to other sources. These methods have proven highly effective, with Iranian oil exports to China remaining robust and largely unaffected by Washington's sanctions regime. (not investment advice)</p>
