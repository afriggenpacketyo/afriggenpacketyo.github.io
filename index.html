          <p>Intense Israeli military strikes continued in Gaza City, destroying Al-Azhar University, despite expectations of a ceasefire. The Gaza Government Media Office reported 93 airstrikes in 24 hours, resulting in 70 Palestinian deaths. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed optimism about securing the return of all hostages soon, while President Trump stated Israel has agreed to an initial withdrawal line as part of a peace proposal. Trump has also urged Hamas to act quickly on the deal, sending envoys to Egypt to finalize the details.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent record sales, the United States is lagging behind Europe and China in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). Analysts attribute this to weaker government support and the recent expiration of a significant $7,500 tax credit, which is expected to cause a sharp drop in demand. The average cost of an EV in the U.S. remains high at over $57,000, and high tariffs have kept more affordable Chinese models out of the market. Automakers are now scaling back EV investments amid policy uncertainty and economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to give police forces new powers to place conditions on recurring protests by considering their "cumulative impact" on communities. This follows a day of mass arrests and comes amid concerns for the safety of religious communities, particularly the Jewish community, due to repeated demonstrations. The new authority could allow police to direct organizers to different locations and may lead to arrest for non-compliance. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has also initiated a review of existing protest legislation, including the possibility of outright bans.</p>

          <p>Authorities in three Indian states have banned the sale of Coldrif cough syrup after it was linked to the deaths of at least nine children. The Indian Health Ministry confirmed that samples of the syrup, manufactured by Sresan Pharma, contained toxic levels of diethylene glycol (DEG), a dangerous industrial solvent. This incident has intensified scrutiny of India's large pharmaceutical industry, which has faced previous warnings from the World Health Organization over contaminated medicines. India is a major global supplier of generic drugs, producing 20% of the world's supply.</p>

          <p>Russia conducted a large-scale missile and drone assault on Ukraine, with a primary focus on the western city of Lviv, located near the Polish border. The attacks resulted in at least two deaths and several injuries in the Lviv region, while a strike on a power plant in Zaporizhzhia killed one person and cut electricity to over 73,000 residents. In response to the threat, neighboring NATO member Poland scrambled its own and allied fighter jets to secure its airspace. The escalation follows a US official's statement of support for Ukrainian strikes deep within Russian territory.</p>

          <p>The article highlights a positive long-term outlook for Nvidia (NVDA) stock, citing the company's critical role in the expanding artificial intelligence (AI) sector. As a leading designer of semiconductor chips essential for training AI models, Nvidia is positioned to benefit from what its CEO predicts could be a $4 trillion annual AI infrastructure market by 2030. Despite its significant growth over the past decade, the stock's valuation is not considered excessively high relative to its growth prospects. The article suggests long-term investors could see strong returns from the company's continued innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

This approach, along with attempts to interfere in Brazilian politics, is seen as a regression to an imperialist "Monroe Doctrine" mindset.

          <p>Germany's Munich Airport experienced two separate shutdowns within 24 hours due to confirmed drone sightings near its runways, impacting thousands of passengers. The incidents are the latest in a series of mysterious drone overflights at airports and critical infrastructure sites across several European Union countries. A Lithuanian airport also briefly closed due to a possible balloon sighting. European authorities are concerned about the source of the drones, with suspicion falling on Russia, though no definitive proof has been established, prompting calls for a coordinated European defense plan.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Issues Temporary Block on Trump's National Guard Deployment to Portland</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland without the governor's consent. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued a 14-day restraining order, ruling that the administration's justification for the deployment was "untethered to the facts." The judge stated that while some protest incidents were inexcusable, they did not rise to a level that local law enforcement couldn't handle. She also warned the president's actions risked blurring the line between civil and military authority.</p>
