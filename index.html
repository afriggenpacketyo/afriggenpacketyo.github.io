          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of urinary symptoms and the discovery of a prostate nodule. Despite the severity, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, offering potential treatment options. Former President Trump and Vice President Harris have offered their support to Biden and his family during this challenging time, as Biden and his family consider treatment options. The former president is reviewing treatment options with his physicians.</p>

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has offered federal resources to the affected states, and emergency housing options are being secured as clean-up efforts begin in the aftermath of the tragic weather event.

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of urinary symptoms and the discovery of a “small nodule” on his prostate. Despite the severity, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, offering potential treatment options. President Trump and Vice President Harris have offered their support to Biden and his family during this challenging time.</p>

          <p>Federal and local agencies are investigating a Mexican tall ship crash into the Brooklyn Bridge that killed two people and injured dozens. The Cuauhtémoc's masts hit the bridge, snapping with 277 people on board. Officials said the ship lost power and drifted backward into the bridge. Sen. Schumer questioned whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency may have played a role in the incident.</p>

          <h2>Former President Joe Biden's Cancer Diagnosis: Gleason Score Explained</h2>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's office announced on Sunday that he is battling an "aggressive" form of prostate cancer, characterized by a "Gleason score of 9". His office also said Biden's diagnosis included metastasis to the bone. The Gleason score is calculated by adding together the two grades of cancer cells that make up the largest areas of the biopsied tissue sample, the NIH says. This approach can effectively slow disease progression and manage symptoms, even in advanced stages where the cancer has spread to the bones.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor, won the presidential election in Romania, defeating George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump. Simion, who had been seen as the front-runner, had called for national protests should the final count show him as the loser. Dan's victory will likely calm fears in Europe's political mainstream that Romania might oppose help for Ukraine and cozy up to Moscow.</p>
