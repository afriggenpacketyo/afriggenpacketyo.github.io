          <p>Over 3,200 Boeing defense unit employees in the St. Louis area have commenced their first strike in nearly three decades, rejecting a contract proposal that included a 20% wage increase and a $5,000 bonus. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 union stated the offer failed to adequately reflect their members' skills and dedication to national defense. Boeing expressed disappointment but activated contingency plans to maintain operations, noting the defense unit contributes significantly to company revenue. The strike follows a larger commercial aircraft worker stoppage last year, highlighting ongoing labor tensions.</p>

          <p>Leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics, have voiced deep concern after being disinvited from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) workgroups. They argue that removing their expertise from this vital process is "irresponsible, dangerous to our nation's health, and will further undermine public and clinician trust in vaccines." This decision, communicated via email, ends a decades-long practice of involving external experts in evaluating vaccine data and formulating recommendations. The move follows a previous Trump administration change to the ACIP panel, raising fears of politicization in public health guidance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's Class A and B shares fell over 2% after the conglomerate reported a 4% decline in second-quarter operating earnings, totaling $11.16 billion. This dip was primarily due to a drop in insurance underwriting, despite gains in other sectors. Investors were also disappointed by the company's continued stock-selling spree and the absence of share repurchases, even as its stock corrected. A significant $3.8 billion loss from its Kraft Heinz stake, carried above market value, further impacted results, reflecting Warren Buffett's prior acknowledgment of overpaying for the investment. The company's cash hoard remains near a record high, signaling a cautious investment stance.</p>

          <p>Following recent economic data showing a tick-up in inflation to 2.6% and a rise in unemployment to 4.2% in July, Democrats are advised to aggressively counter President Trump's positive economic claims. The data also revealed 258,000 fewer jobs gained than previously reported, suggesting his tariff policies may be harming the economy. Trump responded by publicly criticizing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and controversially firing Erika McEntarfer, head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her of manipulating data. This political and economic turmoil, coupled with public disapproval of Trump's tax plan and concerns over potential cuts to social security, provides a critical opportunity for Democrats to highlight economic challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's state broadcaster CCTV reported that the People's Liberation Army Air Force has developed new techniques enabling older warplanes, such as the J-10C fighter, to successfully engage more advanced stealth fighters. This "kill chain" strategy relies on the combined power of multiple systems, including airborne warning and control system (Awacs) planes and electronic warfare platforms, rather than individual fighter capabilities. During an exercise, a KJ-500A Awacs plane identified a stealth target, guiding a J-10C to fire a medium-to-long-range missile. This development, reminiscent of Pakistan's use of similar tactics against Indian Rafale jets, suggests China's efforts to counter advanced American warplanes.</p>

          <p>Saudi authorities have executed 17 people in three days, including two Saudis for "terrorist crimes" and 15, mostly foreigners, for drug offenses. This accelerated pace of capital punishment marks the quickest since a mass execution in March 2022 and puts the kingdom on track to surpass its record of 338 executions last year. Human rights groups like Reprieve and Amnesty International express grave concern, highlighting a significant rise in executions for hashish-related offenses, disproportionately affecting foreign nationals. Analysts link this surge to the kingdom's 2023 "war on drugs," despite a global trend towards decriminalizing hashish.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney's registration as a Republican voter in Florida has drawn significant attention and sparked debate, particularly after President Trump publicly expressed delight. This revelation follows a recent American Eagle ad campaign featuring Sweeney that faced criticism for perceived nationalist undertones, drawing comparisons to "Nazi propaganda" by some online. PR experts warn that such political entanglements can be risky for celebrities, especially early in their careers, potentially leading to "carnage" due to intense public scrutiny and social media opposition. While established stars like Taylor Swift have navigated political stances, Sweeney's less solidified career raises questions about the long-term impact on her public image.</p>

          <p>Germany's Christian Social Union (CSU) has successfully pushed for an earlier implementation of the "mother's pension" increase, now set for January 1, 2027, despite a significant federal budget gap. This third step in the pension plan adds approximately €20 per child per month for children born before 1992, benefiting an estimated 10 million women. While aiming to equalize benefits for older parents, critics argue the €5 billion annual cost is fiscally irresponsible and does not effectively address the gender pay gap or poverty among the elderly, as the poorest may not benefit. Business communities also express concern, suggesting the measure prioritizes older generations at the expense of active workers and infrastructure investment.</p>

          <p>Millions of car buyers in the UK could be eligible for compensation following a Supreme Court ruling on hidden commissions paid by lenders to dealers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is establishing a compensation scheme, with first payments anticipated in 2026. Buyers who took out loans with discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), banned in 2021, are particularly likely to have a claim if they were overcharged or not adequately informed. The article advises against using claims companies, recommending individuals wait for the FCA scheme or contact their lender directly. The ruling emphasizes "fair treatment" for customers, even if commission details were in the small print but not prominent.</p>

This individual was among many in the building who used texts and calls to alert others to the active shooter. The incident resulted in four fatalities, including an off-duty NYPD officer, a mother of two, a real estate firm worker, and a security guard. Authorities believe the 27-year-old gunman, Shane Tamura, was targeting the NFL offices after shooting several people before taking his own life.

Despite a new government and initial hopes of land return, villagers express skepticism about compensation plans and believe their Tamil area was targeted.

Matthews, who was re-elected as a Conservative in May 2024, cited a need to "cut out the dark heart of wokeness" from the criminal justice system and criticized both Conservative and Labour governments for failing the country. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage welcomed the defection, which consolidates the party's local power base.

Despite some families having lived in Iran for generations, they are not granted Iranian citizenship, and documented refugees often face discrimination, including denial of school places. Iranian authorities justify the deportations by citing an increase in "illegal" immigrants and strain on resources, having previously set a July 15 deadline for their departure.

          <p>The sudden global popularity of Labubu, a "demonic-looking" plushie distributed by Chinese company Pop Mart, signifies the blurring lines between childhood and adulthood, a phenomenon dubbed "kidulthood." Labubu's appeal stems from scarcity, blind-box surprise, and its "ugly-cute" aesthetic, which resonates with adults seeking to inject playfulness into their lives and challenge traditional notions of maturity. Unlike previous plushie trends kept private, Labubus are "public displays of cuteness," openly carried by adults in various professional settings. This trend reflects a broader cultural shift towards embracing vulnerability and rejecting rigid adult norms, with Pop Mart successfully marketing these collectibles to young adults.</p>

Online banks typically offer the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs compared to traditional brick-and-mortar institutions.

ETFs, similar to mutual funds but with lower costs and more trading flexibility, offer a basket of securities tracking broad indices. Advisors recommend avoiding trading during market opening and closing hours due to high volatility, suggesting the middle of the day for purchases. Instead of attempting to "time the market," which proves largely ineffective, investors are encouraged to use dollar-cost averaging, investing fixed amounts at regular intervals. Limit orders can also provide more control by setting a specific purchase price, though this may lead to missed opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is promoting Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz" facility as a model for new state-run migrant detention centers, with plans to open similar sites near airports nationwide. The South Florida facility, a 3,000-bed makeshift center in isolated swampland, cost an estimated $450 million in its first year. Noem claims these new venues, strategically located near runways, will be more cost-effective and efficient for processing and deporting unauthorized migrants, funded by a new $45 billion pool from President Trump's "big, beautiful bill." However, the Florida facility faces criticism for alleged inhumane conditions and legal challenges regarding state authority over immigration detention.</p>

This contrasts sharply with the FDIC's national average of 0.38%. Online banks are typically the best source for these accounts due to lower overhead costs, often requiring minimal deposits and charging no monthly fees. The article emphasizes the importance of building an emergency fund to address unexpected expenses without resorting to high-interest credit cards.

          <p>Scientists in Germany are meticulously studying a 1.2-million-year-old ice core extracted from Antarctica, aiming to unlock vital information about Earth's climate history. This oldest continuous ice core ever drilled provides atmospheric records, including greenhouse gas concentrations like CO2, over an unprecedented timescale. Researchers hope to understand the shift from 40,000-year glacial cycles to the current 100,000-year cycles, improving predictions for Earth's response to future greenhouse gas increases. While previous warm periods had lower CO2 levels, current concentrations are significantly higher due to human activity.

          <p>Tesla has awarded CEO Elon Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock, valued at approximately $29 billion, just six months after a Delaware judge revoked his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018. This new grant aims to incentivize Musk to remain at Tesla, particularly as the "war for AI talent is intensifying." Tesla's board stated that if the 2018 deal is reinstated on appeal, Musk would forfeit the new award to prevent a "double dip." The company, which has seen its shares plunge 25% this year, attributes this partly to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Trump and increased competition. An analyst suggests this grant may alleviate some shareholder concerns.</p>

          <p>High-income earners could face an artificially high federal tax rate, dubbed a "SALT torpedo," of 45.5% on modified adjusted gross income between $500,000 and $600,000 under President Trump's "big beautiful bill." This occurs due to a phaseout of the increased $40,000 federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). Tax and investment advisors recommend strategies to reduce modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) below these thresholds before year-end. Solutions include opting for ETFs over mutual funds in taxable brokerage accounts to limit year-end capital gains and switching from Roth to pretax 401(k) contributions. Avoiding large profits from investment or home sales is also suggested to prevent triggering the penalty. (not investment advice)</p>

He urges the Labour government to prioritize getting Britons back into the workforce to slash welfare bills and address the "explosive" national debt.
