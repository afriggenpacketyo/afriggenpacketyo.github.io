          <p>Singer Billy Joel has announced the cancellation of all scheduled concerts following a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition where cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, impacting hearing, vision, and balance. The article details NPH, typically seen in older individuals, explaining its causes, symptoms (gait issues, urinary incontinence, cognitive difficulties), and the importance of distinguishing it from dementia. Treatment involves a surgical procedure called shunting, which regulates fluid in the brain, with symptoms often improving shortly after the procedure. Timely treatment is crucial to prevent permanent brain damage from the excess fluid.</p>

          <p>Russian aerial attacks across Ukraine have resulted in at least 13 deaths and 56 injuries, with Kyiv being a primary target, according to Ukrainian officials. The attacks involved 250 drones and 14 ballistic missiles, causing fires in residential areas and damaging infrastructure, including schools and a clinic. These attacks occurred as Russia and Ukraine engaged in prisoner swaps, exchanging hundreds of soldiers and civilians in the largest exchange since the start of the conflict. President Zelensky emphasized the need for additional sanctions against Russia to achieve a ceasefire, while also highlighting the return of Ukrainian prisoners as part of the exchange deal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to block the institution from enrolling foreign students and cutting federal funding, citing concerns about left-wing bias and antisemitism. The administration has already frozen billions in funding and is demanding sweeping reforms, including ending diversity programs and ensuring viewpoint diversity. Harvard is resisting these demands, arguing they violate freedom of speech, and has sued the administration. The outcome could significantly impact Harvard's international student population, its finances, and its academic freedom, potentially leading to a protracted legal battle.</p>

          <p>Despite Israel allowing limited humanitarian aid into Gaza, aid agencies warn of an impending famine due to insufficient supplies and logistical challenges. Although hundreds of trucks are ready at the border, distribution is slow due to security clearances and damaged infrastructure.

The Amalthea Plan, a maritime aid corridor, has also faced setbacks, and if the current rate of aid delivery does not increase significantly, Gaza's population faces a severe risk of famine in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented images of the USS F-1, a World War I-era submarine that sank off the coast of San Diego in 1917, killing 19 crew members. The high-definition pictures were taken using advanced deep-sea imaging technology during an expedition, revealing the submarine's final resting place more than 1,300 feet below the ocean's surface. The USS F-1 collided with another submarine during exercises, and while it was located in 1972, a close-up survey was not possible until now. The team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed nearby in 1950, holding a remembrance ceremony for the lost crew members.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman stated that he has been "shamed" into returning to his senatorial duties after facing scrutiny over his mental health and attendance record. The Pennsylvania Democrat expressed frustration that his openness about mental health struggles has been "weaponized" against him. Fetterman feels that participating in committee work and casting procedural votes are a "performative" waste of time and has missed votes to spend more time with his family. Despite pressure, Fetterman said he would never switch parties, even as some Republicans have begun courting him.</p>
