          <p>Former President Trump announced that he has ordered two nuclear submarines to be moved to undisclosed strategic locations. The action was described as a response to what he termed "highly provocative statements" made by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council. Trump emphasized the importance of words and their potential for unintended consequences, expressing hope that the situation would not escalate. This move comes amid heightened tensions and Trump's increasing frustration with Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, for which he recently shortened a peace-or-sanctions deadline from 50 to 10 days.</p>

          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a key funder for public media outlets like NPR and PBS, has announced it will wind down its operations. This decision follows the elimination of its federal funding by the Trump administration and Congress, which included clawing back $1.1 billion in previously allocated funds. The private nonprofit has been a long-standing target of Republican criticism and employs about 100 people. The majority of staff positions will be terminated by the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 2025, with a small team remaining until January 2026 to manage the closure.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling over 500 points, as investors reacted to multiple economic pressures. A weaker-than-expected jobs report revealed that only 73,000 jobs were added in July, and previous months' figures were revised downward, indicating a hiring slowdown. Compounding market anxiety, the White House unveiled new high tariffs on over 60 countries, including key partners like Canada. These factors have increased investor expectations that the Federal Reserve may be prompted to cut interest rates in its upcoming September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has enacted steep new tariffs on Brazilian imports and sanctioned a Supreme Court justice, Alexandre de Moraes, under the Magnitsky Act for alleged human rights abuses. The U.S. cited Brazil's prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro and closer ties with China as justifications, though analysts suggest the moves are politically and ideologically motivated. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the actions as an unacceptable interference in the country's sovereignty. The measures have sparked nationalist sentiment in Brazil but also highlight internal divisions regarding the power of its Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report suggests that popular GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy, primarily used for diabetes and weight loss, may also offer relief for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Doctors have observed that patients taking these drugs experience significant reductions in inflammatory arthritis symptoms, with some even being able to stop their primary arthritis medications. The benefit is potentially linked to weight loss, as higher body mass is associated with a greater prevalence of RA. Experts note that fat cells produce inflammatory substances, and reducing them may calm the body's immune response.</p>

Since 2023, more than 27,000 layoffs have been directly attributed to AI, with the technology sector being the most affected. The trend is reshaping the labor market, with a notable 15% decline in entry-level corporate job listings over the past year. While AI's impact is growing, the report identifies federal spending cuts and economic uncertainty from trade tariffs as more immediate drivers of the overall increase in private-sector layoffs.

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated significant slowing as nonfarm payrolls grew by only 73,000 in July, falling short of forecasts and raising concerns about the economy's trajectory. Adding to the weak report, job totals for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000, indicating virtually no growth in those months. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, while wage growth remained modest. The slowdown, attributed partly to new tariff structures, has intensified pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider lowering interest rates, a move President Trump has aggressively advocated for.

According to the 1933 Montevideo Convention, statehood requires a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and the capacity for international relations. However, political dynamics, particularly within the UN Security Council, often play a more decisive role than legal criteria, as seen with states like Palestine and Kosovo, which have wide recognition but lack full UN membership. While UN membership provides significant benefits like sovereign integrity, its absence does not negate statehood but can expose a nation to isolation and conflict.</p>

The article contends that fixating on a playful ad is easier than confronting militarized xenophobia and policies driven by white supremacist conspiracy theories.

          <h2>Major Wildfires in Arizona and Utah Generate Dangerous 'Fire Clouds'</h2>

          <p>Two massive wildfires in the western U.S. have grown so intense they are creating their own weather systems, including dangerous "fire clouds." In Arizona, a mega-fire on the Grand Canyon's North Rim has charred over 164 square miles and is generating pyrocumulus clouds, which fuel the blaze with powerful winds. A separate large fire in Utah has produced a pyrocumulonimbus cloud, a fire-fueled thunderstorm that forced crews to retreat due to its erratic and dangerous downdrafts. Experts warn that these phenomena may become more common as climate change leads to longer, more intense fire seasons.</p>

          <h2>Southern California to Experience First Major Heatwave of the Summer</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a relatively mild July, Southern California is bracing for a significant heatwave next week, with temperatures expected to soar past 100 degrees in valley areas. A high-pressure system expanding from the southwest will replace the cooler Pacific Northwest system that has dominated the weather. Meteorologists forecast temperatures 5 to 10 degrees above normal, with Woodland Hills potentially reaching 107 degrees. While widespread strong winds are not anticipated, reducing immediate fire risk, experts caution that the heat will dry out vegetation, potentially creating dangerous conditions later in the fire season as fall winds approach.</p>

The Crew Dragon capsule, commanded by NASA's Zena Cardman, is expected to dock with the station after a 16-hour journey. The crew also includes NASA pilot Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. The mission marks a personal milestone for Cardman, who was bumped from a previous flight last year to accommodate the return of astronauts from a delayed Boeing Starliner mission.</p>

          <p>A new app called Balance is using artificial intelligence to help parents monitor their children's online activity and mental health. Developed by security company Aura, the tool analyzes a child's language patterns, tone, and late-night activity to detect anomalies that could signal stress or shifting moods, then sends reports to parents to facilitate dialogue. While critics argue that systemic change must come from tech companies and regulators, some parents in a clinical study found the app to be a useful tool for opening communication. The app's creator was motivated by his own daughter's mental health struggles linked to social media.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new global tariff framework has elicited varied reactions from businesses worldwide. While Mexico secured a 90-day reprieve, Canada was hit with a tariff increase from 25% to 35%. European leaders negotiated to keep most tariffs at 15%, but industries in Italy still anticipate significant harm. Brazil, initially expecting a 10% rate, was instead hit with a 50% tariff on many goods, while Switzerland was shocked by a 39% rate. The new trade landscape has created widespread uncertainty, with businesses scrambling to adapt to the steep duties on exports to the American market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paula Deen has announced the sudden and permanent closure of her iconic Savannah restaurant, The Lady & Sons, which she ran with her sons for nearly three decades. The eatery, known for its indulgent Southern buffet, was instrumental in launching her to Food Network stardom. Deen's statement did not provide a reason for shutting down the flagship location and a second Savannah eatery, The Chicken Box. Her four other restaurants outside of Georgia will remain open. The closure marks the end of an era for the 78-year-old chef, whose career has seen both massive success and significant controversy.</p>

          <p>Infertility advocates and patients are expressing frustration over the lack of action on President Trump's campaign promise to ensure IVF treatment is covered for all who need it. An executive order signed in February directed the administration to provide recommendations on making IVF more affordable by May, but that deadline has passed with no update from the White House. With out-of-pocket costs for a single IVF cycle ranging from $12,000 to $25,000, access remains a significant barrier for many. The issue has broad, bipartisan support, and those affected are waiting to see if the administration will follow through on its pledge.</p>

          <p>U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff made a visit to a controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) aid distribution site, a program backed by the U.S. and Israel. The visit's stated purpose was to assess the humanitarian situation for President Trump, but it has been criticized as a "media stunt" by some Gazans. The GHF sites have been the location of hundreds of reported deaths, which the UN attributes largely to Israeli forces, a claim Israel denies. The visit comes amid warnings of mass starvation from UN agencies and calls from human rights groups to suspend the militarized aid operation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2025 reboot of "The Naked Gun" successfully channels the spirit of the original films, with Liam Neeson stepping into the role of the stone-faced, bumbling detective. This review praises the film as a welcome return to out-and-out farce in a cinematic landscape dominated by action blockbusters. Neeson's established tough-guy persona is perfectly suited for the deadpan comedy, much like Leslie Nielsen's was in the original. Directed by Akiva Schaffer, the movie prioritizes a high joke-per-minute ratio over a coherent plot, providing a refreshingly silly and enjoyable experience that recaptures the joy of communal laughter in a theater.</p>

          <p>California is leading a coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit against the Trump administration's efforts to end gender-affirming care for minors. The suit challenges a presidential executive order that denounces such care as "mutilation" and has led to Justice Department subpoenas of doctors and clinics nationwide. The states argue the order is an unconstitutional overreach of federal authority intended to create a chilling effect on providers offering legal, life-saving healthcare. This legal battle is part of a broader conflict over transgender rights and states' rights to regulate medical care.</p>
