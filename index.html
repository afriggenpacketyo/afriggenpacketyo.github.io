          <p>A Japanese nutritionist living in the U.S. details her visit to a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, highlighting six categories of 'longevity foods' she wishes were more available in American stores. She was impressed by the incredible variety of traditional Japanese items, including diverse seaweeds, numerous soy-based products like tofu, and seasonal local produce. The article also notes the availability of healthy, ready-to-eat Japanese meals, traditional rice crackers, and a wide selection of green tea, all of which are staples in a diet associated with a long life.</p>

          <p>Palestinian hospital officials report that at least 42 people were killed overnight by Israeli airstrikes and gunfire, with many of the deaths occurring as people waited for aid trucks in northern Gaza. Witnesses claim Israeli tanks opened fire on a crowd that had gathered, while the Israeli military stated it fired warning shots in response to a threat and was unaware of casualties. The violence continues amid stalled ceasefire negotiations and dire warnings from the United Nations about the risk of famine, with aid delivery hampered by military restrictions and security issues.</p>

          <p>Sir David Nabarro, a distinguished physician and international public health advocate, has passed away at the age of 75. Known for his extensive work with the United Nations and the World Health Organization, he played crucial roles in coordinating responses to global health crises like the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2014 Ebola outbreak, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Nabarro was a strong proponent of vaccine equity and lamented the shift away from global cooperation in handling health emergencies, advocating for robust surveillance and detection systems over repeated lockdowns.</p>

          <p>Fighting between Thailand and Cambodia has entered its third day, resulting in at least 33 deaths and the displacement of over 168,000 people, as both nations trade accusations of initiating fresh attacks. The conflict, which escalated after a land mine incident, has expanded to new areas along their disputed border, prompting international calls for a ceasefire from the U.N. and ASEAN. Former U.S. President Trump stated he secured an agreement from both leaders to meet and negotiate, while human rights groups have raised concerns over the use of cluster munitions and the impact on civilians.</p>

          <p>An analysis by the BBC's Jeremy Bowen characterizes the plan to airdrop aid into Gaza as a desperate and largely ineffective measure that will not solve the growing hunger crisis. Drawing on past experiences in conflict zones like Iraqi Kurdistan and Bosnia, the article argues that airdrops are a crude last resort, delivering far less aid than truck convoys and posing significant risks, such as pallets killing civilians or landing in dangerous areas. The piece contends that with functional ports and land routes available, the focus on airdrops is a political gesture rather than a practical solution to the man-made starvation crisis.</p>

          <p>This political analysis suggests that Donald Trump is unable to effectively deflect the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case because it strikes at the core of his base's anti-establishment beliefs. The narrative of powerful people engaging in secret, corrupt acts is central to MAGA ideology, but now Trump himself appears to be protecting those same powerful interests. This dynamic, where the president is seen defending the very system he taught his followers to despise, explains why the issue has gained so much traction and why his usual tactics of denial and deflection are failing to quell the controversy.</p>

          <p>A woman was stopped at a TSA checkpoint in Miami International Airport after agents discovered she was hiding two turtles in her bra. The turtles were wrapped in gauze and plastic, and the woman's attempt to smuggle them onto a flight was thwarted during the security screening process. The TSA reported that one of the turtles unfortunately died, while the survivor was handed over to the Florida Department of Fish and Wildlife. The agency used the bizarre incident to remind travelers to follow proper procedures for transporting pets and not to hide animals on their bodies.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. study has detected the presence of PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," in nearly a third of tested reusable period products, including menstrual cups and underwear. These chemicals, which do not break down in the environment, are linked to serious health issues like cancer, fertility problems, and immune system effects. Researchers found that while some products had low levels likely from packaging, others contained high concentrations suggesting intentional use in manufacturing. The study aims to raise consumer and manufacturer awareness, as many comparable products on the market are made without these toxic substances.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was notably absent from the team's friendly match against AC Milan, a decision manager Arne Slot confirmed was due to ongoing transfer speculation. The club recently rejected a £58m bid from Bayern Munich for the Colombian player, whose future at Anfield now appears uncertain. Slot stated that while Diaz is training well, the decision was made not to play him because of the "rumours around him lately." The move comes as Liverpool has already signed two new forwards this summer and is reportedly pursuing another, signaling potential changes in their attacking lineup.</p>

          <p>The failure of a mass recall vote against 24 opposition KMT lawmakers is being framed as a significant political setback for Taiwanese President William Lai and his ruling DPP party. Analysts suggest the campaign, which aimed to oust lawmakers viewed as "pro-China," was a miscalculation that backfired, exposing public fatigue with blanket "anti-China" rhetoric. The result ensures that Lai's party will continue to lack a parliamentary majority, complicating his administration's agenda. Beijing has continued its military pressure on the island since Lai took office, viewing his administration as pro-independence.</p>

          <p>As the federal government alters student loan repayment options, more employers are offering reimbursement benefits as a workplace perk, a trend bolstered by recent legislation. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act made the tax-free status of employer contributions (up to $5,250 annually) permanent, removing a key barrier for companies considering such programs. This benefit is seen as a crucial tool for attracting and retaining talent, especially as millions of Americans grapple with significant student loan debt.

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise album "Swag" has produced an unexpected hit, "Daisies," which has risen to No. 2 on the Billboard charts and offers a potential "song of the summer." The album departs from his previous pop sound, embracing a more subtle, R&B-influenced style with aqueous, muffled production. This downtempo yet intricate sound seems to resonate with the current cultural mood, which favors reserved, simmering music over high-energy anthems. The article suggests this trend reflects a collective sense of malaise or a hangover from a more hedonistic period in pop culture.</p>
