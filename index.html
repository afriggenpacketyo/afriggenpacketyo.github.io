Despite the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, many adoptees still fall through the cracks due to age cutoffs and visa issues. Advocates are pushing for legislative changes to address this citizenship gap and provide relief to affected adoptees.</p>

            <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest level amid concerns about tariffs, inflation, and government spending. The survey reveals a decline in economic optimism among Americans, with increasing pessimism about the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, disapproval has risen significantly among Democrats, independents, and blue-collar workers. The survey highlights public discontent with tariffs and inflation, although immigration remains a strong point for the president.</p>

            <p>Scientists are claiming to have discovered a 'new colour' called "olo", said to be a saturated shade of blue-green, which cannot be seen by the naked eye without the help of stimulation. The findings, published in the journal Science Advances, have been described by the study's co-author, Prof Ren Ng from the University of California, as "remarkable". The research follows an experiment in which researchers in the US had laser pulses fired into their eyes. The experiment involved stimulating only M cones, "which in principle would send a colour signal to the brain that never occurs in natural vision", the paper said.</p>
