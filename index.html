            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, effective from 6 p.m. Saturday to midnight Sunday, citing humanitarian grounds. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the announcement as a manipulative tactic, pointing to ongoing Russian drone strikes. This ceasefire announcement follows previous failed attempts at Easter and Orthodox Christmas ceasefires and comes amid frustration from the Trump administration regarding the pace of peace talks. The article also mentions a recent prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, mediated by the United Arab Emirates, marking the largest exchange since the war began.</p>

            <p>A judge ruled that a former roommate of the murdered University of Idaho students can testify about seeing an intruder with "bushy eyebrows" around the time of the crime, despite defense arguments about the reliability of the testimony. Bryan Kohberger is charged with the murders, with investigators linking his DNA to evidence from the crime scene. The judge also ruled on the admissibility of Kohberger's medical diagnoses, stating they cannot be used to explain courtroom demeanor unless Kohberger testifies, as it could confuse the jury. The judge wants attorneys to bring up the matter outside of the presence of the jury.</p>

            <p>Larry Arnn, president of Hillsdale College, which does not accept federal funding, commented on Harvard University's situation after the Trump administration froze $2 billion in grants due to concerns over antisemitism on campus. Arnn suggested that Harvard should consider relinquishing federal funding altogether, as Hillsdale has done, to avoid government stipulations. He emphasized the importance of free speech within academic communities but condemned antisemitic behavior. Arnn drew parallels between Hillsdale's historical connections and Harvard's prestige, advocating for institutions to uphold their principles independently.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration is taking steps to make it easier to fire thousands of federal workers by stripping them of civil service protections. The proposed "Schedule Policy/Career" classification would affect approximately 50,000 federal employees, requiring them to advance the policy interests of the President. The new rule is not immediately reclassifying these workers and will require an executive order from Trump after the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issues a final rule.</p>

            <p>The article explores the shift in political support towards right-wing and far-right candidates, attributing it to a growing sense of financial security among certain voter groups. This security reduces risk aversion, leading to support for radical policies that prioritize individual wealth and freedom. This shift contrasts with the traditional social contract that tied the rich to the poor, leading to a new contract where the state protects the affluent while keeping the poor out of sight. The article suggests that age and education are key factors in voter alignment, with younger and better-educated individuals more likely to lean progressive.</p>

The brothers claim they feared their parents were going to kill them to cover up years of abuse, while prosecutors argue the brothers killed to obtain their inheritance.
