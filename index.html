          <h2>Tax Deductions on Charitable Donations Skewed Towards the Wealthy, Says Opinion Writer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 19:23:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Binyamin Appelbaum of the New York Times argues that the current charitable tax deduction system disproportionately benefits wealthy donors and the charities they support, such as museums and universities. He contends that this system incentivizes charities to cater to the rich, creating an uneven playing field. Appelbaum proposes reforms such as matching private donations or emulating Canada's tax credit system to ensure equal federal subsidies for all donors, regardless of income. This article challenges the current system where the wealthy receive larger tax breaks for their donations compared to lower-income individuals, advocating for a fairer approach to charitable giving.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the creation of a U.S. sovereign wealth fund, spearheaded by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, to manage assets and generate public revenue. The proposal has faced resistance within the White House, leading to debates over the fund's mechanics. Sovereign wealth funds typically invest revenue from natural resources, such as oil and gas, to provide financial stability and benefit future generations. While the administration remains committed to safeguarding America's national and economic security, the details of the fund and its potential uses are still under consideration.</p>

          <p>The Akron Zips football team will be barred from postseason play due to failing to meet the NCAA's minimum Academic Progress Rate (APR) score. The team's score of 914 falls short of the required 930, marking their first postseason ineligibility since 2014. The Zips have struggled in recent years, with their last bowl game appearance in 2017, which also marked their last winning season.

          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates, with analysts predicting further reductions later in the year.

The Monetary Policy Committee will be closely monitoring inflation and global economic uncertainty, including President Trump's tariff policy.

Libya's prime minister has stated that his country refuses to be a destination for migrant deportations. The U.S. State Department advises against travel to Libya due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released a preliminary report on the New Jersey helicopter crash that killed six people, confirming the aircraft was not equipped with video or data recording devices. The helicopter experienced a structural failure in the tail section, leading to a rapid descent into the Hudson River. The fuselage separated from the tail boom, and the main rotor blades detached from the fuselage. The flight was a sightseeing tour of New York City for a Spanish family, and the pilot was identified as Seankese “Sean” Johnson. The investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not lower tariffs on imports from China to facilitate trade talks, emphasizing that stopping fentanyl from entering America would be a key focus of the negotiations. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the U.S. would soon release a list of Chinese entities engaged in the fentanyl trade. These remarks were made shortly before Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to attend high-level trade talks with Chinese officials in Switzerland. The decision underscores the administration's firm stance on trade despite ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>The California State Bar's failed implementation of a new bar exam could cost the agency an additional $5.6 million, exacerbating its existing financial challenges. The agency expects to spend millions on free exams, in-person testing sites, and reverting to the traditional exam format. Lawmakers approved an independent review of the exam after widespread technical glitches and complaints from test takers. The State Bar faces embarrassment and scrutiny as it grapples with the fallout from the exam debacle, which critics attribute to rushed development and a lack of transparency.</p>

The plan involves sending immigrants to a country with a documented history of human rights abuses, conflicting governments, and exploitation of migrants. This action violates the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits sending individuals to places where they face persecution and danger.

The measure caps rent increases at 7% plus inflation or 10% — whichever is lower. The restrictions include single-family homes. The rent-increase cap for manufactured homes is 5%.</p>
