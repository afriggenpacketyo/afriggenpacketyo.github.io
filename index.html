          <h2>Trump Faces Ukraine Peace Deal Hurdles Amidst Russian Aggression</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 08:25:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As President Trump approaches his 100th day in office, he's pushing for a Ukraine peace deal, tasking envoy Steve Witkoff with negotiations in Moscow. However, intensified Russian attacks on Kyiv have prompted a rare rebuke from Trump to Putin. The proposed framework reportedly involves U.S. recognition of Russia's Crimea occupation, lifting sanctions, and Ukraine renouncing NATO ambitions, in exchange for security guarantees and territorial concessions. The deal's feasibility remains uncertain given Ukraine's reluctance to concede territory, and CNBC could not independently verify the terms of the framework.</p>

          <p>Karolina Zurawska, a mother suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, has been given an indefinite hospital order after admitting to the manslaughter of her six-year-old son, Alexander Zurawski, and the attempted murder of her father. The court heard that Zurawska believed she was being "instructed by a demonic force" at the time of the incident, which involved a hand saw. Judge Paul Thomas KC emphasized that the order was for medical help, not punishment, acknowledging Zurawska's deteriorated mental state under the weight of caring for her son. The incident occurred at the family home in Swansea, and police found Alexander with a significant neck injury.</p>

          <p>Amherst College, historically known for its diversity among elite liberal arts schools, is facing an identity crisis after a significant drop in Black student enrollment. In 2023, Black students comprised 11% of the student body, but the incoming freshman class saw that number plummet to just 3%. This decline has sparked concern and discussion within the Amherst community, with some students noting a change in the atmosphere and engagement within Black student gatherings. The college is now grappling with the implications of this shift and considering strategies to address the issue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly targeted the American scientific enterprise, leading to the resignation of Sethuraman Panchanathan from the National Science Foundation. Over 400 research awards were cut, and Congress is being pressured to halve the NSF's budget. Similar budget cuts or freezes have affected the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and NASA, resulting in the defunding or firing of thousands of researchers. This has caused confusion and concern, given science's role in disease containment, competition with China, and attracting skilled immigrants.</p>

          <p>The article warns of a potential return to stagflation, reminiscent of the 1970s, due to President Trump's economic policies. Trump's tariffs are likened to self-inflicted oil shocks, potentially leading to increased prices, shortages, and economic instability. The author criticizes Trump's interventionist approach, cautioning against capital controls and political interference with the Federal Reserve. The article concludes that the economic crisis could be long-lasting, requiring significant repairs by future administrations to restore trust and stability in the global trade system.</p>

          <p>A government survey revealed that potentially harmful PFAS chemicals have been detected at high levels in rivers and groundwater across 22 of Japan's 47 prefectures. The survey, conducted in fiscal 2023, found that PFAS levels exceeded the government's provisional cap in 242 locations. High PFAS levels are frequently detected near factories, U.S. military bases, and Japan Self-Defense Forces facilities. Authorities have taken measures such as switching water sources or restricting consumption in areas where polluted water had been used for drinking.</p>

          <p>Disabled people detained by ICE are sounding the alarm over overcrowded jails and inadequate healthcare. Rodney Taylor, a double amputee, is one such case, facing hardships like missed meals, pain, and ill-fitting prosthetics at Stewart detention center. The closure of federal oversight offices has worsened the situation, leaving detainees at greater risk. Experts warn of potential abuses and deaths due to the combination of overcrowding and reduced oversight.</p>

          <p>Apparel and textiles executives across the US are expressing concern over President Trump's tariffs, stating that they will likely hurt American consumers and businesses. While the tariffs are intended to boost domestic manufacturing, executives warn that they will lead to price increases and business failures. They also fear that other policies, such as immigration crackdowns and the dismantling of vocational training programs, will hinder the growth of the domestic apparel sector.</p>
