          <h2>UK Economy Shows Encouraging Growth, But Challenges Remain</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced a 0.7% growth in the first three months of the year, surpassing forecasts and signaling a potential turning point according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. This growth was largely driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment, but analysts caution that this rate may not be sustainable due to upcoming US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. While Reeves acknowledges the ongoing cost of living crisis, she remains optimistic about the UK's economic prospects. Some business leaders express concern over the rising costs of doing business and are hesitant to make expansion decisions amid economic uncertainty. Optimism surrounds the potential for falling interest rates to positively affect consumer spending.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that the UK is in discussions with several countries to establish overseas "return hubs" for asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected. These hubs would serve as processing centers for individuals awaiting deportation, differentiating the plan from the previous Rwanda scheme. While Starmer emphasized the importance of this innovation, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama stated his country is not involved in the talks, affirming loyalty to a similar agreement with Italy. The announcement has sparked criticism, with Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp calling the trip an embarrassment after Rama's denial of involvement.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changing economic conditions and policy uncertainty. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, even with inflation expectations largely aligned with the Fed's 2% target. He cautioned about the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks, which could pose challenges for the economy and central banks. While Powell did not directly mention President Trump's tariffs, he has previously noted their potential to slow growth and increase inflation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a high-interest rate environment, experts advise strategic borrowing from home equity using home equity loans or HELOCs, which typically offer lower interest rates than unsecured loans and credit cards. Key rules include shopping and comparing rates and terms from various lenders, understanding potential fees like origination or appraisal fees, and choosing the right repayment term. Experts recommend focusing on the intended use of funds to guide borrowing decisions, suggesting pausing if there is no clear need. Borrowing against your home should be approached thoughtfully to ensure it aligns with overall financial plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's EPA plans to weaken limits on some PFAS "forever chemicals" in drinking water, finalized last year, while maintaining standards for PFOA and PFOS. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be scrapped and reconsidered. The EPA will keep standards for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion but give utilities until 2031 to comply. Health advocates criticize the move, arguing it violates the Safe Water Drinking Act, while water utilities say treatment systems are expensive. The EPA's actions align with some arguments utilities made in their lawsuit, including that the agency lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress against the opioid crisis. The data, released by the CDC, shows deaths declined in all major categories of drug use and in most states. While public health experts are cautiously optimistic, they note that drug fatalities remain high, and proposed budget cuts to federal health programs could hinder further progress. The article highlights the need for continued investment in addiction treatment and support programs to sustain the positive trend.</p>

          <p>Taylor Carty, a woman with cerebral palsy, is advocating for more inclusive technical standards in medical schools after her acceptance to Wayne State University School of Medicine was rescinded due to her disability. Carty alleges that Wayne State violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by not providing reasonable accommodations for her to meet the school's technical standards. Experts say technical standards need to be more inclusive, and medical schools should focus more on what students know, and less on their physical abilities. The article highlights the need for greater representation of disabled physicians in the medical profession.</p>

Rising home prices and mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of reach, particularly in cities with restrictive zoning and permitting regulations.
