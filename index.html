          <p>The costs of broad-based tariffs on Chinese imports remain too high even with the tariff reduction deal between Washington and Beijing, according to the head of a soybean industry group. While the tariff reduction is a step in the right direction, US soybeans still face a duty into their largest export market nearly equal to the height of the 2018 trade war. US soybean farmers have searched for alternatives to the Chinese market, but it cannot be completely replaced.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old Michigan man is accused of planning a mass shooting at a U.S. military base on behalf of ISIS. The suspect allegedly provided armor-piercing ammunition and magazines for the planned attack, surveilled the base, and trained undercover officers on firearms and how to build Molotov cocktails.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is delaying the timeline for water utilities to comply with reducing certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water and reconsidering the allowable levels for others. The EPA is proposing to extend the compliance deadline to 2031 for two of the most common PFAS chemicals – PFOA and PFOS. And it's rescinding and reconsidering the limits for the other four listed in the initial regulation – PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS.</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new "Route Share" feature that will operate Uber shuttles along busy routes, offering pickups every 20 minutes. The service is available during weekday commuting hours and is half the cost of an UberX. Uber is also looking to partner with employers to make Route Share eligible for commuter benefits. This new service expands on an existing service that lets riders share cars with strangers in exchange for a lower fare.</p>
