          <p>A devastating explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Karachi, Pakistan, tragically killed at least four individuals and injured over 30 others. The powerful blast triggered a large fire that engulfed the warehouse and several adjacent shops, also causing significant damage to vehicles on Jinnah Road and shattering windows in surrounding buildings, sending pedestrians running for safety. Authorities are actively investigating the cause, with police reporting that raw materials for manufacturing fireworks, and potentially bombs, were illegally stored at the site, leading to the arrest of two warehouse owners. This tragedy underscores persistent infrastructure and safety challenges within Pakistan's financial capital, home to over 20 million residents, and echoes a similar deadly explosion earlier this year in the Punjab province.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has significantly lowered previously threatened tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union, capping them at 15% in a newly detailed trade deal. This decision alleviates earlier concerns stemming from Trump's threats of tariffs as high as 250% for the pharmaceutical sector. The agreement stipulates that the EU must first enact legislation to reduce its own tariffs on US industrial goods to zero before a reciprocal reduction applies to European motor vehicle exports. While the deal is hailed as a step towards stability in the world's largest trading partnership, sectors like wine and spirits remain disappointed, as they were not exempted from tariffs.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, facing intense pressure from President Donald Trump to cut interest rates. Despite Trump's repeated public attacks and calls for his resignation, Powell has maintained the Fed's independence, keeping rates unchanged for five consecutive meetings. Traders now anticipate a 73.5% chance of a rate cut in September, which would be the first in nine months. This address marks Powell's final keynote at the annual gathering before his term concludes next May, with speculation rising about potential successors as the administration continues to challenge the Fed's autonomy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed suppliers to halt production of its China-specific H20 general processing units following a Chinese government directive for local tech companies to cease purchases due to alleged security concerns. This development casts significant doubt on the chip's return to the lucrative Chinese market, despite Washington previously indicating it would issue export licenses for the H20s. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed ongoing discussions with Beijing regarding "backdoors" in the chips, asserting their non-existence and expressing surprise at the queries. The situation highlights Nvidia's ongoing challenges navigating complex trade uncertainties between the US and China, further reinforcing Beijing's commitment to its own chip self-sufficiency campaigns.</p>

This new order follows widespread protests from animal rights activists against the previous ruling, which called for the removal of 5,000 dogs from "high-risk areas" due to a surge in dog bite incidents, with nearly 2,000 reported daily in the capital. The court aims to frame a comprehensive nationwide policy, transferring all similar cases to its jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>Millions of people across the UK are bracing for substantial travel disruption this bank holiday weekend, contending with busy roads, a significant rail strike, and extensive engineering works. The RMT union strike will severely impact CrossCountry rail services from Aberdeen to Cornwall, leading to no services on Saturday and limited operations on Monday. The RAC anticipates Friday will be the busiest day for road travel, with three million getaway journeys planned and particularly heavy traffic expected on the M5. Despite the mostly dry weather forecast, travelers are strongly advised to check their journeys before setting off, as large crowds are expected at numerous festivals and events nationwide, marking the last long weekend before Christmas for many.</p>

While Erin is not forecast to make direct US landfall, it caused significant storm surge and life-threatening rip currents, leading to evacuations in the Outer Banks and swimming prohibitions at various beaches from Florida to New England.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate eased to 3.1% in July, marking its lowest level since March, though it surpassed economists' expectations of 3%. This cooling trend is primarily attributed to a significant deceleration in rice inflation, which dropped to 90.7% after two months of surging past 100% and dominating national headlines. Despite this moderation, the headline inflation figure remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 40th consecutive month, prompting some analysts to suggest the BOJ is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates. The central bank had recently upgraded its inflation forecasts, indicating sustained price pressures even as food inflation shows signs of easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese sportswear giant Li Ning experienced an 11% dip in interim profit, reporting 1.4 billion yuan ($191 million) for the first half of the year, attributed to fierce competition in mainland China's sportswear market. The Beijing-based company, which generates nearly 70% of its revenue from offline sales, closed 232 self-operated stores while opening 145 new ones in an effort to optimize its retail presence and improve operational efficiency. Despite a 2.5% increase in gross profit to 7.4 billion yuan, the gross profit margin declined by 0.4 percentage points to 50% due to adjustments in channel structure and heavier discounts amid intensifying direct-to-consumer competition. The company plans to continue its efforts to streamline its offline footprint in the face of market challenges.</p>

          <p>A Bangkok court has acquitted controversial billionaire and former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra of royal insult charges, which could have led to 15 years in jail. The charges stemmed from a 2015 interview where he allegedly defamed the monarchy, a crime under Thailand's strict lese majeste law, often criticized for targeting political opponents. The court ruled that the evidence was insufficient for conviction, interpreting the law literally since Thaksin had not named specific individuals. This verdict brings significant relief to the Shinawatra family, whose political movement has been a dominant force in Thai politics for decades, and comes as Thaksin's daughter, suspended PM Paetongtarn, faces her own legal challenges.</p>

Under the new rules, claimants who are abroad for more than eight weeks will generally no longer be eligible for the benefit, unless exceptional circumstances apply. A new specialist team will utilize travel data to track if claimants have left the UK and are no longer entitled to payments. A pilot program successfully stopped £17 million in incorrect payments from 2,600 people, and the expanded team of over 200 investigators will continue this effort, potentially extending scrutiny to other benefits claimed overseas.</p>

          <p>Nineteen aid workers from a dozen international organizations accuse their NGOs of "whitewashing" Israel's war in Gaza by restricting public language and minimizing Israel's role, fearing for their jobs. This self-censorship reportedly stems from a new Israeli registration process requiring sensitive data on Palestinian staff, which many organizations oppose due to security risks. Internal communications reveal leadership instructing "low visibility" and avoiding terms like "occupation" or "accountability." Critics argue this compromises advocacy and allows Israel to push out independent observers, with one worker stating, "If we can't talk about what survival looks like for people in Gaza, then we're painting a completely different reality."</p>

While the Menendez family expressed unwavering support for his release, the panel found he still posed an "unreasonable risk of danger to society."

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) as one of "the greatest companies in the history of humanity" during a visit to Taiwan, suggesting that buying its stock would be "very smart." Huang's comments come amidst reports of the US administration considering equity stakes in tech companies, particularly those receiving CHIPS Act funding like TSMC. He confirmed TSMC is producing six new products for Nvidia, including next-generation AI chip components. While the article also briefly mentions Nvidia's H20 chip production halt in China, the primary focus remains on TSMC's industry standing and its strategic importance in the global semiconductor landscape.

          <p>India and Russia have committed to expanding bilateral trade, signaling defiance against US tariff pressure stemming from India's significant Russian oil imports. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar emphasized their relationship as among the "steadiest," with plans to boost India's exports of pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and textiles to Russia. Bilateral trade reached a record $68.7 billion, largely driven by India's oil imports. Despite Western sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine war, New Delhi maintains its purchases were requested by the US to stabilize markets. This partnership underscores a complex geopolitical dynamic, as Trump's administration seeks leverage through tariff threats. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, have explicitly denied that recent price increases in the US are a direct result of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. This contradicts a Nikkei Asia report suggesting carmakers were passing tariff expenses to American consumers. Toyota clarified that its July price adjustments were standard annual increases reflecting operational costs, not tariffs, despite anticipating a significant financial impact from the duties. Honda similarly stated it avoids direct tariff pass-through due to its high percentage of US-made parts.

          <p>Chocolate lovers face continued price increases due to a lagged impact from soaring cocoa prices, which hit record highs amid adverse weather and supply tightness in West Africa. Cocoa futures have eased slightly this year but remain historically elevated, and this decline won't immediately translate to lower retail prices. Analysts predict higher prices for longer due to an ongoing market deficit and depleted cocoa bean availability, exacerbated by longstanding productivity challenges in major producing countries. However, the outlook appears sweeter by next Easter, as industrial demand softens and supply improves with new plantings reaching maturity, though prices are expected to remain structurally higher.

US District Judge Kathleen Williams cited violations of environmental laws and the risk of irreparable harm to the sensitive ecosystem, noting the state failed to explain why the facility needed to be in the Everglades. The order mandates the removal of temporary structures and a decline in detainee population within 60 days.

The high court lifted a lower court order that had required the NIH to restore hundreds of these grants, though the legal challenge from 16 states and research groups will continue. This decision enables the administration to pull back awards deemed misaligned with its policy objectives, which include ensuring federal funds do not support DEI or gender identity initiatives.

This unprecedented tribute confirms reports of North Korean troop deployments to support Russia's war effort, a move that brought the reclusive nation into a European conflict.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing a gas, linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil composition. This novel mechanism offers crucial insights into how planting density affects plant growth and defense, particularly against herbivores. Researchers from Zhejiang University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Leiden University, and the University of Bern conducted surveys in maize fields in Hainan, China, observing that densely planted inner rows suffered less herbivore damage but also exhibited reduced growth. Optimizing the release of this gas could potentially be harnessed to combat pests and increase crop yields, presenting a promising avenue for agricultural innovation and sustainable farming practices.</p>
