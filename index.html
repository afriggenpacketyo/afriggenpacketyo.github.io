          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly advised President Donald Trump to decline the offer of a $400 million jet from Qatar, expressing concerns about national security and Qatar's history of 'playing both sides.' Pence emphasized the potential for intelligence gathering and the need to ensure the president's safety. Trump has stated the plane would be formally donated to the U.S. Department of Defense and eventually transferred to his presidential library foundation, saving taxpayers money due to delays at Boeing. Pence suggests Qatar could instead invest the funds in U.S. military base infrastructure.</p>
