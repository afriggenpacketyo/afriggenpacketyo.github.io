          <p>A murder inquiry has been launched in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, after a man was found deceased. Police have arrested a 30-year-old man in connection with the death. Authorities suspect the incident may be linked to a separate, serious assault on a priest that occurred earlier the same day at St Patrick's Church. The priest was hospitalized with a serious head injury following what was described as a shocking and brutal attack.</p>

          <p>Former Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who served under President Trump, has strongly criticized the decision by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to halt approximately $500 million in mRNA vaccine research funding. Adams argued that the move undermines one of Trump's greatest achievements, Operation Warp Speed, and will cost lives by stifling medical advances against diseases like cancer, HIV, and COVID-19. He also condemned what he called Kennedy's "tepid response" to a recent shooting at the CDC, suggesting past rhetoric may have contributed to the violent climate.</p>

While the feat does not count as an official NFL record because it occurred in the preseason, it drew praise from teammates, including quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who called it an incredible weapon for the team. The current official NFL record is a 66-yard field goal set by Justin Tucker in 2021.</p>

The majority of arrests were for displaying placards supporting the banned organization, marking the largest number of arrests on a single day in the last decade. The government defended the ban based on security advice, while human rights groups like Amnesty International expressed deep concern over the use of broad anti-terrorism laws, viewing it as a threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>In a comedic essay, author David Sedaris reflects on the awkwardness and pressure of modern tipping practices, particularly with automated payment screens. He humorously recounts an experience at an airport breakfast spot where he was prompted to tip 22% for minimal service, contrasting it with the physical effort of carrying a heavy bag of cat litter for a friend. Sedaris wryly observes the internal conflict of feeling like a cheapskate versus questioning the justification for the tip, ultimately highlighting the absurdities of contemporary consumer etiquette.</p>

          <p>After decades of advocacy, newly released government records on President John F. Kennedy's assassination confirm the CIA had been monitoring Lee Harvey Oswald for years before 1963, but they do not provide a "smoking gun" to support conspiracy theories. Journalist Jefferson Morley, who has pursued the documents for 30 years, argues the files show the CIA hid the extent of its surveillance from the Warren Commission.

          <p>South Korean soccer star Son Heung-min made an impactful MLS debut for Los Angeles FC, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2-2 draw against the Chicago Fire. In the 77th minute, Son drew a crucial penalty that was converted by a teammate to secure the draw for his new team. After leaving Tottenham as one of their all-time top goalscorers, Son was warmly welcomed by fans in Chicago, a reception he noted was a pleasant change from the hostile crowds he often faced in the Premier League.</p>

          <p>As generative AI provides attackers with sophisticated tools, corporations are increasingly deploying defensive AI agents to bolster their cybersecurity operations. These autonomous agents can automate routine tasks like threat detection and analysis, freeing up human professionals to focus on more complex strategic work and helping to mitigate industry-wide burnout and talent shortages. While experts see this as an augmentation rather than a replacement of human workers, the adoption of AI is becoming essential for defenders to keep pace with the evolving, AI-powered threat landscape.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major European nations, including the UK, France, and Germany, has issued a joint statement affirming that peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine's involvement. The declaration comes ahead of a planned one-on-one meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, which currently excludes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. While the White House has indicated openness to including Zelensky, European leaders are stressing that any meaningful negotiations must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and that its current borders should be the starting point for talks.</p>

          <p>Companies including tech firm Palantir and private prison operators Geo Group and CoreCivic are reporting significant revenue growth, which they attribute to contracts supporting the Trump administration's expanded immigration enforcement. Palantir's government contracts surged, while prison companies noted detention facilities are fuller than ever, with executives signaling opportunities for "unprecedented growth." This financial success comes as Congress provides a massive cash influx to ICE for detention expansion, and as human rights groups continue to criticize conditions inside the facilities.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Explores Why Humans Are Hardwired for Negativity and How to Counteract It</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new podcast episode and newsletter from Vox explores the concept of "negativity bias," the evolutionary human tendency to focus on threats and bad news. This psychological quirk, combined with the media's watchdog nature, often obscures stories of genuine, quiet progress, such as falling murder rates or fewer deaths from extreme weather. The article argues that embracing "realistic optimism" is not naive but a necessary tool for resilience, as it fuels the belief that problems are solvable and inspires the action required to fix them.</p>
