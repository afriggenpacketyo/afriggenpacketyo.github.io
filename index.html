          <p>Senate Republicans are moving forward with a procedural change, known as the "nuclear option," to speed up the confirmation of President Trump's sub-Cabinet-level nominees. This decision comes after last-minute negotiations with Democrats to create a bipartisan deal for voting on nominees in batches fell apart. Democrats argued that Republicans were rushing the process, while the GOP expressed frustration over what they see as two years of obstruction. The new rule would allow for a simple majority vote to confirm groups of nominees, altering the Senate's long-standing confirmation process.</p>

          <p>David Ellison's Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing a takeover offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that would create a massive media and content conglomerate. The potential acquisition caused Warner Bros. Discovery's stock to surge by nearly 30%. A merger would combine major franchises like Paramount's "Star Trek" and "Mission Impossible" with WBD's "Harry Potter," DC superheroes, and "Game of Thrones." This consolidation would also significantly expand Paramount's sports media rights, adding WBD's NHL, MLB, and March Madness broadcasts to its portfolio, positioning it to compete more directly with Disney's ESPN.</p>

          <p>The U.S. inflation rate increased to 2.9% in August, up from 2.7% in July and moving further from the Federal Reserve's 2% target. This development may influence the central bank's upcoming decision on interest rates, with a cut still anticipated but its magnitude now in question. The article suggests that with rising inflation, gold can serve as a valuable hedge, as it tends to maintain its value and protect portfolios from the eroding purchasing power of the dollar. Financial experts typically advise that gold should constitute a limited portion of a diversified investment portfolio, generally between 5% and 10%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing the ride-hailing company of discriminating against passengers with disabilities in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The complaint alleges that Uber drivers frequently refuse service to individuals with service animals or stowable wheelchairs and sometimes impose improper surcharges. The DOJ also claims drivers have insulted or demeaned disabled riders. Uber has stated that it has a zero-tolerance policy for such discrimination and fundamentally disagrees with the allegations, while the federal government is seeking a jury trial, monetary damages, and a civil fine.</p>

          <p>The FBI has released images of a person of interest and is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The shooting occurred during an event at Utah Valley University, where Kirk was targeted by a single shot from a "high-powered bolt action rifle," which has since been recovered. Investigators believe the suspect, described as college-aged, fired from a nearby rooftop before fleeing.

          <p>Adobe's stock rose in after-hours trading after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The design software giant posted adjusted earnings of $5.31 per share on revenue of $5.99 billion, representing an 11% year-over-year increase. The company also provided a positive outlook for the fourth quarter, with forecasts for both earnings and revenue topping consensus estimates. This strong performance and optimistic guidance suggest robust growth, particularly in its digital media business, which is now expected to see higher annualized revenue growth than previously anticipated.</p>

His only appearance under new manager Ruben Amorim was in a Carabao Cup match, indicating he was not central to the team's immediate plans.</p>

          <p>A majority of Brazil's Supreme Court has convicted former President Jair Bolsonaro for attempting a coup and leading an armed criminal group following his 2022 election loss. The trial, which has deeply divided the nation, revealed evidence of plots to undermine the election and even assassinate his successor. While Bolsonaro's supporters view the trial as political persecution, his critics see it as a necessary step to uphold democracy and set a precedent against undermining electoral results. Although convicted, Bolsonaro is yet to be sentenced and may face a lengthy prison term, but the path to his incarceration could be complicated by appeals and potential amnesty legislation.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that many popular federal tax expenditures, such as the mortgage-interest deduction and education credits, are costly, distort economic decisions, and fail to achieve their stated goals. Citing a new study, the author contends that while some tax breaks like those for 401(k) retirement savings are cost-effective, others primarily benefit wealthier households or special interests without spurring the intended activity. The piece concludes that these ineffective tax breaks complicate the tax code and drain necessary revenue, especially given the rising national debt. The author suggests that eliminating wasteful expenditures would be a crucial step toward responsible fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>The recent downing of armed Russian drones over Poland by NATO jets has raised serious questions about the alliance's collective defense commitment, particularly given the lack of a strong condemnatory response from U.S. President Donald Trump. While European leaders labeled the incursion "unacceptable" and "reckless," Trump's only comment was a cryptic social media post. Analysts suggest the incident was a deliberate Russian probe designed to test NATO's resolve and deepen divisions between the U.S. and its European allies. The muted American reaction has fueled existing European anxieties about the reliability of the U.S. security guarantee under Article 5.</p>

          <p>New data from the Department of Labor shows that initial claims for unemployment benefits rose to 263,000 last week, marking the highest level in nearly four years. This significant jump is seen as one of the clearest signs yet that the U.S. job market is cooling and that layoffs are increasing. The slowing pace of hiring, combined with this rise in jobless claims, strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to implement an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. This labor market data arrives alongside a separate report showing consumer price inflation ticked up to 2.9% in August. (not investment advice)</p>

Six of the passengers, all of whom were identified as farmworkers and Mexican nationals residing in the Stockton area, died at the scene. Celerino is also facing a felony charge for driving under the influence causing injury, with his past convictions serving as an aggravating factor in the case.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak has found an unexpected hit with its new "Kodak Charmera," a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras that sold out shortly after its release. The small, functional cameras are marketed as fashion accessories and sold in "blind box" packaging, tapping into Gen Z's interest in vintage aesthetics and collectibles. This early success provides a bright spot for the struggling photography pioneer, which recently issued a warning about its ability to continue operations after posting significant financial losses. The high demand for the Charmera suggests Kodak has successfully tapped into a potent nostalgia-driven consumer trend.</p>

The messages were sent as Epstein faced charges for sex offenses. The government stated this new information about the "depth" of the relationship was not known at the time of Mandelson's appointment, though his friendship with Epstein was public knowledge. The sacking, which comes just a week before a state visit from President Trump, has prompted criticism from opposition parties and some Labour MPs over the initial appointment and vetting process.</p>

Trump expressed that he was "devastated" by the death of Kirk, whom he credited with helping him win the 2024 election and viewed as a potential future president. The president said his focus remains on winning and helping the country, which he believes is the path for Americans to "come together again."

          <p>California lawmakers are debating a bill that would ban the use of PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," in a range of consumer products including nonstick cookware, dental floss, and food packaging. The proposed legislation has created a conflict between environmental advocates, including actor Mark Ruffalo, and a coalition of celebrity chefs and cookware manufacturers. Supporters of the ban point to the significant health risks associated with PFAS exposure, while opponents argue that the specific type of PFAS used in nonstick coatings, PTFE (Teflon), is safe and has been approved by regulators. The debate centers on the potential for these chemicals to be released from pans into food.</p>

The Department of the Interior is currently reviewing five offshore wind projects already under construction, which Burgum claimed were approved through a "fast ideologically driven permitting process."

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, this analysis piece explores the rising tide of political violence in America and pushes back against calls for "war" from some commentators. The author recalls a conversation with a former Justice Department official who suggested that most Americans' desire for comfort and stability—the ability to "get strawberries in winter"—would prevent a full-scale civil conflict. While acknowledging the dangerous current cycle of violence, the article argues that the vast majority of citizens do not want widespread armed conflict. It concludes by urging leaders to de-escalate rhetoric and for citizens to reject political violence unequivocally.</p>

In exchange, the US has said it will relieve some sanctions on Belarusian airline Belavia, allowing it to buy parts for its airlines.

Polish and other European leaders have condemned the incident as a deliberate Russian provocation intended to test NATO's defenses. In response to the heightened threat, Poland is implementing air traffic restrictions along its eastern border, and Ukraine has offered to share its expertise in fending off Russian aerial attacks.</p>
