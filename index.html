          <p>London's Royal Albert Hall is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that the event has been held outside Japan. The competition features over 40 professional wrestlers, known as Rikishi, and required significant logistical efforts, including shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. Organizers have worked to respect the deep cultural and religious Shinto traditions of sumo while making the competition accessible to a Western audience through English commentary and video replays. The five-day tournament highlights the sport's global reach, featuring competitors from various countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polling indicates that while Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani maintains a double-digit lead in the New York City mayoral race, his advantage has shrunk. Independent candidate and former Governor Andrew Cuomo has gained ground, largely absorbing support from former Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped out of the race. A Quinnipiac University survey places Mamdani at 46% among likely voters, with Cuomo at 33% and Republican Curtis Sliwa at 15%. Despite the tightening race, the poll also shows Mamdani's supporters are significantly more enthusiastic than those backing his rivals, setting the stage for a competitive final stretch before the election.</p>

          <p>Beijing has pushed back against Washington's claims that its export controls on rare earth minerals are a hostile act, stating the measures are not intended to disrupt global supply chains. A Ministry of Commerce spokesperson accused the U.S. of exaggerating China's intent and causing "unnecessary panic." The Chinese government clarified that it approves compliant export applications and is working to expedite the review process. This statement comes amid escalating trade tensions, with Beijing framing its policy as a response to U.S. restrictions on semiconductor trade and attempts at "global suppression of China."</p>

          <p>Despite some positive economic indicators like a strong stock market, a majority of Americans express pessimism about the economy, a sentiment that transcends partisan lines. A recent survey shows 53% of Americans believe the economy is worsening, with significant pessimism also found among key Trump demographics like rural voters. This widespread gloom is attributed to factors beyond headline numbers, including weak business investment outside of big tech, the tangible impacts of trade tariffs, and persistent inflation affecting the cost of living. The president's own rhetoric, often focused on division and crisis, may also be contributing to the negative public mood. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During oral arguments for Louisiana v Callais, the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority seemed prepared to strike down Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This section is the last major provision of the landmark civil rights law, prohibiting racially discriminatory voting practices like gerrymandering. The case stems from Louisiana's congressional maps, which federal courts found diluted the power of Black voters. A ruling against Section 2 would effectively nullify the act, a process the Roberts court began with its 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision, and could significantly impact minority voting power across the country.</p>

However, creating these separate online experiences faces significant hurdles, particularly the difficulty of effective age verification, which raises privacy, security, and free speech concerns. While safer feeds for children are a positive step, the article suggests the challenge of policing an infinite content landscape remains immense.</p>

Many, including nearly 2,000 prisoners released from Israeli detention as part of the deal, are now homeless and living in tents. The widespread devastation, with a UN assessment showing 83% of structures in Gaza City are damaged, has turned reunions into bittersweet moments of joy and sorrow. The human cost is immense, with returning residents describing scenes of utter destruction and grappling with the loss of their former lives.</p>

          <p>Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama has appointed a virtual artificial intelligence entity named "Diella" as a cabinet minister, a world first. Originally a digital assistant on a government portal, Diella's promotion is intended to usher in an era of transparency and incorruptibility in public administration. However, the move has raised significant legal and ethical questions, as Albania's constitution requires ministers to be natural persons capable of bearing political responsibility. Critics argue the AI minister has no legal basis and may serve as a political distraction, while concerns remain about the lack of transparency regarding its code, data, and human oversight.</p>

          <p>An emergency room doctor with 35 years of experience argues that impending federal budget cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act subsidies will have catastrophic consequences for the U.S. healthcare system. With an estimated 33 million people set to lose their health coverage, emergency rooms, already operating under siege, will become the primary care provider for a massive influx of uninsured patients. This will lead to delayed diagnoses, sicker patients with more advanced conditions, and overwhelmed hospital systems. The article contends that this cost-shifting from federal to local levels is a delusional financial strategy that will ultimately increase costs and decrease access for everyone.</p>

          <p>A former Catholic priest in New Orleans, Mark Francis Ford, has been arrested on charges that he systematically abused a disabled boy for a decade. Police allege that Ford positioned himself as a mentor to the boy, who was grieving two family deaths, through a church program for disabled youth that Ford co-founded. He then allegedly used this access to sexually assault the boy, who has a degenerative spinal condition and is on the autism spectrum. The case is the latest development in the long-running clergy abuse scandal within the New Orleans archdiocese, which is currently in bankruptcy proceedings over hundreds of similar claims.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles school board has voted 4-3 to deny a renewal for Gabriella Charter School, a popular school specializing in dance, effectively forcing its closure at the end of the school year. The decision was driven by a desire to provide more space for the district-operated Logan Academy, which shares the same Echo Park campus and is expanding its own programs. The move tests the limits of state laws that protect charter schools' access to public facilities and highlights the anti-charter stance of the board's majority. Gabriella Charter School is now considering its legal options to fight the decision.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat have collapsed to under $1 after the company announced a debt-reduction deal that involves issuing up to 326 million new shares. This stock-diluting move was prompted by a significant decline in sales, as consumer tastes have shifted back toward animal meats. Once an investor favorite with shares peaking near $235, the company has struggled with profitability and competition, with sales dropping from a high of $465 million in 2021. The company is now focused on reducing expenses and introducing new products to counter consumer perceptions of its foods as overly processed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill designed to accelerate the study of psychedelic drugs for treating PTSD, depression, and other mental health conditions, a move strongly backed by veterans' advocacy groups. The new law, AB 1103, streamlines the approval process within California for studies on Schedule 1 drugs like ibogaine and psilocybin that have already received FDA approval. This aims to remove bureaucratic delays from the state's Research Advisory Panel, which has previously held up research. Proponents, including former Navy SEALs, argue that these therapies show immense promise for veterans struggling with trauma where conventional treatments have failed.</p>

The drill also serves as a reminder for residents to secure their homes by strapping down furniture and water heaters, and to consider seismic retrofits for older buildings.

          <p>Investigators have revealed how they identified the suspects in what is believed to be the largest jewelry heist in U.S. history. The thieves, who stole up to $100 million in jewels from a Brink's big rig in 2022, were tracked using cell tower data from burner phones used during the operation. A critical mistake was made when one suspect gave his burner phone number to police after witnessing an unrelated traffic collision the night before the heist. This, combined with pings along the truck's route, allowed authorities to connect the suspects to the crime, leading to the indictment of seven men from the Los Angeles area.</p>

          <p>President Trump's frequent mentions of the Insurrection Act have drawn attention to the 200-year-old law, which grants a president extraordinary power to deploy active-duty military for domestic law enforcement. While historically used in moments of extreme crisis, such as by Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War or Dwight D. Eisenhower to enforce desegregation, it has also been used to suppress labor strikes and protests. Legal experts note the act is broadly worded and provides almost untrammeled power with little room for judicial review, raising concerns that it could be invoked to quell political opposition, representing a "break-the-glass moment" for American democracy.</p>
