          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority has banned an ad for Trip drinks, ruling it made unauthorized health claims about its ability to induce calm and reduce stress. The watchdog found that language like "crafted for calm" was prohibited and that claims about magnesium's effect on cortisol were unsubstantiated. The company was also cited for an inaccurate "0g added sugar" claim and has been ordered not to run the ad again in its current form.</p>

          <p>Crypto markets experienced a rebound as investor optimism grew for the potential passage of key U.S. crypto legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins. Despite a temporary dip after the House failed to advance the bills, analysts view their passage as a matter of "when," not "if." President Trump also indicated that some Republican opponents have shifted their stance, boosting confidence in the sector's regulatory future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, one of the last living survivors of the Auschwitz concentration camp, is celebrating her 100th birthday. Known as the "Cellist of Auschwitz," her musical ability saved her life, and she has since dedicated decades to speaking out against antisemitism and racism. Despite her long-standing commitment to education, the article notes her recent feelings of despair over rising global antisemitism and the sense that her efforts have not been enough to combat hatred.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased to a 2.7% annual rate in June, marking its highest level since February and indicating a gradual rise in inflation. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.3%, driven by increases in energy, food, and housing costs, with some analysts attributing part of the rise to the impact of tariffs. Despite the uptick, the data was largely in line with forecasts, and markets do not expect it to prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As gold investing surges in popularity, consumers now have the option to buy physical gold from retailers like Costco or from traditional gold investment companies. Buying from Costco offers convenience and a high level of trust, often with a lower markup, but comes with downsides like limited selection, purchase limits, and a no-return policy. In contrast, specialized dealers provide more variety, investment strategy support, and buyback options, but may involve higher markups and require more due diligence to avoid fraud.

          <p>With interest rates potentially declining, savers are considering the best place to store their cash, often choosing between certificates of deposit (CDs) and money market accounts. Experts suggest CDs are ideal for goals with a fixed timeline, as they lock in a specific interest rate, protecting against future rate drops, but penalize early withdrawals. Money market accounts offer more liquidity, making them suitable for emergency funds, but their variable rates will fall if the Federal Reserve lowers its benchmark rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Professional cycling teams in the 2025 Tour de France are widely adopting heat training to boost performance, a technique that involves deliberately raising an athlete's core body temperature. Sports scientists explain that this stressor can increase blood volume and stimulate red blood cell formation, similar to altitude training, but is often more effective and accessible. This method, which can be done actively by wearing heavy clothes or passively in a sauna, is becoming a key part of preparation for elite athletes.</p>
