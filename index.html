          <p>A patient at a children's hospital in South Carolina has died from primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rare and devastating brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba. Hospital officials confirmed the death but did not release further details about the patient. This type of infection, which has a fatality rate of over 97%, typically occurs when contaminated warm freshwater enters the nose during recreational activities. Health experts advise holding one's nose or using nose clips when in such waters to reduce risk, as the infection cannot be spread by swallowing water or from person to person.</p>

          <p>Details of a major trade agreement between the United States and Japan have been thrown into confusion after a photo revealed handwritten alterations on a card displayed on President Trump's desk. The card showed a crossed-out investment figure and tariff rates that seemed to conflict with the president's own announcements on social media. This discrepancy has left Wall Street analysts and officials questioning the final terms of the deal, including the exact tariff percentage and the total investment amount from Japan. The White House has not clarified the inconsistencies, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the significant economic pact.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have collaborated to allow institutional clients to purchase tokenized money market funds, a move set to innovate the $7.1 trillion industry. This new system records ownership on a blockchain, aiming to provide faster settlements, 24/7 trading, and increased efficiency for major fund companies like BlackRock and Fidelity. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds offer a yield, making them an attractive option for corporate cash management. The initiative is seen as a foundational step toward a more integrated digital financial ecosystem where such assets could be used as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new program in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit that will allow women passengers to request female drivers and opt to share rides with other women. The feature, called "women drivers," is designed to address safety and comfort preferences expressed by female users. While the company acknowledges that wait times may be longer due to the smaller number of female drivers, it hopes the pilot will provide valuable insights. The program also allows women drivers to set a preference for female riders, expanding on a similar feature already successful in 40 other countries.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued a landmark advisory opinion stating that a "clean, healthy and sustainable environment" is a human right. The ruling, prompted by a campaign from Pacific Island nations, asserts that countries have a legal obligation to protect the climate for present and future generations. The UN's top court emphasized that states must cooperate to prevent climate harm and pursue the highest possible ambition in their national climate targets. While not legally binding, this opinion carries significant moral authority and could influence future climate negotiations and litigation against high-emitting nations.</p>

          <p>Two former London traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for interest rate-rigging overturned by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled that the jury directions in their original trials were incorrect, rendering the convictions unsafe. Both men had argued that their actions, while aimed at manipulating Libor and Euribor rates, were common practice and known to their superiors, making them scapegoats for a wider industry issue. The ruling may open the door for other convicted traders to appeal and has prompted calls for a public inquiry into the prosecutions.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which limits the independence of the country's key anti-corruption agencies, has sparked significant backlash. The legislation grants the presidentially-appointed prosecutor general control over the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap). This move triggered the first major anti-government protests since the 2022 invasion, with thousands demonstrating in Kyiv and other cities.

          <p>U.S. Representative Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, choosing instead to seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler, a Republican, stated that his decision was based on the critical importance of his district in determining control of the House of Representatives. His seat is considered a key battleground, and his focus will be on helping Republicans maintain their narrow majority. The decision removes a potential challenger to incumbent Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul and may reshape the field of Republican contenders for the state's top office.</p>

          <p>A vascular surgeon from Cornwall, UK, has been charged with fraud for allegedly making a false insurance claim stating that injuries to his legs were the result of sepsis, not self-inflicted. The surgeon, Neil Hopper, who had both of his legs amputated, faces two counts of fraud. He is also charged with encouraging grievous bodily harm by purchasing videos from a website known as "The Eunuch Maker" that depicted limb removal. The hospital where he was employed has suspended him and stated the charges do not relate to his professional conduct with patients.</p>

          <p>A haunting 1975 photograph by Stanley Forman, which captured a woman and child falling from a collapsed fire escape, served as a catalyst for major safety reforms in Boston. The image, which won a Pulitzer Prize, depicted the death of 19-year-old Diana Bryant, though her 2-year-old goddaughter survived the fall. The shocking photo raised public awareness about the dangers of neglected fire escapes and directly led the city to enact a new code. This regulation, which is still in effect, requires all fire escapes to be certified as safe every five years, a change that had a ripple effect on safety standards nationwide.</p>

          <p>Australian rugby wing Harry Potter has dismissed claims that the national team has a "losing mentality" following criticism from prominent figures like Sir Clive Woodward. The critique came after Australia's captain kicked the ball out to end the first Test match against the British and Irish Lions while trailing. Potter defended the team, calling the suggestion "ridiculous" and asserting that every player was focused on winning. With the series on the line, he acknowledged the team needed to improve and start stronger in the upcoming second Test in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>President Trump's public pressure on the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates could have the opposite of its intended effect, according to economic analysis. Forcing the central bank to lower its key rate could spook investors, who might anticipate higher inflation and a loss of the Fed's political independence. This could lead them to demand higher returns on long-term U.S. government bonds, which serve as a benchmark for consumer loans. Consequently, interest rates for mortgages, car loans, and other borrowing could rise, undermining the administration's goal of making credit cheaper for consumers and businesses.

This innovation allows designers to optimize a vast number of variables simultaneously without a massive increase in computing power. To illustrate its potential, the scientists used the platform to hypothetically solve the complex design trade-offs between stealth, aerodynamics, and propulsion that led to the cancellation of the U.S. Navy's advanced X-47B stealth drone program.

          <p>The Elysia chlorotica, a small sea slug, exhibits a remarkable biological ability that blurs the line between plant and animal. After consuming a specific type of algae, the slug steals the algae's chloroplasts and incorporates them into its own body, allowing it to generate food from sunlight through photosynthesis. This phenomenon, known as kleptoplasty, is a profound example of symbiosis and challenges traditional evolutionary theory, which often focuses on gradual mutation rather than the transfer of entire biological systems between species. The slug's unique trait offers insights into how organisms can be fundamentally reshaped by their environment.</p>

However, questions remain about the broader economic impact, as the costs of these tariffs are likely to be passed on to U.S. consumers through higher prices for imported goods.
