          <h2>IMF Downgrades U.S. Growth Forecast for 2025 Due to Trade Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund has significantly lowered its U.S. growth forecast for 2025 to 1.8% from 2.7%, citing the negative impact of President Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from trading partners. The IMF anticipates that these tariffs will act as a major headwind for both the U.S. and global economies, increasing the likelihood of a U.S. recession to 40%. This revision reflects a substantial shift in economic outlook, prompting the IMF to compress its production cycle to quickly adapt to the evolving trade landscape. The IMF also adjusted its global growth forecast downward to 2.8% and raised its inflation expectations for advanced economies to 2.5%, with the U.S. inflation outlook increasing to 3%.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University by revoking federal research funding and threatening further actions, including revoking the university's nonprofit status. This move is part of a broader strategy advocated by right-wing activists to weaken institutions deemed enemies of the president, aiming to force them to align with conservative viewpoints. Harvard is resisting these demands, leading to a lawsuit against the administration, but the long-term implications for the relationship between universities and the federal government are concerning. The attacks are impacting scientific and medical research, with funding for studies on diseases like tuberculosis and cancer being clawed back, and experts worry that this will ultimately damage US scientific and medical expertise.</p>

          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that the remains of Army Cpl. Albert J. Estrada, a 17-year-old soldier who went missing during the Korean War, have been accounted for after 75 years. Estrada was part of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in November and December 1950, one of the war's most brutal engagements, where thousands of U.N. soldiers faced overwhelming Chinese and North Korean forces. His remains were among those recovered and later identified through ongoing efforts by the DPAA.

          <p>Stock futures are showing signs of recovery after a sharp sell-off triggered by President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a significant drop amid investor uncertainty about tariffs and Powell's position. Analysts suggest that a potential US-India trade deal and support for Fed independence from key Republicans are contributing to the market's rebound. However, Trump's trade war continues to impact global markets, with mixed trading in Asia and Europe, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track for its worst April since 1932.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have soared, reaching a record high of over $3,500 an ounce, as President Trump's repeated threats against the Federal Reserve's independence shake investor confidence.

GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp discussed the U.S. aerospace sector's trade surplus with Trump, advocating for consideration of the industry's strength under the tariff-free regime.

The ruling also specifies that individuals born male but identifying as women do not have the right to use spaces or services designated for women-only.

          <p>This article celebrates the 250th anniversary of William Turner, one of the greatest Romantic painters, known for capturing the grandeur of nature and the power of machines on canvas. Turner mastered the interplay of light, color, and atmosphere, drawing inspiration from travels across Europe, particularly the Rhine and Venice. His artistic style evolved, becoming increasingly abstract and mystical, influencing later Impressionists. Today, Turner is considered a pioneer of modernism and a forerunner of abstract art.</p>

This initiative aims to provide researchers with comprehensive patient data to study autism, linking medication records, lab testing data, and information from wearables. A new disease registry will also track Americans with autism. The NIH assures that data will be protected and researchers will not be able to download it, though advocacy groups have criticized Kennedy for describing autism as preventable.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly downgraded its outlook for the U.S. and global economies, citing the negative impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs and the resulting uncertainty. The IMF now projects global growth at 2.8% for this year and U.S. economic growth at just 1.8%. The IMF's chief economist noted that the global economic system is being reset due to heightened uncertainty surrounding import taxes. The forecasts align with many private-sector economists' expectations, with some fearing a recession is increasingly likely.</p>
