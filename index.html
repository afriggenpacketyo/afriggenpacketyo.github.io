          <p>Congressional Democrats have released new files concerning Jeffrey Epstein, naming prominent figures such as billionaire Elon Musk and Prince Andrew. The documents, including flight logs and schedules, indicate Musk was invited to Epstein's island and Prince Andrew flew with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2000. While no criminal awareness is suggested for those named, these revelations are part of a broader push to achieve justice for Epstein's victims. The ongoing investigation underscores the extensive network of powerful individuals connected to the late financier.</p>

          <p>Austin police have identified Robert Eugene Brashers as the suspect in the 1991 murders of four teenage girls at a yogurt shop, a cold case that has haunted the city for decades. DNA evidence linked Brashers, who died by suicide in 1999, to the crime, as well as to multiple sexual assault and murder cases in other states. This development comes after two men were wrongly convicted and later exonerated, offering a crucial step towards closure for the victims' families in this infamous case. The police statement affirmed their continuous work on the investigation.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired up to 20 agents who kneeled during a civil rights protest in Washington, D.C., following George Floyd's death in 2020. Sources indicate the agents kneeled as a de-escalation tactic when outnumbered by protesters, and an internal review previously found it was not a political statement. The FBI Agents Association condemned the terminations, calling them a "dangerous new pattern of actions" by Director Kash Patel that could weaken the Bureau and hinder recruitment. This move raises concerns about leadership trust and expertise retention.</p>

          <p>A potential federal government shutdown looms as Congress has four days to agree on funding, threatening to leave hundreds of thousands of federal employees without pay and halt key economic data releases. Republicans seek a "clean" resolution, while Democrats demand health-care protections, leading to a political stalemate. President Trump has intensified brinksmanship, and his administration warned of mass firings. A shutdown would impact numerous services, from national parks to health inspections, and could delay crucial economic reports like the jobs and CPI data.</p>

          <p>Shane Tamura, the gunman responsible for July's deadly Midtown Manhattan shooting, was found to have low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), according to the New York Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes referencing CTE and targeting NFL offices, blaming the league for concealing brain injury dangers. While experts like Chris Nowinski caution against directly attributing violence to CTE, this finding highlights the disease's potential impact on judgment and behavior, urging greater awareness for preventing brain trauma in young athletes.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the deployment of Justice Department agents to guard Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities and directed counterterrorism task forces to investigate attacks against federal authorities. This action follows a deadly shooting at an ICE office in Dallas and an increase in incidents targeting ICE agents amid the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement. Bondi stated the DOJ would seek the most serious charges, including terrorism offenses, against those involved in what she described as "criminal mobs." This signals a significant escalation in federal response to anti-ICE protests.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto rapidly strengthened into a Category 4 major hurricane over the Atlantic, though no immediate watches or warnings were issued for the U.S. by the National Hurricane Center. The storm, the eighth named system of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is currently located northeast of the Leeward Islands and is moving west with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph. Forecasters are also monitoring a second developing storm system in the northeast Caribbean, which could become a tropical depression and potentially impact parts of the Southeast U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a Category 4 storm, is swirling in the Atlantic, with forecasts predicting it will not make landfall. However, there's a possibility it could interact with a second developing system, potentially leading to a rare meteorological phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. This occurs when two storms merge or orbit each other. While the developing system is much weaker, a collision could slightly alter their predicted paths. This scientific interaction highlights the complex dynamics of hurricane season and the ongoing monitoring by the National Hurricane Center.</p>

Liberal justices dissented, arguing the decision conflicts with the constitutional separation of powers, which grants Congress authority over spending.

          <p>Three women—Ashleigh Brown, Cynthia Raygoza, and Sandra Carmona Samane—have been indicted on charges of illegally "doxing" a U.S. Customs and Immigration agent in Los Angeles. Prosecutors allege the women followed an ICE agent to their home, live-streamed the event, and shouted anti-ICE slogans. Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli stated that threatening or doxing federal agents would result in prosecution and prison time. This marks the first prosecution related to such tactics, amidst ongoing protests against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement and concerns from federal officials about agent safety.</p>

          <p>U.S. immigration agents have arrested Ian Andre Roberts, the superintendent of Iowa's largest school district, on a fugitive warrant, accusing him of overstaying his student visa and facing a firearms offense. Roberts, a Guyanese citizen, allegedly fled police in a school district vehicle and was found with a loaded handgun and cash. ICE states his work permit expired in 2020 and he had a prior weapons charge and a federal deportation order from 2024. School officials expressed shock, calling Roberts an integral part of the community, while ICE emphasized removing public safety threats.</p>

          <p>The cause and manner of death for Travis Decker, accused of killing his three young daughters in Washington state, "may never be known," according to the Chelan County Coroner. Decker, a former Army soldier with survival skills, was the sole suspect in the May suffocation deaths of his daughters, aged 5, 8, and 9. After a monthslong manhunt, human remains confirmed to be Decker's were found, but only minimal skeletal remains were recovered. The lack of an autopsy due to the advanced state of decomposition means key questions about his death will remain unanswered.</p>

          <p>King Charles' long-held urban planning philosophies, once criticized, are now influencing the UK government's upcoming announcement of 12 new towns. The housing ministry's head of placemaking revealed plans for walkable, environmentally friendly developments featuring "gentle density" like terraced housing, rather than high-rises. TV architect George Clarke notes the King's traditional building styles and emphasis on community spaces have become mainstream, contrasting with past "ego-driven" modern designs. These new towns aim to correct past mistakes of car-centric layouts and lack of public amenities, fostering a stronger sense of community.</p>

          <p>Three individuals with no social media presence—a potter, a historian, and a theatre performer—undertook an experiment to become influencers, revealing the challenges of the creator economy. Emily, a stroke survivor, found purpose in pottery but struggled with authenticity and comment engagement. Alun, a historian, faced frustration over low views and cruel comments about his alopecia, eventually finding academic amplification. Danyah, the performer, became overwhelmed by the "addiction" of content creation. The experiment highlights the emotional toll, the struggle for authenticity, and the potential, albeit often elusive, rewards of chasing online fame.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced new tariffs effective October 1, including a 100% tariff on patented pharmaceutical drugs (exempting U.S. manufacturers), and 30-50% tariffs on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and heavy trucks. These measures aim to protect domestic industries and address alleged unfair foreign competition. While some experts predict a modest impact on pharma due to generic exemptions and U.S. production, higher costs for home furnishings could affect homebuyers. The tariffs follow a period where they defied inflation predictions, but recent economic data indicates they are now driving prices upward. (not investment advice)</p>

Ahead of the Labour Party Conference, Starmer's stance reflects a broader concern among left-wing leaders about populist movements. He acknowledges Labour's past failure to address concerns about illegal immigration, aiming to present a tough image on the issue. Starmer is also pushing for a digital ID plan, believing public willingness for state-mandated ID has shifted, despite significant opposition.

          <p>Southern California experienced thousands of lightning strikes over two days, primarily offshore, as a weak low-pressure system brought thunderstorms and the potential for more rain over the weekend. The National Weather Service reported over 2,000 strikes across the region, with the Bay Area seeing over 13,000 total strikes, mostly in-cloud. While most lightning occurred during wet conditions, reducing fire risk, isolated showers and heavy downpours are possible, particularly over burn scars. Cooler temperatures are also expected early next week as a large trough moves through the West Coast.</p>

          <p>An article fact-checks claims of a "true car market crash," analyzing whether dealerships are overfilled with unsold cars and if 0-2% finance deals signal declining sales. Data shows premier brands' cars sit on lots for over 110 days, and sales are down compared to 2017-19, partially supporting the claim. While some companies offer low-interest financing, it's more common for EVs, and general rates are higher than during COVID-19.
