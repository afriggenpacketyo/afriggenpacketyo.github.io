The automaker reported adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share on $48.59 billion in revenue, outperforming analysts' forecasts. Citing strong performance and a reduced impact from tariffs, GM updated its full-year outlook, now expecting adjusted earnings between $12 billion and $13 billion. However, the company acknowledged challenges in its electric vehicle division, noting that only about 40% of its EVs are currently profitable on a production basis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham United's Premier League struggles continue, with a recent defeat to Brentford leaving the team in the relegation zone and extending their winless streak to five games. The club has secured only one victory this season, prompting fans to express deep concern, with some labeling the team as "relegation candidates." The poor performance on the pitch is compounded by off-field issues, including fan boycotts and protests against the club's ownership. The team's current start is one of its worst in top-flight history, increasing pressure on new manager Nuno Espirito Santo.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, overturning a lower court's order that had blocked the move. The Justice Department argued the deployment is necessary to manage ongoing protests, which have sometimes turned violent. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the administration's request, calling the 60-day deployment plan a "measured response." However, a second, broader restraining order from the lower court remains in place, creating uncertainty about when troops might actually be deployed, as legal challenges continue.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Sydney-based Lowy Institute suggests the formation of a "Pacific Eyes" intelligence-sharing alliance to counter China's growing security presence in the Pacific Islands. The proposed body would help address institutional weaknesses in the region that external powers, particularly Beijing, could exploit. The study highlights the area's increasing geopolitical competition and warns of China's "unprecedented security inroads" in recent years. The alliance aims to strengthen regional stability and provide a coordinated response to these emerging challenges.</p>

          <p>The implementation of new U.S. tariffs on imported building materials and home goods, such as kitchen cabinets and timber, is creating additional financial hurdles for the housing market. Homebuilders and buyers are already experiencing rising costs, with one new homeowner reporting his budget increased by $150,000 even before the latest levies. Economists warn that these tariffs, combined with previous ones on steel and copper, could exacerbate affordability issues and slow new construction. Businesses, including major retailers like RH and IKEA, have indicated that the increased costs may be passed on to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 49-year-old man was arrested at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after his family alerted police to social media streams where he threatened to "shoot it up." The suspect, identified as Billy Cagle, was taken into custody unarmed inside a terminal, and police later found an AR-15 rifle with ammunition in his truck. Authorities believe he was returning to his vehicle to retrieve the weapon when he was apprehended. Officials credited the family's quick reporting and collaborative law enforcement efforts with averting a potential tragedy at the world's busiest airport.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that black garden ants actively redesign their nests to reduce the transmission of a lethal fungus, a concept termed "architectural immunity." Scientists observed that when exposed to the pathogen, ant colonies built more compartmentalized nests with fewer interconnections and more distant entrances. These structural changes, combined with social distancing behaviors like self-isolation by infected ants, create an effective defense system. The findings, published in the journal *Science*, demonstrate a sophisticated form of social immunity and suggest that principles of disease-mitigating design could offer insights for human public spaces.</p>

Rulings from courts in Oregon and Chicago have sharply contested the administration's factual basis for deploying National Guard troops, with one judge calling the president's determination "untethered to the facts." Legal scholars observe a pattern of judicial pushback against what they see as an overreach of executive power and a disregard for the rule of law.

The piece details the personal loss of a childhood friend and her family, and the suspended dreams of a generation of young people.

          <p>While former President Trump's recent Gaza peace agreement was widely celebrated in Israel, it has angered the country's far-right, particularly the settler movement that seeks to re-establish a Jewish presence in Gaza. The deal, which explicitly rejects Israeli territorial claims on the strip, represents a direct challenge to the ambitions of powerful ministers in Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition. This move, along with Trump's earlier rejection of West Bank annexation, suggests a shift where his administration is actively curbing the Israeli right's agenda. The article argues that sustained U.S. pressure will be necessary to prevent these factions from undermining the fragile peace.</p>

          <p>Belize has agreed to act as a "safe third country" for migrants seeking asylum in the United States, signing a deal that would allow the U.S. to deport certain asylum seekers to the Central American nation. The agreement, which requires approval from the Belize Senate, is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to curb illegal immigration and manage asylum claims. Belize's Prime Minister stated the country would have full authority to approve or reject transfers and would prefer to accept people from Central America. Human rights groups have criticized such agreements, warning of potential dangers for migrants sent to countries with fewer resources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent poll conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation indicates a lack of confidence among the Taiwanese public regarding the United States' willingness to defend the island from a potential Chinese invasion. Nearly 45% of respondents believe former President Trump is not willing to prevent an attack by force, compared to just over 34% who think he is. The results reflect growing pessimism and "deep worry" in Taiwan about the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner. This skepticism has been on the rise during Trump's second term, with previous polls showing a majority no longer view Washington as a dependable ally.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Internet activist Cory Doctorow's new book explores his theory of "enshittification," a three-stage process he argues explains the degradation of online platforms like Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Initially, platforms attract users with good services, then they pivot to benefit business customers at the users' expense. Finally, once both groups are locked in, the platform extracts value from its business customers, leading to a decline in quality for everyone. Doctorow attributes this pattern to a lack of competition and regulation, advocating for stronger antitrust enforcement and policies like interoperability to give users a meaningful "right-to-exit."</p>

          <p>Bernardo Bravo, the president of a citrus producers' association in Michoacán, Mexico, was found killed in his vehicle. His death follows recent public statements in which he condemned the extortion demands that organized crime groups impose on local lime growers. Bravo had described the situation as a "permanent commercial hijacking" and stated that criminal demands had become impossible for producers to meet. The region has long been a focal point of cartel activity, with criminal organizations targeting agricultural industries like limes and avocados for revenue, leading to violence and instability.</p>

          <p>A group of former tenants of Equity Residential, a major corporate landlord, are launching a back rent debt strike, organized with the help of the Debt Collective. The campaign aims to have their rental debts, which for some have grown to tens of thousands of dollars, canceled entirely. Central to their strategy is a new online tool that helps tenants document issues like poor maintenance or billing errors and generate formal dispute letters to debt collectors. This tactic is designed to challenge the economics of debt collection and draw attention to the growing crisis of rental debt, which often creates significant barriers to securing future housing.</p>

          <p>The population of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale has increased slightly, reaching an estimated 384 individuals, according to a new report from the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium. This marks the fourth year of slow but steady growth for the species, which had seen its numbers decline by about 25% in the previous decade due to ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement. Scientists credit conservation measures, particularly in Canada, for the positive trend. While encouraged by the increase and a lack of detected mortalities this year, researchers remain cautiously optimistic, emphasizing the continued need for strong protection efforts.</p>

          <p>Instagram is introducing a new safety feature that automatically places users under 18 into a "13+" setting, restricting their content to a PG-13 standard. However, this opinion article expresses skepticism, citing the platform's history of failed safety promises and research showing existing tools are largely ineffective. The author points to internal Meta documents and lawsuits alleging the platform has become a hub for child predators and exposes teens to harmful content related to self-harm and eating disorders. The piece argues that true safety requires incorporating protective measures into the platform's core design, rather than applying them as afterthoughts.</p>

          <p>An incident where shrapnel from an artillery round fell onto a California Highway Patrol vehicle has drawn scrutiny to the U.S. Marine Corps' decision to fire live munitions over Interstate 5 during a recent demonstration at Camp Pendleton. While no one was injured, military experts say that firing artillery, such as the M777 howitzer used, over the major freeway is extremely rare and a deviation from standard procedures for the base. The mishap, which occurred during a celebration of the Marine Corps' 250th birthday, also led to a dispute between state and federal officials over whether the freeway closure was necessary.</p>
