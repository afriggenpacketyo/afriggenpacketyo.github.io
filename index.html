          <p>Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a demonstration in London's Parliament Square who gathered to show support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. Protesters simultaneously revealed signs stating, "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to the largest number of single-day arrests by the force in a decade. The Home Secretary defended the ban, citing security advice, while human rights groups like Amnesty International called the mass arrests a disproportionate threat to freedom of expression. The protest highlights ongoing tensions surrounding pro-Palestinian activism and UK anti-terror legislation.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order against former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke's PAC, Powered by People, preventing it from funding Democratic lawmakers who left the state. The lawsuit, filed by Attorney General Ken Paxton, alleges the PAC engaged in bribery by covering travel and lodging for legislators who fled to block a Republican-backed redistricting plan. O'Rourke has countersued, accusing Paxton of attempting to silence dissent and dismantle a major voter registration organization. The legal conflict underscores the intense political battle over redistricting and voting rights in Texas.</p>

          <p>Asher Watkins, a Texas-based real estate magnate and big-game hunter, was killed by a Cape Buffalo while on a hunting trip in South Africa. According to the safari company leading the expedition, the attack was "sudden and unprovoked" and occurred while Watkins was tracking the animal.

          <p>The abrupt removal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long was reportedly preceded by a clash with the White House over a request to share confidential taxpayer data. The Department of Homeland Security had asked the IRS to cross-reference a list of suspected undocumented immigrants against its tax records to verify addresses, but the agency declined, citing taxpayer privacy laws. This conflict is part of a broader administration effort to use federal agencies in its immigration crackdown. The White House has denied that this disagreement was the reason for Long's removal.

          <p>Neurologists are cautioning against consuming specific foods that can pose risks to the brain and nervous system, beyond well-known advice to avoid sugar and saturated fats. Experts warn that damaged canned foods could contain botulinum toxin, which can cause severe paralysis, and that large tropical reef fish like barracuda may carry ciguatoxin, a neurotoxin causing sensory disturbances. Additionally, undercooked pork from unregulated sources presents a risk of neurocysticercosis, a parasitic infection that is a leading cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. These warnings highlight lesser-known food-borne neurological dangers.</p>

          <p>This article examines the changing depiction of Kashmir in India's Hindi-language film industry, Bollywood, from a romantic paradise to a conflict-ridden territory. Early films used the region's scenic beauty as a backdrop for romance, but the rise of militancy in the late 1980s shifted the narrative to themes of conflict, patriotism, and national security. The analysis notes that contemporary films, such as "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370," often align with government narratives, reflecting the political shifts since the 2019 abrogation of Kashmir's semi-autonomous status. This evolution showcases how cinema mirrors and shapes public perception of the complex region.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from NASA's Crew-10 mission have successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule after nearly five months on the International Space Station. The crew, consisting of two American astronauts, one Japanese, and one Russian, conducted over 200 scientific experiments during their 146-day mission, studying areas like plant growth and cell behavior in microgravity. Their return concludes NASA's 10th successful commercial crew rotation, a program that continues to demonstrate reliable transportation to and from the orbiting laboratory.</p>

          <h2>German Decision to Limit Arms Exports to Israel Sparks Political Backlash</h2>

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to halt German arms exports to Israel for use in Gaza "until further notice" has triggered fierce debate within his own conservative political coalition. Some members of his CDU/CSU alliance have criticized the move as a departure from Germany's long-standing policy of special responsibility toward Israel. However, the decision has also garnered support from other conservatives and from the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats, who argue that while solidarity with Israel remains, its government's recent actions in Gaza necessitate a response.

          <p>A small meteorite that tore through a homeowner's roof in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than Earth itself. A University of Georgia geologist examined fragments of the space rock, which was part of a fireball seen across the state in June. The meteorite is believed to have originated from the breakup of a larger asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter about 470 million years ago. This is the 27th meteorite ever recovered in Georgia.</p>

          <p>An anti-immigration protest drew hundreds of people to the town of Nuneaton, England, for a march through the town center. The demonstration was organized after the local council leader, from the Reform UK party, stated that two men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers. Warwickshire Police, who were present at the mostly peaceful event, made one arrest for suspected threats to cause criminal damage. The protest is one of several similar actions that took place across England, reflecting heightened tensions around immigration issues.</p>

          <p>Six Lebanese soldiers were killed in an explosion at a Hezbollah weapons depot near the city of Tyre in southern Lebanon. The soldiers were inspecting the depot and dismantling its contents as part of a UN-backed ceasefire agreement with Israel that requires the confiscation of unauthorized weapons. The incident occurred in a Hezbollah military facility containing munitions from the recent cross-border conflict. The explosion underscores the dangers and complexities the Lebanese army faces in implementing the disarmament of the powerful Iran-backed group, which has rejected the calls as a threat to sovereignty.</p>

In response, nations like Egypt and Algeria are launching initiatives for shoreline protection, waste reduction, and sustainable fishing, but local fishermen and activists remain skeptical about the effectiveness of international commitments in addressing the continuous destruction of their livelihood.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical overview of how partisan gerrymandering has become a dominant force in American politics over the past 15 years. It traces the origins to the Republican "Redmap" project in 2010, which strategically targeted state legislative races to gain control of the redistricting process. The piece explains how this led to durable GOP majorities in Congress and statehouses, even when Democrats won more votes, and discusses the Supreme Court's 2019 decision to remove federal courts from adjudicating such cases. The current redistricting battles are presented as the latest chapter in this ongoing political conflict.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous award to a U.S. special envoy, intended for the family of a senior CIA official whose son was killed fighting for Russia in Ukraine. During a meeting in Moscow, Putin gave the Soviet-era Order of Lenin to Steve Witkoff for Michael Gloss, 21, the son of CIA deputy director Juliane Gallina. Gloss, who reportedly suffered from mental health issues, had enlisted with Russian forces in 2023 and expressed pro-Russian views online. The unusual gesture occurred as plans were confirmed for a Trump-Putin summit in Alaska.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James, ordering her to testify about her civil fraud investigation into President Donald Trump. This action comes after James's office successfully sued the Trump Organization for fraudulently overvaluing properties, a case currently under appeal. James's office has condemned the subpoena as a "weaponization of the justice system" and an act of political retribution by the administration. The investigation into James is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York, deepening the political-legal conflict.</p>
