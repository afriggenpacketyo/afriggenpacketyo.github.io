          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to slash most of their recent tariffs on each other's imports and suspend part of the reciprocal duties for 90 days. This move, a significant shift from their ongoing trade war, was reached during high-level trade talks in Geneva and has already prompted a surge in stock prices. The United States will cut tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% from 145%, while China will lower tariffs on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.</p>

          <p>Addiction experts are cautioning that proposed congressional cuts to addiction funding could lead to a rise in overdose deaths. Over 300 physicians, harm reduction workers, and researchers signed a letter to Congress warning of the dire consequences of slashing funds from agencies like the CDC and SAMHSA. They noted that overdose deaths had significantly decreased in 2024 due to increased financial investment in addiction recovery programs. Experts fear that rural areas and poor urban neighborhoods will be particularly affected, and research efforts tracking new synthetic street drugs could be defunded.</p>

          <p>Xaviar Babudar, known as "ChiefsAholic," a Kansas City Chiefs superfan, was sentenced to 32 years in Oklahoma state prison for robbing a Tulsa-area bank.

Babudar stole nearly $850,000 to finance his social media presence and gambling addiction. The Tulsa County District Attorney sought a life sentence, but the judge ordered the sentence to run concurrently with his federal sentence, meaning he will be transferred to state custody after his federal release.</p>

          <p>Fintech companies, which benefited from rising interest rates in 2022, now face a key test as interest rates decline. Higher rates boosted net interest income for fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo, but falling rates raise doubts about the sustainability of this income. Fintechs are now diversifying their revenue streams to reduce reliance on interest and card fees. Companies with diversified income strategies are better positioned to weather changes in the economy, including a lower rates environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the UN refugee agency, Philippe Lazzarini, accuses Israel of using the denial of food to Gaza as a weapon of war. He stated that starvation is spreading and people are dying not from bombardment but from lack of food. The IPC reports that the entire population of Gaza, over two million people, is experiencing acute food insecurity, with 22% in a "catastrophe" phase. Lazzarini believes food and humanitarian assistance are being used to meet political or military objectives, potentially amounting to genocide due to massive destruction and atrocities.</p>
