          <h2>Dollar's Rise Following US Strikes on Iran Expected to Be Temporary</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 04:55:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced an initial surge due to its safe-haven appeal after the U.S. military strikes on Iran. However, analysts suggest this strength is unlikely to last, citing underlying concerns about U.S. fiscal policy, trade wars, and decreasing international demand for U.S. assets. The immediate boost to the dollar stems from fears of Iranian retaliation, potentially disrupting oil transit through the Strait of Hormuz. RBC Capital Markets analysts caution that Iran may employ asymmetric capabilities to raise the economic cost of the combined US/Israeli operations, adding complexity to the situation. The dollar's long-term concerns outweigh its temporary gains. The optimism score is based on the fact that Iran has not officially retaliated and that the situation is currently stable.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump detailed the U.S. strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities on his social media platform, Truth Social, claiming "monumental damage" to all nuclear sites, supported by satellite images. He highlighted the obliteration of facilities, including the Fordo enrichment facility, with damage occurring far below ground level. Several B-2 bombers participated in the strikes on Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with over 125 aircraft involved in the mission. Trump emphasized the depth and shielding of the targeted structures, indicating a successful operation. The article details Trump's claims regarding the success of the strikes and the extent of the damage inflicted on Iranian nuclear facilities. The optimism score is based on the fact that there were no reports of civilian casualties and that Trump's tone was confident and assured.</p>

          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, will be available through GPs in England for individuals meeting strict criteria, as part of a phased rollout managed by NHS England. Initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, Mounjaro can now be prescribed to help people with obesity lose weight, making individuals feel full and reducing food intake. Eligibility requires a BMI of 40 or over (or 37.5 for minority ethnic backgrounds) and the presence of four out of five specific conditions, including type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Patients will receive comprehensive care, including regular check-ups and exercise support; however, access may vary by location, and GPs are urging people to check eligibility before seeking the prescription. The optimism score is based on the fact that the rollout is gradual and measured, prioritizing those most in need.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief expressed shock and frustration over a planned protest in support of Palestine Action, an activist group that recently broke into RAF Brize Norton. The home secretary is reportedly preparing to proscribe the group, effectively branding it a terrorist organization. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley emphasized the importance of the right to protest but condemned actions supporting what he described as an "organised extremist criminal group." While the Met lacks legal power to prevent the protest before proscription, conditions have been imposed, limiting the protest to a specific time and excluding it from much of Westminster. The optimism score is based on the fact that authorities are taking measures to manage the protest and prevent disruption.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, speculation about regime change in Tehran increases, but history suggests such interventions often lead to disastrous consequences. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested that regime change in Iran "could certainly be the result" of Israel's operation, while President Trump has sent contradictory signals. Experts warn that foreign-imposed regime change violates international law, often leading to power vacuums, violence, and instability, citing examples from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. The article suggests that achieving regime change in Iran from the outside is unlikely and that it would require a ground invasion, which is not currently feasible.

          <p>Iran's supreme leader dispatched his foreign minister to Moscow to request increased assistance from President Vladimir Putin following recent U.S. military actions against Iranian nuclear sites. With U.S. President Trump and Israel openly discussing regime change, Russia fears further destabilization in the Middle East. While Putin has condemned Israeli strikes, he has not commented on the U.S. attacks, though he has offered Moscow's services as a mediator. Iran seeks more substantial support from Russia against Israel and the United States, though the specifics of the desired assistance remain unclear.

Himes expressed concern that the attacks were undertaken without congressional authorization, which is constitutionally required for declaring war. While acknowledging a small chance of a best-case scenario, he emphasized the historical tendency for U.S. military involvements in the region to end poorly.

          <p>Iran's parliament approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, a move that could alienate neighbors and trade partners. Experts warn that blocking the strait would harm Iran more than others, risking hostilities and damaging its relationship with key Asian markets like China. The decision now rests with Iran's national security council, and the closure could lead to higher energy prices and increased geopolitical tensions. While the possibility of closure remains minimal, Iran risks turning oil-producing neighbors into enemies and provoking a strong response from the U.S. and Israel. The optimism score is based on the assessment that closure is unlikely and that Iran has much to lose.</p>

Rahmani questioned why Gina, identified as Victim 3, did not testify and why Diddy's chief of staff, Kristina "KK" Khorram, wasn't called to the stand despite being heavily involved in the alleged activities. Text messages involving Diddy's ex-girlfriends and KK were presented, raising questions about her role and potential co-conspiracy. Rahmani also wondered why the ex-girlfriends didn't leave if they had been sexually assaulted and trafficked, suggesting the prosecution hasn't fully answered whether it was sexual assault or regret and resentment. The optimism score is based on the fact that there are still unanswered questions and that the outcome of the trial is uncertain.</p>

          <p>A National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin warns of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. While there are no specific, credible threats, the bulletin notes the likelihood of low-level cyber attacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and potential attacks by Iranian government-affiliated cyber actors. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict increases the risk of cyberattacks, violence, and antisemitic hate crimes. The bulletin also cautions that violent extremists in the U.S. could independently mobilize in response to the conflict, particularly if Iranian leadership calls for retaliatory violence.

          <p>Chinese scientists have found evidence that subatomic particles from cosmic rays may affect the efficiency of error correction techniques in quantum computing. Researchers monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons produced by cosmic rays, as well as gamma ray-induced particle disturbances. They observed quasiparticle bursts leading to correlated errors induced solely by muons, separating their contributions from gamma rays. These findings could be significant for the scaling of quantum processors and the design of fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. The proposed detection method could also be applied in cosmic ray and dark matter particle detection.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Russia's response is closely watched, but Moscow may not be quick to assist its ally. Iran has supported Russia with military drones in the war in Ukraine, but analysts suggest Moscow has limited capacity or willingness to reciprocate. Russia must balance supporting Iran with maintaining ties with the U.S., particularly given Trump's desire to improve relations with Moscow. So far, Russia's response has been muted, calling for negotiations between Iran and Israel. The optimism score reflects the uncertainty of Russian support and the potential for continued conflict.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government appeared to support U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, viewing them as a signal of Washington's resolve to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated that Japan understands the U.S. action demonstrates its determination to de-escalate the situation while preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Japan continues to hope for the reopening of dialogue between the U.S. and Iran, pledging diplomatic efforts toward peace and stability in the Middle East. The government is closely monitoring the impact of the Middle East conflict on Japan's energy supply, following reports that Iran's parliament has backed the closing of the Strait of Hormuz.

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained the wife of a Marine Corps veteran in Louisiana during a routine immigration appointment in New Orleans. Paola Clouatre, a Mexican national married to Adrian Clouatre, was taken into custody, leaving her husband to care for their two young children, including a 3-month-old breastfeeding daughter. Paola had been seeking a green card, but ICE issued a deportation order due to her mother's failure to appear at an immigration hearing years prior. The detention highlights the Trump administration's push for increased deportations and the strict enforcement policies impacting military families. The optimism score is based on the distressing nature of the situation and the potential for family separation.</p>

The China International Capital Corporation noted the potential for increased risk aversion as parties engage in retaliatory strikes and exchange strong rhetoric.
