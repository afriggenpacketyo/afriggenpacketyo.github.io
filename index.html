          <p>Varda Space Industries, a startup focused on manufacturing pharmaceuticals in orbit, has raised $187 million in a Series C funding round. This brings the company's total capital to $329 million, which will be used to increase its flight cadence and expand its in-space drug development capabilities. Varda believes the microgravity environment of space allows for the creation of drug crystals that are difficult to produce on Earth. The company has already completed three space launches and recently received FAA approval for its W-Series 1 capsule to return to Earth.</p>

          <p>Wedbush analyst Dan Ives forecasts that Microsoft will become the next company to achieve a $4 trillion market capitalization, potentially as soon as this summer. The prediction is driven by accelerating large-scale artificial intelligence deals and strong growth in the company's Azure cloud services. Ives raised his 12-month price target for Microsoft to $600 per share, suggesting the stock's current price has not fully accounted for its future growth potential in AI. The note highlights that Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain a competitive edge against rivals like Alphabet and Amazon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official testified in federal court that the agency has not determined where it would send Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he were released from pretrial detention. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and has since returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges. His attorneys are concerned he could be removed to a third country without due process. The judge has expressed frustration over the lack of clarity from the government regarding his short-term fate, seeking a binding stipulation that his rights will be protected.</p>

          <p>Russian missile and drone strikes on Kyiv resulted in at least two fatalities and multiple injuries as Ukraine's allies convened in Rome for a recovery conference. During the summit, Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced Germany's readiness to purchase US-made Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine. Meanwhile, international partners pledged over €10 billion to support Ukraine's reconstruction efforts. The events highlight the dual reality of Ukraine fighting an intensifying war while simultaneously planning for its post-war future, with leaders stressing the urgent need for more robust air defenses.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, are being questioned about the timing of emergency notifications during the recent flash floods that have resulted in 96 local deaths and over 160 missing people.

Officials have cited a focus on rescue efforts as their current priority over creating a precise timeline of the events.

OMB Director Russell Vought's letter questions whether the project complies with federal planning laws and demands Powell halt construction.

During a flood, the primary advice is to seek higher ground immediately and never attempt to walk or drive through floodwaters, as just six inches can sweep a person away. After the event, it is vital to wait for the all-clear from authorities before returning home and to check for structural and electrical hazards.</p>

          <p>All remaining charges have been dropped against Mario Guevara, a journalist who was arrested by local police and then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while covering a protest near Atlanta in June. The Gwinnett County solicitor announced there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the traffic citations that were the basis for his continued detention. Guevara, who has been in the U.S. for over 20 years and has a work permit, remains in federal custody as ICE appeals a judge's decision to grant him bond, a situation that has drawn condemnation from press freedom advocates.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' shares surged after the company reinstated its full-year profit outlook and projected a stronger-than-expected summer travel season. CEO Ed Bastian stated that booking patterns have stabilized after a dip earlier in the year, giving the airline confidence to forecast adjusted full-year earnings between $5.25 and $6.25 a share. The positive forecast was driven by strong sales of premium seats and a lucrative partnership with American Express. The news boosted not only Delta's stock but also the shares of other major U.S. airlines, signaling renewed investor confidence in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The federal tax credits for electric vehicles, worth up to $7,500 for new cars, are set to expire on September 30, a change enacted by President Trump's recent major legislative bill. This abrupt end to the incentive is expected to trigger a "summer of the EV" as consumers rush to make purchases before the deadline. To qualify, a buyer must take possession of the vehicle by the end of September, not just place an order. Automakers like Tesla are already urging customers to act quickly, and analysts predict a period of strong sales and additional manufacturer discounts.</p>

          <p>A growing number of migrants from Latin America are reportedly giving up on reaching or staying in the United States and are making perilous return journeys, a trend experts call "reverse migration." This shift is attributed to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies and the elimination of legal protections like humanitarian parole, which has left many former legal residents in a state of limbo. While unauthorized border crossings have dropped, humanitarian organizations report it is a sign of despair, not improved conditions, as many return to the same unstable and dangerous situations they originally fled.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war and the removal of a key tax exemption have created significant challenges for low-cost Asian e-commerce giants Temu and Shein. The new tariff structure has eroded their significant price advantage in the U.S. market, forcing a temporary halt in some shipping operations. However, some retail experts believe their highly flexible, low-overhead business models may allow them to adapt and remain formidable competitors to Amazon. As U.S. consumers become more price-conscious amid economic uncertainty, these companies could still benefit by offering cheaper alternatives, despite the increased duties.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazil is being widely interpreted as a political maneuver to support his ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The justification for the tariffs included criticism of Bolsonaro's ongoing trial related to a 2022 coup plot, which many analysts see as direct interference. This move could backfire, as some of the Brazilian sectors most affected, like agribusiness, are part of Bolsonaro's political base. The action has strained U.S.-Brazil relations and could potentially create a "rally-around-the-flag" effect for current President Lula, who has condemned the threat as an attack on Brazil's sovereignty.</p>

Directed by and co-starring Embeth Davidtz, the story is told from the perspective of 7-year-old Bobo (Lexi Venter), whose innocent yet revealing observations expose the anxieties and entitlements of her settler family. The film is praised for its unflinching portrayal of a chaotic childhood and for Venter's remarkable lead performance.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An annuity can serve as a powerful tool to supplement and strategically manage Social Security benefits in retirement. By providing a guaranteed income stream, an annuity can allow a retiree to delay claiming Social Security, which increases their monthly benefit by about 8% for each year of deferral past full retirement age. This strategy creates a higher lifetime income. Additionally, annuity payments can fill income gaps left by Social Security and, if structured correctly, can help manage one's overall taxable income, potentially reducing the taxes owed on Social Security benefits.

          <p>The newly announced "one in, one out" migrant returns deal between the UK and France, while simple in concept, is likely to face significant legal, political, and practical challenges. The pilot scheme aims to deter small boat crossings by returning migrants to France, but its implementation will require navigating complex legal questions about selection fairness and potential EU database conflicts. Officials will also need to establish a system for identifying which asylum seekers in France have a strong case to be sent to the UK. Experts suggest the initial small scale may not be a major deterrent, and scaling it up will be costly and difficult.</p>
