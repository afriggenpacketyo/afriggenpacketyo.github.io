          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit to remove Democratic Representative Gene Wu from office, labeling him the "ringleader" of lawmakers who fled the state to block a vote on a contentious redistricting plan. The lawsuit argues that by breaking quorum, the Democrats have abandoned their official duties, a claim legal experts and Democrats contest. This legal action escalates the political standoff over a Republican-backed map that would significantly favor the GOP in future congressional elections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals with illegally shipping millions of dollars worth of advanced AI chips, including Nvidia's H100 units, to China. The individuals allegedly used a California-based company to export the technology without the required licenses, circumventing U.S. export controls designed to restrict China's access to sensitive semiconductor technology. The scheme reportedly involved routing shipments through countries like Malaysia to conceal their final destination.</p>

          <p>A new national poll from Equis research group indicates that a quarter of Latino voters who supported Donald Trump in 2024 are not committed to voting for Republican congressional candidates in the 2026 midterms. The findings suggest this support is not guaranteed for the wider party, with many respondents expressing uncertainty or a belief that neither party truly cares about them. This shaky alignment could pose a challenge for Republican midterm strategies that rely on continued growth in Latino support.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has terminated 22 contracts worth nearly $500 million for the development of mRNA-based vaccines. The administration cited doubts about the technology's effectiveness against respiratory infections like COVID-19 and the flu, stating a shift toward what it calls safer platforms. The decision has sparked immediate criticism from many public health experts, who defend mRNA vaccines as a critical and life-saving tool.</p>

          <p>Governor Greg Abbott has escalated a political standoff by ordering the civil arrest of Democratic legislators who left Texas to deny a quorum and block a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan. While Abbott directed state police to locate and return the lawmakers, their jurisdiction does not extend out of state. Democrats maintain they are using a constitutionally protected procedural tool to fight against what they call a racist, gerrymandered map.</p>

          <p>California officials have announced the planned closure of the state correctional facility in Norco by fall 2026, a move attributed to the state's declining prison population and expected to save $150 million annually.

This closure is part of a broader trend of deactivating correctional facilities as California re-evaluates its justice system.</p>

          <p>U.S. border officials have been instructed to stop deportations under President Trump's asylum ban after a federal appeals court order. The court ruled that the government cannot completely suspend laws that protect migrants from being sent to countries where they could face torture or persecution. This decision effectively reopens pathways to certain humanitarian protections for migrants who cross the border illegally, which had been shut down by the administration's sweeping policy.</p>

          <p>Sources familiar with Ghislaine Maxwell's recent interview with the Department of Justice claim she told officials that Donald Trump never engaged in any concerning behavior in her presence. The nine-hour interview with the convicted sex trafficker took place as she appeals her sentence and reportedly seeks a presidential pardon. The Trump administration is now said to be considering a public release of the interview transcripts, adding another layer to the politically charged case.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders has been named the starter for the team's preseason opener against the Carolina Panthers. The fifth-round draft pick gets the surprising opportunity due to injuries affecting other quarterbacks on the roster, including Kenny Pickett and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel. This start provides Sanders, who was prolific in college playing for his father Deion Sanders, a key chance to compete for a roster spot.</p>

          <p>A scathing U.S. Coast Guard report has concluded that the fatal 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible was preventable and resulted from a "toxic" safety culture at its operator, OceanGate. The investigation found the company used "intimidation tactics" to evade regulatory oversight and that CEO Stockton Rush, who died in the incident, negligently ignored repeated warnings about the vessel's flawed design. The report states Rush likely would have faced criminal charges had he survived.</p>
