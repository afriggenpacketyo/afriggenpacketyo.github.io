          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at a four-year low in March, with the consumer price index increasing by 0.9% year-on-year, matching February's rate. The Monetary Authority of Singapore attributed the inflation to higher food and private transport costs. This reading comes as Singapore prepares for a general election, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledging cost-of-living concerns. The country has eased its monetary policy and downgraded its GDP forecast, citing global economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six major automotive policy groups are jointly lobbying the Trump administration to reconsider imposing 25% tariffs on auto parts. The groups argue that the tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production, as many suppliers are already facing financial difficulties. They represent a significant portion of the industry, supporting millions of jobs and contributing trillions to the economy. The letter comes after Trump indicated a willingness to consider helping auto companies needing time to adjust to new sourcing requirements.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Chicago Cubs in extra innings after squandering a late-game lead. Despite scoring a season-high in runs, the Dodgers struggled to maintain momentum and capitalize on opportunities. The bullpen faltered, allowing the Cubs to tie the game and ultimately win. While the Dodgers still maintain a strong record, the loss highlighted areas for improvement and the need to maintain focus throughout the game.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent comments suggesting a potential easing of tariffs against China may indicate U.S. anxiety and provide Beijing with leverage in trade negotiations, analysts suggest. Trump's remarks followed claims of progress in trade talks, but experts believe there has been no substantial change. The analysts say that the more Trump talks about the situation, the more anxious the U.S. side is.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its 2025 GDP growth projections for China, India, and Japan, citing trade tensions and "high policy uncertainty." The IMF also reduced its global growth forecast for 2025, attributing the downgrade to tariffs announced by the U.S. and its trading partners. The forecast aligns with a broader trend of research firms and banks cutting growth forecasts for Asian economies due to the intensifying U.S.-China trade war.</p>
