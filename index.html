          <h2>Pakistan Airspace Closure Has Limited Impact on Indian Airlines' Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 01:33:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pakistan's closure of its airspace to Indian airlines has forced carriers to reroute flights, increasing flight times and costs, particularly on westbound routes. However, experts believe the closure's impact on airfares will be minimal. While some routes have been temporarily suspended, passengers are unlikely to see significant fare increases. A similar closure in 2019 cost airlines around $82 million, but current prices on some routes have already dropped, suggesting the impact is more symbolic than disruptive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The absence of China's top general, He Weidong, from a recent Politburo study session has fueled speculation about his current status. He Weidong, the second-ranked vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, last appeared publicly on March 11, and no official explanation has been given for his absence from key events. While analysts suggest this absence is unlikely to affect China's political stability, it has nonetheless raised questions within the political and military spheres.

This resource, found naturally beneath the Earth's surface, produces only water when burned and contains no carbon. Companies like Rio Tinto, Fortescue, Gazprom, and BP are backing exploratory efforts to locate and extract this elusive gas, though critics raise concerns about environmental impact and distribution challenges.

China's advancements in electric vehicles, backed by state subsidies, pose a significant risk to the entire U.S. auto industry.

          <p>Planned changes to school uniform policies in England are expected to impact over four million pupils by limiting the number of compulsory branded items. The government aims to reduce costs for families, estimating savings of around £50 per child, but school wear manufacturers warn the plans could increase costs. Some worry that cheaper, generic garments may not last as long as branded items, and branded uniforms play a role in reducing inequality in schools and improving behavior. Uniform exchanges are popular resources for parents seeking affordable options.</p>

          <p>The US military says it has struck over 800 Houthi targets in Yemen since launching sustained air and naval strikes, claiming to have killed hundreds of fighters and leaders. The Houthis, however, report that US attacks have killed civilians, including women and children. The US asserts its actions are aimed at ending the Houthi threat to shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis claim their actions are in support of Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>

          <p>The current weakness of the U.S. dollar, driven by uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policies, is creating an opportunity for the Euro to attract investors. European officials believe their stability, predictability, and respect for the rule of law are proving to be strengths. They are seeing increased investor interest in Euro-denominated assets. This shift comes as investors simultaneously sold off the U.S. dollar, American stocks, and U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>
