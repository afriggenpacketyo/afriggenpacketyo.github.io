            <p>Margaret Elaine Winn, a British woman, has been identified as one of the four fatalities in a cable car crash near Naples. The incident occurred when a cable snapped, causing the cabin to plunge to the ground. Italian authorities have launched a criminal investigation, noting that the cable car had passed a safety inspection just two weeks prior. Sixteen people were rescued from another cabin, and the UK foreign office is assisting local authorities. The Mount Faito cable car, operational since 1952, experienced a similar accident in 1960 resulting in four deaths.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelan detainees held in North Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, responding to an emergency appeal by the ACLU. The ACLU argued that these individuals were at imminent risk of deportation without due process. The court's order prevents the Trump administration from removing any member of the group until further notice. The ACLU lawsuit contends that the detainees were given notices in English, despite speaking only Spanish, and were not informed of their right to contest their designation in federal court.</p>

            <p>Congressional Republicans are advocating for the reauthorization of President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire later this year. They argue that failing to do so would result in significant tax increases for many Americans and could potentially trigger a recession. Democrats, however, aim to highlight the perceived tax disparity and argue that the cuts primarily benefit wealthy individuals and corporations. Some Republicans are considering raising taxes on the wealthy to offset the cost of the tax cuts and shield themselves from Democratic criticism. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Barbara Lee surged into the lead in the race to become Oakland's next mayor, according to the latest vote results. Lee, a former Democratic Congresswoman, moved ahead of her primary challenger, Loren Taylor, with 53% of the vote. Oakland uses ranked-choice elections, which may delay the final vote count. If the results hold, Lee would replace ousted Mayor Sheng Thao, who was recalled from office amid voter frustrations with crime and homelessness.</p>

            <p>US Senator Chris Van Hollen reports that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has been moved to a new prison. Van Hollen, after visiting Abrego Garcia, said he was "traumatised" and fearful of other prisoners while inside the mega-jail Cecot. The Supreme Court has ordered the government to "facilitate" his return, however Trump administration officials have continued to push back against the order. Van Hollen also noted that conditions in the new prison are better, but Abrego Garcia still lacks access to news or communication with the outside world.</p>

            <p>Despite multiple court orders, including a Supreme Court ruling, the Trump administration continues to resist facilitating the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The White House accuses Abrego Garcia of being a member of MS-13 and insists he will "never live" in the US again. The case is part of a legal showdown between the Trump administration and the US courts system on immigration, with a judge considering holding the administration in contempt for disregarding his order barring deportation flights.</p>

            <p>The article examines the allegations against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported from the US to El Salvador. Despite court orders for his return, the White House claims he is an MS-13 gang member, a claim he denies. The article details a 2019 police encounter where officers identified Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 member based on clothing and information from a "proven and reliable source." His lawyers argue he has never been convicted of a crime and was granted a "withholding of removal" order due to fear of persecution by a rival gang.</p>

            <p>President Trump has stated that the US will "take a pass" on brokering further Russia-Ukraine talks if significant progress towards a peace deal is not made soon. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed this sentiment, warning that the US would abandon talks unless there were clear signs of progress within days. Trump's direct diplomacy with Putin and criticism of Zelensky have raised concerns among NATO allies. These statements come amid ongoing Russian strikes in Ukraine and stalled negotiations for a ceasefire.</p>

Bin, a former gang member, was sentenced in 2008 for shooting at the home of a rival. Newsom's pardon follows efforts to use clemency powers to help immigrants targeted for deportation. Bin's good behavior and rehabilitation efforts in prison led to a reduced sentence, and the pardon is intended to help him remain in California.</p>
