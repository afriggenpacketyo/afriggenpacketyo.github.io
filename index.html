          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 2% amid volatile trading following the announcement of a 250 billion yen share buyback and better-than-expected operating income. The company's operating income for the last three months beat estimates, though it showed a decrease from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders. However, Sony's outlook for the current financial year was lackluster, forecasting a slight rise in operating profit, impacted by trade war effects, though this estimate did not reflect the recent trade deal between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Family offices are growing rapidly as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services, but they face a talent crunch in finding qualified money managers. Trust is a critical factor, often outweighing other qualifications, leading to selectivity and difficulty in filling roles. Family offices struggle to compete with banks and private equity firms for top talent, particularly for combined roles like chief investment officer and CFO. Young employees are hesitant to join due to the lack of corporate structure and perceived "retirement job" status, while European family offices are raising compensation packages to attract and retain talent.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to tighten immigration rules, aimed at prioritizing British workers, is raising concerns among businesses about potential labor shortages. The new proposals include stricter English language requirements and higher skill levels for migrants seeking work visas. Businesses, particularly in sectors like health and social care, worry that British workers may be unable or unwilling to fill the resulting labor gaps. Care England warns that ending overseas recruitment for social care visas could have serious consequences for a sector already facing significant vacancies, emphasizing that social care is high-skill work deserving of proper recognition and investment.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, a significant step towards their potential release after more than three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited the brothers' rehabilitation and support from corrections officials as factors in his decision, emphasizing they have earned the chance for parole consideration. The brothers apologized for their crimes, acknowledging the pain they caused their family and the legal system, and spoke of their desire to help others if released. While the resentencing makes them immediately eligible for parole, the final decision rests with the state parole board and Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has approved a potential sale of over $1.4 billion in helicopters and F-16 fighter jet parts to the United Arab Emirates, coinciding with President Donald Trump's upcoming visit to the Middle Eastern nation. The proposed sale includes $1.32 billion for CH-47 F Chinook helicopters and $130 million for F-16 parts. Some Democrats have expressed hesitation, citing concerns about the UAE's involvement in conflicts like the one in Sudan and potential conflicts of interest related to investments in Trump's businesses. Senator Chris Murphy vowed to block arms sales to nations engaging in direct personal business with Trump, calling such dealings "nuclear grade graft."</p>

While Putin has remained silent, Zelenskyy has emphasized that Ukraine is committed to peace and doing everything Trump asks.

          <p>A charter plane carrying white South Africans arrived in the United States as refugees, fast-tracked by President Trump, who claims they face racist policies and a "genocide." This move has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that there is no evidence of persecution or land theft targeting white South Africans. Experts assert that crime in South Africa affects everyone, regardless of race, and that Black South Africans are more likely to be victims of violence. Trump's decision is seen by some as an attempt to position himself as a savior of white privilege and Christianity globally, while straining relations with the South African government.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand to dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, though Mr. Witkoff's spokesman denied the proposal was discussed. The plan entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from other countries providing oversight. This venture would be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, potentially addressing concerns of both Iran and the United States.</p>

Despite the decline, egg prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu that has wiped out flocks of egg-laying hens. Experts anticipate further price drops in May and June due to decreased consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing $1 billion to help farmers improve biosecurity measures, and the U.S. has increased egg imports from various countries.</p>

Experts warn that these devices could be used to remotely switch off inverters or change their settings, potentially causing widespread blackouts.

Families visiting the facility express concerns about the presence of sexual offenders, and former inmates describe a climate of bullying and attacks.

          <p>Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, testified in the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean Combs, detailing drug-fueled sex sessions with male prostitutes that she said left her feeling "disgusting" and "humiliated." She described Combs' alleged orchestration of these sessions, dictating her appearance and sex acts, and the long-lasting impact on her life and career. Ventura stated she stayed with Combs out of love and a desire to please him, but eventually recognized the abusive nature of their relationship and her fear of his power over her career. The defense has argued that the sexual encounters were consensual, but Ventura maintains otherwise.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reduced most of their recent new tariffs on each other's imports and suspended part of the reciprocal duties for 90 days, following high-level trade talks in Switzerland. The U.S. cut tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China reduced retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. to 10% from 125%. However, both countries have retained a portion of the tariffs, which will be negotiated during the 90-day pause. China also agreed to suspend or remove non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals. This agreement aims to improve the trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.</p>

The research builds on previous findings that chimpanzees self-medicate by eating certain plants, and adds to a growing body of evidence that primates use natural medicines to stay healthy. Researchers filmed and recorded instances of chimpanzees applying plants to their wounds and tending to the wounds of other animals, suggesting a capacity for empathy. The study also compiled decades of scientific observations, revealing human-like hygiene habits among chimpanzees.</p>

Despite this tension, relations between Canada and the US have improved, with negotiations on trade and security expected soon. Carney remains cautious, emphasizing the need to plan for potential challenges in the security relationship and the global trading system.</p>

The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs published the names, along with detailed coordinates and maps, despite recent efforts to improve diplomatic ties between the two countries. This move comes after a deadly military clash in the Galwan Valley in 2020 and a subsequent military stand-off at the shared border, though China and India agreed to end their military stand-off late last year.</p>

A Chinese government policy-setting document warned that “external forces” posed increasing “threats to China’s frontier regions, border areas, and security in its surrounding areas.” China is trying to leverage the upheaval in Washington’s trade policy by presenting itself as a beacon of stability and predictability, while also flexing its power in regional disputes.</p>

In contrast, Japan ranked first in physical health and improved in academic and social skills.
