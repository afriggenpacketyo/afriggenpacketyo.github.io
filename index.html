        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese and U.S. negotiators have agreed to continue discussions on a new tariff deal, though significant differences persist, particularly regarding Washington's duties on Japan's automotive industry. The talks in Washington were described as "fruitful," but no immediate breakthrough was announced as a July deadline for President Trump's proposed reciprocal tariffs looms. The Trump administration has hinted that the 90-day pause on these tariffs could be extended, providing more time for negotiations with key trading partners like Japan. However, the administration's separate, higher tariffs on imported vehicles remain a major point of concern for the Japanese government.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that schools must allow parents to opt their children out of lessons that feature LGBTQ-themed storybooks if they conflict with their religious beliefs. The case originated from a lawsuit by parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who challenged the inclusion of nine specific picture books in the elementary school curriculum. The majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, argued that the books promote messages contrary to some parents' religious principles. The dissenting justices warned that the decision fails to recognize the existence of LGBTQ+ people and could undermine inclusive education.</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, suggesting its primary objective has been to prevent any regional state from achieving military or technological parity with Israel. It cites an exchange with a U.S. senator who reportedly stated the goal was to reduce potential adversaries to a "pre-industrial society." The piece argues this agenda, once confined to neoconservative circles, became official U.S. policy following the September 11 attacks. This perspective frames decades of American intervention in the region, from Iraq to Iran, as part of a consistent strategy to maintain Israeli dominance.</p>

          <p>China's solar manufacturing industry is confronting a severe downturn, battered by a combination of a domestic price war and prohibitive U.S. tariffs. Prices across the solar supply chain have plummeted by up to 80% in 2024, pushing many of the nation's producers into financial losses totaling billions. A major industry conference in Shanghai was marked by a gloomy mood, with several leading companies skipping the event. The situation reflects a deep and prolonged crisis for what was once billed as a key new economic driver for China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NFL coach Jim Harbaugh has been added to a class-action lawsuit against the University of Michigan concerning a former assistant coach accused of hacking. The suit alleges that Harbaugh and other university officials knew that former co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss was viewing private information but still allowed him to work a major playoff game. Weiss has been criminally charged with unauthorized computer access and identity theft, allegedly accessing over 2,000 college athletes' accounts to find intimate photos.

This sharp rhetoric follows a 12-day conflict and U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, indicating that post-ceasefire tensions remain extremely high between Washington and Tehran.</p>

          <p>A new study from Tulane University has found that sections of New Orleans' post-Katrina flood protection system are sinking, with some areas subsiding by nearly two inches per year. This rate is faster than the rise in sea levels, effectively reducing the capacity of the city's multi-billion dollar levee system to block storm surges. The research, which used satellite radar data, identified hotspots around industrial sites and residential areas, warning that the city's flood defenses could be significantly degraded if the trend continues without intervention.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom warned that a Republican budget bill currently in the U.S. Senate could lead to an estimated 3.4 million Californians losing their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill's proposed work requirements for Medicaid recipients would disproportionately affect the state, which has over 15 million people enrolled in the program. Newsom described the potential cuts as "devastating" and "cruel," predicting they could force the closure of rural hospitals and threaten the state's progress in reducing its uninsured rate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in Japan has found a correlation between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age people. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, identified diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, seaweed, and green tea as beneficial. Researchers theorize that nutrients like the omega-3 fatty acids in fish and folic acid in vegetables could play a role in releasing mood-regulating neurotransmitters, though they emphasize that more research is needed to confirm the link.</p>

          <p>In the remote Alaskan village of Kwethluk, hundreds of Orthodox Christian clergy and pilgrims gathered to witness the canonization of Matushka Olga, the first Yup'ik saint. Olga, a local midwife and healer who died in 1979, is remembered for her compassion and became associated with miracles, particularly in healing victims of trauma. The two-day ceremony, which incorporated the local Yugtun language and traditions, marked a historic moment of cultural and religious recognition for the community and the Orthodox Church in America.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, labeling him a "communist" and a "Lunatic." Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, scored a stunning primary victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Trump's comments reflect a growing alarm among conservatives and some business leaders over the prospect of a democratic socialist leading America's largest city, given his platform of higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations.</p>
