          <p>The leading candidates for New York City mayor—Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa—clashed in a televised debate covering major city issues. Key topics included housing affordability, city noise, and the influence of President Donald Trump on federal-city relations. Mamdani, the progressive frontrunner, defended his pro-Palestinian views against criticism from Cuomo, who positioned himself as an experienced centrist capable of managing the White House. The debate highlighted the deep ideological divides within the race as early voting approaches, with affordability remaining a central concern for New Yorkers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bangladesh's interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, is facing significant backlash over its plan to lease three key ports, including the vital Chattogram Port, to foreign operators. Critics, including military leaders and security analysts, argue that such a long-term decision with national security implications should not be made by an unelected, temporary administration. The move, intended to attract investment, has been criticized for its lack of transparency and competitive bidding. Concerns are mounting that the decision could entangle Bangladesh in geopolitical rivalries, particularly between the US, China, and India.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is scheduled to speak with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to discuss ongoing trade negotiations between the two economic powers. The call comes after President Trump threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports in response to Beijing's new export controls, escalating recent tensions. Despite the aggressive tariff rhetoric, Trump also expressed optimism, stating "I think we're going to do fine with China" and mentioning a planned meeting with President Xi Jinping. The conversation is seen as a potential step toward de-escalating the trade dispute.</p>

          <p>Meta has announced it will roll out new parental controls for its AI characters on platforms like Instagram and Facebook, responding to an inquiry from the Federal Trade Commission. The upcoming features, expected early next year, will allow parents to monitor their teens' interactions, block specific AI characters, and disable one-on-one chats entirely. This move follows criticism and reports that the company's AI chatbots engaged in inappropriate conversations with minors. Meta is implementing these changes to enhance safety and address concerns about the potential harm of AI companions on young users.</p>

          <p>A stampede at the state funeral for Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga has resulted in dozens of injuries, with at least 17 people hospitalized. The incident occurred as thousands of mourners gathered at a Nairobi soccer stadium to pay their respects to the influential political figure, who died at age 80. This event follows a day of unrest where security forces reportedly killed at least three people while trying to disperse crowds of mourners. Odinga, a former prime minister and five-time presidential candidate, was a pivotal figure in Kenya's transition to a multi-party democracy and is being honored with a seven-day national mourning period.</p>

          <p>Forty years ago, basketball star Lynette Woodard made history by becoming the first woman to join the Harlem Globetrotters, breaking barriers in a male-dominated sport. An Olympic gold medalist and a record-setting player at the University of Kansas, Woodard was selected from a pool of 60 women who tried out in 1985. Her two-year tenure with the iconic team paved the way for future female players and further solidified her legacy as a trailblazer. After her time with the Globetrotters, Woodard played professionally overseas and in the WNBA, and she has since been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame twice.</p>

          <p>The UK government's attempt to prevent a judicial review of its decision to ban the direct-action group Palestine Action under terrorism laws has been rejected by the Court of Appeal. This ruling allows the group's co-founder, Huda Ammori, to proceed with a High Court challenge against the proscription, which criminalizes support for the organization. The court determined that a judicial review would be a faster and more appropriate way to assess the legality of the ban than the government's proposed internal review process. The decision is seen as a significant victory for the group and its supporters, who argue the ban is a misuse of counter-terror laws.</p>

The report advises that the U.S. must safeguard its interests against China's ambitions while simultaneously pursuing strategies to manage the rivalry, similar to its approach during the Cold War.

Following numerous lawsuits, major producers like Johnson & Johnson have transitioned from talc-based to cornstarch-based powders, which are not considered a cancer risk.</p>

          <p>An estimated one billion birds die each year in the United States from colliding with glass windows, a danger second only to cats and habitat loss. During migration, birds are often deceived by transparent or reflective glass, mistaking it for open sky or habitat, leading to fatal impacts. Volunteer groups like Lights Out DC monitor buildings and collect data, revealing that a few architectural designs are responsible for a large share of deaths. In response, a new Bird Collision Prevention Alliance is promoting solutions, such as installing dotted film on windows, which has been shown to reduce collisions by up to 95%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 stock market experienced a sharp drop as investor anxiety spread from the United States banking sector. The sell-off was triggered by two U.S. regional lenders, Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank, which disclosed issues with bad or fraudulent loans. This news sparked fears of broader instability, causing shares of major UK banks like Barclays and Standard Chartered to fall over 5%. While there is no evidence of similar issues with UK banks, analysts describe the market reaction as a knee-jerk response to potential systemic risk in the financial sector.

          <p>OpenAI has disabled the ability of its AI video generator, Sora, to create deepfake videos of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., calling some of the content "disrespectful." The decision came after a public request from Dr. King's estate and his daughter, Bernice A. King, to stop the creation of AI-generated clips of the late civil rights leader. The viral app had been used to create bizarre and offensive scenarios involving historical figures, raising ethical concerns about rewriting history and the spread of misinformation. While OpenAI has paused images of Dr. King, it still permits the creation of videos featuring other public figures.</p>

          <p>As exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grow in popularity, financial advisors are warning investors about common mistakes that can negatively impact their portfolios. One major error is "chasing performance" or following a herd mentality into trendy, thematic funds like AI or crypto, which are often volatile and narrowly focused. Another frequent misstep is ignoring expense ratios, as seemingly small differences in fees can significantly erode returns over time. With the ETF market surpassing $11 trillion, experts stress the importance of understanding these products and ensuring they align with long-term, diversified investment strategies rather than short-term trends.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a bill that would have banned the use of toxic PFAS "forever chemicals" in cookware and other consumer products. Public health advocates fear the decision could hinder similar legislative efforts in other states, as California often sets national environmental policy trends. In his veto message, Newsom cited concerns about the bill's impact on the availability of affordable cookware, an argument that followed intense lobbying from the industry. Advocates called the veto a blow to public health, arguing that safe and affordable alternatives to PFAS-coated pans are widely available.</p>

          <p>China is tightening its control over the global supply of rare earth elements by expanding its export regulations to include products made abroad using Chinese technology or materials. However, analysts are skeptical about Beijing's ability to enforce these new rules on a global scale. A Morgan Stanley report notes that unlike the U.S., China lacks the established legal frameworks, international licensing regimes, and allied cooperation necessary for such broad enforcement. The move is seen as part of the ongoing trade conflict with the U.S., but its practical implementation faces significant challenges.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on her decision to marry her partner of three decades primarily to gain access to his SAG-AFTRA health insurance. The arrangement, which she once joked about in her comedy routine, became a practical necessity after she lost her own coverage. However, the "forever" promise of that insurance later vanished due to policy changes, forcing her to confront the illusion of permanence. The author draws parallels between her experience and the precariousness of life in Los Angeles, from racial covenants on property deeds to the potential overturning of legal protections, concluding that true permanence lies in choice, not paperwork.</p>

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has ruled that the BBC committed a "serious breach" of broadcasting rules by failing to disclose a significant conflict of interest in its documentary "Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone." The program, narrated by the 13-year-old son of a Hamas official, was deemed "materially misleading" because this connection was not revealed to the audience. Ofcom stated this omission deprived viewers of critical context and had the potential to erode trust in the broadcaster.

          <p>Millions of Americans, particularly early retirees not yet eligible for Medicare, face substantial health insurance premium increases if the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies expire at the end of the year.

Without them, an older couple with an income just over the original eligibility threshold could see their monthly premiums rise by nearly 300%. This potential "subsidy cliff" would force many to deplete retirement savings or forgo necessary medical care to afford coverage. (not investment advice)</p>
