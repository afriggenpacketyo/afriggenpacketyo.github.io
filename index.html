          <p>While China's government bond yields have recently risen, economists predict that persistent deflationary pressures will keep borrowing costs low.  The rise is attributed to factors like PBOC liquidity management and DeepSeek's impact on market sentiment.  Despite low interest rates, consumer confidence remains weak, hindering credit demand. <i></i><br>(not investment advice)<i></i></p>
