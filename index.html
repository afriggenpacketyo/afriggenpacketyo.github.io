        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thursday's newspapers are filled with speculation regarding potential US military action against Iran, with the Metro calling it "ArmagedDon" and citing Iranian threats of retaliation. The Guardian highlights Trump's ambiguous stance, while the Financial Times focuses on the US's capacity to destroy Iran's nuclear sites. The Times reports the UK is considering military support for the US, and the Daily Telegraph reveals legal warnings against UK involvement. The Daily Mail focuses on rising welfare costs, and the Daily Mirror criticizes welfare reforms. The Daily Express features an interview with Dame Esther Rantzen's daughter advocating for assisted dying, and the Daily Star mocks Royal Ascot's trash disposal. Optimism regarding global stability is low as tensions rise.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Justice Department cannot represent Donald Trump in his appeal of the $83 million defamation case brought by E. Jean Carroll. The court denied Trump's request for DOJ lawyers to argue on his behalf, meaning American taxpayers will not fund the appeal. Carroll was awarded damages after Trump defamed her in 2019 when denying her accusation of sexual assault. The DOJ had argued that Trump's alleged conduct fell within his presidential role, but the court disagreed. Oral arguments for the appeal are scheduled for June 24.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, during a press conference about the installation of new flagpoles at the White House, jokingly inquired about the immigration status of the construction workers. After discussing his administration's deportation efforts, Trump turned to the workers and asked if any were undocumented immigrants. The workers shook their heads, and Trump added, "If there were, we'll find out." He also remarked that their lives could be "destroyed" due to the press conference. These comments came as Trump instructed ICE officers to pursue a mass deportation program.</p>

          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated that Israel's military actions against Iran are aimed at eliminating its nuclear capabilities, not pursuing regime change. Herzog accused Iran of "cheating" and "rushing to the bomb," while asserting that a change in regime could bring peace to the region. He emphasized that Israel's strikes have had a genuine impact on Iran's nuclear program. The Group of Seven countries have expressed support for Israel, while China has condemned Israel's violation of Iran's sovereignty. Herzog noted that back channel talks and dialogue with world leaders are ongoing to de-escalate the situation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As President Donald Trump imposes tariffs, companies are using "tariff engineering" to lower duty costs by altering product materials and classifications. This legal practice involves modifying items to fit into different "harmonized system codes." For example, some manufacturers bundled steel and aluminum to qualify for lower duties, but now remove them due to increased tariffs on those materials. Companies like Columbia Sportswear and Converse have also used strategic design choices to save on tariffs, such as adding pockets to shirts or fuzzy felt to sneaker soles. This practice allows businesses to navigate the complex tariff system and reduce their financial liabilities.</p>

While the US government supports Israel's defense efforts, it has not officially participated in the military conflict. However, President Donald Trump has indicated that he is considering US involvement, and senior White House officials are reportedly planning for a possible US attack.</p>

          <p>Many California households struggle with high transportation costs, making car ownership unaffordable. A United Way study found that 35% of California households cannot afford basic living costs, including transportation. The average cost of owning a new car is over $12,000 per year, posing a significant challenge for low-income families. For some, like Franchescoli Andrade, this means relying on public transportation, which can involve long commutes. Despite these challenges, people like Andrade are determined to save up for a car to improve their family's situation.</p>
