          <p>A Christian girls' summer camp in Kerr County, Texas, was devastated by a sudden flash flood from the Guadalupe River, which rose 26 feet in under an hour. The deluge destroyed low-lying cabins, leading to a significant number of fatalities, including young campers and the camp's director. With dozens dead in the county and search efforts ongoing for missing children and a counselor, the community is grappling with the tragedy and questions about camp safety. Survivors recount horrific scenes as the area transforms from a place of joy into a disaster zone.</p>

          <p>The jury has begun deliberations in the retrial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, who face charges of manslaughter by gross negligence in the death of their newborn baby, Victoria. The couple was the subject of a nationwide manhunt in 2023 after their car was found abandoned and burnt out with evidence of a recent birth. The baby was later found deceased in a shopping bag in Brighton, having died in a tent on the South Downs. While already convicted of lesser charges, the jury in the initial trial could not reach a verdict on the more serious manslaughter charge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ESPN is receiving backlash for its social media post announcing the death of former Chicago White Sox pitcher Bobby Jenks at age 44 from stomach cancer. The post described the two-time All-Star as having been "on the roster" for the 2005 World Series-winning team, a phrasing that fellow players and fans found dismissive of his crucial role as the team's closer. Jenks was instrumental in securing the championship, which ended an 88-year drought for the franchise. The incident has sparked a conversation about how media outlets report on the passing of notable figures.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood early Monday resulted in three fatalities and ten injuries, including two juveniles who are expected to survive. The incident occurred at a large gathering of around 40 people, where police believe an exchange of gunfire took place. Officers had been monitoring the block over the weekend due to previous disturbances and made one arrest at the scene, recovering a weapon.

President Trump and Governor Ron DeSantis promoted the camp, located in a hostile environment with extreme heat and hurricane risks, while the Florida GOP sold merchandise mocking the situation. Democratic Congressman Maxwell Frost described the facility as a "hell on earth" and condemned the dehumanizing treatment of migrants.

For decades, credit for the 1961 murals was mistakenly given to her boss. The Dodgers, seeking to install a similar design in their clubhouse, tracked down Bennett for her blessing and advice, ultimately creating a sign that credits her as the inspiration. This act provides public recognition that the airport itself has not, resolving a long-standing issue for the artist who designed a signature visual element of Los Angeles.</p>

This move is politically sensitive, particularly concerning Beijing's view of Taiwan's sovereignty.

          <p>A new analysis critiques the nationwide Medicaid work requirement included in President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," arguing it will not significantly increase employment but will cause millions to lose health coverage. The article asserts that most eligible Medicaid recipients are already working, caring for family, or in school, meaning the policy primarily functions as a burdensome reporting mandate. This red tape is expected to create massive administrative costs for states and cause eligible individuals to be disenrolled due to complex paperwork and faulty systems. Critics argue the policy is designed to reduce coverage through administrative friction rather than to genuinely encourage work.</p>

          <p>Two soldiers in the British Army have been dismissed after a court martial found them guilty of sharing grossly offensive material. The signallers, Zakariya Munir and Mohammed Salah, distributed graphic helmet-camera footage from the October 7 Hamas attacks, which depicted dead bodies being kicked and urinated on. They also shared a video of an Islamic State execution. The judge advocate general condemned their actions, stating that the videos showed violated bodies and likely war crimes, and emphasized that such behavior is contrary to the values of the British Army.</p>

          <p>Zambia has enacted new cybersecurity legislation that has drawn criticism from rights groups who argue it threatens freedom of expression and privacy. The laws grant the government broad powers to intercept and surveil all electronic communications and bring the national cybersecurity agency directly under the president's office. While the government defends the laws as necessary to combat digital crimes like fraud and identity theft, critics point to vague definitions and harsh penalties as tools to stifle dissent. The move reflects a broader trend in Africa where governments are passing restrictive cyber laws that impact digital rights.</p>

          <p>Fellow organizers allege that the detention of Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, a prominent 25-year-old farm worker activist in Washington state, was politically motivated. Juarez Zeferino, who played a key role in securing overtime pay and heat protections for farm workers, was arrested by ICE agents in March based on a years-old deportation order he was reportedly unaware of. His colleagues believe his successful advocacy made him a target for the Trump administration, which has been accused of using immigration enforcement to silence political opponents. ICE denies the allegations, stating he is an "illegal alien with a final order of removal."</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his public attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, demanding significant interest rate cuts to boost the economy. However, economists argue that the central bank's independent and consensus-driven structure largely insulates it from direct presidential control. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets rates, is composed of 12 members, most of whom Trump cannot replace in the short term. While the president's rhetoric is a notable departure from tradition, the Fed's historical nonpartisanship and Powell's public resistance suggest that policy will continue to be based on economic data, not political pressure.

          <p>California's landmark 2021 law making ethnic studies a high school graduation requirement has unraveled into a bitter controversy. The initiative, intended to elevate the experiences of marginalized groups, is now at the center of lawsuits and political battles over its content, particularly its characterization of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Jewish groups have alleged that some curricula are antisemitic, while academics defend the material as central to the discipline's critique of colonialism. The conflict has led to Governor Newsom withholding funding, potentially collapsing the requirement and showcasing how national political polarization is deeply infiltrating even liberal states' education systems.</p>

          <p>While Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement heavily emphasizes diet and lifestyle changes, it has been notably silent on policies to address America's widespread sleep deprivation. Key MAHA figures acknowledge that poor sleep is linked to chronic diseases, yet Kennedy, as Health Secretary, has not proposed any significant interventions. The article suggests this may be because sleep is difficult to legislate, with causes ranging from late school start times for teens to economic pressures on adults. This gap illustrates the challenge of translating wellness advice into effective public policy.</p>

This new push prioritizes individuals with undisclosed criminal histories or those deemed a national security risk, but critics fear it could be weaponized against political opponents, echoing its use during the Red Scare. The administration has suggested high-profile targets like Elon Musk and Zohran Mamdani.

The project has also fractured families, with compensation money creating greed and division, and the influx of oil workers altering social dynamics.

This weakness is attributed to a downturn in the property sector and declining income expectations among households.
