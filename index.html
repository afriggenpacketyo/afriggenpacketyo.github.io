          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane. Baldoni accused them of civil extortion and defamation after Lively filed a complaint alleging sexual harassment and retaliation, which Baldoni denied. A defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which initially reported Lively's complaint, was also dismissed. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete victory, while Baldoni's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment, with Baldoni having the option to amend some claims by June 23.</p>

Short-term CDs, ranging from three to twelve months, offer higher rates than long-term CDs currently, providing an opportunity for a sizable return with less risk of sacrificing access to funds. While high-yield savings accounts offer similar flexibility, their rates are variable and subject to change, making CDs a more stable option.

          <p>Executives from the U.S. host city committees for the 2026 World Cup have admitted to "uncertainty" due to recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. The raids, along with slow visa processing times and travel bans, raise concerns about welcoming foreign visitors to the tournament. Host city committees are focused on providing a welcoming environment but are wary of the contrast with immigration crackdowns. They expressed confidence that FIFA and the federal government are addressing these issues to ensure a successful and inclusive event.</p>

          <h2>Gender Gap Widens on Support for Abortion Rights, Poll Reveals</h2>

          <p>A new Gallup poll shows a record divergence between men and women on their support for abortion rights, three years after the overturn of Roe v Wade. Sixty-one percent of women identify as "pro-choice," compared to only 41% of men, marking the largest gap in decades of polling. This shift is attributed more to increased support among women since Roe's collapse than to changes in men's attitudes. The poll also reveals a record disagreement over the morality of abortion, with 57% of women and 40% of men viewing it as moral.</p>

          <p>Robinhood shares experienced a 2% drop after the online brokerage was not selected to join the S&P 500 in the latest quarterly rebalance. Despite speculation and a recent rally, the stock was snubbed, disappointing investors who anticipated the inclusion. Companies added to the S&P 500 typically benefit from increased trading volume and passive fund investments, as seen with Coinbase's 24% surge after its inclusion. Robinhood's shares have still seen a significant comeback this year, up 97%, following a period of decline after the GameStop trading frenzy and the collapse of FTX.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is splitting into two separate companies, raising concerns about the future of TNT Sports. One company will focus on streaming and studios, while the other, Global Networks, will house legacy cable networks and TNT Sports. The decision leaves the fate of live sports rights held by TNT uncertain, as U.S. sports have not been a major driver of HBO Max sign-ups. TNT Sports could be licensed to the Streaming and Studios business, merged with another entity, or monetized differently, with potential tax implications to consider.</p>

          <p>The clean energy transition requires a significant increase in the extraction and processing of critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and copper. These minerals are essential for technologies like solar panels, batteries, and electric motors, and the demand for them is expected to surge in the coming years. However, the uneven distribution of these resources and potential supply chain disruptions pose challenges to the widespread adoption of clean energy. Innovation in mining techniques, material substitution, and recycling efforts are crucial to overcoming these constraints and ensuring a sustainable transition to a greener economy.</p>

Maximus has spent over $2 million lobbying the federal government and its stock price reportedly increased when states re-examined Medicaid eligibility after the pandemic.
