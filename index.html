          <h2>Japan's Economy Contracts Amid Weak Spending and Global Uncertainties</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a 0.7 percent annualized contraction in the January-March period, marking the first decline in a year, according to recent government data. This contraction is attributed to sluggish domestic demand due to inflation and increased import costs, with private consumption only inching up by 0.04 percent. Additionally, exports fell by 0.6 percent, impacted by a decline in charges for intellectual property rights and R&D services, while economists anticipate further slowdowns in subsequent quarters, contingent on negotiations with the United States regarding tariffs. The government is preparing an economic package to ease the impact of inflation and U.S. levies before the House of Councillors election this summer.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is revisiting the assisted dying bill, sparking intense debate following significant revisions. The bill, which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives, has undergone scrutiny by a parliamentary committee, resulting in amendments like removing the need for a High Court judge's approval. Amidst the debate, the government has quietly revised its impact assessment, acknowledging errors in calculating potential uptake of assisted dying services. Strong opinions persist on both sides, with opponents raising concerns about the bill's fitness and potential impacts on vulnerable individuals, while supporters emphasize the need for compassionate end-of-life options.</p>

          <p>At an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering in South Korea, nations are actively seeking engagement with the United States Trade Representative to address concerns over impending U.S. tariffs. With a 90-day pause on tariffs set to expire in July, countries throughout the region are eager to negotiate and mitigate potential economic impacts. The meeting provided a critical opportunity for Asian economies and the U.S. to convene following President Trump's initial announcement and subsequent suspension of reciprocal tariffs, which had disproportionately affected imports from Asian trading partners. South Korea's trade minister noted the increased urgency among participating countries, reflecting the significant economic implications of the looming tariff deadline.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, the Gulf states showcased extravagant displays of wealth and hospitality, signaling their eagerness to strengthen ties with the U.S. and advance their economic interests. Agreements totaling trillions of dollars were pledged, including a $1.2 trillion economic exchange with Qatar and a $600 billion investment promise from Saudi Arabia. While some question the feasibility of these large figures, the visit underscored the Gulf states' desire to be at the forefront of partnerships with the U.S. in business, military, and technology, with some viewing the announcements as competition between the Gulf states for closer ties with the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump, on his first major foreign trip of his second term, has signaled a willingness to overlook past conflicts in the Middle East to foster peace and economic partnerships. This approach contrasts sharply with his domestic policies, where he has initiated investigations into political rivals and utilized executive powers to target critics. Trump's shift towards reconciliation extends to Iran and Syria, with the lifting of sanctions and a meeting with Syria's new president, despite past ties to Al Qaeda. However, Trump remains less forgiving towards domestic opponents, pursuing legal and political action against those he perceives as disloyal or critical.</p>

NJ Transit's bus system continues to operate, and the agency hired private buses, but they can only accommodate about 20 percent of displaced train riders.

          <p>China's advanced PL-15E air-to-air missiles faced their first combat test during a skirmish between Pakistan and India, marking a significant milestone for the country's military modernization. The deployment of the Chinese-made missiles by the Pakistan Air Force underscores the growing capabilities of China's air-to-air missile systems. This event sparks discussions about the potential expansion of air-to-air missile exports as Beijing challenges the Western-dominated global arms market, though accurately assessing the missile's performance remains difficult due to conflicting claims from both sides.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers has conducted an extensive genetic analysis, tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas and shedding light on prehistoric human expansion. The study reveals that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region, and that early migrants to South America formed distinct groups due to environmental conditions. These findings could provide insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced major population declines.</p>

This shift was driven by concerns over the U.S. economy and asset performance due to trade uncertainties, with Japanese assets viewed as a safe haven.
