          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has threatened former President Jair Bolsonaro with imprisonment for allegedly violating a social media ban. The ban, which includes an ankle monitor, was imposed due to allegations of plotting a coup. The recent issue arose after allies circulated a video of a speech Bolsonaro gave to journalists, which the judge believes was intended for social media dissemination through third parties. This has sparked a debate in Brazil over whether news interviews are included in such a ban.</p>

          <p>A Bangladeshi F-7 military training jet crashed into a school in Dhaka, resulting in the deaths of at least 27 people, many of whom were students. The pilot, who was also killed, reportedly experienced a mechanical fault shortly after takeoff and attempted to steer the aircraft away from crowded areas. This incident marks the country's deadliest aviation disaster in decades, injuring over 170 people and prompting a national day of mourning. An investigation has been launched to determine the exact cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce its first-ever sanctions targeting people-smuggling operations, a key part of its strategy to curb illegal Channel crossings. The measures will name and freeze the assets of gang leaders, corrupt officials, and companies involved in supplying equipment like small boats. This new financial action aims to disrupt the criminal networks that profit from organizing these dangerous journeys. The move comes amid increasing pressure on the government to address the rising number of migrant crossings.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has shown a distinct preference for using tariffs as a primary tool for international leverage, often blurring the line with traditional sanctions. Unlike sanctions, which typically require complex legal frameworks, tariffs can be deployed unilaterally by the president to exert rapid economic pressure, aligning with an "America First" agenda. This approach has been used to address trade deficits and influence non-trade issues like immigration and drug trafficking, creating significant uncertainty in global markets.

          <p>Slovenian writer Ana Schnabl critiques the Western publishing industry's tendency to expect authors from the Balkans to produce work centered on historical trauma and political conflict. In an opinion piece, she recounts being advised to write about themes specific to her culture's difficult history, implying a lack of interest in universal stories from the region. Schnabl argues this expectation exoticizes and limits Balkan writers, reinforcing a perception of the region as perpetually tragic, rather than embracing the diverse, contemporary voices emerging from it.</p>

          <p>According to an analysis by property portal Zoopla, the average monthly cost of renting a home in the UK has risen by £221, or 21%, over the past three years. The sharp increase is attributed to high tenant demand coupled with a shortage of available rental properties. This financial pressure has forced some tenants to make career decisions based on local rent affordability and led to more parents assisting their adult children with living costs. While the rate of increase is now slowing, rents continue to rise sharply in more affordable areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The program grants temporary protection from deportation and work permits to individuals from countries deemed unsafe. While the court acknowledged the plaintiffs have a plausible case, it found insufficient evidence to block the policy while the lawsuit continues. The administration argues the program is meant to be temporary and that conditions in both countries have improved enough for recipients to return.</p>

          <p>Critics are accusing President Trump of attempting to divert public attention away from the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case. This comes after the administration faced backlash for its handling of Epstein-related files. In a series of social media posts, Trump focused on wide-ranging topics, such as demanding the Washington Commanders football team revert to its old name and attacking political rivals. Commentators like former Congressman Joe Walsh and Rev. Al Sharpton suggest these actions are a deliberate strategy to distract from the Epstein issue.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they may have an unintended positive consequence. The economic pressure from these tariffs is compelling countries like Canada, China, and the European Union to confront and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers. By exposing domestic protectionism and regulatory hurdles, the tariffs are creating an impetus for these nations to liberalize their economies. This could unlock significant economic potential that was previously constrained by internal policies. (not investment advice)</p>

She stated that while the case is more complex than a simple "client list," there are still unanswered questions.

The White House Correspondents' Association condemned the move, calling it a troubling attempt to punish a media outlet for its coverage.
