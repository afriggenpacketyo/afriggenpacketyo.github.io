          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a $50 billion federal fund to support rural hospitals will be available in early September. This fund was established to counteract the effects of significant Medicaid cuts included in a recent major legislative package. The legislation also introduced stricter Medicaid work requirements, which Oz defended, stating the goal is to help able-bodied recipients connect with the job market. The Congressional Budget Office estimates these changes could lead to 10 million Americans losing Medicaid coverage over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A number of former Justice Department attorneys are running for elected office after resigning in protest of what they describe as the politicization of the agency under the Trump administration. These candidates, who lack traditional political backgrounds, are leveraging their experience as career prosecutors to campaign on restoring the rule of law. Figures like Ryan Crosswell in Pennsylvania and Erika Evans in Seattle cite the dismantling of anti-corruption and civil rights divisions as key motivators for their shift into electoral politics. Their campaigns are reportedly resonating with voters concerned about the recent changes within the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>A critical zero-day vulnerability in on-premise versions of Microsoft's SharePoint Server is being actively exploited by hackers, placing government agencies and private companies at significant risk. The exploit, dubbed "ToolShell," allows attackers to gain full control of servers without credentials, steal data, and access connected services like Outlook and Teams. Cybersecurity firm Eye Security identified the vulnerability, which has reportedly compromised over 400 servers globally, including a confirmed targeting of the National Nuclear Security Administration. Microsoft has released emergency patches and is urging administrators to update systems and rotate cryptographic keys immediately.</p>

He revealed that his wife, Kayla, gave birth to their fifth child, a daughter named Aine, in the back of a car while on the way to a hospital in New Zealand. Aki, who was in Brisbane for the first Test match at the time, learned of the birth through a video call just before a team meeting. The 35-year-old center had not seen his family for eight weeks and had yet to meet his newborn daughter, expressing his excitement to reunite with them.</p>

          <p>Smoke from hundreds of ongoing wildfires in Canada is causing hazy skies and poor air quality across several states in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast. Air quality alerts have been issued in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, and parts of Illinois and Indiana, with officials advising residents to limit outdoor activities. Minnesota is experiencing its longest continuous air quality alert on record. The National Weather Service attributes the smoke's spread to persistent wind patterns, which are expected to continue, potentially prolonging the adverse conditions for the foreseeable future as over 500 fires burn out of control in Canada.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with potential payouts estimated to be less than £950 per deal.

The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion and cover agreements dating back to 2007. The regulator advised consumers to complain directly to their loan providers rather than using claims management companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a self-imposed deadline passing without a new trade agreement, negotiations between the U.S. and Canada are set to continue. The U.S. recently increased tariffs to 35% on some Canadian goods, justified by claims of non-cooperation on drug trafficking, a charge Canada denies. However, nearly 90% of Canadian exports remain duty-free under the existing CUSMA/USMCA trade pact, providing a buffer against the new levies. Analysts suggest that while businesses desire certainty, both sides feel pressure to secure a quality deal, with Canada's new government taking a less rushed approach than its predecessor.

          <p>A 27-year-old woman was arrested in Kaiwaka, New Zealand, after a two-year-old girl was found alive inside her suitcase in the luggage compartment of a bus. The bus driver became suspicious after noticing the bag moving and opened it to find the child, who was reportedly very hot but otherwise physically unharmed. The girl was taken to a hospital for medical assessment. The woman has been charged with ill-treatment and neglect of a child. Police commended the bus driver for his immediate action, which they said prevented a potentially much worse outcome.</p>

          <p>President Trump directed a social media tirade at radio host Charlamagne Tha God, calling him a "racist sleazebag" with a "low IQ" following an interview on Fox News. During the segment, Charlamagne suggested that the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files could cause a schism in the MAGA movement and create an opportunity for traditional conservatives to reclaim the Republican Party. Trump's post questioned why the host is allowed to use "God" in his name and criticized him for knowing "nothing about me or what I have done."</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are turning up the heat, adding dozens of new spicy menu items in an effort to attract Gen Z and Gen Alpha customers. Brands like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell are launching spicy sauces, sides, and main dishes, which are often less expensive to implement than new proteins. This trend is driven by data showing younger generations' preference for bold, adventurous flavors, with up to 50% of Gen Z consumers eating spicy food weekly. Social media platforms like TikTok are playing a key role, as viral taste tests and challenges help drive the popularity of these limited-time offers.</p>

          <p>The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has reported that an Israeli military attack on its headquarters in Khan Younis, Gaza, killed one of its workers and injured three others. The humanitarian group described the overnight shelling as "deliberate," stating the building was clearly marked with the protective red emblem and its location was known to the Israeli military. The attack reportedly sparked a fire in the building. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC it was reviewing the claim. The UN Human Rights office expressed outrage and called for an independent investigation into the continued killings of emergency workers.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won the Hungarian Grand Prix, holding off a late charge from his teammate and championship rival, Oscar Piastri. After dropping to fifth on the opening lap, Norris executed a bold one-stop tire strategy to regain the lead, a move he later admitted he wasn't sure would work. Piastri, on fresher tires, closed the gap in the final laps but was unable to overtake on the notoriously difficult Hungaroring circuit. The victory narrows Piastri's championship lead to just nine points as Formula 1 heads into its summer break, setting up an intense battle for the second half of the season.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has departed for its August recess without reaching a deal to advance dozens of President Trump's stalled nominees, following days of contentious negotiations. Democrats have been blocking fast-track confirmations, forcing lengthy roll-call votes on each candidate. The standoff culminated in Trump attacking Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on social media, telling him to "GO TO HELL!" Republican leaders have suggested they may seek to change Senate rules in September to expedite the confirmation process, a move Schumer warned would be a "huge mistake" for future bipartisan cooperation.</p>

          <p>Germany's birth rate fell to a new low of 1.35 children per woman in 2024, fueling a debate over the country's demographic and economic future. While some, like author Julia Brandner who chose sterilization, see it as female self-determination, others fear a shrinking population will harm prosperity. Sociologists link the decline to multiple crises like the pandemic and inflation, creating uncertainty for young people. Experts argue the focus should be on bridging the "fertility gap"—the difference between the desired number of children (1.8) and the actual rate—by improving family-friendly policies like reliable and affordable childcare.</p>

          <p>A satirical article in The Atlantic imagines how tours at U.S. national parks and historic sites might change to align with a political agenda that avoids controversial aspects of American history. The piece humorously rewrites narratives for sites like the Stonewall National Monument, Manzanar, and the Selma to Montgomery Trail, replacing historical context with generic praise for natural beauty or sanitized, vague descriptions of events. For example, it suggests the Trail of Tears was a "fun trail to walk voluntarily" and the Civil War was fought "over nothing." The article serves as a sharp critique of efforts to alter historical education.</p>

          <p>China has granted export permits to 183 additional Brazilian coffee companies, a move that provides a significant alternative market for Brazil's coffee industry. This development comes as the United States is set to impose a steep 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee and other goods, creating a major challenge for exporters who sell approximately 8 million bags to the U.S. annually. While the U.S. has historically been a much larger market for Brazilian coffee than China, this approval signals a potential shift in global trade dynamics for the major commodity producer.
