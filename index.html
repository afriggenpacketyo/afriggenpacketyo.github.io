          <p>The Department of Justice announced that two individuals, Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine, have pleaded guilty to federal gun charges for illegally selling the SKS rifle used in the alleged assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Court documents reveal Cooper acted as a middleman for Oxendine, selling the firearm to Ryan Routh for $350, knowing he was a convicted felon prohibited from owning guns. Prosecutors state this is the same weapon Routh was found with at Trump's golf club, providing new details on how he acquired it, though the sellers claim no prior knowledge of his alleged plans.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined a request from Florida officials to lift a lower court's injunction against a state law that criminalizes the entry of undocumented immigrants into Florida. The decision keeps the law on hold while legal challenges proceed, based on the argument that it unconstitutionally infringes on the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration. The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, has been criticized by civil liberties groups as cruel and dangerous. A federal judge previously found the state's attorney general in contempt for failing to ensure the law was not being enforced.</p>

          <p>Tim Leiweke, the CEO of prominent venue management company Oak View Group, has been federally indicted on a criminal conspiracy charge for allegedly rigging the bid for the University of Texas's $338 million Moody Center arena. The indictment accuses Leiweke of conspiring with a competitor, reportedly Legends Hospitality, to have them drop their bid in exchange for lucrative subcontracts, a promise he later allegedly broke. In connection with the case, Oak View Group and Legends have agreed to pay penalties of $15 million and $1.5 million, respectively, while a spokesperson for Leiweke has denied any wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>Turkey's government is intensifying its suppression of independent journalism, with the country's two largest critical television stations, Sözcü TV and Halk TV, facing 10-day broadcasting bans. The state's media council, RTÜK, justified the bans by citing "incitement of the people," a move seen by observers as a new escalation in controlling the press. This follows years of increasing pressure that has left over 95% of Turkish media outlets aligned with the government. Critics, including the Turkish Journalists' Association and European officials, have condemned the action as an attempt to silence dissent and punish reporting on opposition successes.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented move, the Diocese of San Bernardino has formally lifted the obligation for Catholics to attend Mass if they fear detention by immigration authorities. This decision makes it the first diocese in the nation to issue such a special dispensation, responding directly to immigration agent activity on two of its church properties in June. Bishop Alberto Rojas enacted the measure as Catholic leaders nationwide report significant drops in Mass attendance due to the Trump administration's immigration enforcement actions. The diocese, which serves over a million Catholics, is addressing the tangible fear within its community.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California's Department of Education, alleging that its policies allowing transgender athletes to compete based on their gender identity violate federal civil rights laws. The complaint argues these policies illegally deprive female athletes of equal opportunities and create a hostile educational environment. This legal action follows threats from the administration after a transgender student won two state high school track-and-field events. California's Governor Gavin Newsom stated the state is following a law enacted in 2013 and that the administration's interpretation of Title IX has not been adopted by any court.</p>

Debt settlement can significantly reduce the total amount owed but may severely damage credit scores, while credit counseling offers a structured debt management plan that preserves credit but does not lower the principal balance. Other strategies include debt consolidation programs, which combine debts into a single loan, and temporary credit card hardship programs for those facing short-term financial difficulty.

Strategies include enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan before they are phased out, which can cap monthly bills based on income. For short-term struggles, requesting deferment or forbearance can provide a temporary pause, though interest may still accrue. Other options this article suggests are refinancing to a lower interest rate for those with good credit, seeking employer or state-based repayment assistance, and setting up autopay for a small interest rate discount.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A pattern has emerged where the Supreme Court frequently intervenes on its emergency docket to halt lower-court rulings that block controversial Trump administration policies. A recent example involves the Court pausing an injunction that prevented the administration's plan for mass layoffs of federal workers. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, criticizing the majority for second-guessing lower courts' factual findings and greenlighting legally dubious executive actions. This trend, which has been observed in cases concerning immigration, government personnel, and birthright citizenship, raises questions about the Court's willingness to grant the administration leeway while litigation is still pending.</p>

          <p>A new HBO documentary, "My Mom Jayne," directed by her daughter Mariska Hargitay, seeks to re-evaluate the legacy of actor Jayne Mansfield beyond her image as a Marilyn Monroe variant. The film explores how Mansfield, an intelligent and talented performer, strategically used her bombshell persona to navigate the restrictive Hollywood studio system of the 1950s. While acknowledging her unfulfilled dramatic potential, the documentary dignifies her as a shrewd operator and mother, not just a tragic figure. It frames her story within the context of a changing Hollywood, where her carefully crafted image eventually became a liability.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump allocates approximately $170 billion for immigration enforcement, providing a massive funding increase for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to expand its operations. The legislation includes $45 billion to nearly double ICE's detention capacity to over 100,000 beds and $30 billion to hire more deportation officers and expand state and local enforcement partnerships. This funding will supercharge the Trump administration's planned mass deportation campaign. Critics warn the unprecedented resources could lead to dire humanitarian consequences and more aggressive, indiscriminate enforcement actions across the country.</p>

The visit is already drawing criticism from Scottish political figures over the high policing costs associated with his previous trips and his controversial political stances.

          <p>Following deadly flash floods in Texas, New Mexico, and North Carolina, water rescue experts are stressing the importance of public preparedness and avoidance. Experts note that just six inches of fast-moving water can be powerful enough to knock an adult over, and survival once caught in a torrent is largely a matter of luck. They advise having a planned response rather than a reactive one, which includes owning a weather radio, understanding warning levels, and preparing a 'go-bag' with essentials. For drivers, the primary advice remains to never attempt to cross a flooded roadway, as the water's depth and the road's integrity are unknown.</p>

          <p>An earthquake swarm involving hundreds of small tremors has been detected at Mount Rainier in Washington, marking the most significant seismic activity at the volcano since 2009. The U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory reported that the swarm began early Tuesday and was ongoing, but assured the public there is no cause for concern. The earthquakes are too small to be felt at the surface and are not expected to cause any damage. Scientists believe the activity is likely caused by the movement of water within the earth's crust above the magma chamber, not by rising magma.</p>

          <p>The relationship between President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a complex dynamic of mutual need, particularly concerning the war in Gaza and regional stability. Trump is eager to secure a foreign policy win, such as a Gaza ceasefire, to bolster his legacy and pursue a Nobel Peace Prize. Netanyahu, in turn, requires U.S. support for Israel's security, especially regarding Iran, making him dependent on Trump's goodwill. This analysis suggests Netanyahu may agree to a temporary ceasefire to appease Trump, buying time while balancing his own narrow political and security objectives against the president's transactional demands.</p>

Reports based on emergency radio transmissions indicate that a request from first responders to trigger a mass alert was delayed for hours.
