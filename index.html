          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore has affirmed the company's commitment to its expansion plans despite receiving a shorter-than-usual two-year casino license renewal from regulators. The Gambling Regulatory Authority cited "unsatisfactory" tourism performance, but the resort is proceeding with a SG$6.8 billion investment. New attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium have already opened, with a focus on shifting from shopping to premium lifestyle experiences to revitalize its appeal. The company aims to be ready for its next license review in 2026.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showing a 5.8% drop in vacancies to 718,000. This decline was observed across most industries, suggesting some companies are slowing recruitment or not replacing departing employees. Despite the slowdown, wage growth remained steady at 5% and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%, indicating a more gradual cooling than some economists had predicted. The hospitality and retail sectors experienced the most significant drops in payroll employees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to its App Store rankings. Musk claims Apple's practices make it impossible for any AI company besides its partner, OpenAI, to achieve the top spot, specifically citing the placement of his xAI's Grok chatbot. This follows Musk's previous criticism of Apple's integration of OpenAI's technology at the operating system level, which he called an "unacceptable security violation." The threat adds to Apple's existing legal challenges, including a landmark antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its iPhone ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, European Union leaders have publicly appealed to Trump to ensure Ukraine has a say in any potential peace deal. In a statement signed by 26 of the 27 member states, they stressed Ukraine's right to choose its own destiny and that peace must respect international law and territorial integrity. The appeal reflects widespread European concern that Trump might make concessions to Russia at Ukraine's expense, particularly after he suggested both sides would have to cede land to end the war.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant tariff hike. Under the agreement, the U.S. will maintain its 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances and what the White House terms "unfair trade practices." Despite the truce, some business owners express concern over continued uncertainty, and trade flows between the two economic giants have already seen a significant decline this year.

The central bank noted that inflation has dropped substantially from its 2022 peak, moving closer to its target range. The decision comes amidst a changing global trade environment and softer domestic economic performance, with analysts now forecasting further rate cuts later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the severity of the heat stress has surpassed all previous records for the region. This event is part of a global bleaching crisis driven by climate change, threatening the survival of coral ecosystems worldwide as they have insufficient time to recover between events.</p>

However, the same research reveals a stark disconnect regarding the humanitarian crisis, with nearly 80% of Jewish Israelis reporting they are not troubled by the suffering and famine among Palestinians. This sentiment is contrasted by growing street protests led by hostage families who fear the government's military strategy endangers their loved ones. Experts suggest that while the desire for hostage return is high, empathy for the Palestinian plight remains very low.</p>

According to interviews with defectors and South Korean intelligence, these laborers work over 18-hour days on construction sites with minimal pay, which is largely sent back to the North Korean regime. This practice violates UN sanctions that ban the use of North Korean labor, but Russia appears to be bypassing the rule using student visas.

          <p>Spain is charting a distinct foreign policy course that is creating friction with the Trump administration, notably by resisting NATO's 5% defense spending target and pursuing closer economic ties with China. The Spanish government recently opted for European military aircraft over U.S.-made F-35s, drawing direct criticism and trade threats from President Trump. Analysts suggest Spain's minority leftist government may be using these high-profile foreign policy stances to distract from domestic issues. While a risky strategy, Spain has so far been shielded from direct U.S. tariffs due to the EU's collective trade negotiation power.</p>

          <p>A former Los Angeles Police Department reserve officer, Eric Halem, has been charged with kidnapping for ransom and robbery in connection with a December home invasion. Prosecutors allege that Halem and three other men entered a Koreatown apartment, handcuffed the victims, and then kidnapped one man, forcing him to transfer $200,000 in cryptocurrency. Halem was an active reserve officer at the time of the incident and was arrested last week by the LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division. He was already facing separate insurance fraud charges from earlier this year, which led to his police powers being stripped.</p>

The plaintiffs accuse Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference, alleging they exploited their power for their own financial self-interest.

His exit comes as GitHub faces increasing competition from a wave of new AI coding startups like Cursor and Replit, which are gaining traction among developers.

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology, and the president stated his nominee will ensure the numbers are "HONEST and ACCURATE." The move has drawn concern from some economists who fear it politicizes the independent statistical agency. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife later located the animal hiding in brush on the property and euthanized it. The girl was hospitalized for her injuries, and authorities say that while such attacks are rare, the home is near mountain lion habitat.</p>

          <p>In an effort to promote tourism in its more remote regions, Nepal has announced that it will waive climbing fees for 97 Himalayan peaks for the next two years. The mountains are located in the country's less-developed Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. This initiative contrasts with a recent fee increase for summiting Mount Everest, which will now cost $15,000 during peak season. Officials hope that making these less-explored peaks free to climb will attract more mountaineers, create jobs, and stimulate the local economies in these poorer areas of the country.</p>
