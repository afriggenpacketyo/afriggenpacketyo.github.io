          <p>A Milwaukee County circuit judge, Hannah Dugan, was arrested by the FBI for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, evade arrest. Dugan is accused of obstructing and impeding a proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest. The FBI alleges she escorted Flores Ruiz out of the courtroom through a jury door after being informed of an ICE warrant for his arrest. Dugan's attorney protests the arrest, claiming it was not in the interest of public safety, while Flores Ruiz was apprehended shortly after fleeing the courthouse.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis indicates that tariffs levied by President Trump would disproportionately hurt the poorest U.S. households. The study found that in 2026, taxes for the poorest 20% of households would rise significantly more than those in the top 1%. Tariffs are taxes paid by importers on foreign goods, and economists expect consumers to bear some of the cost through higher prices. This regressive policy hurts lower income consumers more because food and clothing make up a larger share of their budget. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Michael Gloss, the 21-year-old son of a senior CIA official, died fighting for the Russian army in Ukraine. Gloss, who had a history of anti-American sentiment, joined the Russian military after becoming disillusioned with the U.S. political system. He had previously been involved in climate protests and expressed admiration for the Brics nations. Gloss's family held a funeral for him in Fairfax, Virginia, without mentioning his involvement with the Russian army.</p>
