        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan's coast guard has requested additional funding to enhance coastal surveillance after several undetected landings by mainland Chinese individuals in inflatable boats. The request follows incidents where mainland residents crossed the Taiwan Strait, landing on sensitive shores used for military exercises. The coast guard confirmed the authenticity of a viral video showing a man claiming to have crossed the strait, raised a Chinese flag, and returned, though investigations are ongoing to determine the specifics of the crossing. Authorities are assessing the feasibility of such crossings and bolstering surveillance to prevent future breaches of Taiwan's coastal defenses.</p>

          <p>A major distributor to UK supermarkets, Peter Green Chilled, has been hit by a ransomware attack, disrupting order processing and deliveries. The logistics firm, which supplies supermarkets like Tesco, Sainsbury's, and Aldi, reported that clients are receiving regular updates and workarounds to maintain operations. The attack, which encrypted the company's data and locked them out of their computer systems, follows recent cyber-attacks on Marks & Spencer and Co-op, highlighting the increasing vulnerability of supply chains.

          <p>William Goodge, a British ultra-endurance athlete, claims to have broken the world record for running across Australia, completing the 3,800km journey in 35 days. Goodge ran the equivalent of two-and-a-half marathons daily, starting from Cottesloe Beach in Perth and finishing at Bondi Beach. The run raised money for cancer charities in memory of his mother, who died from cancer in 2018. The record is pending verification by Guinness World Records, while some in the running community have questioned the accuracy of data tracking his speed and heart rate.</p>

          <p>China is expanding its influence in Latin America by offering financial support, infrastructure investments, and visa exemptions, contrasting with what is seen as President Trump's negative approach to the region. Xi Jinping announced a $9.1 billion credit line and visa-free entry for tourists from several Latin American countries during a summit with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). This strategy positions China as a reliable partner, promoting free trade and multilateralism, while Trump's policies are viewed as protectionist and disrespectful towards the region. China's engagement includes inviting Latin American politicians to study its governance model, raising concerns about promoting autocracy.</p>

          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly adopting AI technology to address labor shortages and boost production, despite concerns among artists about copyright infringement. Japan's copyright act allows the use of copyrighted materials to train AI models without the copyright holder's consent, aiming to attract AI investors. While many artists worry about job losses, some studios are using AI to assist with coloring, background generation, and converting photos into anime, significantly reducing production time. The cultural acceptance of technology and the need to fill labor gaps are driving the integration of AI in anime production, though debates about copyright protection continue.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the electric vehicle market. CATL's IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly the largest globally this year, with funds allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply European automotive clients. The company's expansion into Europe coincides with global growth from Chinese EV makers and increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU. CATL also faces challenges related to U.S.-China trade tensions, but its core strategy remains focused on Europe and emerging regions.</p>

          <p>The parole hearing for Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, has been rescheduled for August, according to California officials. Originally set for June 13, the hearing is now scheduled for August 21 and 22, allowing the brothers and their attorneys more time to prepare. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office converted the brothers' clemency hearing into a parole hearing, and while the parole board will make a recommendation, Newsom may still approve or deny their release. The brothers, who were resentenced to 50 years-to-life, argue they acted in self-defense after years of abuse.</p>

This marks Indiana's second execution since 2009, following a hiatus due to drug shortages. Ritchie, who had been on death row for over two decades, apologized for his actions, while his attorneys argued that his legal counsel at trial was ineffective due to a failure to fully investigate evidence related to his fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure. Despite these arguments and appeals to the Supreme Court, his clemency bid was rejected, and the execution proceeded.</p>

Activists have criticized the decision as a xenophobic attack, while Homeland Security said it was a win for American safety.
