          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, have initiated a defamation lawsuit in the United States against conservative influencer Candace Owens. The suit addresses claims spread by Owens alleging that Mrs. Macron was born male, a conspiracy theory that has circulated in fringe online communities. The Macrons' legal team stated that Owens' campaign was designed to harass and cause pain, and they pursued legal action after she refused to retract the statements. Under US law, the Macrons must prove "actual malice," meaning Owens knew the information was false but published it anyway.</p>

          <h2>New Analysis Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps Significantly Reduces Risk of Death and Chronic Disease</h2>

          <p>A new analysis published in The Lancet Public Health journal suggests that taking 7,000 steps per day offers significant health benefits, challenging the widely known 10,000-step goal. The research found that a 7,000-step count was associated with a 47% lower risk of death, a 38% lower risk of dementia, and a 25% lower risk of heart disease compared to taking only 2,000 steps. The study's authors propose that 7,000 steps could serve as a more realistic and achievable public health target. Even a modest increase to 4,000 steps daily showed substantial risk reduction.</p>

          <p>IBM reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, yet its shares fell by as much as 6% in extended trading. The company's software revenue, while growing 10% to $7.39 billion, slightly missed analyst consensus, which CEO Arvind Krishna attributed to clients reprioritizing spending toward hardware. Despite this, overall revenue increased by nearly 8% year-over-year, and the company's generative AI book of business has grown to $7.5 billion. IBM maintained its full-year guidance, projecting over $13.5 billion in free cash flow for 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a comprehensive AI Action Plan designed to maintain U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence by removing regulatory hurdles. The plan includes over 90 federal policy actions, such as fast-tracking the construction of data centers and semiconductor plants, and compelling federal agencies to repeal rules that obstruct AI development. It also aims to create rules for government contractors to eliminate "ideological bias" in chatbots and to establish a program for exporting AI packages to U.S. allies. The initiative follows an executive order that removed AI guardrails imposed by the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines posted second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst estimates, with net income dropping 42% from the previous year. However, the airline indicated that travel demand has stabilized, aligning with recent trends reported by other carriers, and announced a new $2 billion share buyback program. The company has been overhauling its business model, moving away from policies like two free checked bags and introducing assigned seating. Southwest noted that initial sales of its new restrictive basic economy fares were weak but have since recovered to expected levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The word "OK" is a uniquely American invention that has become one of the most universally understood terms on the planet. Its origin is traced back to a linguistic fad in 1830s Boston, where it appeared as a playful abbreviation for "oll korrect," a deliberate misspelling of "all correct." The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, where his supporters formed "O.K. Clubs," referencing his nickname "Old Kinderhook." Its simplicity and versatility allowed it to spread globally, particularly through telegraphs, world wars, and modern technology.</p>

          <p>Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have joined Democrats in supporting the CANADA Act, a bill designed to exempt U.S. small businesses from President Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods. The legislation comes as Trump threatens a blanket 35% tariff on Canadian imports, escalating a trade dispute with America's largest export partner. Supporters of the bill argue that the tariffs harm small businesses, drive up costs, and threaten jobs that rely on cross-border trade. The proposed law would make existing and potential tariffs inapplicable to goods imported by or for small business concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein scandal has transformed from a story of sex crimes into a sprawling conspiracy theory that captivates various political subcultures, according to a Vox analysis. The article argues that the case's mysterious facts—Epstein's wealth, elite connections, and death in jail—allow different groups to project their own narratives onto it, from MAGA tales of liberal elites to Democratic hopes of exposing Trump. The Trump administration's awkward handling of the issue, especially after reports his name is in the files, has only fueled more speculation and interest from all sides, turning it into a political firestorm he cannot control.</p>

          <p>Six months into President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations since the Obama administration, with nearly 150,000 removals recorded. This pace projects to over 300,000 deportations for the year, the highest since 2014 but still far below the administration's stated goal of one million annually. The increase follows a sweeping mandate to crack down on illegal immigration, supported by unprecedented funding from a new budget bill.

This analysis explores the phenomenon of "panopticontent," where ordinary people are turned into public figures without consent, often fueled by platforms like TikTok.

The trend of overconsumption, which began in the 1970s, is visible in deforestation, biodiversity loss, and carbon accumulation. High-income countries like Qatar and the US reach their individual overshoot days much earlier in the year, highlighting the disparity in global resource use.</p>

          <p>The term "corn sweat" refers to the moisture released into the air by vast fields of corn through a process called evapotranspiration, which can significantly increase humidity during hot, sunny weather. This phenomenon is currently exacerbating a major heat wave across the Midwest, contributing to dangerously high heat index values. While evapotranspiration can have a cooling effect, the extreme humidity it produces during intense heat waves can offset this benefit, making the weather feel more oppressive and preventing temperatures from cooling down at night. This natural process highlights the environmental impact of large-scale monoculture farming.</p>
