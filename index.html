          <p>Venezuela has accused the United States of threatening its sovereignty and seeking "regime change" through military intimidation. The accusation follows a significant deployment of U.S. warships to the southern Caribbean, which the White House has described as an anti-drug trafficking operation. President Nicolás Maduro stated his country is facing its biggest threat in a century and has declared "maximum preparedness" for defense. The U.S. denies invasion plans but does not recognize Maduro's presidency, while neighboring Guyana has welcomed the American military presence.</p>

The team, which includes Jon Rahm and Shane Lowry, will face the United States at what Donald calls the Bethpage "bear pit." Donald emphasized that despite the team's continuity, the strategy will be different for an away match, focusing on overcoming a hostile environment.

This display of strong ties comes as India faces steep U.S. tariffs, imposed in retaliation for its continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. Analysts suggest that U.S. economic pressure is pushing New Delhi closer to Moscow and Beijing. The leaders discussed regional stability and trade, with bilateral trade between India and Russia reaching a record $68.7 billion last financial year.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's attempt to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi on transfer deadline day has fallen through despite the clubs agreeing on a fee of at least £35 million. The deal collapsed because Crystal Palace was unable to secure a suitable replacement for the 25-year-old captain before the transfer window closed. Palace had reportedly been targeting Igor Julio, who ultimately opted for a move to West Ham instead. The development is a setback for Liverpool, who were seeking to bolster their defense after conceding six goals in their first three games of the season.</p>

          <p>Federal data reveals a significant shift in the U.S. labor force, with the number of immigrant workers declining by 1.2 million in the first seven months of the year under President Trump's policies. This reduction, analyzed by the Pew Research Center, comes as immigration flows have slowed and deportations have increased. Economists express concern that the decline could impact sectors heavily reliant on foreign labor, such as agriculture and construction, potentially exacerbating labor shortages. The trend may also complicate economic indicators, as it could create a misleading picture of a tighter labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has sharply criticized comments from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. Pistorius called the public discussion of such plans "completely wrong" and premature before Kyiv and Moscow have even entered negotiations. He emphasized that the European Union does not have the jurisdiction to deploy troops in such a manner. His comments highlight a potential division among EU members regarding the nature and timing of long-term security commitments to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has responded to a new book ban in the province of Alberta by releasing a satirical short story. The protest comes after her classic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was among over 200 books removed from some school libraries under a new policy targeting "explicit sexual content." Atwood's new story sarcastically describes "very, very good children" who grow up without any biological realities, taking aim at the policy and its supporters. The incident reflects a growing trend of book challenges, similar to those seen in the United States, moving into Canada.</p>

Authorities reported that none of the passengers, who included a 1-year-old, were wearing proper safety restraints. The remote location of the crash complicated rescue efforts. Officials have highlighted the incident as a tragic reminder of the importance of adhering to safety protocols when operating recreational vehicles.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has publicly backed his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism over the tax implications of a past property purchase.

Starmer defended Rayner, highlighting her background as a "great story of British success" and asserting that attacks against her are a mistake.

          <p>A new study from the University of Montpellier reveals that human activities, particularly since the Middle Ages, have caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic animals. By analyzing over 225,000 animal bones from the last 8,000 years, researchers found that wild species like deer and foxes have shrunk due to habitat loss and hunting. In contrast, domesticated species such as cattle and chickens have grown larger due to selective breeding and controlled management. This highlights the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world.</p>

          <p>The intense fan enthusiasm for the Prime Video series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has escalated into online hostility, prompting the network to intervene. Passionate debates over which romantic interest the main character should choose have led to some fans harassing the show's actors online. In response, Prime Video launched a social media campaign urging viewers to "keep the conversation kind" and reinforcing its zero-tolerance policy for bullying. A psychiatrist weighs in, suggesting this behavior reflects a blurring of fiction and reality and may point to a broader societal need for connection.</p>
