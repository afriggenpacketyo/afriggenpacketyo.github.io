          <p>As China and the United States resume formal trade talks, analysts predict a spectrum of potential outcomes ranging from a deal that reduces tariffs to a complete breakdown in negotiations. The article notes that an ideal scenario would involve both sides agreeing to lower existing tariffs, whereas a worst-case scenario would see one or both parties walking away without any consensus. One potential positive outcome mentioned is a temporary suspension of import duties, similar to what the US offered other countries previously. Since Trump's return to the White House, tariffs on Chinese imports have increased significantly, prompting retaliatory measures from China.</p>

          <p>This New York Times news analysis explores China's strategy, led by Xi Jinping, to make the world dependent on its exports and know-how as a means of countering foreign pressure. The article details how China has ramped up exports, deepened its position as a manufacturing base, and introduced economic warfare tactics like export controls. China's dominance in critical minerals and magnets gives it leverage in global trade, potentially impacting consumer prices and pressuring the US government. While China still relies on the West for advanced technologies, its willingness to weaponize the supply chain poses a challenge to the US and could divide the world into competing spheres of influence.</p>

          <p>A South Korean temple has returned a 14th-century Buddha statue to its rightful Japanese owner after a protracted legal battle. The statue was stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012, but Buseoksa Temple in South Korea claimed it had been looted from them by Japanese pirates centuries ago. After years of court rulings, including a Supreme Court decision, the statue was finally handed over to representatives from Kannonji Temple in Japan.

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage footballer who was previously banned by the Football Association for a comment made to a transgender woman opponent, is now demanding an apology from the governing body. Vaughan was sanctioned for improper conduct after questioning the player's gender during a match, raising concerns about fairness and safety.
