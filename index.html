          <p>The trial for Ryan Routh, the 59-year-old man accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump at a Florida golf course in September 2024, has begun with jury selection. Routh is representing himself against federal charges including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate and several firearm violations. Prosecutors allege Routh meticulously planned the attack for weeks, armed with an AK-47-style rifle, before being spotted by a Secret Service agent. The trial is being overseen by Judge Aileen Cannon, with opening statements expected later in the week.</p>

The visit underscores the Trump administration's strategy to increase naval presence near Venezuela to disrupt narcotics trafficking, which recently included a lethal strike on a vessel allegedly carrying narco-terrorists. Puerto Rican Governor Jenniffer González-Colón welcomed the officials, highlighting the island's strategic role in the regional crackdown and supporting the administration's America First policies to secure borders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to release a significant downward revision of U.S. jobs data, potentially showing that hiring was weaker than initially reported by hundreds of thousands of jobs through March 2025. This annual benchmark revision, which provides a more accurate count of business openings and closings, could lower the average monthly job growth of 2024 from 165,000 to around 100,000. The expected revision comes amid a dramatic slowdown in hiring in recent months, adding pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has received documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, including a "birthday book" compiled for the financier in 2003. Democrats on the committee released an image of a page allegedly containing a lewd, handwritten message and signature from Donald Trump, which the President has vehemently denied writing and for which he has sued The Wall Street Journal for defamation. The White House maintains the signature is not authentic, while the committee's investigation into Epstein's records continues amid bipartisan calls for more transparency.</p>

          <p>Members of the UK Parliament are pressuring the government to reconsider its decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, following the arrest of nearly 900 people at a London protest. Critics, including Labour MP Stella Creasy, argue the ban dilutes the meaning of terrorism and infringes on free speech, noting that many arrested were peacefully protesting. However, Security Minister Dan Jarvis defended the decision, asserting that the group has connections to terrorism and that its violent methods are distinct from legitimate, peaceful demonstrations for Palestinian rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropping to its lowest level in nearly a year, prospective homebuyers can take steps to secure even better terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score, as higher scores directly translate to lower interest rates, and increasing the down payment to at least 20% to reduce lender risk and avoid private mortgage insurance. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the standard 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which can offer a significantly lower initial interest rate.

          <p>While most seniors cannot completely avoid paying for Medicare Part B, there are specific circumstances that allow for delaying enrollment or receiving financial assistance for the monthly premiums. The most common method is to remain on a creditable employer health plan after age 65, which allows for penalty-free delayed enrollment. For those with limited income, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or qualifying for Medicaid can cover the premiums. However, it is crucial to note that forgoing Part B can render seniors ineligible for essential supplemental coverage like Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans.</p>

          <p>The 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly is set to begin, bringing together delegations from all 193 member states for the world's primary forum for global diplomacy. As the only UN body with equal representation, it addresses a broad agenda of economic, social, and security issues against the backdrop of current events like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Although its resolutions are non-binding, the General Assembly serves a crucial role in setting international norms, fostering dialogue, and initiating processes that can lead to legally enforceable treaties.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision allowing federal immigration agents to resume certain enforcement tactics in Los Angeles, it is crucial for residents to understand their constitutional rights. If ICE agents come to a home, they cannot enter without a valid judicial warrant; residents have the right to keep their door closed and ask for the warrant to be shown. Individuals also have the right to remain silent and are not required to answer questions about their immigration status or sign any documents without consulting an attorney, and they have the right to contact legal counsel if detained.</p>

          <p>Following a weak August jobs report, financial markets are now pricing in a small but notable possibility that the Federal Reserve could implement a half-percentage-point interest rate cut at its next meeting. While a standard quarter-point cut remains the most likely scenario with an 88% probability, some traders believe the faltering labor market could prompt the central bank to take more aggressive easing action. The final decision will likely be influenced by upcoming inflation data, which could either solidify the case for a smaller cut or increase pressure for a larger one. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles that a lower court had blocked. The ruling, issued on the emergency "shadow docket," lifts an injunction that prevented ICE from stopping individuals based solely on factors like their apparent race, language, or type of work. In a scathing dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued the decision effectively legalizes racial profiling of Latinos, while the majority offered no explanation for its action, a common practice for rulings on this docket.</p>

          <p>France has been thrown into a political crisis after Prime Minister François Bayrou was ousted in a no-confidence vote, defeated 364 to 194 in the National Assembly.

President Emmanuel Macron must now appoint the country's fifth prime minister in under two years, facing options that include choosing a new leader from the center-right, pivoting to the left, or dissolving parliament for new elections.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has increased its settlement offer to survivors of clergy sexual assault to a minimum of $230 million in its ongoing bankruptcy case. This new figure, up from a previous offer of $180 million, is an attempt to secure the necessary two-thirds approval from the 660 claimants. The settlement amount could grow substantially larger, as it does not include potential contributions from the archdiocese's primary insurer, Travelers, which is reportedly in active negotiations to resolve its liability in the case.</p>

The survey found that the perceived probability of finding new employment after a job loss dropped to 44.9%, the lowest point since the survey began in 2013. This data reflects a significant reversal from the "Great Resignation" era, as a cooling labor market with slower hiring has led workers to cling to their current positions amid economic uncertainty.</p>
