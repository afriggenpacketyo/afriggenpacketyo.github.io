          <p>In Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, two children and one adult were struck by a car outside a church preschool. Authorities believe the incident may have been intentional, leading to a manhunt for the suspect, Justin Collin Adams, who was later found in a boat on the island. One child and the adult were hospitalized, but the child has since been discharged. The suspect ditched his sedan after the crash and was believed to be on foot and armed with a knife following the crash, according to Storen. The FBI and U.S. Marshals were involved in the search, police said.</p>

          <p>Amazon's first-quarter results exceeded expectations, but the company provided cautious guidance for the current period, citing uncertainty related to President Trump's tariffs and potential recessionary fears. CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged the difficulty in predicting the impact of the tariffs, particularly those levied on goods from China. Despite these challenges, Jassy expressed optimism that Amazon could emerge stronger due to its ability to offer low prices, similar to its performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amazon's cloud division revenue came in slightly below consensus estimates, while advertising revenue was a bright spot, growing 19% year over year.</p>

          <p>The Chamber of Commerce has requested the Trump administration to provide tariff exclusions for small businesses importing goods, warning that the tariffs could harm America's Main Street and potentially trigger a recession. In a letter to the Treasury Secretary, the Chamber's CEO, Suzanne Clark, emphasized that small businesses lack the financial reserves to withstand increased tariffs, particularly the steep 145% levy on products from China. Clark urged immediate action to protect small businesses and prevent economic downturn. If tariffs persist, small business owners could end up passing off the cost to customers in the form of higher prices.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services Secretary, is requesting the CDC to develop new guidance for treating measles, including the use of drugs and vitamins, despite his promotion of unfounded claims about measles cures. Kennedy has praised the use of budesonide and clarithromycin, citing anecdotal evidence of their effectiveness, but medical experts caution against relying on unproven therapies. The CDC has also warned against overuse of vitamin A, which Kennedy has suggested as a treatment, as high doses can be toxic. The American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes that vaccination remains the only way to prevent measles and that promoting unproven treatments is misleading and dangerous.</p>

          <p>President Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor, nominating him as ambassador to the United Nations, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily fill the role while remaining in his current position. Waltz faced scrutiny after mistakenly adding a journalist to a Signal chat where sensitive military plans were discussed. Some sources suggest Waltz was ousted due to the Signal situation and concerns about his vetting of National Security Council staff, but was given a new post due to Trump's respect for him. Other officials believe Waltz may struggle to be confirmed by the Senate, allowing Trump to remove him entirely.</p>

CEO Tim Cook addressed the impact of tariffs, noting limited impact in the March quarter due to supply chain optimization. However, Cook stated that predicting beyond June is "very difficult" due to tariff uncertainty. Apple expects tariffs to add $900 million to its costs for the current quarter, assuming no major changes occur. Cook also mentioned that Apple is already sourcing about half of the iPhones for the U.S. from India and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking the Supreme Court's assistance in its attempt to strip temporary protected status (TPS) from over 300,000 Venezuelan migrants in the US, potentially leading to their deportation. The Justice Department has asked the justices to halt a federal judge's order that blocked the Homeland Security Secretary's decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans. The judge had stated that the secretary's action would inflict irreparable harm on hundreds of thousands of people, cost the US billions in economic activity, and injure public health and safety. Critics argue that the administration's actions disregard legal standards and the facts of individual situations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to allow it to remove temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants. A federal judge had previously blocked the administration's plan, citing procedural violations and racial bias. The administration argues that the law creating the program bars judicial review of the executive branch's decisions regarding the designation or termination of a foreign state's protected status. The judge, however, disagreed, stating that the provision did not prohibit him from deciding whether the Homeland Security Secretary was authorized to vacate the protections. The Supreme Court has ordered the challengers to respond to the application by May 8.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he is nominating Michael Waltz to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and that Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim national security advisor while continuing his current role. This is the first Cabinet shuffle of Trump's second term. Waltz's departure as national security advisor came after he faced scrutiny for inadvertently adding a reporter to a Signal chat with top Trump officials discussing a U.S. military strike. Rubio was seen in conversation with White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller shortly before the announcement.</p>

          <p>A by-election is being held in Runcorn and Helsby following the resignation of Mike Amesbury, triggered by his conviction for assaulting a constituent. This election marks Sir Keir Starmer's first by-election as prime minister, making it a significant test of Labour's standing nine months after their general election victory. The constituency, a newly created one, was won by Labour in the last election with a substantial majority, but Reform UK came in second place. The results will be closely watched for signs of shifting political sentiment amidst ongoing trade negotiations and economic changes.</p>

          <p>Small businesses in the United States are urgently calling for relief from President Trump's tariffs, citing crippling costs and disrupted supply chains. The US Chamber of Commerce is advocating for automatic exclusions for small importers who lack the financial flexibility to absorb the tariffs. The organization is also seeking exclusions for products not produced in the US and a process for companies to apply for relief if tariffs pose significant risks to employment. Trump has imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese imports and a 10% tariff on goods from other countries, pausing the latter for 90 days to allow for negotiations.</p>

They then made bogus emergency calls to police, livestreaming the officers' armed responses on social media. Two of the victims were in Southern California, where Nelson made false reports of armed individuals and shots fired at their residences.

          <p>Bill Belichick's recent CBS interview promoting his book, "The Art of Winning: Lessons From My Life in Football," has generated controversy due to an interruption by his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, when asked about how they met. Hudson's interruption, where she stated, "We're not talking about this," was unexpected given Belichick's history of controlling interviews. The incident has raised questions about the dynamics of their relationship and the extent of Hudson's involvement in Belichick's professional life. In the aftermath, Belichick issued a statement suggesting the interview was selectively edited and that unrelated topics took him by surprise.</p>

The charges stem from an incident in February 2024, where mercury was spilled inside an SUV at a car wash owned by Kulikoff. Authorities allege that Kulikoff conspired to move the contaminated vehicle outside of California City to the town of Boron, Kern County. If convicted, Kulikoff faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for conspiracy to transport hazardous waste and up to 15 years in prison and a $50,000 fine per day for placing another person in imminent danger.</p>

CEO Chris Kempczinski stated that heightened anxiety about the economy is weighing on lower-income Americans. The burger chain's same-store sales in the U.S. declined 3.6% in the first quarter, marking the biggest U.S. decline for the company since the COVID-19 pandemic forced stores to close nationwide.

          <p>The Trump administration, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is planning to require placebo-controlled trials for all new vaccines, a move described as a "radical departure" from past practices. Officials have suggested that updated COVID-19 shots may be included, raising concerns among vaccine experts about potential delays in vaccine access. Public health experts argue that the statement is misleading, as childhood vaccinations, including those for Hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, polio, and mumps, were all initially tested against a placebo. Critics warn that requiring placebo tests for simple upgrades of established vaccines would be costly and could deter drug makers from developing newer, more effective versions.</p>

          <p>Despite California Governor Gavin Newsom’s objections, Democratic state lawmakers approved changes to a bill that removed tougher penalties for soliciting 16- or 17-year-olds for sexual assault. The controversial action came after a heated debate on the floor of the Assembly, with Republicans accusing Democrats of being soft on sex offenders. Current law allows the offense of soliciting a minor under the age of 16 for sexual assault to be punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony on the first offense and as a felony on subsequent offenses. Democrats also added language to the bill that said it was the Legislature’s “intent” to strengthen protections for older teens, which does not affect how the charge of soliciting minors will be prosecuted.</p>

Despite the slower growth, AWS remains the world's top provider of cloud infrastructure.

Armed Sunni Muslim extremist groups then attacked areas with large Druse populations. Government representatives have since struck accords with Druse leaders to calm the violence and integrate armed groups into a national military. Leaders in the Druse-controlled Sweida region, previously reluctant to unite with government forces, expressed openness to doing so.</p>

The proposal, potentially part of a state budget deal, has raised concerns among education experts, including the state education commissioner, who views such changes as a "travesty" for children attending religious schools lacking a basic secular education. The state is also considering lowering the standards that a school would have to meet in order to demonstrate that it is following the law.
