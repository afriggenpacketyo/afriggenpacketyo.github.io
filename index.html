          <p>Archaeologists in Caral, Peru, have discovered the 5,000-year-old remains of a noblewoman, providing insights into the ancient Caral civilization. The woman's remains were carefully preserved in layers of fabric and included artifacts such as a toucan beak and a stone bowl. This discovery challenges previous assumptions that ancient societies were primarily led by men, suggesting that women held significant status in the Caral civilization, which existed around the same time as other major civilizations in Mesopotamia and Egypt.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration commended Paraguay's President Santiago Peña for designating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. This decision, along with the expansion of designations to include the entirety of Hezbollah and Hamas, is seen as a significant step against Iranian-backed extremism. The U.S. believes Paraguay's actions will help cut off the Iranian regime's ability to fund terrorism and operate in Latin America, particularly in the Tri-Border Area.</p>
