Despite holding a double-digit lead in the first half, the Lakers' defense faltered, allowing 30 points in the third quarter. Cole Swider was a standout performer for the Lakers, scoring a game-high 24 points, while 2024 first-round pick Dalton Knecht struggled with his shooting. Bronny James, the team's highly anticipated rookie, traveled with the team but did not play in the game.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed the discovery of remains belonging to all seven workers who were missing after a series of explosions at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The fatal incident occurred at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse, which was reportedly not permitted to store fireworks at that location. The property is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant whose own home was destroyed in the blasts. Federal and state agencies are investigating the cause, with plans to conduct controlled detonations of remaining hazardous materials at the site.</p>

          <p>The recent catastrophic flooding in Texas Hill Country highlights the region's geographical vulnerability, making it one of the deadliest places in the U.S. for such events. Known as "Flash Flood Alley," the area's steep hills, shallow soil, and the Balcones Escarpment contribute to rapid water runoff and sudden, powerful surges in rivers like the Guadalupe. A hydrologist explains that when warm, moist air from the Gulf is forced upward by the escarpment, it can lead to intense downpours. This article details how these geological and meteorological factors create the perfect conditions for devastating and fast-moving floods.</p>

          <p>Hamas has submitted what it termed a "positive response" to the latest proposal for a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange, though it stated that another round of negotiations is needed to finalize the implementation. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office called the changes requested by Hamas "unacceptable." Despite this, Israel has agreed to send a negotiating team to Doha, Qatar, to continue discussions. The proposed 60-day deal involves the release of 10 living hostages and the remains of 15 others held by Hamas.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Central California, dubbed the Madre Fire, has rapidly expanded to become the largest of 2025, scorching over 79,900 acres in the Los Padres National Forest. As of Saturday evening, the blaze was only 10% contained and has threatened approximately 50 structures, prompting evacuation orders in parts of San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. State and federal agencies are operating in a unified command to combat the fire, which has seen exponential growth due to weather, terrain, and fuel conditions. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how U.S. President Donald Trump is employing a foreign policy strategy centered on unpredictability, a concept political scientists call the "Madman Theory." By being deliberately inconsistent and centralizing decision-making, Trump aims to keep adversaries and allies off-balance to extract concessions, a tactic he honed in real estate. This approach has yielded some results, such as pressuring NATO allies to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. However, critics question its long-term effectiveness, arguing it could erode trust, make the U.S. an unreliable partner, and potentially backfire with adversaries like Iran.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid secured a place in the Club World Cup semi-finals against Paris Saint-Germain after a dramatic 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund. Madrid dominated most of the match, with goals from academy products Gonzalo García and Fran García. However, a chaotic stoppage time saw Dortmund score twice and Real Madrid's Dean Huijsen receive a red card. A spectacular acrobatic goal from Kylian Mbappé ultimately sealed the win for the Spanish giants, setting up a highly anticipated match against his former club.</p>

          <p>Recent funding cuts to HIV research by the Trump administration are raising significant concerns among public health experts about the future of efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the United States. The reduction in financial support for scientific studies and prevention programs could stall or reverse decades of progress made in treating and preventing the virus. This article explores the potential impacts of these budgetary decisions on research institutions, community health initiatives, and the long-term goal of eradicating HIV as a public health threat. The move has sparked debate over public health priorities and resource allocation.</p>

          <p>Representative Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, has officially announced his resignation from Congress, a move that further shrinks the GOP's already slim majority in the House of Representatives. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated his resignation will be effective July 20. With his departure, the Republican majority will be reduced to 219-212, presenting a greater challenge for Speaker Mike Johnson in passing legislation. Green said he is leaving public office to start a private sector business aimed at helping the U.S. compete against China.</p>

          <p>An executive order from President Donald Trump aims to curb the use of Chinese-made drones, but industry experts suggest that China's dominance in the market makes this a difficult goal to achieve. Chinese firms are world leaders in drone manufacturing, and their products are deeply integrated into global supply chains for commercial use. Analysts and business owners argue that banning these drones could significantly raise costs and disrupt operations for companies that rely on them for services like commercial inspections. The move is seen by some as a negotiation tactic in the broader U.S.-China trade conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for sending an email that critics label as misleading political propaganda. The email claimed that a new spending bill signed by President Donald Trump eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most recipients. However, the legislation only provides a temporary tax deduction, not a full elimination of the tax. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the communication as a "blatant political statement" and a "lie," breaking from the agency's historically apolitical stance.

          <p>A new study focusing on women in Los Angeles has found a correlation between exposure to extreme heat and wildfire smoke and negative birth outcomes. The research indicates that these environmental factors, which are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, can impact the health of both mothers and their unborn children. The findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that environmental pollutants and climate-related stressors pose significant risks during pregnancy. This highlights the need for public health strategies to protect vulnerable populations from the effects of a changing climate.</p>

One particularly large "monster rip current" pulled more than 10 people far from the shore, requiring a significant rescue operation involving lifeboats and helicopter support. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for dangerous swimming conditions across Southern California beaches for the holiday weekend due to elevated surf. The warnings are expected to remain in effect through Sunday as hot weather continues to draw crowds to the coast.</p>
