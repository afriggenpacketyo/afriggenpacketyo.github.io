          <p>China's economy has demonstrated significant resilience during a turbulent first half of 2025, navigating US trade policy shifts while maintaining steady growth toward its 5% annual GDP target. Despite this, experts warn of emerging pressure points for the rest of the year, as the positive effects of front-loaded exports may diminish. Forecasts are mixed, with some analysts predicting a slowdown in export growth to zero, while others anticipate a contraction, suggesting an uphill climb for the remainder of the year.

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay an £8.4m fee for Trent Alexander-Arnold, rather than wait a month to sign him for free, is already paying dividends. The investment was made to ensure his availability for the Club World Cup, and his performance, including a key assist, has helped the club secure an additional £10m in prize money so far. While questions about his defensive work remain, his attacking contributions and integration into the team under manager Xabi Alonso are being praised, suggesting the calculated gamble was a success for the Spanish club.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has announced that Israel has accepted the conditions for a proposed two-month ceasefire in its conflict with Hamas.

The details of the proposal have not been made public, and neither Israel nor Hamas has officially commented on the terms. Previous ceasefire efforts have stalled, but this new push, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, represents a potentially significant development in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>California has passed the most significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in over 50 years, a move aimed at accelerating housing construction. Championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the new legislation waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise developments in urban areas, eliminating lengthy environmental studies and the threat of lawsuits that often delay projects. This reform represents a major political shift, prioritizing housing abundance over the procedural hurdles that have historically stifled development. While hurdles like interest rates and labor costs remain, the removal of this key regulatory barrier is considered a seismic change in the state's approach to its housing crisis.</p>

CEO Robert Kyncl announced that $170 million of these savings will come from headcount reductions, with the remainder from administrative and real estate expenses. This move is part of a broader strategy to "future-proof" the company and increase investment in artist development and acquisitions.

          <p>A profile in The Atlantic examines the rise of Christian-nationalist musician Sean Feucht, who has become a prominent figure in the MAGA movement. Feucht blends Christian rock with right-wing political sermons, advocating for the fusion of church and state and has gained access to top Republican leaders, including Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson. The article details his connection to the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) and its "seven-mountain mandate" to influence all spheres of society. While his influence grows, Feucht is also facing allegations of financial misconduct from former staffers, which he has publicly denied.</p>

          <p>A provision within a major GOP spending bill would block abortion providers like Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for any services, including non-abortion care such as cancer screenings and STI testing. This measure would impact clinics nationwide, not just in states with abortion restrictions, potentially leading to clinic closures and reduced access to a wide range of health services for low-income patients. Legal scholars describe it as one of the most significant moves affecting abortion access since the Hyde Amendment. The policy represents a shift from the "leave it to the states" approach and could have a devastating financial impact on providers.</p>

Bargains included adding a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals to appease senators concerned about Medicaid cuts.

With a razor-thin majority, Johnson can only afford to lose three votes.

          <p>In a last-minute change, the Senate's version of President Trump's domestic policy bill eliminated a proposed excise tax that would have targeted the renewable energy industry. The tax would have applied to wind and solar projects using materials from prohibited countries like China, potentially raising consumer energy prices. The bill also modified the phase-out of clean energy tax credits, allowing projects already in development to qualify under a new timeline. Despite this concession, environmental groups argue the bill still severely curtails incentives for clean energy, which could lead to higher emissions and increased energy costs for Americans.

          <p>Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos has sold over 3.3 million shares of the company, valued at roughly $737 million, according to a recent financial filing. The transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan that was adopted in March, which allows for the sale of up to 25 million shares by May 2026. Bezos, who remains the company's largest individual shareholder, has regularly sold stock to fund other ventures, including his space exploration company Blue Origin and his nonprofit preschool initiative, Day 1 Academies.

The legislation would also mandate that agents clearly display their names and agency affiliations on their uniforms.

He emphasized that while the tariffs have not yet had a major economic impact, the prudent course is to wait and observe their effects on growth and inflation.

          <p>Nordstrom has announced it will be closing its store at Santa Monica Place, with the final day of business set for August 26. The company stated the decision is part of a broader strategy to better serve customers through its surrounding stores and digital channels as shopping habits shift online. The closure comes amid ongoing concerns about safety and crime in the downtown Santa Monica area, which has seen an increase in high-profile robberies and homelessness. Nordstrom is one of several major retailers, including Macy's and Walmart, that have recently been restructuring their physical store networks in California.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team defeated England by 24 runs in Bristol, taking a commanding 2-0 lead in the five-match T20 series. After a shaky start, India posted a strong total of 181-4, thanks to a brilliant recovery led by Jemimah Rodrigues and Amanjot Kaur, who both scored 63. In response, England's batting lineup faltered early, slumping to 17-3. Despite a half-century from Tammy Beaumont, England could not build the necessary momentum and finished at 157-7, repeating many of the mistakes from their previous loss and putting pressure on the team's new leadership.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis's announcement that he will not seek reelection in 2026 has ignited a fierce, early battle for his open North Carolina seat. On the Republican side, potential candidates include Trump allies like Lara Trump, who the former president endorsed as his first choice, and RNC Chairman Michael Whatley. For the Democrats, former Governor Roy Cooper is strongly considering a run and is seen as a top contender to flip the seat. The race is expected to be a key battleground as both parties vie for control of the Senate in the midterm elections.</p>
