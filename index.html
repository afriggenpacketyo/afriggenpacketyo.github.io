          <p>Mexico has initiated legal action against Google following the tech giant's decision to relabel the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America on its maps platform, aligning with a previous executive order. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the lawsuit, emphasizing Mexico's disagreement with applying the 'Gulf of America' label beyond the U.S. continental shelf. The Mexican Foreign Relations Ministry had previously communicated its concerns to Google, while the U.S. House Republicans passed the Gulf of America Act to codify the name change. Google's policy is to reflect local official names, displaying different labels within the U.S., Mexico, and other regions.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, is preparing to introduce new measures aimed at reducing UK net migration, which reached 728,000 last year. The proposed policies, outlined in an upcoming immigration white paper, will require employers to prioritize investment in UK skills before recruiting overseas workers, particularly in sectors like IT and telecommunications. Visa applications from countries with high rates of overstaying and asylum claims, such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka, are expected to face stricter screening. Additionally, migrants may need to wait longer to apply for permanent residency, and tougher English language requirements are anticipated, though reports of A-Level equivalent tests have been denied.</p>

          <p>Newly released records detail key moments in a federal corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, which was later dropped under controversial circumstances. The documents, obtained by The New York Times and The New York Post, include search warrants and sworn statements related to the investigation into Adams's fundraising and ties to Turkey. Federal agents considered seizing Adams's electronic devices at the New York City Marathon but ultimately approached him the following night. The investigation also explored allegations of witness tampering related to an Uzbek businessman. The case was ultimately dismissed after the Trump administration directed prosecutors to drop the charges, sparking accusations of a quid pro quo involving Adams's cooperation on immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Former New Labour cabinet member Lord Mandelson, now the UK's ambassador to the US, has lauded the recent UK-US trade deal as a foundation for future trade opportunities between the two nations.

While discussions regarding the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) occurred, abolishing the DST was not part of the deal.

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are meeting with Chinese officials in Geneva to address escalating trade tensions between the two countries. The discussions aim to de-escalate a dispute marked by tariffs, with the U.S. imposing a combined 145% tariff on China and China retaliating with a 125% levy on American imports. While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, there is hope that the two countries will scale back the tariffs. President Trump has suggested the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, potentially setting the stage for a reduction of tariffs to 80%.</p>

          <p>The recent trade agreement between the United States and Britain, which lifts the 25 percent tariffs on steel exported to the US, has provided some relief for struggling British businesses. The tariffs, imposed in February, had added significant costs and complexities to an already challenged industry. While the deal is welcomed by British steelmakers, uncertainties remain regarding products processed in the European Union before being shipped to the United States. The impulsive nature of the Trump administration's trade policy also creates concerns about long-term stability and planning.</p>

          <p>Faced with high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, Chinese companies are increasingly shifting their manufacturing operations to Vietnam. This trend is accelerating as the cost of sending products to the United States has soared. Chinese e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Shein are facilitating this transition by helping companies find manufacturing alternatives in Vietnam. While Vietnam offers advantages such as a shared border and a large workforce, it also faces challenges, including potential scrutiny from American officials concerned about China using Vietnam to circumvent tariffs.</p>

          <p>Adm Sir Ben Key, the head of the Royal Navy, has been removed from his duties pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has not released specific details regarding the nature of the allegations, stating that it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time. This announcement follows reports in The Sun suggesting that Adm Key is suspected of having an affair with a female subordinate. Earlier this week, the MoD stated that the First Sea Lord had 'stepped back due to private reasons'.</p>

          <p>A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies, as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) cost-cutting drive. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled that federal employee unions are likely to prove that the Trump administration's efforts to reorganize and downsize the federal government exceed its legal authority. The restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or placing workers on administrative leave to comply with the executive order. The ruling will remain in effect for at least 14 days while the judge considers the case.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has reportedly been subpoenaed in the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, though Swift's representative denies any creative involvement in the film 'It Ends With Us,' beyond licensing a song. The lawsuit stems from Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on set and Baldoni's countersuit claiming defamation. Baldoni's team suggests Lively's close friends, including Swift, pressured him to accept changes to the script. Swift's spokesperson stated that the subpoena is a tactic to draw public interest by using her name.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices declined in April, fueling concerns about deflation amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The national consumer price index (CPI) edged down by 0.1 percent year on year, aligning with economists' predictions. This decline follows a period of sluggish domestic consumption and the impact of high tariffs on trade. The situation is exacerbated by the trade war with the United States, which has led to manufacturers accumulating unsold goods.</p>
