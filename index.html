          <p>Alison Hall, an "Inside Edition" correspondent, attributes her early-stage breast cancer diagnosis to actress Olivia Munn's public sharing of her own breast cancer story. Inspired by Munn's advocacy for early detection, Hall underwent a breast cancer risk assessment test and subsequent MRI, leading to the discovery of stage zero cancer. Hall met Munn, expressing gratitude for the "gift of early detection" and highlighting the impact of Munn's openness on other women. Hall underwent a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery, avoiding chemotherapy and radiation due to the early diagnosis, and emphasized the importance of body image and self-acceptance after cancer treatment. The full report will air on "Inside Edition" on Wednesday, with Hall sharing letters from other women who were similarly impacted by Munn's story.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, President Trump stated he gave Iran an "ultimate ultimatum" and is considering military action. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem is preparing for large-scale evacuations of American citizens seeking to leave Israel. Trump claimed Iran wants to negotiate, a claim the Iranian mission to the UN quickly denied. Iranian officials threatened the U.S. with "irreparable damage" if it intervenes militarily. Iran and Israel have been exchanging missile fire following Israel's preemptive attack on Iran's nuclear program and military sites, with the IAEA reporting damage to Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>

Zoox began testing its robotaxis on public roads in 2023 and currently operates a few dozen in Foster City, San Francisco, and Las Vegas.

          <p>A recent study reveals that mothers disproportionately manage 71% of family tasks, leading to cognitive and emotional overload. Psychiatrist Dr. Sue Varma emphasizes the invisible load women carry, including constant attention to children's needs and household management. This mental load can result in anxiety, sleep disturbances, and irritability, impacting women's well-being. Varma suggests partners should actively participate in household tasks, engage in open communication, and acknowledge the emotional burden women face. Partners can show support by initiating tasks without being asked, taking ownership of responsibilities, and expressing appreciation for the caregiver's role.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, upheld a Tennessee law banning hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and gender transition surgery for transgender minors. The court's conservative justices ruled that the ban does not violate the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment. Chief Justice John Roberts stated that Tennessee concluded there is an ongoing debate among medical experts regarding the risks and benefits of such treatments. Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, stating the court abandoned transgender children and their families to political whims, and an attorney for the ACLU called the law a blunderbuss ban overriding careful judgment of parents and doctors.</p>

The author argues they were not informed of the risks and received harmful drugs and surgeries due to abuse and trauma. The author expresses concern over the Biden administration's support for such procedures, citing growing international evidence of their harm, and emphasizes the need for healthcare rooted in biological reality and truth, advocating for the protection of children from experimentation.</p>

          <p>Social Security's trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, potentially leading to a 19% reduction in monthly benefits. The accelerated timeline is partly attributed to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which expanded benefits for millions of retirees. Despite the potential depletion, benefits will not disappear entirely, but beneficiaries could face a reduction in their monthly checks. The Social Security Fairness Act has expanded benefits for about 3.2 million recipients, and there has been a spike in early benefits claims, possibly due to anxieties about the program's stability.</p>

He plans to grant a 90-day extension while the administration works to close a deal, potentially requiring China's blessing. This decision follows a high-stakes meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials to revive stalled trade negotiations. Trump's actions contradict the bipartisan law passed last year, which demanded that TikTok, used by over half of Americans, be divested from its Beijing-based owner due to concerns about spying and influence.</p>

          <p>Caroline Fraser's new book, Murderland, examines the potential connection between industrial pollution and the rise of serial killers in the Pacific Northwest. Fraser argues that the presence of industrial smelters releasing lead and arsenic into the environment may have contributed to increased crime rates. Data suggests a correlation between elevated lead levels and aggressive behaviors, with the phasing out of leaded gasoline and paint correlating to a drop in violent crime. However, the focus on Ted Bundy in the book overshadows the broader thesis about environmental damage, and the book fails to fully explain why violence remained skewed along gender lines.</p>

The conversation explores the disconnect between the state's revolutionary slogans and the aspirations of Iranian society. Sadjadpour suggests the regime's priorities are its own survival and revolutionary principles rather than the national interests of Iran, but that this focus may be tested given the ongoing conflict with Israel.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to extend the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. business for a third time. The White House Press Secretary stated that Trump does not want TikTok to go dark and that the extension will last 90 days. This extension will allow the administration to work to ensure that a deal is closed, so that American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure. Trump had previously paused the enforcement of the law that required ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations or be removed from app stores.</p>
