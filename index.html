        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, clarified to CNBC that his company is not seeking to acquire another railroad, despite a recent meeting with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs. Instead, discussions focused on enhancing cooperation between Berkshire's BNSF Railway and CSX to boost freight rail efficiency across the U.S., a strategy aiming for combined benefits without a full acquisition. This revelation significantly impacted the market, causing CSX shares to fall over 5% and other major railroad stocks like Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern to also decline, as previous speculation about a potential industry consolidation had driven their prices higher. The announcement signals a shift in strategy for BNSF, opting for strategic partnerships over large-scale acquisitions to improve national freight logistics.</p>

          <p>Stephen Nakagawa, a choreographer and former dancer with The Washington Ballet, has been appointed as the new director of dance programming at the Kennedy Center. This significant leadership change comes just days after the entire dance department staff was dismissed, sparking controversy and accusations of retaliation. Former director Jane Raleigh explicitly stated her belief that her firing was due to her public support for an ongoing unionization drive, highlighting concerns about artistic freedom and staff rights. Nakagawa's selection is unusual given his limited experience in curatorial or arts administration roles at such a prominent institution. The center is also navigating a request for increased federal funding, with political conditions attached, adding another layer of complexity to this pivotal moment.</p>

          <p>Federal funding for the Francis Scott Key Bridge reconstruction in Baltimore has become a contentious point in an escalating feud between President Donald Trump and Maryland Governor Wes Moore. Trump threatened to revoke the funding and deploy the National Guard to address Baltimore's crime, following an exchange of barbs with Moore. Governor Moore's office criticized Trump's stance, emphasizing the bridge's vital role as an economic engine supporting thousands of jobs and critical supply chains on the East Coast. The new bridge is estimated to cost $1.9 billion, and without federal aid, Maryland would struggle to meet the 2028 completion target, causing significant economic damage to the state and national economy.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI, along with his social network X, has filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, accusing them of an "anticompetitive scheme" to stifle AI rivals. The lawsuit, filed in Texas, alleges that Apple has colluded with OpenAI to maintain monopolies in the smartphone and generative AI markets, specifically by deprioritizing xAI's Grok in App Store rankings while favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT. This legal action marks the latest development in an ongoing clash between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, stemming from Musk's co-founding of OpenAI and subsequent departure over disagreements on its direction. OpenAI has dismissed the lawsuit as part of Musk's "ongoing pattern of harassment."</p>

This century-old policy, which allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, is being terminated globally by presidential executive order, having already ended for goods from China and Hong Kong. The carriers cite unprepared systems and unresolved questions regarding customs duties and data transmission as reasons for the temporary pause, impacting smaller European businesses and American consumers of their goods. While the suspensions are expected to be temporary, they highlight the significant logistical challenges introduced by the new trade regulations.</p>

Zambada, 77, expressed regret for the harm caused by illegal drugs in the U.S. and Mexico, taking responsibility for his actions. His arrest in 2024, which he claims was a kidnapping orchestrated by Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s sons, led to a plea deal after prosecutors decided not to seek the death penalty.

While the risk to public health in the U.S. is currently deemed very low, the northward spread of this parasitic fly from South America poses a significant threat to the country's livestock industry. Infestations, though rare in humans, can be painful and potentially fatal if untreated, as larvae feed on living tissue. The USDA is taking extensive measures, including building a new sterile fly production facility in Texas and increasing border surveillance, to prevent a widespread outbreak, which could lead to billions in economic losses for the cattle industry.</p>

Success often depends on contacting the issuer early, having a good payment history, and demonstrating a temporary hardship with a plan for resuming payments.

          <p>Intel has issued a warning regarding "adverse reactions" from investors, employees, and foreign governments due to the Trump administration acquiring a 10% stake in the company. The company highlighted concerns about potential impacts on international sales, which constitute 76% of its revenue, given its direct tie to President Trump's fluctuating tariff and trade policies. The deal, largely funded by CHIPS Act money, introduces risks of dilution for existing shareholders and potential challenges to the agreement itself due to a changing political landscape. Intel also noted that the government's stake could limit future transactions beneficial to stockholders and reduce their voting rights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CNN reporter recounts witnessing a swift, unsettling ICE arrest at a Maryland gas station, where masked agents in an unmarked car detained a man named Samuel Antonio Garcia Apilcano. The experience raised concerns about the lack of clear identification by agents and the overall "terrifying and surreal" nature of the encounter, which felt like a kidnapping. The article details the reporter's subsequent efforts to identify the detained man and learn about his fate, underscoring the broader context of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

Ghost jobs, used for various reasons like resume collection or signaling growth, waste job seekers' time and create a "gray area" legally. The proposed TJAAA aims to mandate transparency in job listings, requiring details like intended hire dates and previous posting history, and imposing fines for non-compliance. Thompson's advocacy highlights a growing national and international push for greater transparency in the hiring process.</p>

          <p>The Irish rap group Kneecap has announced the cancellation of all its upcoming U.S. tour dates, attributing the decision to a conflicting court hearing scheduled in London on September 26. The legal proceedings involve charges against member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh for allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag at a London performance, an accusation he denies. This development follows the band's earlier separation from its booking agency after a Coachella performance that featured strong criticism of the Israeli government. Kneecap conveyed its regret over the cancellations but promised an even bigger tour once their court case is resolved, underscoring the ongoing legal and political challenges faced by the group due to their activism and outspoken views.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's recent logo refresh has sparked public furor and a nearly $100 million drop in its market value, illustrating the perils of altering a company's established brand. Marketing experts suggest the redesign failed by abandoning the brand's core "southern, whimsical" story, particularly by removing the iconic "Uncle Herschel" and the barrel from the logo. This alienated loyal customers who associated the imagery with a "simpler time" and "homestyle country cooking." The incident also highlights the culturally and politically charged environment companies navigate today, where even design changes can be interpreted through a "political lens," leading to significant backlash despite the company's intent to modernize.</p>

Factors influencing the appropriate P/E multiple include a company's earnings growth rate, industry comparisons, historical valuation trends, and broader economic conditions like interest rates and perceived market risk.

While this means boaters and beachgoers are learning to coexist with these predators, shark experts emphasize that fatal shark bites remain exceedingly rare. Maine, for instance, has only recorded two unprovoked fatal attacks since 1837, reassuring the public that the overall risk to humans remains minimal despite the sharks' expanded range.</p>
