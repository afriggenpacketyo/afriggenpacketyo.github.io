          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu highlight China's rapid technological advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence, challenging the long-held belief that America is always ahead. China's AI firms are expanding influence by freely distributing their models, making them more accessible to researchers and developers worldwide. Chinese apps like Shein, Temu, and TikTok are gaining global popularity, posing a potential threat to Western dominance in the digital economy. The article urges the United States to openly share more of its AI technologies and research, innovate faster, and double down on diffusing AI throughout the economy to maintain its competitive edge. Optimism is tempered by the recognition of China's advancements and the need for the US to adapt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid rising tensions between Pakistan and India following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Syed Asim Munir, has adopted a more assertive stance. General Munir's comments reflect a need to project strength and rally public support amid political divisions and economic hardship in Pakistan, though analysts describe him as a hard-liner on India. He invoked the ‚Äútwo-nation theory‚Äù and framed Kashmir as Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äújugular vein,‚Äù signaling a potential shift in Pakistan‚Äôs stance toward India. The article suggests that whether the current crisis escalates depends on international diplomacy and domestic politics, with the United States and the United Nations calling for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns that other nations are offering incentives to attract filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Trump described this as a "National Security threat," arguing that it impacts messaging and propaganda, and stated his desire to bring movie production back to America. The announcement has raised questions about the scope and impact of the tariffs, including whether they would apply to American production companies filming abroad. The article notes that the US remains a major film production hub but has seen a decrease in spending, while other countries have attracted increased spending.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking fell to fourth among OECD members in 2024, behind the United States, Germany, and Britain. The decline was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years due to resumed development projects after COVID-19 suspensions. Despite the decrease, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool for pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific. The article also notes an overall decline in ODA by Development Assistance Committee members due to reduced contributions to international organizations and aid for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Patsy Widakuswara, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit fighting Donald Trump‚Äôs order to dismantle Voice of America (VOA), is calling for the media to resist attacks from the administration. Widakuswara, the White House bureau chief for VOA, argues that the administration's actions are a violation of press freedom. The lawsuit, backed by Reporters Without Borders and four unions, argues the Trump administration is attempting to unlawfully dismantle VOA‚Äôs operations because they deem it contrary to the government‚Äôs agenda. Widakuswara emphasizes the importance of providing objective information, especially in illiberal environments.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey indicates that foreign visitors to Japan are most frustrated by the lack of trash bins in public areas. This issue was cited by 21.9 percent of over 4,000 respondents as their top concern, with many having to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of trash bins in public spaces is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks.

          <p>China is striving to help exporters divert sales to the domestic market due to high tariffs killing U.S. orders for Chinese goods, a move that threatens to drive the world's second-largest economy into deeper deflation. The side effect is a ferocious price war among Chinese firms, eroding companies' profitability and weighing on employment. Consumer prices have slipped into negative territory, and the producer price index has fallen for 29 consecutive months. Economists predict that deflation in China's wholesale prices will likely deepen.</p>

The committee found that social care is consuming an increasing proportion of councils' budgets, crowding out spending on other services. It added that social care makes up an integral part of the government's NHS reforms and cannot be a separate process.</p>
