          <h2>Treasury Officials Surprised by Trump's Abrupt Reversal on Syria Sanctions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 21:23:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's unexpected announcement to lift sanctions on Syria caught senior Treasury officials off guard, creating confusion about the specifics and timeline for rolling back decades-old measures. The decision, made during an investment forum in Saudi Arabia, followed months of lobbying by Syria's transitional government for sanctions relief, citing economic hardships. While some work was underway at Treasury for incremental easing, the comprehensive reversal surprised many. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested relief might come through waivers, allowing foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties, but the long-term implications remain unclear. Relevant context includes the previous sanctions imposed on the Assad regime for human rights abuses and support for terrorism, which have significantly crippled Syria's economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations, raising concerns about the impact of global trade policies, particularly those of the U.S., on Japan's export-dependent economy. The Bank of Japan had previously cautioned about a potential moderation in economic activity due to increased uncertainties and downward pressure from U.S. tariff policies. Despite these concerns, the central bank seems poised to continue raising its policy rate, citing inflation surpassing its 2% target for three consecutive years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Top U.S. diplomat Marco Rubio expressed skepticism about the potential for a breakthrough in Ukraine-Russia peace talks scheduled in Turkey, suggesting that direct interaction between President Trump and President Putin is necessary for meaningful progress. Trump echoed this sentiment, stating that significant developments are unlikely until he and Putin meet in person. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy criticized the "low-level" delegation sent by Moscow, accusing Russia of disrespect towards Trump and Erdogan. Russia's chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, indicated that Russia views the talks as a continuation of previous failed negotiations aimed at establishing long-term peace.</p>

          <p>More than 60,000 disabled households in England faced homelessness last year, marking a nearly 75% increase since 2019, according to government data. This rise in homelessness among disabled individuals outpaces the overall increase in homelessness during the same period. Concurrently, the amount of social housing allocated to disabled people has decreased, exacerbating the problem. Labour MPs have voiced concerns about planned cuts to disability benefits and the lack of a government strategy to end homelessness, with one MP warning against going "further and faster in the wrong direction".</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding the ability of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a check on presidential authority. The cases involve President Trump's order to eliminate birthright citizenship, a move challenged as unconstitutional.

The Trump administration argues against nationwide injunctions, claiming they impede the executive branch's duties, while opponents contend that such injunctions are necessary to stop unconstitutional actions.

          <p>A committee of MPs is advocating for a one-year delay to the implementation of farm inheritance tax changes, citing a lack of adequate consultation and impact assessment. The government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m at a rate of 20% starting in April 2026, which has sparked protests across the UK. The Efra Committee warns that the tax reforms threaten the most vulnerable farmers and recommends a delay until April 2027 to allow them more time to seek professional advice. The committee also criticized the government's sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) environmental payments scheme.</p>
