          <p>The second week of the Israel-Iran war began with strikes targeting an Iranian nuclear research facility in Isfahan, as Iran warned the United States against military intervention. Israel claimed to have targeted centrifuge production sites and killed senior Iranian commanders, including one allegedly involved in the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Iran launched drones and missiles at Israel, but most were intercepted, and damage was reportedly minimal. President Trump is considering U.S. military intervention, while Iran's foreign minister cautioned that such action would be dangerous.</p>

          <p>The British-flagged superyacht Bayesian, which sank off Sicily last year, has been recovered by salvage crews. The yacht's sinking resulted in the deaths of U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch and six others. The recovery operation aims to facilitate a full criminal investigation into the cause of the sinking. British investigators previously reported that extreme wind caused the yacht to capsize. The yacht will be transported to Termini Imerese for further examination after the lifting operation is completed.</p>

          <p>Sen. Mike Lee's social media posts following the fatal shooting of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband drew bipartisan backlash. Lee posted controversial content that appeared to blame the governor and Marxists for the violence. His posts incensed fellow senators, particularly those who knew the victims. After confrontations with colleagues, Lee deleted the posts but did not issue a public apology. The incident has prompted reflection in Congress about the need to lower political tensions.</p>

          <p>Steve Bannon, a MAGA podcaster, played a significant role in President Trump's decision-making process regarding a potential U.S. attack on an Iranian nuclear facility. Bannon advised Trump against the strike, citing concerns about Israeli intelligence and the effectiveness of bunker-buster bombs. Other advisors, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have also influenced Trump's stance, leading to a more cautious approach. Trump ultimately decided to hold off on a strike for two weeks, considering diplomatic solutions and the deployment of additional military resources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say that U.S. sunscreens are often less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences, with the FDA classifying sunscreen as an over-the-counter drug, have slowed the approval of new UV-filtering ingredients. While American sunscreens adequately block UVB rays, their UVA protection is often weaker compared to products in Europe and South Korea. A bipartisan bill in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations and allow non-animal testing alternatives. Dermatologists still emphasize the importance of wearing sunscreen and recommend broad-spectrum options with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>

          <p>New court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was described as a "prepper." Boelter's wife told investigators that he gave her a "bailout plan" and instructed her to leave the house with their children due to potential threats. Investigators found empty rifle cases and gun-cleaning supplies in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffmans, who were victims of the shooting, recounted a terrifying attack where the gunman impersonated an officer.

          <p>A senior Iranian official stated that proposals made by European powers at nuclear talks in Geneva were "unrealistic." The official suggested that adhering to these positions would hinder reaching an agreement. The European diplomats aimed to test Tehran's willingness to negotiate a new nuclear deal amidst ongoing conflict with Israel. French President Emmanuel Macron indicated agreement to accelerate negotiations, but insisted Iran provide assurances of peaceful intentions. The Iranian official dismissed negotiating defensive capabilities and reiterated that zero uranium enrichment was not an option.</p>
