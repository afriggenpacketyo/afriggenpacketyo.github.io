          <h2>Health Workers Warn of Disease Outbreak Risks Due to HHS Cuts</h2>

          <p>Former HHS workers warn that mass terminations and budget cuts are impacting key programs, potentially increasing the risk of missed disease outbreaks, with over 70 staff laid off in South Carolina due to funding cuts. An epidemiologist from the South Carolina department of public health noted that the cuts impact the ability to spot patterns, find outbreaks early, and respond before more people get sick. The HHS has been significantly impacted by budget cuts, leading to the elimination of numerous grants and the reduction of its workforce from 82,000 to 62,000. These cuts are also affecting critical areas such as child support enforcement and AIDS relief programs, potentially undermining years of progress.</p>

          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America's recent report identifies the most challenging US cities for seasonal allergy sufferers, with Wichita, Kansas, topping the list for the third consecutive year due to high tree and grass pollen counts. Dr. Purvi Parikh from NYU Langone recommends starting allergy medications early, such as 24-hour antihistamines, eye drops, and nasal sprays, and consulting a doctor for breathing issues. Additional tips include washing clothes after spending time outdoors, washing bedsheets weekly in warm water, and staying indoors during peak pollen times in the morning and late afternoon. It is also important to differentiate allergy symptoms from those of colds and viruses, as allergies tend to last longer.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While China's electric vehicle (EV) exports to the UK have decreased, plug-in hybrid vehicle exports are experiencing a significant surge, increasing nearly 600% in the first quarter of the year. In March alone, hybrid EV exports to the UK soared by 1,849% year-on-year, reaching 3,898 units. This trend is attributed to the UK's relatively low 10% import tariff on Chinese cars, making them more affordable compared to European brands. The UK has become China's second-largest export destination for EVs and fifth-largest for hybrid electric vehicles, indicating a growing acceptance of Chinese car brands among British consumers.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, primarily due to lower crude oil prices and reduced production.

Aramco's CEO, Amin Nasser, acknowledged the impact of global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty on energy markets, emphasizing the company's resilience and long-term view.

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed optimism about upcoming peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, stating his commitment to working with both sides to end the conflict, urging an end to the "bloodbath" in a social media post. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signaled a positive outlook, stating that Putin's offer for direct talks in Istanbul was "a positive sign" and that a complete and unconditional ceasefire should begin soon. Putin proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, "without preconditions," an offer that came in response to Ukraine and its allies urging Moscow to commit to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or face additional sanctions. The proposed deal reportedly included provisions for Ukraine's neutral status and put limits on its armed forces, while delaying talks on the status of Russian-occupied areas.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, argues that mothers are constantly bombarded with messages that they are not doing enough, often stemming from historical biases within her field. She emphasizes that being a perfect mother is harmful and unrealistic, as children need to learn about flaws and the importance of give-and-take in relationships. Ross encourages mothers to stop worrying about being good enough and highlights the importance of self-care and accepting imperfections. She concludes by advocating for society to cut mothers some slack and recognize their inherent worth.</p>

Mortgage rates are influenced by factors like global demand for US Treasury bonds and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies.

          <p>The new German government led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing scrutiny over potential lobbying conflicts due to the appointment of three individuals from the business world to top cabinet positions. Critics argue that these appointments, including a former lobbyist for BlackRock as Chancellor, raise concerns about undue influence and conflicts of interest. Experts emphasize the need for stricter regulations to curtail such conflicts, highlighting the importance of transparency and ethical conduct in government.

In a social media post, Trump emphasized that change was "negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner".

They attribute the ongoing issues to stalled bin lorries and the suspension of recycling collections, while Labour MP Rachel Taylor accuses them of political maneuvering.

The surge in renewable energy investment aligns with China's commitment to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas.

          <p>RÃ¼meysa Ã–ztÃ¼rk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, has returned to Boston after being released from a Louisiana immigration detention center, vowing to continue her legal action. She was held for over six weeks after co-authoring an op-ed critical of her university's response to the war in Gaza, which her lawyers argue was a violation of her First Amendment rights. Despite losing her freedom and education, OztÃ¼rk expresses gratitude for the support she received and maintains faith in the American justice system. Senator Edward Markey praised her resilience and commitment to fighting for her rights.</p>
