          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of cooling in July, adding only 73,000 jobs, which was well below economists' forecasts. Compounding the weakness, job growth figures for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000, indicating a more rapid deterioration than previously understood. The unemployment rate also increased to 4.2%, fueling speculation that the Federal Reserve may be compelled to lower interest rates to support the slowing economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moderna has lowered the upper end of its full-year revenue forecast after a delay in Covid vaccine shipments to the United Kingdom, which will now be delivered in early 2026. Despite the revised outlook, the company's second-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations, posting a smaller-than-expected loss and higher revenue. This performance was largely attributed to significant cost-cutting measures, including a recent 10% reduction in its workforce, as the company navigates dwindling demand for its Covid vaccine.</p>

          <p>The interest-free payment pause for millions of borrowers on the SAVE student loan plan has officially ended, meaning interest will begin accruing on their debts again. This change, resulting from legal challenges and the plan's repeal by Congress, means that borrowers who remain in forbearance without making payments will see their balances grow. Experts advise borrowers to quickly find a new repayment plan, such as the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, though it will likely result in a higher monthly bill than the more generous SAVE plan.</p>

          <p>Smoke from more than 650 wildfires burning across Canada is blanketing the U.S. Midwest, creating dangerous air quality conditions for millions of people in states like Minnesota, Illinois, and Michigan. Air quality alerts are in effect across the region, with several major cities ranking among the worst in the world for air pollution. This event is occurring alongside other severe weather threats in the U.S., including a risk of flash flooding in the Carolinas and an extreme heat warning in the Southwest.</p>

Yoon, who was removed from office over his attempt to impose martial law, is on trial for rebellion and faces other criminal investigations. This act of defiance was his latest attempt to avoid interrogation, with his lawyers citing health problems as the reason he cannot attend questioning or his trial.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Adam Sandler comedy "Happy Gilmore" and its new sequel are more than just frivolous entertainment, suggesting they convey a traditional conservative message about family values. The author contends that the protagonist's motivation in both films is purely altruistic, as he takes up golf not for personal glory but to provide for his grandmother and later his daughter. This focus on familial obligation over self-interest is presented as a core theme of the popular movie franchise.</p>

        </div>

          <p>This article explores why many international aid organizations have chosen not to speak out publicly against the Trump administration's dramatic cuts to their funding. This phenomenon, termed "anticipatory silence," stems from a fear that public criticism could lead to further retaliation and the loss of remaining government contracts. The strategy is controversial within the aid sector, with some arguing that quiet, behind-the-scenes diplomacy is more effective, while others believe silence allows the administration to control the narrative and harm their mission.</p>

          <p>Massive wildfires burning in Arizona and Utah have grown so large and hot that they are creating their own weather systems in the form of pyrocumulus and pyrocumulonimbus clouds. These "fire clouds" can generate erratic and dangerous conditions, including powerful downdrafts, high winds, and even fire tornadoes, which significantly complicate firefighting efforts and endanger crews on the ground. This phenomenon highlights the increasing intensity of wildfires, which scientists link to climate change, longer fire seasons, and widespread drought conditions.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques the Trump administration's decision to burn nearly $10 million worth of USAID-purchased contraceptives rather than distribute them to women in low-income countries. The author argues this act is a potent metaphor for a broader, deliberate policy shift against women's health and reproductive freedom, both globally and domestically. The article connects the incinerated supplies to cuts in domestic family planning programs, asserting that the administration is actively working to subordinate women's lives and ambitions to childbearing.</p>
