          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth testified that he and President Trump believe they can deploy National Guard and active-duty troops anywhere to support ICE operations, a statement criticized by Democrats as an overreach of power. This assertion comes as approximately 4,800 National Guard members and Marines are being sent to Los Angeles amidst protests, a move that California Governor Gavin Newsom has denounced as inflammatory. Representative Betty McCollum voiced concerns about using the military for domestic law enforcement, emphasizing their lack of training for such missions and potential for escalating tensions. The Trump administration justifies the deployment under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, allowing military forces to protect federal assets and personnel, though experts question the preparedness of Marines for policing American citizens. The deployment is estimated to cost $134 million, drawn from existing Defense Department funds. Optimism regarding the author's tone is middling due to the content of the article being a report on a controversial policy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration asserts it has complied with a court order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. after his mistaken deportation to El Salvador, according to Justice Department attorneys. This filing comes in response to a federal case in Maryland, where a judge had mandated his return. Abrego Garcia was brought back to face criminal charges in Tennessee, following legal battles where the administration initially claimed his return was unfeasible. Abrego Garcia's lawyers maintain the case isn't over, seeking accountability for the government's actions and ensuring his case proceeds as if he had not been improperly deported, while the Justice Department intends to file a motion to dismiss the case. The author's tone has relative optimism due to the fact that someone was brought back to the US to face charges.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is considering implementing curfews and other measures in response to potential violence stemming from protests against federal immigration sweeps. While acknowledging some looting, she emphasized that recent protests were smaller and less violent than previous demonstrations. Bass attributed the unrest to individuals with agendas separate from immigrant support and highlighted that the disturbances are confined to a few blocks in downtown Los Angeles. She criticized the National Guard's role as limited to guarding federal buildings and expressed uncertainty about the Marines' intended actions, while urging ICE to cease the raids due to the disruption caused to immigrant families and the local economy.

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is undergoing cross-examination in Brazil's Supreme Court, accused of orchestrating a coup attempt following his 2022 election defeat. Bolsonaro and seven associates are on trial for allegedly plotting to retain power after losing to Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, marking the first time a Brazilian head of state has faced trial for attempting to overthrow the government. The alleged plan involved assassinating or arresting President-elect Lula da Silva, Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin, and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. Testimony has also covered the January 8, 2023 riots, when Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings, and Bolsonaro, already barred from running for office until 2030, could face up to 40 years in prison if convicted. The author's tone is neutral given the seriousness of the coup trial.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to dismiss all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is raising concerns among health policy experts. Experts, including Lawrence Gostin, argue that this move politicizes science and vaccine policy, potentially increasing public distrust in vaccinations and federal health agencies. The firings could erode U.S. immunization rates and weaken the nation's ability to manage outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. While the impact on vaccine manufacturers is uncertain, analysts suggest it introduces more regulatory uncertainty, with some experts fearing Kennedy might appoint members sympathetic to anti-vaccine views.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a federal judge to swiftly block the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles, citing potential harm to state sovereignty and escalation of civil unrest. State Attorney General Rob Bonta is seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent the deployment, arguing it deprives the state of vital resources and promotes unrest rather than quelling it. Newsom has described Trump's actions as tyrannical, while Trump defended the deployment by claiming Los Angeles would otherwise be "burning." The lawsuit alleges that Trump illegally federalized the California National Guard without the governor's consent, making the author's tone relatively anxious.</p>

          <p>While hummingbird feeders can supplement the diets of these tiny birds, they can also be deadly if not properly cleaned and maintained. Spoilage of sugar water can lead to microbial growth, causing infections like candida that can swell a hummingbird's tongue and lead to starvation. Wildlife rehabbers emphasize the importance of regular cleaning, recommending every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily or every other day in summer. To support hummingbirds, experts suggest planting native wildflowers and contacting local wildlife rehabbers if an injured bird is found.

          <p>Students preparing for the fall 2025 semester face a challenging borrowing environment with high interest rates, making it crucial to secure a good student loan rate. While federal student loan rates have slightly decreased, private lenders offer a range of options with fixed rates starting at 3.29% and variable rates at 4.39%. Experts recommend starting with federal aid and comparing private lenders, looking for discounts, and considering a co-signer to obtain the best possible rate. Ultimately, a good student loan rate is the lowest achievable based on one's financial situation, ideally below the national average, but borrowers should also consider loan terms and protections.

          <p>Attorneys for former Tennessee basketball player Zakai Zeigler are leveraging a new Tennessee law to challenge the NCAA's authority and secure an additional year of eligibility for their client. The law allows Tennessee universities and athletes to opt out of NCAA rules if they violate antitrust law, potentially impacting Zeigler's ability to earn NIL compensation. The NCAA counters that the law is irrelevant to Zeigler's case, while Zeigler's attorneys argue that the law allows UT to determine its team roster, not the NCAA. A federal judge could invalidate the state law altogether, and the outcome hinges on whether the court sides with Zeigler or the NCAA.
