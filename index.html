          <p>Emergency crews in Kerr County, Texas, suspended and then partially resumed their search for victims from the catastrophic July 4th flash floods due to a new flood threat. The original disaster along the Guadalupe River resulted in over 132 deaths statewide, with 161 people still missing in the hard-hit Hill Country. Governor Greg Abbott confirmed ongoing rescue operations in other counties as authorities monitor rising river levels, which created a dangerous and life-threatening situation for both residents and recovery teams working in the area.</p>

          <p>China's exports saw a significant 5.8% year-on-year increase in June, surpassing market expectations as businesses took advantage of a temporary tariff truce with the United States. Imports also unexpectedly rose by 1.1%, contributing to a monthly trade surplus of nearly $114.8 billion. Despite ongoing trade tensions and a broader contraction in imports during the first half of the year, this robust export performance highlights a moment of resilience for the world's second-largest economy.

          <p>A volatile wildfire in the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed dozens of structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and a water treatment facility, which caused a hazardous chlorine gas leak. The Dragon Bravo Fire forced evacuations and complicated firefighting efforts, while another large fire burns in the nearby Kaibab National Forest. This event unfolds as smoke from intense Canadian wildfires blankets the U.S. Upper Midwest, causing widespread unhealthy air quality and highlighting a summer of extreme fire danger across North America.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security agency, the SBU, announced that it tracked down and killed the Russian agents responsible for the assassination of a senior SBU colonel in Kyiv. The colonel, who was reportedly involved in covert operations in Russian-occupied territories, was shot and killed in a bold daylight attack caught on surveillance video. The SBU stated the suspected assassins were killed after resisting arrest, marking another grim episode in the ongoing shadow war of targeted killings between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Imam Ayman Soliman, a former hospital chaplain and respected community figure in Cincinnati, was suddenly detained by ICE after his asylum status was revoked.

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose nationalist, "illiberal" style is admired by some conservative figures abroad, is facing a growing political threat at home. A surprise challenger from his own former circle, Peter Magyar, has gained significant traction by focusing on domestic failures like the poor state of hospitals and schools. This new opposition from the center-right is challenging Orban's long-held power by creating a compelling narrative of a country in decline, weakening his position ahead of the 2026 election.</p>
