          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 03:12:12 EDT</div>

          <p>SK Hynix announced its readiness to mass produce next-generation high-bandwidth memory chips (HBM4), surpassing competitors and boosting the company's stock. HBM chips are crucial for AI computing, particularly for Nvidia, a key SK Hynix client. The company completed internal validation and quality assurance for HBM4, which doubles bandwidth and increases power efficiency by 40% compared to the previous generation. HBM4 is expected to be essential for Nvidia's next-generation Rubin architecture, solidifying SK Hynix's position as a leading supplier and the company expects to double HBM sales for the full year compared to 2024. The chipmaker's shares have risen significantly this year due to strong HBM demand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced zero growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June, aligning with economists' expectations. The Office for National Statistics reported weakness in production output, which contracted by 0.9%, while services and construction output saw slight increases. This stagnation follows a better-than-expected 0.3% growth in the second quarter, down from 0.7% in the first quarter. Economists anticipate a slowdown in the latter half of 2025, posing challenges for Finance Minister Rachel Reeves ahead of the Autumn Budget, and the Bank of England is balancing fiscal uncertainty with persistent inflation. Any potential tax hikes are a particular focus as the government has promised to ensure spending is funded by tax receipts, rather than borrowing (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers detained in an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia have returned to South Korea. Their return follows warnings from the South Korean president and Hyundai's CEO about the raid's impact. President Lee Jae Myung stated that companies would be hesitant to invest in the US following the incident. Hyundai's CEO, José Muñoz, noted that the raid would delay the factory's opening by at least two to three months. The South Korean foreign ministry has called for US congressional support for a new visa for Korean firms, as the raid has raised concerns about trade relations between the two countries.</p>

Nearly two-thirds of younger employees are helping older colleagues learn and use AI, reshaping collaboration and bridging generational divides. Senior directors report that this partnership allows them to focus on higher-value tasks and unlock new business opportunities. Most employees surveyed believe AI boosts efficiency and benefits their careers, with common applications including drafting emails, organizing files, and data entry.

          <p>Official figures reveal that the UK economy experienced zero growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June. While monthly figures can be volatile, the economy grew by 0.2% over the three months leading up to July compared to the previous three months. The service sector performed well, particularly in health, computer programming, and office support, but this was offset by a weak manufacturing sector. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces increasing pressure to boost economic growth ahead of the Budget on November 26, amidst speculation of potential tax increases to meet fiscal rules (not investment advice).</p>

The article discusses the complexities of assessing proportionality, including intent, military advantage, and the right to self-defense, as well as the UN saying that more than 2,000 people have been killed around aid sites and convoys in recent months.</p>

          <p>A report from the National Audit Office (NAO) reveals that the cost of residential care for vulnerable children in England has nearly doubled in five years, yet many children still do not receive adequate care. Councils spent an average of £318,400 per child in a children's home in the year ending March 2024, but this expenditure does not represent value for money. Rising costs are attributed to a record number of children in care, the complexity of their needs, and a profit-driven market.

          <p>China has become the leading source of foreign investment in Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor, committing US$8.4 billion between 2019 and 2024. These investments support the development of a state-fostered industrial cluster. Chinese investors are also participating in infrastructure projects, including a high-speed railway line.

          <p>The House of Lords is set to debate a bill legalizing assisted dying in England and Wales, facing opposition from peers who see "massive problems" in the proposed legislation. Supporters urge respect for the MPs' decision to back the bill, while opponents insist on changes to address flaws. The bill proposes allowing terminally ill adults with fewer than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, subject to approval by doctors and a panel. The debate is expected to cover concerns about coercion, safeguards, and mental capacity, with the bill's chances depending on cross-bench peers.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Washington's efforts to contain China and revitalize US industry will negatively impact the US and its allies, disrupting globalization and world trade. The author cites the immigration raid on a Hyundai-LG battery plant as an example of the contradiction between anti-immigrant policies and industrial policy. The crackdown on undocumented workers, both skilled and unskilled, is seen as appealing to a specific political base but ultimately undermining the goal of reshoring American manufacturing. The article questions the feasibility of industrial policy in a post-industrial American economy.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has cautioned Mexico against plans to increase tariffs on Asia-made cars to 50%, threatening potential countermeasures. The ministry stated that it hopes Mexico will "think twice" before acting, as the two countries are important trade partners. Mexico's proposed tariffs are part of a broader budget proposal affecting $52 billion in imports, and China has previously used export restrictions on key minerals as countermeasures in trade disputes. Excess supply was a reason why global trade existed, according to a Chinese official.</p>

          <p>The California Assembly passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill that aims to increase housing density near public transit hubs by overriding local zoning laws. The bill allows for taller, denser housing near transit corridors, potentially impacting single-family neighborhoods. Supporters argue the measures are needed to address the state's affordability crisis, while critics claim it strips local authorities of control. The vote came after the Los Angeles City Council opposed the bill, and support surged following an agreement with a labor group for union hiring on certain projects.</p>
