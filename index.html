          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 daily flights from Newark Airport due to persistent equipment and staffing issues, according to CEO Scott Kirby, who states that the FAA acknowledges Newark cannot handle the current flight volume. The FAA attributes the problems to equipment issues, runway construction, and staffing shortages in Philadelphia, where the traffic control center for Newark's airspace is located. Travelers are experiencing significant delays, with some flights delayed by over three hours, causing frustration and impacting other airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to revamp the air traffic control system to address these issues. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to assist qualifying students with private school tuition. The bill allows most students in accredited private schools to receive $10,000 annually, students with disabilities up to $30,000, and home-schooled students $2,000. Democrats argue the legislation will harm public schools by diverting funds to wealthier students already in private education.

          <p>China's focus on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics into manufacturing processes could drive significant economic growth. While some investors focus on the competition between China and the US in AI development, Chinese policymakers are emphasizing the commercial-scale adoption of AI. Demographic challenges, such as a shrinking working-age population, are driving the need for productivity gains through AI and robotics. The combination of AI and robotics is seen as a way to address labor shortages and increase economic output. Optimism score: 70</p>
