          <p>Severe tornadoes tore through Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia, resulting in at least 23 fatalities and widespread destruction. In St. Louis, a church was severely damaged, trapping people inside, while Kentucky experienced a mass casualty event due to a devastating tornado. The spring tornado season has been particularly brutal, with officials warning that the death toll may rise as they assess the damage. This event comes at a precarious time for disaster relief efforts, as staffing and funding cuts have upended the usual processes for getting assistance from the federal government, though officials are in touch with the Department of Homeland Security to address the need for disaster relief.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly pursuing a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, aiming to avoid military conflict despite objections from Republican hard-liners and Israeli officials. Negotiations, led by Steve Witkoff, are ongoing, with Trump insisting on halting uranium enrichment, a demand Iran has resisted. The Gulf Arab states, previously wary of Iran, are now seeking a negotiated settlement to avoid regional instability. Sanctions relief and guarantees from the U.S. are key sticking points, as Iran seeks assurances that the U.S. will adhere to any new agreement given Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer confirmed five deaths in her city and said more than 5,000 homes were affected, with a state of emergency declared. Rescuers are searching for survivors in damaged areas, and emergency shelters have been set up to assist those affected by the storms.</p>

          <p>The EU is closely monitoring the Romanian presidential election, where the hard-right George Simion faces pro-EU Nicusor Dan in a runoff. A Simion victory could trigger a crisis in the European Union, given his "sovereignist" views and alignment with leaders like Trump and Orban. The election is considered a historic decision for Romania, with implications for its relationship with the EU and NATO. Simion's recent change in tone contrasts with his past anti-Ukrainian and anti-Hungarian agitation.</p>
