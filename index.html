        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is facing legal challenges from California Governor Newsom over the deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. Newsom argues that the deployment, intended to address protests related to federal immigration enforcement, is an unlawful federalization of the National Guard and an overreach of presidential authority. The lawsuit claims Trump's actions violate the U.S. Constitution and undermine Newsom's role as Commander-in-Chief of the California National Guard. Newsom asserts that local law enforcement is capable of managing the situation and that Trump is attempting to manufacture chaos for political gain. Optimism surrounding the resolution of this conflict is low given the entrenched positions on both sides. </p>

          <p>More than 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have signed an open letter criticizing the Trump administration's policies, citing concerns about research politicization, interrupted global collaboration, and budget cuts. The letter, addressed to NIH director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, calls for the reinstatement of staff and restoration of funding, emphasizing the need to prioritize human safety over political momentum. Scientists expressed fears of retaliation but felt compelled to speak out, especially as Bhattacharya is set to testify on the NIH budget. The administration defends its policies, stating that international collaborations continue and that indirect research costs are capped to align with other funders. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has activated approximately 700 Marines for potential deployment to Los Angeles, joining National Guard troops already sent to the city to address protests.

          <p>Chinese electric car manufacturers, like BYD, are expanding into European markets, offering cheaper alternatives. This has prompted responses from the US and EU governments, including increased import tariffs, to protect domestic industries. Concerns are rising about potential security risks related to internet-enabled cars and the possibility of spyware or hacking. Despite these concerns, experts acknowledge that Chinese technology is becoming increasingly integrated into the global economy. </p>
