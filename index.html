            <p>Closing arguments have been delivered in the bribery trial of Nadine Menendez, wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, who was previously sentenced to 11 years in prison. Prosecutors allege that Nadine acted as a broker, leveraging her husband's influence for personal gain, including cash, gold bars, and a luxury car. The defense argued that the government's definitions of "official acts" and "quid pro quo" were too broad and that much of the alleged misconduct was routine political behavior. The jury will now deliberate on the charges against Nadine Menendez.</p>

            <p>A report from the European Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that China's 'Made in China 2025' plan has fallen short of several key technology targets, despite achieving domestic dominance in some sectors like autos. The plan, intended to boost China's self-sufficiency in technology, has also been criticized for fostering unhealthy industrial competition and worsening global trade tensions. While China has made strides in areas like shipbuilding and electric cars, it still relies heavily on foreign technology in sectors like aerospace. U.S. restrictions on China's access to high-end tech have further complicated the situation.</p>

Ancient silk paintings dating back to the Ming dynasty provide evidence of brown rat domestication in China during AD1425–1435. Researchers propose that domesticated brown rats may have stowed away on ships used by Zheng He, facilitating their spread across the globe. Brown rats, also known as common or street rats, are believed to have originated in northern China and Mongolia.</p>

            <p>The White House is rebuilding the National Security Council (NSC) with aides believed to be aligned with President Trump's agenda after the removal of six people earlier this month. Derek Harvey, a military intelligence analyst, is expected to be named senior director for intelligence. Retired Lt. Col. Michael Jensen is also likely to join the NSC. These changes reflect a shift towards individuals more closely aligned with the President's vision for national security.</p>

            <p>Canada's federal party leaders participated in their second and final debate ahead of the upcoming election, with the US President Donald Trump emerging as a central theme. Liberal leader Mark Carney faced scrutiny over his connection to the previous Trudeau administration, while leaders debated approaches to trade with the US. The debate also covered domestic issues such as housing, crime, and the environment. Smaller parties fought for air time as polls suggest a close race between the Liberals and Conservatives.</p>
