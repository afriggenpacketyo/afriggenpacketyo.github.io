        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has renewed his call for jailing individuals who burn the American flag, following flag burning demonstrations in California protesting immigration enforcement. This stance clashes with a 1989 Supreme Court decision affirming that states cannot criminalize flag burning, as it infringes upon First Amendment rights. Senator Josh Hawley proposed legislation to stiffen penalties for rioters who burn flags, but the Supreme Court has previously struck down laws that criminalize desecration of the American flag. The court has maintained that restricting flag burning would lead to subjective limitations on free expression.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar index has hit a three-year low, prompting investors to consider the implications of the weakening greenback. A weaker dollar generally benefits U.S. companies' overseas business by increasing foreign buyers' purchasing power, though it may also increase costs for imported supplies. The travel industry could see a shift, with international travel becoming more expensive for U.S. citizens and relatively more affordable for foreign tourists visiting the U.S. While currency fluctuations are a factor, investment decisions are primarily driven by company-specific and industry-related considerations (not investment advice).</p>
