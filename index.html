        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Keir Starmer is facing mounting criticism from within his own party following the controversial appointment and subsequent firing of Peter Mandelson. Labour MP Clive Lewis stated the Prime Minister "doesn't seem up to the job," reflecting a wider sentiment of frustration among MPs who feel the leadership has lost control. The backlash intensified over Mandelson's links to Jeffrey Epstein, which colleagues argue represents a betrayal of the party's promise to uphold higher standards. This internal turmoil, compounded by other recent resignations, has created a despondent atmosphere, with some members urging Starmer to "get a grip" to avoid losing public trust.</p>

          <p>Officials in Utah have arrested and identified a suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event at Utah Valley University. Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah native, was taken into custody after a family member informed law enforcement that Robinson had confessed to them. During a press conference, authorities revealed that the suspect had become more political in recent years and had expressed disdain for Kirk's viewpoints. Evidence recovered includes a high-powered rifle and bullet cartridges with politically charged messages engraved on them, suggesting a premeditated and politically motivated act.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Tether is launching a new U.S.-regulated token, USAT, and has appointed Bo Hines, a former White House advisor, as CEO of its new U.S. division. This move signals a strategic effort by Tether to engage more closely with American regulators and institutions, especially following the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration. The new USAT token is specifically designed for U.S. businesses and will operate under the GENIUS Act, distinguishing it from the globally focused USDT. The initiative aims to solidify the U.S. dollar's dominance in the digital age by providing a compliant stablecoin option for the domestic market.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 11:47:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent economic data indicates that the Trump administration's tariffs are now contributing to higher consumer prices, with the Consumer Price Index rising 2.9% in August from a year ago. Goods that are heavily imported, such as coffee, audio equipment, and furniture, have seen some of the most significant price increases. Initially, many U.S. companies absorbed the tariff costs or stockpiled goods to delay price hikes, but that strategy appears to be ending.

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the influential conservative activist who co-founded Turning Point USA, has died at the age of 31 after being shot while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. A close ally of President Trump, Kirk was a pivotal figure in mobilizing young conservative voters and played a significant role in the Trump campaign's ground game. His death has drawn condolences from across the political spectrum, with President Trump calling him a "very, very good friend."

He was instrumental in mobilizing young voters and was credited by Trump for his role in the 2024 election victory.

          <p>The suspect in the killing of Charlie Kirk, identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was apprehended after a family member contacted authorities with information that he had confessed.

Utah Governor Spencer Cox confirmed that investigators learned the suspect had become increasingly political and had described Kirk as someone who was "full of hate." Evidence, including messages on the Discord app, pointed to the location of the murder weapon, a Mauser bolt-action rifle, which was found wrapped in a towel near the university campus.</p>

However, the club's investment thesis remains intact, as such delays are not uncommon and are not expected to alter the company's long-term cash flow trajectory.

This approach marks a significant shift from her more confrontational stance during Trump's first term.

Lepore emphasizes that while the physical parchment and ink are subject to decay, the concepts within it endure and evolve over time.

Clothing resellers are seeing a surge in donations of larger-sized clothing, altering inventory dynamics that previously saw smaller sizes as more common. In response, some retailers are reducing the in-store stock of extended sizes, making them online-only offerings. While the demand for plus-size clothing remains, it is shifting toward smaller plus-sizes as consumers downsize.

          <p>Julia Fenner, a dual UK-Belarusian citizen and wife of a British diplomat, has been released from a Belarusian prison as part of a larger deal brokered between Belarus and the United States. Fenner was one of 52 political prisoners freed in exchange for the U.S. easing some sanctions on Belarus's national airline. She had been detained in March 2024 and was serving a long sentence on charges related to extremist activity. The UK's Europe Minister praised the release as "great news" and a "significant breakthrough," thanking the U.S. for its diplomatic efforts, though over 1,000 political prisoners remain incarcerated in Belarus.</p>

          <p>China has expelled four senior generals from its national legislature, the National People's Congress, as part of an ongoing anti-corruption drive within the military. The dismissed officers include Wang Chunning, commander of the People's Armed Police, and three other high-ranking officials from the rocket force and logistics departments. General Wang is the highest-ranking of the four, having previously commanded the crucial Beijing garrison responsible for defending the capital. This move signals a continuation of President Xi Jinping's campaign to root out corruption and enforce loyalty within the People's Liberation Army and its associated forces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of luxury furniture company RH declined after it reported second-quarter revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates and lowered its full-year outlook. The company attributed the miss to a significant financial hit from tariffs, which it now expects to be $30 million higher than previously forecasted. CEO Gary Friedman also noted uncertainty from President Trump's threat to impose new tariffs specifically on imported furniture, a move intended to bolster domestic manufacturing. RH has been actively shifting its operations out of China and is exploring alternatives to its manufacturing in India to mitigate these ongoing trade-related challenges.</p>

          <p>The UK's House of Lords held a deeply personal and emotional debate on a bill that would legalize assisted dying in England and Wales. Peers from both sides shared poignant stories of their loved ones' suffering, with a record number of members requesting to speak. Supporters, like Lord Michael Dobbs, argued the current law is "cruel and untenable," while opponents, including former Prime Minister Theresa May, raised concerns about inadequate safeguards and the risk of pressuring vulnerable individuals. The bill's sponsor, Lord Charlie Falconer, urged the House to scrutinize but not block the legislation, respecting its prior passage in the House of Commons.</p>

          <p>Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir will remain in the starting lineup for Manchester United's upcoming derby match against Manchester City. The decision comes amid a shake-up in the team's goalkeeper ranks, with Andre Onana leaving on loan to a Turkish club and the recent signing of 23-year-old Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp. Head coach Ruben Amorim confirmed Bayindir will continue for now but praised Lammens as a player with the potential to be the team's first-choice keeper for years to come. The changes reflect the club's strategy of balancing immediate needs with a focus on developing future talent.</p>

          <p>In an op-ed, Senator Bernie Sanders argues that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is unfit for office and must resign due to his rejection of fundamental scientific principles. Sanders contends that Kennedy's anti-vaccine stance is just one part of a broader dismissal of modern science, including his public questioning of the germ theory of disease. The senator highlights Kennedy's history of spreading misinformation about vaccines for polio and COVID-19, as well as his promotion of debunked theories about HIV/AIDS. Sanders concludes that Kennedy's actions endanger public health and that he cannot be trusted to lead the nation's top health agency.</p>

          <p>The Flanders Festival Ghent's decision to cancel a concert by the Munich Philharmonic because its Israeli conductor, Lahav Shani, had not sufficiently condemned his government's actions has ignited a fierce debate. German officials and Jewish leaders have labeled the move antisemitic, drawing parallels to historical anti-Jewish boycotts. The controversy highlights the complex and polarizing issue of cultural boycotts, with some comparing it to the dismissal of Russian conductor Valery Gergiev for his support of Putin. Critics argue that forcing artists to make political statements is a hallmark of authoritarianism and that such boycotts deepen societal divisions rather than fostering peace.</p>

          <p>Military experts suggest that China's DF-5C intercontinental ballistic missile, a liquid-fueled rocket, has undergone technological upgrades that enhance its readiness and launch capabilities. Unlike older liquid-fuel systems that require lengthy fueling times, the DF-5C appears to feature advanced fuel storage technology. This innovation, indicated by protective membranes on its rocket nozzles, would allow the missile to be stored fully fueled in a silo for long periods. Such a development would significantly reduce its launch preparation time, making it a more versatile and immediate threat comparable to solid-fuel missiles like the American Minuteman III.</p>
