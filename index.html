        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tsunami advisory for southern Alaska was canceled after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck approximately 50 miles south of Sand Point. The initial tsunami warning prompted evacuations in some coastal towns, but officials later downgraded the alert, stating that large, widespread waves were not expected due to the quake's shallow depth. While the earthquake was felt across the Alaska Peninsula, authorities confirmed there was no danger to Anchorage, and the primary impact was limited to potential small sea level changes.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. Sources confirmed her termination from the Manhattan office, where she had served as a prominent prosecutor in several high-profile cases. Notably, she was the lead prosecutor in the criminal case against Sean "Diddy" Combs and also played a key role in the prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Her father was famously fired as FBI director by President Trump in 2017.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting deaths of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca, both 70. The couple was found dead in their Encino, California, home following a wellness check. Police believe the suspect, identified through surveillance footage and facial recognition, entered the home through an unlocked door and was confronted by the couple when they returned. The incident is being treated as a random, tragic event, not a targeted attack or part of a larger crime ring.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing thousands of veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. The legislation addresses a gap created when the Department of Veterans Affairs ended a previous homeowner assistance program, leaving many veterans with unaffordable options. This new law will allow veterans who have fallen behind on mortgage payments to move those missed payments to the end of their loan term, thus making their loans current. The measure is now awaiting the president's signature to be enacted.</p>

The government spent £400 million on the secret plan, which has relocated approximately 900 individuals and 3,600 family members so far. The full extent of the harm caused by the leak remains unknown.</p>

          <p>This article explores how the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theory has become an uncontrollable political force that now poses a significant challenge to President Trump. After years of leveraging such theories, Trump has lost control of the narrative, with his attempts to dismiss the story as a "hoax" only fueling more suspicion among his base and the general public. The saga combines credible investigative reporting with a core, unproven secret—the client list—making it uniquely potent and persistent. The situation reveals the limits of Trump's ability to command attention and control political narratives he helped create.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Germany are set to formalize a new agreement to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants across the English Channel. As part of the deal, Germany has committed to changing its laws by the end of the year to make facilitating illegal migration to the UK a specific crime. Currently, German law does not explicitly prohibit smuggling people to a non-EU country. This change is expected to help authorities disrupt the supply chain for small boats and equipment stored in Germany before being used for dangerous Channel crossings.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Festival Chapín de Los Angeles, a major annual Guatemalan cultural event, have postponed the festival due to community safety concerns surrounding recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity. The event, which typically draws 80,000 people, was moved from August to October to ensure the well-being of attendees, vendors, and staff. This follows the cancellation or postponement of several other community events in the Los Angeles area, as aggressive immigration sweeps have instilled fear in local immigrant communities, despite a recent court injunction aiming to restrict such tactics.</p>

          <p>More than 20 children are in the custody of California's child-welfare agency as authorities investigate a Los Angeles-area couple who are their legal parents. The investigation began after a two-month-old infant in the couple's care was hospitalized with a traumatic head injury, allegedly caused by a nanny. The case has raised questions about the circumstances under which the children, ranging in age from two months to 13 years, were born via numerous surrogate mothers. Some surrogates have come forward stating they were misled and unaware that other surrogates were also involved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans is finalizing a bankruptcy plan to settle 633 clergy abuse claims, but investors are arguing that about half of these claims could be legally thrown out. Arguments center on claims filed after the court's deadline or those involving abusers not directly under archdiocesan authority. If successful, this could significantly alter the settlement dynamics, potentially increasing the average payout for remaining victims but also making it easier for opponents to derail the entire deal. The church has agreed to pay at least $180 million into a settlement trust.</p>

          <p>This article provides a chronological overview of President Trump's public statements regarding Jeffrey Epstein, tracing his evolving rhetoric from his first term through the 2024 campaign to the present. In 2019, he distanced himself from Epstein, whom he had previously called "terrific," while also suggesting Epstein may have been killed. On the campaign trail, he pledged to release the Epstein files, but as president, he has reversed course, now calling the matter a "Democratic hoax" and growing angry with supporters who continue to press the issue, creating a significant political contradiction.</p>

          <p>A landmark UK study has confirmed the success of a technique using DNA from three people to prevent the transmission of devastating inherited mitochondrial disorders. Researchers reported that eight children, born using this method, appear healthy and free of the diseases that have plagued their families for generations. The procedure, known as mitochondrial donation, involves transferring the nuclear DNA from a mother's egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria. While hailed as a major breakthrough, the technique remains controversial, with critics raising ethical concerns about heritable genetic modification.</p>

          <p>Doctors in the United Kingdom have announced that eight babies have been born using a pioneering technique that combines genetic material from three people. The method was developed to prevent incurable and often fatal mitochondrial diseases from being passed from mother to child. The procedure involves using a donor woman's egg to provide healthy mitochondria, the tiny powerhouses of our cells. All eight children are reportedly healthy and developing normally, providing the first proof that the legally approved but controversial technique is successful in preventing these devastating conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has walked back suggestions that he might fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating that such a move is "highly unlikely." This clarification came after reports that he had asked Republican lawmakers whether he should oust the central bank head, a move that caused brief market instability. While downplaying the likelihood of firing Powell, Trump continued his criticism, calling him a "knucklehead" and accusing him of mismanaging Fed property renovations, suggesting a case could be built to remove him "for cause."

          <p>President Trump stated that China is making "big steps" in its efforts to control the flow of fentanyl into the United States. This positive assessment marks a shift in tone from previous statements where he directly linked tariffs on Chinese goods to the fentanyl crisis. Trump's comments come amid ongoing high-level trade negotiations between the two countries. He acknowledged that while tariffs were a penalty related to the fentanyl issue, he believes Beijing is now actively working to address the problem, which has been a major point of contention in U.S.-China relations.</p>
