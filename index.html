          <p>A deadly Russian attack on Kyiv has resulted in at least nine fatalities and dozens of injuries, marking the deadliest strike since 2024. The assault involved cruise missiles, drones, and ballistic weapons, targeting residential areas and infrastructure. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is returning home from South Africa earlier than planned due to the attack, which comes amid strained negotiations to end the war, and he has stated that Russia is not seeking peace, and continues to kill Ukrainians. The attack has further complicated peace talks, with President Trump accusing Zelenskyy of prolonging the conflict.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren is initiating a comprehensive investigation into the Trump administration's plans to dismantle the Department of Education. Warren aims to gather insights from students, parents, teachers, and borrowers who may be adversely affected by these changes. She sent letters to various education and civil rights groups, including the NAACP, NEA, and AFT, to assess the potential impact on access to affordable, high-quality public education. Warren views the proposed dismantling as a "reckless crusade" that could jeopardize critical funding and services for students, particularly those with disabilities and low-income families.</p>

          <p>Despite initial optimism, oil companies are now worried about the potential impact of President Trump's trade policies. Tariffs are increasing the cost of essential materials, such as steel pipes, and creating uncertainty in the market. Executives fear that a recession caused by trade wars could depress oil prices and discourage new drilling. The industry is grappling with balancing the benefits of deregulation with the economic risks of trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered evidence of massive icebergs, comparable in size to cities, that once drifted off the UK coast. Distinctive scratch marks on the North Sea floor reveal the presence of these giant icebergs over 18,000 years ago. The findings provide crucial information about the behavior of ice sheets and shelves, potentially helping to understand how Antarctica might respond to current climate change. By analyzing these ancient iceberg tracks, researchers hope to improve models of sea level rise.</p>
