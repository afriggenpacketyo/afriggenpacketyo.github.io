          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is appealing to the Trump administration to immediately establish a "tariff exclusion process" to prevent the U.S. economy from sliding into a recession. In a letter obtained by CNBC, the business lobbying group requested that tariffs be automatically lifted on all small business importers and products that cannot be produced domestically or are not readily available in the U.S. The Chamber emphasizes the potential for "irreparable harm" to small businesses if these exclusions are not implemented.

          <p>Eli Lilly reported first-quarter revenue and earnings that surpassed expectations, driven by high demand for its weight loss and diabetes treatments, Mounjaro and Zepbound. However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to its acquisition of an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics.

Experts suggest HELOCs may be easier to qualify for due to their interest rates being based on the prime rate plus a margin, and some lenders offer more flexible debt-to-income (DTI) requirements on HELOCs. However, choosing between a home equity loan and HELOC should depend on individual needs, considering how the funds will be used, repayment preferences, and risk tolerance.
