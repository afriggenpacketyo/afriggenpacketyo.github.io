          <p>Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed in a targeted shooting at their home, while State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were injured in a separate shooting. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, was apprehended after a two-day manhunt and faces murder and attempted murder charges. The shootings are believed to be politically motivated, with Boelter allegedly targeting other lawmakers' homes the same night. Boelter served on a state board with Hoffman, and authorities are investigating whether the suspect knew Hoffman or Hortman personally, as a search of the man's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Iran would "like to talk" about de-escalating the conflict with Israel, reiterating that Iran is "not winning this war" and should negotiate immediately. These comments come amid ongoing missile exchanges between Israel and Iran, initiated by Israeli attacks targeting Iranian military commanders and nuclear facilities. Trump also mentioned his previous offer of 60 days for Iran to negotiate a new nuclear deal, adding that it is painful for both parties. The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran has been sending messages to Israel and the U.S. via Arab intermediaries, signaling openness to negotiations if the U.S. does not join Israeli attacks.</p>

          <p>Following the murder of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband, and the wounding of another lawmaker and his wife, members of Congress are calling for increased security measures. Senators will receive a briefing from law enforcement on Tuesday, while House Republicans held a "tense" conference call to discuss their concerns. The main point of contention is the request for police presence outside their homes at all times, which law enforcement authorities say would require more funding from Congress. Michigan Democratic Rep. Hillary Scholten postponed a town hall event after learning she was on a list connected to the recent tragic shooting in Minnesota.</p>

          <p>Roksana Lecka, a 22-year-old nursery worker from Hounslow, West London, has been convicted of abusing 21 babies, including kicking one in the face and stepping on another's shoulder. She admitted to seven counts of cruelty and was found guilty of another 14 after CCTV footage revealed she pinched, scratched, pushed, and covered the mouths of children in her care. Lecka told police she smoked cannabis before her shifts and was seen vaping near a baby, with the Metropolitan Police describing her actions as exceptionally cruel. The nursery has since closed, and Lecka will be sentenced at Kingston Crown Court on September 26.</p>

The government has accepted the recommendation for better data collection on the ethnicity of suspects and has promised research into the factors driving exploitation. Concerns remain about whether the report will lead to meaningful change or simply be another set of recommendations that are shelved.</p>

AMD recently unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including a full-server rack called Helios, which is expected to be crucial for AI customers.

          <p>Investing $400,000 in an immediate fixed annuity at age 65 can provide monthly income ranging from approximately $2,246 to $2,590, varying based on gender and payout option. Factors such as gender, interest rates, annuity type, and optional features influence the monthly payments, with women typically receiving lower payments due to longer life expectancy. The current higher interest rate environment makes annuity purchases more appealing, but it is essential to consider individual financial situations, liquidity needs, and retirement goals before investing. Annuities provide guaranteed income but come with trade-offs like illiquidity and potential loss of higher investment returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giants Huawei Technologies and ByteDance are planning significant investments in Brazil's cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence sectors, moves that may heighten U.S. concerns. Huawei is reportedly set to announce a deal with Dataprev to use its data centers and is in discussions with Edge UOL for infrastructure, cybersecurity, and AI operations. These expansions come as the United States has increased warnings about Chinese investments in critical tech infrastructure across Latin America, citing risks of data theft, surveillance, and strategic leverage.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to expand mass deportations in major U.S. cities, particularly those run by Democrats, directing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to focus on cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper apologized to victims and announced a national inquiry into grooming gangs, with the government committed to following all 12 of the report's recommendations, including mandatory data collection on ethnicity and nationality of suspects.

          <h2>U.S. Steel Shares Rally as Trump Approves Nippon Takeover</h2>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares increased after President Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, issuing an executive order that allowed the deal so long as they signed a national security agreement. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename the company, transfer production or jobs outside the U.S., and close or idle plants before certain time frames. U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, and all regulatory approvals have been received.</p>

          <h2>Lobbyist Claims Against New York Anti-Plastic Bill Deemed 'Misleading'</h2>

          <p>The oil and petrochemical lobby is accused of attempting to undermine a New York state proposal to reduce plastic waste by arguing that it will disproportionately harm people of color, a claim deemed 'misleading' by advocates. The packaging reduction and recycling infrastructure bill aims to reduce plastic packaging by 30% and boost recycling rates. Lobbyists have reportedly targeted the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic, and Asian American legislative caucus, arguing the bill will raise food prices. Advocates and religious leaders have condemned this tactic as racist and manipulative, emphasizing the health risks of the plastic supply chain to communities of color.</p>
