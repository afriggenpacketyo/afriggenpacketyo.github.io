          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed Robert Malone, who is known for his anti-vaccine views and conspiracy theories, to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Malone has a history of disputing scientific data, including the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines and promoting discredited COVID-19 treatments. He has also alleged government psychological warfare against its citizens. Public health experts have expressed concerns that this appointment undermines the credibility of the committee and endangers public health. Malone's newsletter has over 350,000 subscribers where he shares anti-vaccine claims and praises Kennedy, marking a significant shift in the shaping of America's vaccine policy.</p>

          <p>Iran launched dozens of ballistic missiles toward Israel in retaliation for Israel's preemptive strike targeting Iran's nuclear program and military leaders. Israeli officials stated that the strike aimed to eliminate the Iranian threat. The U.S. assisted Israel in intercepting the missiles, and U.S. troops in the Middle East were ordered into bunkers during the attacks. While the U.S. government maintains it did not provide military assistance or have any involvement in the Israeli strike, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests or personnel, stating that Israel acted unilaterally in self-defense. The Israeli military reports that its fighter jets struck the Iranian regime's nuclear site in the Isfahan area, dismantling a facility for producing metallic uranium. The situation remains tense with concerns about further escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>Robert Morris, the founder of Gateway Church in Texas, is being sued by a woman who claims he sexually assaulted her when she was 12 years old. The lawsuit alleges that Morris and others engaged in libel, malice, defamation, failure to report, civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and unjust enrichment. The plaintiff, Cindy Clemishire, claims the abuse occurred over four-and-a-half years, beginning in 1982. Morris resigned from his position in June 2024 and subsequently filed a lawsuit against the church, claiming his relationship with a minor was not a breach of contract, leading to financial disputes over deferred compensation and retirement benefits.</p>

Trump also mentioned that Iranian hardliners who opposed a nuclear deal are now dead, suggesting further consequences if a deal is not reached.

          <p>Hollywood is increasingly relying on live-action remakes of animated films, with recent examples including *Lilo & Stitch* and *How to Train Your Dragon*. These remakes, while entertaining, highlight a concerning trend of nostalgia being exploited with shorter intervals between original and remake releases. While *Lilo & Stitch* diverged somewhat from its source material, *How to Train Your Dragon* closely mirrors the original, raising questions about the necessity and artistic risk involved in these adaptations. The industry's struggle to attract moviegoers is driving this trend, but it lacks the innovation needed to ensure the medium's future beyond recycling existing content.</p>

          <p>Gulf states are expressing concerns about being drawn into the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, with Saudi Arabia condemning Israel's actions. Despite efforts to improve relations between Israel and Arab nations, Saudi Arabia remains cautious due to its role as a leader in Sunni Islam and its need to maintain solidarity with the Palestinian cause. The Gulf states are particularly vulnerable due to a lack of effective defense systems and the presence of U.S. troops on their territory.

          <p>Debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed, typically for unsecured debts like credit cards and personal loans. The process requires borrowers to stop making payments and instead save money in a dedicated account, while a debt relief company negotiates with creditors. While it can reduce debt and avoid bankruptcy, debt settlement also carries risks, including credit damage, fees, and potential tax consequences. It is generally suited for individuals with significant debt who are already behind on payments, but it's crucial to weigh the benefits against the trade-offs and consider alternative options.

          <p>Amazon is restructuring its health-care business into six new units to streamline operations and address fragmented patient experiences, following several senior executive departures. The reorganization aims to accelerate innovation and simplify the company's approach to the multitrillion-dollar U.S. health-care market. While Amazon has made significant investments in health care, including the acquisition of One Medical and the launch of Amazon Pharmacy, it has also faced setbacks, such as the closure of Amazon Care. The new structure focuses on clinical care delivery, operations, strategic growth, technology, compliance, and pharmacy services.</p>

          <p>An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff in western India, resulting in the deaths of nearly all passengers and crew on board. Preliminary data indicates that the plane lost altitude rapidly after reaching 625 feet, crashing into a residential area. Investigators will examine the plane's black boxes, maintenance records, pilot maneuvers, and weather conditions to determine the cause of the crash. While the Dreamliner has faced manufacturing and quality concerns in the past, it is not immediately clear if these are related to the crash.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering borrowing against their equity can choose between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, the monthly payments for a $100,000 loan are nearly identical for both options, but HELOC rates are variable and could become cheaper if interest rates decrease. HELOCs offer flexibility with revolving credit and interest-only payments during the draw period, while home equity loans provide a lump sum with immediate repayment obligations. Borrowers should carefully assess their financial needs and consider both short- and long-term costs before making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>
