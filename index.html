        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Jack Reed criticized President Trump's dismissal of his own intelligence chief, suggesting it's politically motivated amid escalating tensions with Iran. Reed highlighted that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified weeks prior that Iran wasn't developing nuclear weapons, contradicting Trump's claims. Reed believes Trump's rejection stems from contemplating an attack on Iran, requiring a narrative of imminent nuclear threat. The senator emphasized the need for immediate correction if Gabbard's testimony was false, rather than dismissing it after Israeli actions.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran and President Trump's considerations regarding Iranian nuclear facilities, the U.S. Air Force E-4B Nightwatch, also known as the "doomsday plane," has garnered attention. The plane, designed during the Cold War as a mobile command post, is capable of remaining airborne for up to a week and communicating worldwide. The E-4B protects national security officials, the President, and the Secretary of Defense, enabling them to continue governing during a nuclear conflict. The Nightwatch can withstand electromagnetic pulses, nuclear blasts, and cyberattacks, with leaders within Iran threatening retaliation against the U.S. if it enters the conflict.</p>

Investigators found empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter.

          <p>Amazon's free and easy returns policy is causing problems for small businesses, with many sellers experiencing rising return fraud and mistakenly shipping used products to customers. This has led some sellers to exit Amazon's Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program due to the financial risks. Amazon has started charging sellers a new fee for items exceeding certain return rate thresholds, which has led to some improvements. Some sellers have raised prices due to the increased cost of returns, while others are using camera systems to track outgoing items and incoming returns to combat fraud.</p>

These incidents follow a wave of assassinations targeting Iranian military officials, leading to increased concern about infiltration.

          <p>A federal appellate court panel has blocked a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms, deeming it unconstitutional. Civil liberties groups hailed the ruling as a victory for the separation of church and state, arguing that the mandate would isolate non-Christian students. Louisiana's Attorney General Liz Murrill plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar laws are being challenged in other states, testing the court on the issue of religion and government.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict reveals a mix of his instincts, including a predator's eye for weakness and a fear of accountability. While initially appearing eager to join the war, Trump has postponed a decision, promising a resolution within "two weeks." This delay reflects his pattern of shirking decisions and his unwillingness to act against Russian President Vladimir Putin's wishes. Trump's vulnerability lies in his lack of preparation for war, including congressional authorization, financial resources, competent leadership, allied support, and public opinion.</p>

          <p>The superyacht Bayesian, owned by British tech tycoon Mike Lynch, has been raised from the seabed nearly a year after it sank off the coast of Sicily, resulting in seven deaths. Italian officials will conduct inspections to investigate the sinking, which an earlier investigation suggested was caused by high winds. Previous salvage efforts were delayed after a diver died during the operation. Raising the vessel is considered crucial for understanding the cause of the disaster, with investigations underway in both the UK and Italy.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its home-grown operating system, OpenHarmony, in space, marking a significant step towards reducing reliance on foreign software. The OpenHarmony real-time operating system (RTOS) was tested on the Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat, improving data updates and stability compared to earlier systems. The mission, running on a domestically produced chip, achieved a fully home-grown hardware-software solution. Following the mission, national technical standards have been proposed to guide the use of OpenHarmony in small satellites, encouraging broader adoption across commercial and research missions in China.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Afghans who fled to the US after the Taliban regained power are facing deportation due to the Trump administration's immigration policies. The loss of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and the addition of Afghanistan to the travel ban list have created fear and uncertainty within the Afghan community. Advocates and lawmakers argue that Afghanistan remains dangerous, especially for minorities and those who assisted the foreign war effort.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of rapid growth, computer science enrollment is declining in many programs, signaling a potential bursting of the computer science bubble. This decline is attributed to a grim job outlook for entry-level coders, with artificial intelligence increasingly capable of writing code. This has led to layoffs and hiring freezes in the tech industry, prompting young people to reconsider their career paths. While some argue that the decline is a temporary fluctuation, others suggest that AI may be permanently displacing tech workers, potentially impacting all entry-level white-collar jobs.</p>

          <p>The UK faces significant questions regarding its role in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, given its tangled history in the region. Successive governments have been deeply concerned about Iran's nuclear ambitions, and there are growing worries about Iranian activities within the UK. While ministers are currently focused on diplomacy, the UK's approach is questioned, with some suggesting that Europe is largely irrelevant in the situation. The UK's legal and political considerations are complex, particularly concerning potential support for military action and the impact on domestic politics.</p>

          <p>This article explores the shift away from the body positivity movement towards a renewed focus on thinness, driven by social media trends like SkinnyTok and the rise of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic. The author notes that many plus-size figures who championed body positivity have lost weight, and a new wave of influencers is promoting restrictive eating habits. While acknowledging the potential for disordered eating, the article suggests that SkinnyTok's harsh honesty resonates with women who feel pressure to be thin and are drawn to the perceived benefits of being smaller. The article also explores the potential for SkinnyTok to be a gateway to more conservative viewpoints.</p>

The request was made recently by Elbridge Colby, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, the Financial Times has reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

          <p>Donald Trump has taken the commercialization of politics to a new level, with his business ventures intertwined with his presidency. Since his reelection campaign began, Trump is estimated to have more than doubled his net worth to $5.4bn, thanks in part to Trump-branded products. The recent launch of Trump Mobile, a Trump-branded phone service, exemplifies this trend, with analysts noting the blurred lines between business and politics. Critics argue that Trump's presidency has become a brand franchise, blurring the boundaries between commerce and the office of the president.</p>

While not as exploitative as "Showgirls," the author finds the subplot oddly cynical and questions its necessity in a film marketed as a rom-com.
