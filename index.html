          <p>According to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health, at least 24 people were killed and dozens injured by Israeli forces while waiting for humanitarian aid at a distribution center in the southern Gaza Strip. The Israel Defense Forces acknowledged a shooting approximately 500 meters from one of the aid sites, stating that forces fired at suspects moving towards them and deviating from access routes. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation reported that aid distribution was conducted safely at their site but acknowledged the IDF is investigating whether civilians were injured outside the safe corridor. The UN Secretary-General has called for an independent investigation into the incident. The optimism score for this article is relatively low due to the loss of life and ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Thames Water's efforts to secure its financial future suffered a setback as KKR, a US private equity firm, withdrew from plans to invest £4bn into the company. This increases the possibility of government-supervised administration for the UK's largest water company, which serves a quarter of the population, primarily in London and southern England. Despite KKR's withdrawal, Thames Water chairman Sir Adrian Montague stated that the company will continue discussions with creditors and stakeholders. Sources indicate that the politicization of the water industry served as a major disincentive for KKR to proceed with the deal, but water services will continue uninterrupted regardless of ownership. This article has a relatively low optimism score due to the financial uncertainty surrounding a major utility provider.</p>

          <p>During the Spanish Grand Prix, Max Verstappen and George Russell made contact in Turn One, leading to a stewards' inquiry. Red Bull ordered Verstappen to give the place back based on recent incidents and the expectation of a penalty.

Christian Horner admitted that Red Bull's decision to pit Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car was also a mistake.

          <p>The article discusses the role of shamelessness in politics, using examples from Donald Trump's career. It argues that politicians often have to justify changing their positions, even if the explanations are not genuine. Ross Douthat suggests that Trump's willingness to contradict himself is part of what keeps him viable, reassuring voters that anything extreme is provisional. The article also touches on examples from other politicians, such as John Kerry, and how their flip-flops were perceived. The optimism score for this article is moderate, as it reflects on the nature of political behavior and adaptability.</p>

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and state media have described the price wars as "involutionary competition" that hinders investment in research and development.

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has sharply cut its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. due to President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The U.S. growth outlook was revised downward to 1.6% this year and 1.5% in 2026, citing the fallout from tariffs, economic policy uncertainty, and a slowdown in net immigration. The OECD also lowered its global growth forecast, noting that the slowdown is concentrated in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The OECD adjusted its inflation forecast, saying higher trade costs will push up inflation, but this will be partially offset by weaker commodity prices (not investment advice).

          <p>Parents whose babies died while under the care of maternity units in Nottingham have welcomed a corporate manslaughter investigation into Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust. The investigation follows failings that led to hundreds of babies dying or being injured. NUH was previously fined £800,000 in 2023 after admitting failings in Wynter Andrews' care. While the parents are pleased with the investigation, they maintain that individuals need to be held accountable.

          <p>Five women from across England shared their stories of being groomed and abused as children or young adults, highlighting the ongoing impact on their lives.

          <p>The United Kingdom is increasing its defense spending, planning to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and prepare its army for potential conflict in Europe. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain "cannot ignore the threat that Russia poses" and pledged sweeping changes to British defenses. The government will accept recommendations from a strategic defense review, including increasing production of submarines and weapons, investing in cyber command, and developing new drone technology. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and to assure the U.S. that Europe is increasing its defense contributions. The optimism score is moderate, as it reflects a focus on defense and potential conflict, but also on strengthening international alliances.</p>

          <p>In Poland's recent presidential election, nationalist candidate Karol Nawrocki defeated liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, marking a shift in the country's political landscape. This outcome follows a trend of voters rejecting Trumpist candidates in other countries, making Poland's decision significant.
