          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson described the event as a potential turning point for the nation. He urged political leaders on both sides to de-escalate their rhetoric, arguing that calling opponents names like 'Nazis and fascists' can incite deranged individuals to action. Johnson stated that while vigorous debate is healthy, it must be motivated by love for one's fellow citizens rather than hate. He hopes this tragic event will encourage a return to more civil discourse and appeal to the country's 'better angels' in honoring Kirk's memory.</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a España cycling race was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in central Madrid. Demonstrators knocked down barriers and occupied the road, leading organizers to declare Jonas Vingegaard, the race leader, the overall winner. The protests were directed at the Israel-Premier Tech team, which had faced demonstrations throughout the multi-stage race. Clashes between protesters and the more than 1,000 deployed police officers continued after the race was officially ended, disrupting what was meant to be the grand finale of the prestigious cycling event.</p>

          <p>In the days following the assassination of its founder, Charlie Kirk, the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA (TPUSA) has experienced a massive surge in interest. A TPUSA spokesperson reported receiving over 32,000 inquiries from individuals wanting to establish new college chapters, a significant number compared to its current 900. This influx suggests that the tragedy may be galvanizing support for the movement and accelerating Kirk's vision of expanding the organization's presence on campuses across America. Kirk's widow has vowed that the movement will not die but will instead become stronger and louder than ever before.</p>

          <p>A coalition of seven prominent women's organizations in the UK has warned the government against weakening its flagship Employment Rights Bill. In a letter to the business secretary, the groups argued that proposed amendments from the House of Lords would undermine a 'once-in-a-generation' opportunity to tackle the gender pay gap. They highlighted that women are disproportionately affected by insecure work, such as zero-hours contracts, and would benefit most from the bill's original provisions. The organizations are urging ministers to deliver the legislation in full, without dilution, to advance gender equality and fulfill promises made to working people.</p>

          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has officially terminated talks with Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the sale of its general merchandise retailer, Argos. The discussions ended after JD.com reportedly sought to engage on a 'materially revised set of terms and commitments.' Sainsbury's concluded that the new terms were not in the best interest of its shareholders and decided to end the negotiations.

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has shared new information about the 22-year-old suspect arrested for the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The governor stated that the suspect, Tyler Robinson, is not cooperating with authorities but that his friends and family are providing details, suggesting he was 'deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.' Cox also confirmed that the suspect lived with a romantic partner who is transitioning from male to female, and that investigators are trying to determine if this is relevant to the motive. Formal charges are expected to be filed soon, which may reveal more about the reasons behind the attack.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has become the new men's 100m world champion, ending a nine-year drought for Jamaica in the event since Usain Bolt's last global title. The 24-year-old sprinter ran a personal best of 9.77 seconds in Tokyo to claim the gold medal, leading a Jamaican one-two finish with Kishane Thompson taking silver. Seville's victory is seen as the dawn of a new era for Jamaican men's sprinting, fulfilling the long-held expectation that he would be the successor to the legendary Bolt. The win was particularly meaningful as Bolt, an inspiration and mentor to Seville, was in the crowd to witness the triumph.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has started its Premier League title defense with four wins, all secured by goals scored in the final minutes of play, a trend now being dubbed 'Arne Time' after manager Arne Slot. This pattern of late-game heroics, reminiscent of Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United, has become a defining characteristic of the team's early season performance. The team has already scored more goals in the 90th minute or later this season than in all of the previous one. While the need for last-minute winners suggests the team is not yet at its peak, it also demonstrates a powerful psychological edge and resilient winning mentality.</p>

These services, which split purchases into interest-free installments, represent a direct challenge to credit card revenue from transaction fees and interest. More significantly, financial experts warn that BNPL usage creates a 'giant black hole' in a consumer's credit profile, as these short-term loans are often not reported to credit bureaus. This makes it difficult for lenders to accurately assess a person's total debt and overall credit risk, posing a potential threat to the broader financial system.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, aiming to mitigate diplomatic fallout from recent Israeli actions. The visit follows an Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar, that targeted Hamas leaders but also killed a Qatari security officer, angering the key U.S. ally. Rubio's mission is to convey President Trump's displeasure with the strike while reaffirming broad U.S. support for Israel's security. The trip occurs amid heightened international pressure on Israel over its war in Gaza and the expansion of settlements in the West Bank.</p>

          <p>The financial markets are keenly focused on the U.S. Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting, where an interest rate cut is widely anticipated. While a 25-basis-point reduction is expected, investors will be paying closest attention to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent statements for clues about the central bank's future plans. The decision comes after a period of mixed inflation data and slowing jobs growth, which Powell has previously indicated might warrant a policy adjustment. The Fed's forward guidance will be critical in shaping market sentiment and determining the direction of stocks for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham warns that the U.S. is in a 'dangerous place' following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. He argues that political violence historically erupts in America during periods of existential tension over national identity and who is included in 'We the People.' Meacham draws parallels between the current climate and other violent eras in U.S. history, suggesting that the nation is debating not just the means but the very purpose of its politics. He urges leaders and citizens to learn from history and recommit to peaceful debate to avoid breaking faith with the American covenant.</p>

          <p>Journalist James Fallows reflects on the recent wave of political violence in America, comparing the current moment to other painful, history-defining periods like the 1960s and 9/11. He warns that cycles of political violence are deeply damaging and self-reinforcing, and that loose talk of 'civil war' is catastrophic. Fallows advises against immediate, ungenerous reactions, citing George W. Bush's outreach to American Muslims after 9/11 as a positive example. He concludes by quoting Robert F. Kennedy's impromptu speech after Martin Luther King Jr.'s murder, calling for a dedication 'to tame the savageness of man.'</p>

          <p>Following a large march in London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared that the national flag will not be surrendered to those who use it for 'violence, fear and division.' The 'Unite the Kingdom' march, which drew over 150,000 people, resulted in clashes and injuries to 26 police officers. Starmer affirmed the right to peaceful protest but condemned assaults on police and the intimidation of people based on their background. He emphasized that the flag represents Britain's tolerance and diversity, values he vowed to protect from extremist appropriation.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents devastated by a recent wildfire have formed the Altadena Dining Club to support local restaurants struggling with a post-disaster drop in business. The group, founded by a resident who lost her own home, rotates weekly between different eateries, providing a vital economic boost and a space for community healing. For many members, who were strangers before the fire, the club has become a crucial support network where they can share experiences and forge new friendships. The initiative serves as a model for post-disaster recovery, demonstrating how grassroots efforts can help rebuild both a local economy and community bonds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary critiques the pervasive tipping culture in the United States, arguing that the government's new 'no tax on tips' law only further enables a flawed system. The author contends that instead of creating complex tax deductions for tips, the focus should be on ensuring employers pay their workers a fair, living wage, as is common in many other countries. The article criticizes the temporary nature of the new tax benefit and questions the eligibility list, which includes professions like 'digital content creators' but excludes others like teachers and postal workers. The ultimate solution proposed is to ban tips altogether and force a shift toward higher base wages.</p>
