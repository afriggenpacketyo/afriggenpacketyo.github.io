          <p>Reports indicate that a British passenger, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, survived the Air India plane crash that occurred shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad. According to Indian media, Ramesh, who was seated in 11A, reported hearing a loud noise thirty seconds after takeoff before the plane crashed. Ahmedabad Police Commissioner GS Malik confirmed that Ramesh is hospitalized and receiving treatment. The flight, bound for London Gatwick Airport, carried 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese nationals, and one Canadian; the crash occurred less than a minute after takeoff, impacting nearby accommodations used by doctors. The article states that verified video footage shows the Air India plane descending moments before the catastrophic event. Optimism is low given the fact that many people died in the plane crash. </p>

          <p>An Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner bound for London crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, resulting in the likely death of all 242 people aboard and some locals in a residential area. The signal from Flight 171 was lost less than a minute after takeoff, according to FlightRadar24, and initial flight-path data indicates the aircraft reached a maximum altitude of 625 feet before descending rapidly. Air India's CEO Campbell Wilson expressed condolences and stated that efforts are focused on supporting passengers, crew members, and their families. The aircraft, which had been in service since 2014, had accumulated 41,000 hours of flight time, which is average for that aircraft and the year it was built, according to aviation-data firm Cirium. Given the tragedy, the optimism is very low. </p>

          <p>Protests against federal immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles have continued for six consecutive days, leading to over 850 arrests in Los Angeles County and spreading to other cities. The timeline of events includes protests outside the Robert Young Federal Building, clashes between protesters and law enforcement, freeway blockades, and the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to the area. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued a curfew for downtown Los Angeles in response to vandalism and looting, while California Governor Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard troops without his permission. The protests were sparked by immigration raids in Los Angeles, with demonstrators clashing with Department of Homeland Security officers and vandalizing buildings, resulting in a declaration of an unlawful assembly by the LAPD. Given the nature of protests, there is a general atmosphere of low optimism. </p>

The governors prepared to defend their records on immigration and public safety, emphasizing their states' cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The hearing coincides with ongoing immigration-related protests in California, prompting President Trump to deploy U.S. Marines and the National Guard to the area.

Leaders from Unicredit to Goldman Sachs told CNBC that Europe has a significant opportunity, with the Stoxx 600 outperforming the S&P 500 since November 2024. Bank of America reported outflows from U.S. equities and inflows into European stocks, while Goldman Sachs noted the convergence in U.S. and European growth rates as a factor driving investment toward Europe. Despite trade tensions, particularly regarding an EU-U.S. trade deal, optimism remains about Europe's continued revival and its potential to attract capital and innovation.

          <p>Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are calling for an investigation into Justice Department official Ed Martin over his plans to "shame" political opponents of President Trump and other actions. Martin, who will serve as an associate deputy attorney general, the U.S. pardon attorney, and director of the "Weaponization Working Group," has stated his intention to target the alleged "weaponization" of the department under the Biden administration. Democrats are concerned that Martin's plans to publicly shame uncharged parties would violate DOJ policy and undermine public trust in the department. The letter from Senate Democrats requests Bondi provide records related to Martin's appointment and early days as head of the Weaponization Working Group and Pardon Attorney's Office.

Ryanair will also seek civil damages for compensation for costs incurred in more serious cases, and has amended its terms and conditions to allow fines to be taken directly from the card used to make the booking.

The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog stated that Iran is not complying with nuclear non-proliferation obligations, prompting accusations from Iran that the UK, France, and Germany are fomenting confrontation.

          <p>The Mexican national team is preparing to play in the Copa Oro at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, but has remained silent on the immigration concerns affecting its fan base in Los Angeles. Despite the team's reliance on its "incondicionales" (unconditional) fans, the team has not addressed the fear and tension caused by immigration raids and the deployment of the National Guard in Southern California. Coach Javier Aguirre has avoided political questions, stating he is apolitical and not a spokesperson for Mexicans. While the team has changed hotels to avoid potential issues, critics have noted the silence on the issue, contrasting it with statements from local teams like Angel City and LAFC. This article has a relatively low optimism given the circumstances. </p>

          <p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are common ways to invest in diversified baskets of stocks or bonds, with both actively and passively managed options. ETFs trade like individual stocks with fluctuating prices, while mutual funds are priced at the end of the market day. Investors should review a fund's prospectus for investment objectives, risks, fees, asset composition, and performance history. ETFs generally have lower expense ratios than mutual funds due to lower transaction management costs, and mutual funds often have minimum investment thresholds.
