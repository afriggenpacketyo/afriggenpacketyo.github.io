          <p>New Census Bureau data reveals the inflation-adjusted median monthly cost of homeownership has climbed to $2,035, a nearly 4% increase from the previous year. The rise is attributed not only to high mortgage rates and home prices but also to increasing insurance premiums, property taxes, and homeowners association fees. These escalating background costs are adding significant financial pressure to homeowners across the country, with residents in Washington D.C. facing the highest expenses.

          <p>The joint military drills between Russia and Belarus, codenamed Zapad 2025, are causing significant concern in neighboring Baltic states like Lithuania.

In response, Lithuania and its allies are conducting their own military exercises and increasing defense spending to bolster regional security and demonstrate preparedness against potential aggression.</p>

Economists attribute the rise to increasing prices for consumer goods, influenced by trade tariffs, as well as higher costs for groceries and electricity. While the labor market has cooled, which could temper future price hikes, the persistent inflation presents a complex challenge for the Federal Reserve ahead of its upcoming interest rate decision.

          <h2>Netanyahu Threatens Further Strikes in Qatar Despite U.S. Assurances Against It</h2>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that Israel may conduct further attacks on Hamas leaders in Qatar if the nation does not expel them. This defiant stance directly contradicts a statement from U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he had assured Qatari leaders that another Israeli strike on their soil "will not happen again." The diplomatic fallout follows an Israeli strike in Doha that targeted a Hamas meeting, an act that has been condemned by Qatar and has complicated ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is bracing for strong winds and heavy rain this weekend as an area of low pressure develops over the Atlantic. The Met Office has issued yellow warnings for wind across parts of England and Wales, with gusts expected to reach 50-60 mph, potentially causing some disruption. Forecasters are monitoring the system to determine if it will strengthen enough to be named Storm Amy, which would be the first named storm of the season, bringing an additional risk of localized flooding.</p>

          <p>The recent violation of Polish airspace by 19 Russian drones has prompted a rare display of unity between Poland's politically opposed president and prime minister. Both leaders have emphasized the need to act as "one fist" in the face of the threat from Russia, coordinating their response and calling for greater support from NATO allies. This shared sense of purpose has temporarily replaced the usual political infighting, as the nation confronts what its leaders call an unprecedented provocation and test of its security.</p>

          <p>While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The report contains a long list of recommendations, such as promoting sunscreen innovation and investigating vaccine injuries, but often lacks concrete plans for implementation or measurement of success. Critics note that while goals like closing food industry loopholes are laudable, the administration's definition of "action" can be vague, making it difficult to assess real progress.</p>

          <p>A new study published in PLOS Global Public Health projects that recent U.S. foreign aid cuts could have a devastating impact on the global fight against tuberculosis.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medicare's "3-day rule" is a critical regulation that can determine whether post-hospitalization care is covered. The rule requires a beneficiary to have a medically necessary inpatient hospital stay of at least three consecutive days before Medicare Part A will pay for subsequent care in a skilled nursing facility. This distinction is crucial, as time spent in a hospital under "observation status" does not count toward the requirement, potentially leaving patients with thousands of dollars in unexpected out-of-pocket costs for their rehabilitation.</p>
