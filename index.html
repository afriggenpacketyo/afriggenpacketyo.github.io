          <p>Two brothers are on trial for allegedly assaulting three police officers at Manchester Airport following an earlier incident at a Starbucks. The prosecution claims the confrontation began after one brother head-butted another man, leading to a violent struggle with police that left one officer with a broken nose. The defendants, who deny the allegations, are claiming self-defense in the matter. The court was told that the events were captured on CCTV and police body-worn cameras, which will be presented as key evidence.</p>

          <p>Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz secured his spot in the fourth round of Wimbledon with a four-set victory over Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff. After a dominant first set, Alcaraz faced a significant challenge as Struff's powerful serve helped him win the second. However, the world number two regained control, showing his quality under pressure to close out the match 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. Alcaraz acknowledged the difficulty of the match and will now face Andrey Rublev as he continues his quest for a third consecutive Wimbledon title.</p>

          <p>A major budget package signed into law includes a provision that creates a new federal tax deduction on income from tips for many service industry workers. The measure, which fulfills a promise from President Trump, is set to expire in 2028 and includes varying income caps depending on the version of the bill. Critics argue the policy is a flawed way to assist low-wage earners, as many don't earn enough to pay federal income tax and the benefit excludes non-tipped workers in similar pay brackets.

          <p>Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. has been arrested by ICE for overstaying his visa and allegedly providing false information on a green card application, just days after his loss to Jake Paul. U.S. authorities are processing him for expedited removal to Mexico, where he faces an outstanding arrest warrant for organized crime and weapons trafficking. The Department of Homeland Security highlighted Chávez Jr.'s extensive criminal history in the U.S. and alleged affiliations with the Sinaloa Cartel as factors in his case, which has become a high-profile example of the current administration's immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Severe weather has resulted in multiple deaths across both Texas and New Jersey. In central Texas, as much as 10 inches of rain caused catastrophic flash flooding of the Guadalupe River, leading to fatalities and ongoing search and rescue efforts for an unknown number of missing people. A local official acknowledged the community lacked an adequate warning system for a flood of this sudden magnitude. Meanwhile, in New Jersey, at least three people were killed by falling trees during powerful thunderstorms that also caused widespread power outages.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has proposed holding a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds as part of the nation's 250th anniversary celebrations next year. During a speech in Iowa, Trump stated he had discussed the idea with UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, to organize the event for an audience of 20,000 to 25,000 people. The proposal is unprecedented, as a major professional sporting event has never been hosted at the White House. The President has been a frequent attendee at UFC events since returning to office.</p>

          <p>While fighting on the front lines against Russia, LGBTQ+ soldiers in the Ukrainian army are also battling for legal equality at home. Despite growing public support, a bill to recognize same-sex civil partnerships has been stalled in parliament for over two years, leaving partners of soldiers without legal rights in cases of injury or death. Some soldiers report facing discrimination and threats within their units, though others note a gradual shift towards acceptance. Activists and soldiers continue to push for legislative changes, highlighting the urgency of the issue for those risking their lives for their country.</p>

          <p>In an interview ahead of the nation's 250th birthday, acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most significant events in world history. He argued that its creation of the "citizen"—an individual not merely a subject to a ruler—fundamentally "turned the world upside down" and inspired subsequent revolutions globally. Burns, whose new film on the topic is forthcoming, also emphasized the importance of embracing the complexities of American history. He noted that the inspirational words of the Declaration of Independence have empowered marginalized groups even though they were not included in its original scope.</p>

          <p>A detailed report reveals the complex negotiations behind Paramount Global's $16 million settlement with President Trump over a contentious "60 Minutes" interview. The deal, seen as crucial for the approval of Paramount's sale to Skydance Media, was brokered amidst internal revolt at CBS News and intense pressure on the company's board. Key figures, including tech billionaire Larry Ellison and agent Ari Emanuel, were involved in resolving the dispute. Paramount successfully resisted demands for an apology but agreed to pay the sum to end the legal battle, which Trump's team alleged was based on deceptive editing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts detail the significant physiological stress the body endures during competitive eating events like the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. To consume dozens of hot dogs in minutes, competitors train their stomachs to expand massively, which can lead to a permanent loss of contraction ability and impact digestion. The immediate aftermath includes bloating, fatigue, and gastrointestinal distress, while the massive intake of sodium and fat poses risks of high blood pressure and other issues. Although long-term effects are not well-studied, doctors warn of potential dangers like choking, esophageal tears, and other serious health complications.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in California's Los Padres National Forest, dubbed the Madre Fire, has rapidly grown to over 52,500 acres, making it the largest blaze in the state so far this year. The fire's exponential growth has prompted evacuation orders and warnings in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. With the fire currently at 10% containment, a significant number of personnel, including air tankers and ground crews, have been deployed to combat the flames. Officials have warned that the fire is a stark reminder of the potential dangers as the holiday weekend approaches.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has been condemned by Jewish advocacy groups for using the antisemitic term "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. While discussing tax changes, Trump used the slur, which originates from a Shakespearean character and evokes harmful stereotypes about Jewish people and greed. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "extremely offensive and dangerous." When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he understood it to simply mean a moneylender charging high rates, a defense that has drawn further skepticism.</p>

          <p>Following separate phone calls between President Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Russia unleashed its largest aerial assault on Kyiv since the war began. The attack, involving approximately 550 drones and 11 missiles, killed at least one person and caused widespread damage as the Trump administration paused key weapon shipments to Ukraine. Trump reported making no progress in his call with Putin, while Zelenskyy described his subsequent conversation with Trump as "useful," focusing on Ukraine's urgent need for enhanced air defense systems to counter the intensifying Russian bombardment.</p>

          <p>The ACLU and other legal groups have filed a class-action lawsuit against federal immigration authorities, alleging widespread racial profiling in recent raids across Southern California. The suit claims that agents are unconstitutionally targeting people based on their appearance, particularly those who appear to be Latino, during sweeps in known community hubs. Advocates argue that the administration's high daily arrest quotas are forcing agents to cut corners and make arrests without the required "reasonable suspicion." The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations, stating that its enforcement operations are highly targeted and not based on race.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed his landmark domestic policy package into law, enacting key agenda items including tax cuts, increased defense spending, and funding for an immigration crackdown. The 870-page bill, which narrowly passed Congress along party lines, extends the 2017 tax cuts, introduces new tax breaks for tipped income, and cuts Medicaid spending. While the White House touts the bill as a catalyst for economic growth, Democrats and some Republicans have raised concerns about its impact on the national debt and its disproportionate benefits for the wealthy.

          <p>In a novel effort to combat the effects of climate change, scientists are transplanting crossbred coral fragments onto a reef near Miami that was devastated by bleaching. The project involves corals created by crossbreeding native Florida Elkhorn coral with a more heat-tolerant variety from the warmer waters of Honduras. The goal is to introduce greater genetic diversity and thermal resilience to help the iconic reefs survive rising ocean temperatures. This marks the first time internationally crossbred corals have been permitted for planting in the wild, offering a potential blueprint for reef restoration across the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>The UK government will offer compensation payments of up to £4,000 to 277 Afghan nationals whose personal information was exposed in Ministry of Defence data breaches in 2021. The most significant breach occurred when an email was sent to people eligible for relocation, with their email addresses mistakenly placed in the 'To' field, potentially exposing their identities to the Taliban. The error, which the data watchdog said could have led to a "threat to life," has prompted the government to offer compensation totaling around £1.6 million to those affected by the critical mistake.</p>
