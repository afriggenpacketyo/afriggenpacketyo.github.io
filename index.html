          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to large-scale protests following ICE operations, sparking a confrontation with California's Governor Newsom and L.A.'s Mayor Bass. President Trump cited the need to address riots and looting, invoking Title 10 authority to deploy 2,000 troops, primarily from the California National Guard. Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and unnecessary, emphasizing the ability of local authorities to manage the situation, while Mayor Bass stated that city officials were coordinating with federal authorities. The deployment raises questions about federal overreach and the use of military force in domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Two sisters from Pontardawe, Wales, recount the emotional impact of their mother stealing their Â£50,000 inheritance, which was left to them by their grandmother. Katherine Hill and her father were convicted of fraud after draining the trust fund intended for her daughters, Gemma and Jessica Thomas. The sisters describe their mother as once being their best friend, but the betrayal has left them with deep-seated anxiety and an inability to trust. The money, intended to be accessed when they turned 25, was instead used to fund Hill's lifestyle with her new partner, leaving the daughters feeling robbed of a significant opportunity.</p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum on whether to halve the time required to apply for citizenship, a move supported by civil society groups but opposed by the hard-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The referendum proposes cutting the waiting period from 10 years to five, aligning Italy with most other European countries, and could potentially naturalize up to 1.4 million people. Meloni has announced she will boycott the vote, deeming the current citizenship law "excellent" and "very open," while other parties are urging Italians to abstain. The debate highlights the sensitive issue of immigration in a country with a rapidly aging population.</p>

The author criticizes the government's decision to spend an additional Â£15 billion on nuclear warheads, claiming it perpetuates illusions about Britain's global power status and increases the risk of tactical nuclear weapons deployment. The piece suggests that the UK's actions send a cynical signal to other nations, potentially encouraging nuclear proliferation.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's financial self-enrichment since beginning his 2024 campaign presents a significant danger to the American political system. The author contends that the influx of foreign money into Trump's real estate and crypto ventures, along with other instances of self-dealing, risks transforming the U.S. into a country where the leader's personal interests are indistinguishable from the nation's. Comparisons are drawn to Vladimir Putin's Russia and Viktor Orban's Hungary, where corruption has been used to consolidate power. The author suggests that checks and balances are being weakened, moral frameworks eroded, and oligarchs are gaining undue influence.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have used the rare mineral tellurium to create an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and gave them the ability to see infrared light. The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, demonstrated the successful use of tellurium nanowire implants in restoring vision in genetically blind mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, offering a potential treatment for human blindness. The scientists can use tellurium as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina and send electrical signals converted from light signals to the brain.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The research, co-authored by Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce greater long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study highlights that traditional expectations placing the burden on women clash with rapid economic changes, contributing to the decline in fertility rates.</p>

          <p>Israel has announced the retrieval of the body of Nattapong Pinta, a Thai hostage kidnapped into Gaza on October 7, 2023, during a special military operation. Pinta, who worked in agriculture in Israel, was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz and killed in captivity, with his body recovered from the Rafah area. This comes as Israel continues its military campaign across Gaza, resulting in numerous casualties. The retrieval follows the recovery of the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages, highlighting the ongoing efforts to locate and recover those taken captive during the conflict.</p>
