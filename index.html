            <p>A 17-year-old from Wisconsin, Nikita Casap, has been charged with multiple felonies, including first-degree intentional homicide, for allegedly shooting and killing his mother and stepfather. The bodies were discovered severely decomposed in their home weeks after the alleged crime. Casap reportedly confessed to fantasizing about the murders and discussed his plans with a classmate. Surveillance footage allegedly showed him tending to the body of his stepfather. He was apprehended in Kansas after fleeing in his parents' SUV and is being held on a $1 million bail.</p>

            <p>Dive teams are working to recover remaining wreckage from a helicopter crash in the Hudson River that killed all six people on board. The NTSB is investigating the cause, noting the helicopter lacked flight recorders. Recovery efforts are focused on the main rotor, gearbox, and tail boom, as these parts could provide crucial insights into the crash's cause. Preliminary investigations suggest a rotor may have broken off, leading to the uncontrolled descent. The helicopter was carrying a family on a tour of the New York City skyline.</p>

Selonia Reed was found stabbed and sexually assaulted in her car, a short distance from her home, leaving her six-year-old son, Reggie, without a mother. The investigation has revealed potential suspects, including a close friend of Selonia's husband, Reginald Reed Sr. DNA from a cigarette butt found in Selonia's car matched the twin brother of Jimmy Ray Barnes, who later confessed that Reginald Reed offered him $50,000 to kill his wife.

The filing did not detail steps the administration was taking to facilitate Garcia's return, despite a court order. President Trump is scheduled to meet with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.
