          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time in connection with the 2020 disappearance and murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew. The rearrest follows the discovery of her remains and a new toxicological report that found a combination of animal tranquilizer drugs in her bone marrow. Authorities allege that Morphew, an avid hunter, was the only private citizen in the area with access to these specific drugs. Despite the charges being previously dropped, this new evidence led a grand jury to issue a new indictment for first-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Zarah Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, has resigned from the UK's Labour Party to launch a new political party alongside former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sultana, who had been suspended from the Labour whip for opposing the party's stance on a benefit cap, stated the new party aims to challenge the "broken" Westminster system. The move signals a further splintering on the left of British politics, bringing together independent MPs and activists.

Another 38 people were reportedly killed while waiting for or traveling to collect humanitarian aid, a claim the Israeli military has called "lies."

The research suggests the Gazan Health Ministry's numbers, while not exaggerated, are likely a conservative minimum.

          <p>Relations between Russia and Azerbaijan have become severely strained following a series of escalating diplomatic incidents.

In response, Azerbaijan canceled Russian cultural events and arrested Russian journalists, while Moscow downplayed the incident. The tensions compound existing friction from a 2024 plane crash over Russia that killed 38 people, signaling a potential strategic realignment for Azerbaijan away from its traditional ally.</p>

Critics, including former diplomats, warn this move would eliminate critical expertise from foreign policy debates and undermine decades of bipartisan work.

          <p>A major tax and spending bill passed by Congress eliminates the long-standing federal tax credits for electric vehicles, with the incentives terminating after September 30. The credits, which offered up to $7,500 for new EVs, were designed to make them more affordable compared to gas-powered cars. While the removal of these incentives may make the upfront cost of EVs prohibitive for some buyers, experts note that the long-term savings on fuel and maintenance can still make them a financially sound and environmentally friendly choice. The overall cost-effectiveness depends on factors like local electricity prices and driving habits. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill also allows a deduction for interest on new auto loans and establishes "Trump accounts," a new savings vehicle for children with a one-time government deposit.

          <p>Indian cricket captain Shubman Gill scored a monumental 269 runs, leaving England in a precarious position on day two of the second Test at Edgbaston. Gill's performance, the highest score by an Indian batter in England, propelled his team to a total of 587. In response, England's top order collapsed, slumping to 77-3 by the close of play as India's bowlers took control. With a massive first-innings lead, India is in a commanding position to level the series, while England faces an extremely difficult task to salvage the match.</p>

          <p>President Trump has achieved his first major legislative victory of his second term with the passage of his sprawling spending and tax-cut package. The bill delivers on key campaign promises by funding border security and making tax cuts permanent, a significant accomplishment given narrow Republican majorities. However, the legislation carries substantial political risks, as it is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt and will cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose Medicaid coverage. Democrats are already preparing to campaign on these consequences, setting the stage for a contentious political battle over the bill's true impact.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. decision to pause a shipment of weapons to Ukraine, including critical air defense missiles, underscores the increasingly precarious nature of American support for the war-torn country.

The pause forces European nations to accelerate their own military production and support for Ukraine's domestic defense industry.

The public often reacts negatively to the perceived ideological extremity and messy legislative process.

          <p>President Trump's newly passed spending bill contains several tax provisions that will primarily benefit wealthy Americans and investors. The legislation increases the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 and expands the benefits for investors in qualified small businesses (QSBS) by raising eligibility thresholds. It also makes the higher estate tax exemption permanent, a key priority for wealthy families. While a new deduction for charitable giving is included for non-itemizers, changes to itemized deduction limits slightly decrease the value of large charitable donations for top earners.
