        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has sharply criticized Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, calling it a "gift to the GOP." Fetterman stated that he disagrees with nearly all of Mamdani's socialist-leaning policies and argued that Mamdani is not representative of the broader Democratic party or battleground states. He warned that Mamdani's rise provides Republicans with an opportunity to brand the entire Democratic party with radical policies, suggesting it could be detrimental in future national elections. Fetterman also urged other candidates like Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo to consolidate their independent campaigns to prevent a Mamdani victory.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld the $5 million civil verdict against former President Donald Trump for the sexual assault and defamation of writer E. Jean Carroll. The unanimous ruling from a three-judge panel found no errors in the original trial's proceedings that would warrant a new one. This case stems from a May 2023 jury decision that found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s and defaming her in 2022. A separate, larger verdict of $83.3 million for different defamatory statements made while he was president is also under appeal by Trump.</p>

          <h2>White House Accuses Federal Reserve of Mismanagement Over Headquarters Renovation Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 15:20:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House, through Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, has accused Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement and misleading Congress. The criticism centers on the escalating cost of the Fed's headquarters renovation, which Vought claims has ballooned to $2.5 billion and includes "ostentatious" features. This move represents a new line of attack in the administration's ongoing conflict with Powell, whom President Trump has repeatedly criticized over interest rate policies. The letter questions the project's compliance with federal planning laws and raises speculation about whether the administration will seek to remove Powell for cause. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record high, climbing above $113,000 as investors showed increased appetite for risk assets and short sellers were forced to liquidate their positions. The rally was broad, with other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Solana also experiencing gains. According to data from CoinGlass, over $318 million in short positions were liquidated in a 24-hour period, a market dynamic that further fuels price increases. The upward trend is also supported by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds and large-scale purchases by public companies, which have helped maintain the cryptocurrency's price above the $100,000 mark for over two months.

          <p>A San Francisco judge has ruled that the lawsuit filed by former CNN anchor Don Lemon against Elon Musk and his social media company, X, can proceed to trial. The judge denied Musk's attempts to move the case or have it dismissed, finding that Lemon's claims of "fraud by false promise" and an "implied contract" were plausible. The lawsuit stems from X's abrupt cancellation of a partnership with Lemon for a new show on the platform, which occurred shortly after Lemon conducted a tense interview with Musk. The case adds to a series of legal challenges faced by Musk and X since his 2022 acquisition of the company.</p>

          <p>As the economic landscape shifts with anticipated interest rate cuts, savers are advised to be more strategic with their Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts. This article outlines three common mistakes to avoid this summer to maximize returns. These include incorrectly assuming CD rates will only change after official Federal Reserve action, becoming distracted by higher short-term rates at the expense of long-term stability, and failing to calculate the full interest-earning potential before making a deposit. With rate changes imminent, locking in a favorable long-term rate now could be more beneficial than waiting or opting for a short-term, high-rate CD that will mature in a less favorable environment.

          <p>The U.S. trade war, particularly the removal of a key tax exemption for low-value overseas shipments, has created significant challenges for low-cost Asian retailers Temu and Shein. After the de minimis tax exemption was canceled, Temu temporarily halted shipments from China to the U.S. While the tariffs have eroded their price advantage, some analysts believe their highly flexible and low-cost business models could allow them to remain formidable competitors to Amazon. The companies are adapting by using U.S.-based warehouses and may benefit if American consumers, facing rising prices on other goods, trade down to cheaper alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

Khalil was detained for over three months by immigration authorities due to his prominent role in campus protests against the war in Gaza, an action widely condemned as an attack on free speech. His legal filing alleges he was smeared as an antisemite as the government sought to deport him without presenting evidence. Khalil, who was released last month, stated that any potential settlement money would be shared with others targeted for their pro-Palestinian activism.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has proposed a rule change that would relax the criteria for what constitutes a "well-managed" bank, a move that could ease regulations for large financial institutions. Under the new proposal, a bank could still be considered well-managed even with one "deficient" rating across the categories of capital, liquidity, or governance. This status is crucial as it allows banks to engage in certain activities, such as acquisitions. The proposal, supported by Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, drew immediate criticism from her predecessor Michael Barr and Governor Adriana Kugler, who warned it could introduce greater risk to the banking system.

Directed by and co-starring Embeth Davidtz, the movie portrays the raw, often brutal, reality of life on a farm during a civil war, where racial tensions and violence are ever-present. The review praises the film for humanizing a complex and fraught childhood, highlighting the astonishing lead performance by newcomer Lexi Venter. While the film takes some political liberties not present in the book, it is described as an enthralling and heartbreaking watch.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial annuities can serve as more than just a supplementary income stream in retirement; they can also strategically influence how retirees utilize their Social Security benefits. By providing a guaranteed income, an annuity can allow an individual to delay claiming Social Security until age 70, which significantly boosts their monthly payments for life. Furthermore, annuity payments can create a stable income "floor," helping to manage budgets and cover essential expenses not fully met by Social Security. A well-structured annuity may also offer tax advantages, potentially reducing the taxable portion of one's Social Security income and preserving more wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The newly announced "one in, one out" migrant returns deal between the UK and France, while simple in concept, is likely to face significant legal, political, and practical challenges. The plan, which involves swapping undocumented migrants for legitimate asylum seekers, is designed as a deterrent but its implementation will be complicated. While France is considered a safe country, avoiding the legal issues of the Rwanda scheme, challenges could arise over the fairness of the selection process. The pilot scheme's small scale may not be a sufficient deterrent, and scaling it up would involve major questions of cost, logistics, and EU cooperation.</p>

The Hawk-Eye tracking system will then determine the pitch's location, with the result displayed on the scoreboard.

Despite a request from Belfast City Council, the PSNI stated that a risk assessment concluded that intervening to dismantle the structure posed a greater danger than allowing it to proceed as planned.
