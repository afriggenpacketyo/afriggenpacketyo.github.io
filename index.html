          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning based on credible intelligence that Hamas may be planning an imminent attack against Palestinian civilians in Gaza. This action would represent a severe violation of the recently brokered ceasefire agreement, which involved a limited hostage-prisoner exchange. Hamas has denied the allegations, accusing Israel of supporting rival armed gangs. The situation highlights the fragile nature of the peace plan and the complex internal power dynamics within Gaza, as the U.S. threatens unspecified measures to protect civilians if the attack proceeds.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government has unveiled a comprehensive strategy to generate 400,000 new jobs in the clean energy sector within the next five years. The plan prioritizes training for in-demand roles such as plumbers, electricians, and welders to support the expansion of renewable, wind, solar, and nuclear energy. To facilitate this, the government will establish five specialized technical colleges and launch programs to match veterans and others with careers in the green economy. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the initiative aims to lower energy bills and provide secure, well-paid jobs in industrial regions.</p>

          <p>A report from a Trump-aligned consulting firm, National Public Affairs, has identified a new voting demographic described as "Resistance Grandmas." The research, based on a focus group of affluent, college-educated, older white women in Northern Virginia, explores their shift further to the political left. The article details the women's strong opposition to Donald Trump, their self-perception as well-informed voters, and their justifications for controversial political actions. The study aims to understand what has radicalized this group, which was once considered a moderate and civil voting bloc.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Tommy Fleetwood won his eighth European tour title with a two-shot victory at the DP World India Championship in Delhi. Finishing with a final round of 65, Fleetwood expressed that his primary motivation was to win so his eight-year-old son, Frankie, could run onto the green to congratulate him for the first time. The victory continues a strong season for Fleetwood, who also played a key role in Europe's recent Ryder Cup win. He overcame a two-shot deficit at the start of the final day, demonstrating excellent form with a series of crucial birdies.</p>

          <p>Thieves executed a highly organized robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing jewelry of "inestimable heritage and historical value." The suspects used a basket lift to access a window and smashed display cases in the Galerie d'Apollon shortly after the museum opened to the public. The entire operation lasted only seven minutes, after which the perpetrators fled on motorcycles, prompting a major police investigation and the temporary closure of the world's most visited museum. This article notes the event echoes other recent high-profile museum raids across Europe.</p>

Speaking at a conference in Beijing, he projected that China could sustain an annual growth rate of 4.5% to 5% for the next five years. This sustained growth, he argued, would establish a solid foundation for the country to meet its long-term goal of achieving "socialist modernization" by 2035. His optimistic comments come as China's leadership prepares for a key party meeting to set economic priorities amid ongoing rivalry with the United States.</p>

Multiple consumers from across the country share personal anecdotes of rising costs for everyday items like groceries, car tires, and baby formula, forcing them to alter their budgets and lifestyles. Economic analyses cited in the article suggest that these tariffs could cost the average household over $2,000 annually, with the bulk of the expense being passed from companies to consumers.

          <p>Georgia is experiencing an unprecedented surge in demand for electricity, primarily driven by the rapid construction of data centers for artificial intelligence. The state's main utility, Georgia Power, has requested a massive increase in energy generation capacity, with an estimated 80% of the new power designated for these data centers. This has sparked concerns among consumer advocates and environmental groups about potential rate hikes for residential customers and an increased reliance on fossil fuels. Public hearings are scheduled to address the nearly $16 billion plan and determine who will bear the costs of this energy expansion.</p>

These funds would only be released to the federal government once constitutional obligations are met and authoritarian threats are withdrawn.

          <p>The remains of Ronen Engel, a 54-year-old photographer, and Sonthaya Akrasri, a 30-year-old Thai farm worker, have been returned to Israel from Gaza. Both were killed during the October 7th attack, and their bodies were taken by Hamas. Engel's daughter confirmed his return, stating he is "finally home," though it was not the outcome they had hoped for. The return is part of a broader ceasefire agreement, but delays in recovering all deceased hostages have caused significant outrage and political tension in Israel, highlighting the ongoing emotional toll of the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police has announced it is "actively" looking into media reports alleging that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail to obtain personal information about his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The reports claim he asked an officer to investigate her, providing her social security number, shortly before a newspaper published a photo of their first meeting. This development follows Andrew's recent decision to voluntarily relinquish his royal titles. The claims add another layer to the long-running scandal surrounding his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the allegations made by Giuffre.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to neuroscientist Dr. Charan Ranganath, our understanding of memory as a faithful filing cabinet of the past is fundamentally flawed. In an interview, he explains that memory's primary function is not to store facts but to help us construct a personal narrative, make sense of the present, and anticipate the future. Forgetting is as crucial as remembering, as it allows us to prioritize what matters and shape our life's story. The article delves into why emotion strengthens recall, how trauma lingers, and the ways in which both individual and collective memory are malleable and selective.</p>

          <p>Labor unions have become a primary force of opposition to the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce and curtail collective bargaining rights. Unions have filed dozens of lawsuits across the country to challenge executive orders aimed at reclassifying jobs, firing employees, and dismantling federal agencies. A recent significant victory includes a temporary restraining order blocking mass layoffs related to the government shutdown. These legal battles are framed by union leaders and legal experts as a crucial defense of not only workers' rights but also the principle of a nonpartisan civil service.</p>

          <p>Aaron Mahan, a lifelong Republican and two-time Trump voter working as a food server in Las Vegas, details his growing disillusionment due to personal economic struggles. He attributes a significant drop in his income and the depletion of his savings to what he calls the "Trump slump," citing inflation and a decline in tourism he links to the administration's policies. Mahan's experience reflects a broader economic malaise felt in the tourism-dependent city, with fewer visitors spending less money. His story provides a ground-level perspective on how the administration's economic performance is affecting some of its former supporters.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the escalating, tit-for-tat technological conflict between the United States and China is no longer a temporary issue but a defining, systemic feature of the global landscape. For decades, the world operated on a U.S.-centric tech order, with American companies setting the standards for software, chips, and platforms. Now, China is leveraging its dominance in areas like rare earth processing to challenge this order, while the U.S. uses its powerful sanctioning abilities to maintain control. The author contends that each nation is testing the other's limits, fundamentally reshaping global technology and supply chains.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian forces have successfully conducted a long-range drone strike on a major gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg region, approximately 1,700 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The attack on the Gazprom-operated facility, one of the world's largest, sparked a fire and caused partial damage, forcing it to halt its intake of gas from Kazakhstan. This strike is part of Ukraine's escalating campaign since August to target Russian energy infrastructure, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies and reduce Moscow's revenue for its war effort.

          <p>A long-running investigation, aided by secret filming from a 2016 BBC Scotland documentary, has led to the conviction of 14 people in a £28 million timeshare fraud. The scheme, run by a company called Sell My Timeshare, defrauded over 3,500 victims, mostly elderly individuals desperate to exit expensive timeshare contracts. The company used high-pressure sales tactics to sell them useless fake "credits" instead, funding a lavish lifestyle for its owners. The final sentences were handed down recently, bringing a measure of closure to a case described by prosecutors as one of the largest frauds of its kind in the UK.</p>

The warning comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers increasing taxes on the industry to ensure it pays its "fair share." Done stated that even a moderate increase would eliminate profitability for his high-street operations, echoing similar concerns from other major betting companies like William Hill. He argued that such a move would decimate a high-street presence and push gamblers towards untaxed offshore operators.</p>
