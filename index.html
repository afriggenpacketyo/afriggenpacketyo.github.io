          <p>A group of migrants from countries including Vietnam, Cuba, and Mexico are stuck in Djibouti amidst a legal battle over their deportations. A federal judge in Boston found the deportations violated an order requiring immigrants to receive reasonable notice before being deported to a country not their own. The Trump administration initially refused to confirm the migrants' destination, describing the information as classified. A lawyer for the migrants expressed concern for their health and welfare, citing potential issues with access to food, water, and prolonged shackling. The article details the legal wrangling and the president's frustration with court decisions on immigration matters.</p>

Despite Navy policy stating that vaccinations are not required for family members, their children were deemed unsuitable based solely on their vaccination status. The Johnsons' destination, Peru, also does not require any vaccinations for entry or residence. The family has filed a congressional inquiry and seeks reform to prevent similar situations in the future.

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to halt Harvard University from enrolling international students by revoking its access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). This action could leave the university's 6,800 foreign students in limbo and subject to deportation. The administration claims this move is necessary to pressure Harvard to align with the president's agenda. Legal experts suggest Harvard is likely to challenge the decision in court, arguing that the administration's actions are arbitrary and retaliatory, infringing upon the university's ability to recruit students globally.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in the U.S., linked to a surge of the virus in China. Cases have been found in international travelers arriving at airports in several states, with origins tracing back to various countries including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Experts are closely monitoring the variant, which is now dominant in China and rising in parts of Asia. Preliminary data suggests NB.1.8.1 may be more transmissible due to its ability to bind to human cells, but it doesn't appear to be better at evading the immune system.</p>

Headline inflation climbed 3.6% from a year ago, remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. Economists expect core inflation to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts a 60% chance of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season in 2025, with 13 to 19 named storms expected. Six to 10 of those storms are forecasted to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes. The forecast cites a confluence of factors, including the neutral phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, warmer ocean temperatures, and weak wind shear. NOAA emphasizes the importance of preparedness and has upgraded its forecasting model to increase accuracy.</p>

          <p>Beef prices in the U.S. have reached all-time highs, with ground beef costing nearly 50% more than five years ago. Ranchers are struggling to keep costs down due to rising prices for feed, land, and financing, leading to the lowest U.S. cattle herd numbers in over 70 years. Drought conditions have further exacerbated the issue, making it difficult to maintain adequate grazing land. The USDA forecasts that beef prices will continue to rise throughout 2025, impacting consumers and producers alike. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 vote, upheld President Trump's decision to fire two agency officials with fixed terms, siding with the president's power to remove executive officers. The justices set aside rulings that would have reinstated Gwynne Wilcox to the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris to the Merit Systems Protection Board. The court clarified that the Federal Reserve Board is not affected by this decision. Justice Elena Kagan filed a dissent, arguing the decision favors the President over established precedent and the will of Congress.</p>

          <p>The skincare industry is increasingly marketing products to tweens, including some that contain ingredients harmful to young skin.

Nielsen data indicates that households with children 12 and under spent billions on skincare and makeup in 2023. Lawmakers are considering legislation to restrict the sale of certain anti-aging cosmetics to minors, but brands continue to use kid-friendly branding and packaging to attract young consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans passed a domestic policy bill that would limit the power of federal judges to hold people in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and his administration from the consequences of violating court orders. The provision was included in the tax and spending cut bill and aims to weaken federal judges' ability to enforce their rulings, particularly in cases related to immigration. Democrats argue that the measure would strip courts of their power and allow officials to ignore judicial rulings without consequence. The bill's retroactive application could impact ongoing cases involving Trump administration officials.</p>
