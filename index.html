          <p>Following days of escalating protests and clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators over immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles, President Trump deployed National Guard troops to the city.

Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and requested its rescission, while Mayor Bass expressed concerns about the escalation of the situation.

          <p>Nine veterans with PTSD traveled to Mexico for a psychedelic retreat, seeking relief from their invisible wounds through psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT ceremonies. Organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, the retreat aimed to help veterans revisit traumatic moments and find new perspectives. While most participants reported improved symptoms and life-changing experiences, one veteran experienced a decline in mental health and returned to antidepressant medication. The Veterans Administration is now conducting clinical trials using psychedelics to treat PTSD, depression, and addiction, but cautions against self-medicating outside of a safe and monitored environment.</p>

          <p>Hezbollah's losses in Lebanon, including the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah and the disruption caused by the Mossad's pager operation, have significantly weakened Iran's regional influence. The pager operation, which injured thousands and killed key figures, undermined Hezbollah's command structure and morale. With the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Hezbollah's access to critical military positions and supply routes has been cut off. Experts suggest that Iran's proxy war strategy, which relies on Hezbollah to project power in the Middle East, is failing, forcing Iran to reconsider its approach to regional security.</p>

          <p>Britain's energy bills are rising due to grid limitations that force energy firms to be paid significant sums to not provide power. Wind farms in Scotland are often restricted because the grid lacks capacity to transport the electricity to England, leading to compensation payments. The government is considering a shift to regional electricity markets to improve efficiency and lower costs, but the move has sparked intense debate and opposition from energy companies. The proposed changes aim to address the challenges of integrating renewable energy sources and delivering cheaper electricity to consumers, although the outcome remains uncertain.

          <p>During India's Emergency in the mid-1970s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government quietly explored replacing parliamentary democracy with a centralized presidential system. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, officials sought to concentrate executive power and sideline the judiciary. Though the proposal never fully materialized, it influenced the Forty-second Amendment Act, which expanded Parliament's powers and centralized authority. After Gandhi's defeat in 1977, the Janata Party reversed these changes, but the idea resurfaced in 1982, reflecting a recurring tension between centralized power and democratic checks and balances.</p>
