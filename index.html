        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nationwide 'No Kings' protests saw millions demonstrate against the Trump administration's policies in cities across the United States. Organizers framed the events as a defense of democracy against perceived authoritarianism, citing concerns over immigration tactics, federal intervention in states, and the expansion of presidential power. The protests were reported as being largely peaceful, featuring a wide range of participants and support from some Democratic politicians. Despite some Republican leaders denouncing the rallies, law enforcement in major cities like New York and Washington D.C. reported no protest-related arrests, highlighting the organized and non-violent nature of the mass demonstrations.</p>

          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on what it calls "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an imminent attack on civilians in Gaza. A State Department statement declared such an act would be a grave violation of the current ceasefire agreement and would undermine recent diplomatic progress. Hamas has strongly denied the allegation, accusing Israel of supporting rival armed groups to destabilize the region. This development introduces significant tension into the fragile ceasefire, which was brokered to end major hostilities and facilitate the exchange of hostages and prisoners.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew is facing intensified scrutiny following reports that he used his police protection detail to seek personal information about his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, in 2011. These claims emerge as calls grow for King Charles III to strip him of his 'prince' title, a step beyond his recent relinquishment of other royal honors. The new reports, coupled with pressure from senior royals like the Prince of Wales, add to the ongoing fallout from his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The developments precede the posthumous publication of Ms. Giuffre's memoir, which is expected to bring further attention to the case.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian drones successfully attacked the Orenburg gas processing plant in Russia, causing a fire and damaging a workshop at one of the world's largest such facilities. The regional governor confirmed the strike but stated that no employees were injured in the incident. This attack represents an expansion of Ukraine's strategy to target Russia's critical energy infrastructure, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies and economic resources funding the war effort. The Russian Defence Ministry reported downing numerous other drones over several regions overnight, indicating a widespread and coordinated series of attacks by Ukrainian forces.</p>

          <p>Several large companies, including Accenture, Lufthansa, and Salesforce, have recently cited artificial intelligence as a reason for significant job cuts, but some experts are skeptical. Critics argue that AI has become a convenient "scapegoat" for companies to justify downsizing that may actually be driven by other factors, such as overhiring during the pandemic or general economic slowdowns. While employees fear job replacement by AI, recent labor market data from Yale University and the New York Fed suggests that widespread, AI-driven unemployment has not yet materialized. The trend of blaming AI allows firms to appear innovative while potentially masking less favorable business realities.</p>

          <p>A long-running investigation, aided by secret filming from the BBC, has culminated in the conviction of 14 people involved in a £28 million timeshare fraud. The scheme, run by a company called Sell My Timeshare (SMT), defrauded over 3,500 victims, most of whom were elderly individuals desperate to exit expensive timeshare contracts. The fraudsters used high-pressure sales tactics to sell useless fake "credits," funding a lavish lifestyle for the company's owners. The criminal proceedings have now concluded, bringing a measure of justice nine years after the BBC's initial exposé helped bring the scam to light.</p>

          <p>The annual Social Security Cost-Of-Living Adjustment (COLA) for 2026 will be determined by changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). This index measures inflation across a basket of goods and services, with the final COLA calculation based on data from the third quarter of the year. There is ongoing debate about the fairness of using the CPI-W, as critics argue it does not accurately reflect the spending habits of retirees, particularly concerning higher healthcare and housing costs. However, for now, this remains the established method for adjusting benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

The warning comes as UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers increasing taxes on the sector to ensure companies pay their "fair share." Done argues that even a moderate increase would erase profits, making the retail business unviable, especially with 300 shops already losing money.

          <p>North Korea is actively pursuing stronger relationships with Southeast Asian nations, as evidenced by high-level visits from Vietnamese and Laotian leaders to Pyongyang for the 80th anniversary of its ruling party. This diplomatic outreach is seen as an effort by the isolated regime to enhance its international legitimacy and find partners to help bypass extensive global sanctions. While Vietnam and Laos share similar single-party political ideologies with North Korea, their economic systems differ significantly. Analysts suggest these strengthened ties could provide Pyongyang with new avenues for trade and revenue, particularly through illicit channels and the use of North Korean labor abroad.</p>

The project has transformed over 45,000 hectares of desert into vegetated land, serving as a critical environmental barrier.

This shift is partly due to hormonal changes, as the initial cocktail of sex-drive hormones gives way to oxytocin, a hormone that fosters bonding and dampens libido. The article also discusses how factors like communication, unmet sexual needs, and the "orgasm gap" can disproportionately affect women's desire over time. Experts recommend open communication about needs and maintaining physical affection to help sustain intimacy in relationships that have moved beyond the early stages.</p>

The initiative highlights a proactive approach to conservation as trees struggle to migrate and adapt naturally at the rapid pace of human-driven warming.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai has announced a plan to develop a "T-Dome," described as a multilayered air defense network to shield the island from potential missile and drone attacks by Beijing. The proposal, which appears to draw inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome system, aims to protect critical infrastructure and population centers. Lai pledged to accelerate its development using increased defense spending and advanced technologies like AI. However, the announcement surprised Taiwan's defense establishment, as the project was not mentioned in the latest National Defence Report and has no allocated funding in the upcoming budget.</p>

          <p>Japan is on the verge of appointing its first female Prime Minister, as reports indicate the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will form a coalition with the Japan Innovation Party. This new alliance will provide the necessary support in parliament for LDP leader Sanae Takaichi to be elected as prime minister. The deal comes after Takaichi's initial path to the premiership was blocked when the LDP's long-term junior coalition partner, Komeito, departed the government. The new agreement signals a resolution to the recent political turmoil and marks a historic moment for Japanese politics.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans' hopes for a College Football Playoff berth took a significant hit after a 34-24 road loss to rival Notre Dame. In a rain-soaked game, USC's offense committed several costly turnovers, including a critical fumble on a trick play in the fourth quarter, and the defense struggled to contain Notre Dame's rushing attack, which amassed 306 yards. Coach Lincoln Riley took responsibility for several "stupid" play calls that put his team in poor positions. With a second loss on their record, the Trojans now have no margin for error for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>UCLA secured its third consecutive victory with a dramatic 20-17 comeback win over Maryland, sealed by a last-second field goal. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava led a game-tying touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter before briefly exiting with a knee injury. After being cleared to play, he returned with only 35 seconds left and orchestrated a rapid drive into field goal range, which was aided by a crucial 35-yard run from reserve running back Anthony Frias II. The victory continues an impressive midseason turnaround for the Bruins under interim coach Tim Skipper.</p>
