          <p>Ten years after the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, the families of children born with congenital Zika syndrome face ongoing challenges, often with little public support. The article follows a group of mothers in Maceió, the epicenter of the outbreak, whose children suffer from severe disabilities and require constant care. Many of these mothers, abandoned by partners and struggling financially, have formed a tight-knit community, even moving into the same housing complex to support one another. Recently, they achieved a major victory when Brazil's Congress overturned a presidential veto to approve significantly higher lifetime compensation for affected families.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has departed for its August recess without reaching a bipartisan deal to expedite the confirmation of President Trump's nominees. Contentious negotiations between Republicans, Democrats, and the White House broke down, punctuated by a social media post from Trump telling Senator Chuck Schumer to "GO TO HELL!" Republicans have suggested they may change Senate rules to speed up the process upon their return, a move Democrats warn would be a significant mistake. This standoff highlights the escalating partisan obstruction over judicial and executive appointments in recent years.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough's latest BBC series, "Parenthood," documents the extraordinary lengths animal parents go to in order to raise their young. The show features dramatic and emotional stories from across the globe, including African social spiders whose young consume them, and orangutan mothers who spend a decade teaching their offspring. The director, Jeff Wilson, notes the series aims to connect with universal parental experiences and highlight how animals adapt to a changing world. At 99 years old, Attenborough continues to provide his iconic narration, bringing these powerful natural history moments to a wide audience.</p>

          <p>With a sequel reportedly in development, women are reflecting on the enduring cultural impact of the 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham." The movie, about a Punjabi girl in London who defies her family's expectations to play football, was a landmark moment for South Asian representation on screen. Many women who grew up facing similar cultural and family pressures say the film made them feel "heard and seen" and inspired them to pursue their own goals. While women's football has grown immensely since the film's release, the story of balancing cultural identity with personal dreams remains highly relevant.</p>

          <p>The fashion trend of intentionally creating and displaying tan lines is gaining popularity on social media, but health experts warn of the serious risks. While some influencers promote achieving the look safely with fake tan, many others are deliberately sunburning themselves to create sharp lines, a practice that significantly increases the risk of melanoma. The article features the story of a young man who developed skin cancer from excessive sunbed use and warns against online misinformation that downplays the dangers of UV radiation. Doctors emphasize that there is no safe way to get a natural tan and urge the use of sunscreen.</p>

          <p>Analysts are debating the likelihood and implications of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending China's upcoming World War II 80th-anniversary victory parade. Some experts suggest that Modi's presence, alongside Russia, could provide a valuable opportunity to resolve ongoing border disputes and strengthen the trilateral relationship between the nations. However, most observers believe Modi is unlikely to attend, despite a recent thaw in relations between the two Asian powers. The potential visit is viewed as a significant political test with major ramifications for regional diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Video footage from a camera mounted inside a Black college student's car has prompted an internal investigation into his violent arrest by officers in Jacksonville, Florida. The student, William McNeil Jr., was pulled over for a minor infraction, after which an officer smashed his window and repeatedly punched him. McNeil's dashboard camera provided a clear view of the incident that was not visible in the officers' bodycam footage, leading civil rights attorneys to urge more motorists to record police interactions. The case underscores how citizen-recorded video can offer a crucial counter-narrative to official police reports.</p>

Although four men were arrested in 1999 and two were convicted based on confessions they later recanted, the convictions were overturned.

          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a new electronic warfare technique using drone swarms to create an "eye of the storm" for friendly forces. By precisely coordinating their signals, the drones can jam enemy communications while creating a null zone where allied signals are unaffected and can operate freely. This targeted approach marks a significant advancement over traditional brute-force jamming, which disrupts all signals within range, including friendly ones. According to a published paper, the system can reduce electromagnetic interference at a targeted friendly location to zero.</p>

          <p>Rescue workers at the El Teniente copper mine in Chile have found the remains of one of the five miners who were trapped following a partial collapse on Thursday. The collapse was triggered by a 4.2 magnitude seismic event that also killed another person outside the mine. Over 100 rescuers are involved in the intensive search operation, delving as deep as 1,200 meters to locate the remaining four miners. Chile's President Gabriel Boric met with the families of the trapped men, assuring them that all resources are being deployed.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are launching a new left-wing political party but are leaving its name up to their supporters. Having already registered over 600,000 supporters, the duo is asking for suggestions to define the new movement's identity before officially registering with the Electoral Commission. Naming a new party presents a significant branding challenge, as it must be distinct and resonate with voters in a digital age. This unconventional, crowd-sourced approach is part of a broader debate about what the new party will ultimately represent.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have formally committed to Luka Dončić as the future of the franchise by signing him to a three-year, $165 million contract extension. The move solidifies the 26-year-old's status as the team's centerpiece, a shift that intensifies questions about the role of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. While the front office expressed positive and professional dialogue with James's camp, his future with the team remains unclear. This transition marks a pivotal moment for the Lakers as they build around their new superstar.</p>

          <p>Climate change is increasing the risk of catastrophic landslides in the Alps, threatening to wipe out historic mountain villages and forcing a difficult debate about whether to rebuild or relocate. The article highlights the recent destruction of Blatten, Switzerland, where a collapsing mountain and glacier forced the evacuation of 300 residents. While some question the high cost of rebuilding and protecting these remote communities, others argue it is essential to preserve the unique culture and identity of the Alps. Scientists warn that as glaciers recede and permafrost thaws, such events will become more frequent.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was the catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who had qualified as a physician but felt unsuited for the profession, said his stepfather's passing made him realize he didn't want to spend his life in a job he wasn't passionate about. He recalled feeling emotionally out of his depth as a doctor, particularly when breaking bad news to patients. The move proved successful, leading to a long career in entertainment, most notably with his hit show "Harry Hill's TV Burp."</p>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for £30 million, just two years after signing him. The potential sale is linked to the club's strong interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While United sources state they can acquire Sesko without first selling players, an exit would likely be necessary to comply with profit and sustainability rules. If Sesko were to arrive, Hojlund would be marginalized, prompting the club to consider a sale at a financial loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms is reportedly becoming more cautious about its open-source approach to artificial intelligence, a shift that comes as Chinese companies aggressively push forward with their own advanced open-source models. Renowned AI expert Andrew Ng has suggested that China's competitive, "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in the field. Recently, Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have released powerful new open-source models, highlighting the country's growing momentum and challenging the dominance of Western proprietary systems.</p>
