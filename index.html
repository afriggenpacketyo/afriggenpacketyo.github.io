          <p>Shares of U.S. rare earth mining companies experienced a significant rally following President Trump's threat to impose new 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. This market reaction highlights investor sensitivity to the escalating trade dispute, particularly concerning China's dominance in the critical minerals supply chain. China, which produces nearly 70% of the world's rare earths and processes almost 90%, recently announced a framework to restrict its exports, further intensifying the economic standoff between the two nations.

          <p>The remnants of Typhoon Halong have caused devastating floods and storm surges in western Alaska, resulting in at least one death and two missing persons. U.S. Coast Guard officials described the scene in the villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok as "absolute devastation," with some homes swept away and over 50 people rescued. The disaster has raised significant concerns for the recovery of these remote, predominately Alaska Native communities, as damaged homes and ruined food supplies pose a severe threat with winter approaching.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared an end to the Israel-Hamas war following a historic exchange of remaining Israeli hostages for over 1,900 Palestinian prisoners. While the initial steps of the 20-point peace plan have been celebrated, Middle East experts caution that significant hurdles remain for achieving lasting peace. Key unresolved issues include the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas, and the establishment of an international body to govern the territory, making the path forward complex and fragile.</p>

          <p>Following claims from the White House suggesting a link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism, medical experts are refuting these and other related assertions. Doctors and researchers have clarified that there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that Amish communities have no autism due to avoiding medications, noting they do use Tylenol. Experts also dismissed unverified rumors of pregnant women taking excessive doses in protest and reaffirmed that acetaminophen, when used correctly, is considered the safest option for pain and fever relief during pregnancy and for children.</p>

          <h2>Welsh Government Faces Potential Spending Cuts Amid Budget Negotiations</h2>

          <p>Wales' Labour government is warning of significant public service cuts if its upcoming budget fails to pass in the Senedd, where it lacks a majority. Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford is set to publish the spending plans, but will require support from opposition parties to enact them. The Welsh Conservatives have offered to negotiate a deal in exchange for scrapping the land transaction tax for main homes. Failure to pass a budget by April would legally restrict government spending to 75% of the previous year's allocation, potentially leading to widespread redundancies.</p>

          <p>A new book titled "Candid New York" compiles the groundbreaking work of George Bradford Brainerd, a 19th-century civil engineer and photographer. In the 1870s, Brainerd developed early handheld cameras that allowed him to capture spontaneous and detailed scenes of everyday life on the streets of New York. Often called the 'father of instantaneous photography,' his images document a diverse range of city inhabitants, from musicians and paperboys to beggars. The book, authored by Erik Hesselberg, offers a unique visual record of the era and is set for release on October 21st.</p>

          <p>A new study by DHL and NYU's Stern School of Business suggests that global trade has proven resilient against the Trump administration's tariff hikes and is not currently reversing. The research forecasts that global trade volume will grow at an average annual rate of 2.5% through 2029, a pace similar to the previous decade but slower than earlier predictions. Despite a surge in shipments in early 2025 ahead of tariff implementations, growth is expected to slow significantly next year before stabilizing, indicating that globalization is adapting rather than collapsing.

          <p>An NPR reporter is relinquishing his Pentagon press pass after 28 years in protest of a new Defense Department rule that he argues stifles journalism. The policy warns that journalists could lose credentials for soliciting unclassified information that has not been officially cleared for release.

The performance provided a much-needed boost for the Dodgers' bullpen and demonstrated manager Dave Roberts' continued confidence in the veteran pitcher during a critical moment in the National League Championship Series.</p>

While the Venezuelan government cited a restructuring of its foreign service, the move is widely seen as a diplomatic retaliation for the honor bestowed upon a prominent critic of President Nicolás Maduro. Norway's foreign ministry called the decision "regrettable" but emphasized that the Nobel Prize is awarded by an independent committee and that it wishes to maintain open dialogue with Venezuela despite political differences.</p>

Cameron McGerr believes he might have been able to help his father, who died from a cardiac arrest earlier this year, if he had been taught life-saving skills. After successfully persuading his own school to introduce the training, he is now campaigning for it to be implemented across Scotland, arguing that equipping young people with this knowledge could significantly improve survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.</p>

          <p>Torrential rains across five states in Mexico have led to severe flooding, raising the death toll to 64, with an additional 65 people reported missing. The government has deployed approximately 10,000 troops to assist in rescue efforts, as around 100,000 homes have been damaged and some 200 communities remain cut off. In the oil town of Poza Rica, cleanup is complicated by a thick residue of crude oil that mixed with the floodwaters, contaminating homes and property. The deadly downpours have been attributed to two now-dissipated tropical systems.</p>

These compounds, which the UN says operate on forced labor and human trafficking, are responsible for swindling billions of dollars from victims worldwide. The investigation follows reports that Starlink has rapidly become Myanmar's largest internet provider, with its satellite dishes appearing on scam-center roofs shortly after a supposed crackdown on their operations.
