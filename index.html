          <p>Typhoon Kajiki made a devastating landfall in Vietnam, unleashing severe floods and widespread damage, particularly in Hanoi. Authorities confirmed at least three fatalities and ten injuries, with powerful winds exceeding 130km/h tearing roofs from thousands of homes and leaving over 1.6 million people without electricity. Rescue efforts are actively underway, with soldiers and paramilitary workers clearing debris, assisting evacuations, and addressing damage to thousands of homes, rice fields, and trees. Further heavy rainfall is expected across northern Vietnam and neighboring Laos and Thailand, necessitating continued vigilance.</p>

          <p>European stock markets experienced a sharp decline, with France's CAC 40 index plummeting over 2%, as traders reacted to the potential for a no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's government. Bayrou's controversial budget plans, which include €44 billion in cuts to address France's 5.8% GDP deficit, face strong opposition, raising significant political uncertainty. This turmoil contributes to an unwinding of momentum trades in European assets, highlighting the fragility of the political and economic outlook. Analysts warn of considerable risks, though the government's fate remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia has taken decisive action by expelling Iran's ambassador and three other embassy officials, citing intelligence linking the Iranian government to antisemitic attacks in Sydney and Melbourne. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned these "dangerous acts of aggression" as attempts to undermine social cohesion within Australia. In response, Australia has also withdrawn its own diplomats from Tehran and announced plans to designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. This significant diplomatic move marks the first ambassador expulsion by Australia since World War Two, underscoring severe bilateral tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the firing of Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, alleging mortgage fraud and intensifying his ongoing pressure on the central bank to lower interest rates. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, swiftly rejected the dismissal, asserting that Trump lacks the legal authority to remove her and vowing to take legal action to remain in her post. This dramatic move challenges the Federal Reserve's long-held independence and sets the stage for a significant legal and political dispute over the president's powers concerning Fed appointments. The situation has already impacted financial markets.</p>

          <p>China is set to accelerate the expansion of its national carbon market, aiming to incorporate major polluting industries by 2027, three years earlier than previously planned. New guidelines also introduce a tougher standard by setting absolute limits on emissions, moving beyond the current carbon intensity-based caps that allow emissions to increase. This ambitious initiative is designed to invigorate the often-sluggish carbon market and underscores the government's heightened commitment to achieving its climate targets. Heavily polluting sectors like steel, aluminum, and cement will be added this year.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has strongly condemned illegal immigration as a "scourge" and unveiled a comprehensive plan to tackle small boat crossings, pledging to detain and deport those entering the UK unlawfully. His proposals include radical legal changes, such as withdrawing from the European Court of Human Rights, repealing the Human Rights Act, and disapplying international treaties like the Refugee Convention. Farage advocates for a legal obligation on the Home Secretary to remove illegal migrants and to ban them from claiming asylum, asserting the need to prioritize British interests amidst growing public concern.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is engaged in a series of public feuds with political opponents, including former allies John Bolton and Chris Christie, and Maryland Governor Wes Moore. Trump has leveraged social media to accuse Christie of past misconduct, suggesting a re-examination of the "Bridgegate" scandal, and attacked Bolton following an FBI raid on his home. More controversially, he threatened to withhold federal funds for Maryland's Francis Scott Key Bridge reconstruction, linking it to a dispute with Governor Moore. These actions highlight Trump's combative approach and raise concerns about the use of executive power for political retribution.</p>

          <p>UK food price inflation surged to 4.2% in the year to August, marking an 18-month high, predominantly driven by escalating costs for chocolate, butter, and eggs. The British Retail Consortium's latest monitor attributes these "significant increases" to high demand, tightening supply, increased labor costs, and poor global cocoa harvests exacerbated by climate change. This rise contributes to an overall increase in shop prices and broader UK inflation, which hit 3.8% in July. Households are advised to reassess budgets as everyday food items have seen a substantial 37% price increase over the last five years.</p>

          <p>California Republicans have launched a legal challenge, filing an emergency petition with the State Supreme Court to halt a November special election concerning Governor Gavin Newsom's redistricting plan. Proposition 50, as it's known, proposes to redraw California's congressional map to create five additional Democratic-leaning districts, which Democrats argue is a necessary response to similar actions by Texas Republicans. Opponents contend the plan violates the state constitution by bypassing an independent redistricting commission and redrawing maps mid-decade, intensifying a contentious political battle over future congressional control.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have announced a significant breakthrough in developing "invisibility" technology for airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, which are typically high-value and vulnerable targets. The new method employs frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, assigning each antenna a minutely varied frequency, which makes the aircraft's radar emissions chaotic and highly resistant to interception and geolocation from a distance. This innovation could effectively obscure the directional origin of AEW&C platforms, fundamentally altering their detectability and potentially enhancing their survivability in complex combat environments.</p>

Mercedes-Benz cited the non-strategic significance of the Nissan holdings and framed the sale as a portfolio cleanup. This development exacerbates pressure on Nissan's stock, which has already been affected by U.S. tariffs, declining sales, and the challenging global transition to electric vehicles amid fierce competition, particularly from Chinese rivals. Nissan is currently undergoing a major restructuring, including significant job cuts and plant closures, to address its struggling performance. (not investment advice)</p>
