          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>According to the BBC, sources claim that the national leadership of the Unite union interfered with a potential agreement between Birmingham bin workers and the city council, prolonging a strike that resulted in significant uncollected rubbish on the streets. Local Unite members reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with the handling of the dispute, alleging that power struggles within the union influenced the decision-making process. A leaked letter from Unite's General Secretary criticized government commissioners overseeing the council's financial recovery, further complicating negotiations. The industrial action, which began in January and escalated in March, caused major disruptions in waste collection across Birmingham.</p>

            <p>Barclays has lowered rates on some of its mortgage products to below 4%, becoming the largest UK lender to do so. This decision comes as continued uncertainty surrounding US tariff policies raises expectations of interest rate cuts later in the year. The rate reduction applies to specific fixed-term deals for borrowers with a 60% loan-to-value ratio, and an £899 fee. Several other lenders, including Coventry Building Society and TSB, have also cut mortgage rates this week, reflecting broader market trends amid predictions of potential Bank of England rate reductions to stimulate economic growth (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order directing the energy secretary to rescind a change introduced by Barack Obama that restricted multi-nozzle showers from discharging over 2.5 gallons of water per minute overall. Trump criticized the "ridiculous" amount of time it takes to wet his hair in the shower, arguing that the previous rules, implemented under Obama's Energy Conservation Program, were part of a "radical green agenda." Consumer and conservation groups have opposed the changes, stating that existing efficiency standards reduce water waste and save consumers money. The Trump administration, however, frames its efforts as ending a "war on water pressure."</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>According to David Daley of The Guardian, the Democratic Party faces significant structural challenges that go beyond messaging issues. Gerrymandered legislatures, a malapportioned Senate, and the Electoral College tilt the playing field against Democrats, making it difficult to achieve majorities even with popular support. The article emphasizes the need for structural reforms, such as redistricting, court reforms, and statehood for Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, to create a level playing field. Daley argues that without addressing these systemic barriers, Democrats risk being relegated to opposition status despite potentially assembling a majority coalition.</p>

Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic agreed to start negotiations on electric vehicle pricing and auto sector investment ties. China and the EU also signaled their readiness to launch market access talks and address trade frictions related to EU concerns about the diversion of Chinese exports previously destined for the US. This follows increased tariffs imposed by the EU on China-made EVs after an anti-subsidy investigation.</p>

Jim Burkhard of S&P Global Commodity Insights noted that the higher tariffs on China remained a significant factor, contributing to ongoing market volatility and uncertainty regarding future trade negotiations (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Following President Donald Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian accused the U.S. of using "tariffs as a weapon to exert maximum pressure and seek selfish gains." Lin stated that this move goes against the interests of the international community. He also said that Beijing would respond to safeguard its economy. Trump's decision came after Beijing announced it would increase tariffs on all U.S. goods to 84%. Lin added that China does not want to fight trade wars but will not fear them.</p>

            <p>New tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could significantly increase the cost of raising children in America, affecting essential items like cribs, strollers, clothing, and food. The Budget Lab estimates that the tariffs could cost an average household $3,800 per year, particularly impacting families during the financially challenging early years of parenthood. While the White House claims the tariffs address trade deficits, critics argue that they contradict the administration's stated goal of encouraging higher birth rates. Higher prices on necessities could force families to make difficult choices, potentially affecting children's quality of life.</p>

            <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to assist with tax filing, with companies like TurboTax and H&R Block launching AI-powered chatbots. While these tools have improved, they still have limitations and can provide inaccurate information, potentially leading to errors in tax returns. However, they can also offer helpful guidance and boost users' confidence in their filings. The use of AI in accounting is expanding, with firms automating processes to save time, although some experts caution against relying too heavily on chatbots and emphasize the value of human expertise.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump backed down on some of his largest tariffs, though the trade war is far from over, with significant levies still in place on Chinese goods and a 10% tariff on most other imports. Experts predict prices will likely increase across the board, affecting items from fresh produce to new cars, as businesses pass on the increased costs. Economists suggest various strategies businesses may employ, including shrinkflation, reducing cheaper options, or increasing prices across the board. Some industries, like textiles and consumer electronics, are expected to be hit harder than others.</p>
