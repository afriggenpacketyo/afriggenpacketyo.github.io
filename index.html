          <p>Operations at Milan Bergamo Airport were halted for nearly two hours after a man was killed by being sucked into a moving aircraft's engine. Authorities report the individual was not a passenger or employee and is believed to have breached security with the intent of taking his own life. The incident involved a Volotea Airbus A319 that was taxiing for departure to Spain. The event caused significant flight disruptions, with multiple cancellations and diversions to other regional airports while an investigation was launched.</p>

          <p>Greek authorities closed the Acropolis in Athens for several hours to protect visitors and staff from dangerously high temperatures. The Culture Ministry announced the temporary shutdown as temperatures were forecast to exceed 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). In addition to the closure of the famous archaeological site, mandatory work breaks were imposed for outdoor laborers in other parts of Greece to prevent heat-related health issues. Officials also warned that the ongoing heatwave is expected to increase the risk of wildfires across the eastern mainland.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 tech founders and community members have signed an open letter urging venture capital firm Sequoia Capital to denounce partner Shaun Maguire for his comments about New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Maguire, a vocal Trump supporter, made inflammatory posts on social media, which the group described as an attack on Mamdani and the Muslim community. The signatories are demanding a public apology, an independent investigation into Maguire's conduct, and a zero-tolerance policy on hate speech. The letter sets a deadline for a response before the group considers broader public action.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is experiencing heightened anxiety after a U.S. deadline for new tariffs passed without the island securing an exemption, leaving it vulnerable to future trade penalties. While the government suggests negotiations are ongoing, critics fear the lack of an announcement indicates trouble and the possibility of harsher terms later. Taiwan's Vice-Premier Cheng Li-chun has made two trips to Washington in two weeks, signaling the intensity of the discussions. The situation has created significant uncertainty for Taiwan's economy as it awaits an official notification from the Trump administration regarding its trade status.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association indicates a widespread decline in the physical and mental health of children in the United States between 2007 and 2023. Researchers analyzed 170 different indicators, finding increased rates of chronic conditions like anxiety and depression, rising childhood obesity, and more sleep-related problems. The report also highlights that U.S. children face a significantly higher mortality rate compared to those in other high-income countries, largely due to firearm incidents and vehicle crashes. Experts suggest these findings reflect broader systemic health issues within the nation.</p>

          <p>Germany's government has unveiled a draft budget for 2025 featuring unprecedented investment in the nation's defense and infrastructure, financed by substantial new borrowing. Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil stated the plan aims to tackle a massive investment backlog, including dilapidated roads, bridges, and schools, while also reviving a weak economy. A significant portion of the spending will go towards increasing the defense budget to meet NATO targets, with plans to more than double it by 2029. This new fiscal policy marks a major shift, lifting the country's strict "debt brake" to fund future viability and security.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar is confronting significant headwinds after experiencing its worst first-half performance since 1973, declining 10.7% against global currencies. Analysts point to factors such as policy volatility, growing national debt, and potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts as primary drivers of the decline. This trend has prompted global central banks to increase gold purchases as an alternative safe-haven asset. While some experts believe fears are overblown, others maintain a short position on the dollar, citing its overvaluation and ongoing fiscal concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

The author, a former Green Beret, argues that this creates a false dichotomy between lethality and professionalism, which includes adhering to the laws of war and moral standards. The piece suggests that Hegseth's perspective, while appealing to some soldiers, overlooks the complexities of modern warfare and strategic leadership.

          <p>This article analyzes how Vice President JD Vance's past social media posts are complicating the Trump administration's current position on the Jeffrey Epstein case. While the White House now refutes the existence of a definitive "Epstein client list," Vance had previously amplified the conspiracy, tweeting in 2021 that the government was keeping the list secret and stating on a podcast that it needed to be released. This history has put Vance in an awkward position of defending his boss from speculation he once encouraged, highlighting how the administration is now battling a narrative that some of its own key figures helped create.</p>

          <p>Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer who represented the Ukraine whistleblower, is suing the Trump administration after his security clearance was revoked by a presidential memo. Zaid was named alongside high-profile political figures like Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton in an order that deemed their access to classified information was "no longer in the national interest." He argues the action is unconstitutional, politically vindictive, and impedes his ability to represent his clients. The case highlights the administration's broader retribution agenda against critics and raises concerns about the weaponization of security clearances.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the catastrophic Texas floods that killed over 100 people, a political battle is emerging over the government's response and preparedness. Democrats have called for an investigation into whether budget and staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) under President Trump affected forecasting accuracy. Meanwhile, prominent Republicans have praised Trump's swift disaster declaration while avoiding questions about his administration's policies, including threats to dismantle FEMA. The article notes a pattern of blaming nature rather than contemplating potential links between the tragedy and administration policies or the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Club World Cup semi-final between Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain is charged with drama as star striker Kylian Mbappé faces his former club. The buildup has been dominated by off-field conflict, including Mbappé's legal claim against PSG for €55 million in unpaid wages and bonuses, which PSG disputes. After a bitter and highly publicized departure, the match is being framed as a revenge game for Mbappé, who left PSG to win major trophies but saw his old club win the Champions League without him. The high-stakes sporting event is now inseparable from the personal and financial battles between the player and his former team.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece discusses the case of Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old woman in Georgia who was declared brain dead but kept on life support for four months because she was pregnant. Her family was reportedly told by the hospital that the state's abortion ban required them to maintain her body to gestate the fetus. The author argues this desecration of a corpse illustrates how abortion bans reduce women to instruments of the state, disregarding their personhood and dignity. The article draws a parallel to how sexual assault functions, using a body for an end without deference to the person who inhabits it.</p>

          <p>This article provides a deep profile of General Dan Caine, President Trump's surprising pick to lead the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Caine, a retired three-star Air Force general, was promoted over all active-duty four-star officers, a move typical of Trump's unorthodox style. The piece explores Caine's background as a fighter pilot and his reputation as an apolitical, team-oriented professional, contrasting it with the "hell-raiser" persona Trump has projected onto him. It highlights the potential for friction as Caine's duty to provide unvarnished military advice clashes with a president who demands loyalty and dislikes being contradicted.</p>

          <p>Industry forecasts predict that Hong Kong's insurance market could see its gross premium jump by 55 percent to US$127 billion by 2032, up from US$82 billion last year. According to Manulife Financial's Asia president, a key driver for this optimism is the aging population and low insurance penetration in the Greater Bay Area, a region of 86 million people. Last year, sales of new life policies in Hong Kong hit a record high, with mainland Chinese visitors purchasing nearly a quarter of them, underscoring the city's role as a regional insurance hub.

          <p>A Mexican court has found ten men guilty of murder and kidnapping in a case connected to a "ranch of horror" allegedly used by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) as a forced recruitment center. The men were arrested last year after a shootout with police at the property in Jalisco state. The site was reportedly used to train new recruits in weapons use, with those who refused orders or tried to escape being tortured and killed. The case has drawn significant attention in Mexico, a country grappling with over 100,000 missing persons, many linked to cartel violence.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, has reportedly instructed the military to prepare a plan to relocate the entire population of Gaza, approximately 2.1 million people, into a single large camp. According to Israeli media, the proposed "humanitarian city" would be established on the ruins of Rafah in southern Gaza. Katz stated that people would be moved there after security screening and would not be allowed to leave. A human rights lawyer has condemned the proposal as an operational plan for a crime against humanity, while the UN has previously warned that such forcible transfers are tantamount to ethnic cleansing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Republican-led bill, despite featuring major cuts to other social programs, includes a significant $16 billion investment in federal child care tax credits. This article analyzes the political dynamics that allowed a freshman Republican senator, Katie Britt, to successfully champion the provisions. By positioning herself as a credible party messenger on family policy after the Alabama IVF ruling, she built a coalition that saw the new spending as a political imperative. The legislation expands tax credits for parents and businesses, primarily benefiting middle-class families and marking a notable shift in GOP priorities on an issue traditionally led by Democrats.</p>
