          <p>A passenger who jumped overboard from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship near San Juan, Puerto Rico, has been federally charged after an alleged attempt to evade a gambling debt of over $16,000. Jey Gonzalez-Diaz was rescued by a jet ski rider after plunging into the water as the ship was disembarking. Upon being located by authorities, he was found with a large amount of cash and multiple IDs. The incident highlights an unusual method of attempting to escape financial obligations, leading to serious legal consequences for the individual involved.</p>

          <p>Arizona Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego is pushing for legislation to prevent Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the January 6th Capitol riot, from receiving full military funeral honors. Gallego argues that conferring such honors on someone who actively participated in an attempt to overthrow the government would discredit the U.S. Air Force, in which she served. The Pentagon had initially denied the honor but later reversed its decision following lobbying from a conservative legal group, creating a contentious political and ethical debate.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a memorandum aimed at increasing the transparency and accuracy of direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertisements, particularly on television and social media. The initiative, championed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will enforce existing regulations more strictly by sending out thousands of warning letters to pharmaceutical companies. Rather than an outright ban, the new measures seek to close a loophole that allowed companies to omit full risk information in their ads, aiming to provide patients with more balanced information.</p>

          <p>Over 2,000 actors and filmmakers, including prominent names like Emma Stone and Ava DuVernay, have pledged to boycott Israeli film institutions they deem complicit in what they describe as genocide and apartheid against Palestinians. The campaign, modeled after the 1980s cultural boycott of apartheid South Africa, targets institutional partnerships rather than individuals. In response, Israeli film industry groups have condemned the boycott as misguided, arguing that it silences creators who foster dialogue and understanding through their work.</p>

          <p>England's national football team delivered a commanding performance, defeating Serbia 5-0 in a crucial World Cup qualifier in Belgrade. The victory, described as the best of coach Thomas Tuchel's tenure, was achieved despite the absence of key players like Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka. The decisive win silenced the notoriously hostile Serbian crowd and has significantly boosted England's prospects for qualifying for the World Cup, leaving them just five points away with three games remaining.</p>

Oracle announced it had signed several multi-billion dollar cloud contracts, including one with OpenAI, and raised its future revenue guidance significantly, boosting investor confidence.

          <p>President Trump's response to the release of documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate is drawing scrutiny, with an analysis suggesting his uncharacteristically defensive posture and denials are backfiring. Instead of his usual tactic of brazenly confronting controversy, Trump has sued a media outlet for reporting on the documents and has repeatedly tried to dismiss the issue. This approach has fueled speculation that he may have something to hide, prolonging the scandal and creating a political vulnerability that opponents are eager to exploit.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that Israel's recent assassination of Hamas leaders in Doha is more than a military operation; it's a fundamental challenge to Qatar's relevance as an international intermediary. For years, Qatar has built its geopolitical influence by hosting and mediating between opposing factions, including the U.S., Iran, and the Taliban. By striking on Qatari soil, Israel signals that it, and potentially the U.S., now views this mediation as a futile exercise, potentially undermining Qatar's long-cultivated diplomatic strategy.</p>

The judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to proceed to trial on charges of forgery and conspiracy. This decision is a major blow to one of several state-level prosecutions across the country aimed at holding individuals accountable for their roles in the effort to overturn the 2020 election results.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists predict that key inflation reports for August will show a continued rise in prices, primarily due to the impact of tariffs on goods like automobiles and furniture. Despite the anticipated increase in headline inflation, the Federal Reserve is still expected to proceed with an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. Policymakers are likely to focus on the unchanged core inflation rate and a weakening labor market, viewing the tariff-related price hikes as a temporary rather than a long-term inflationary trend.

          <p>The race to become the next deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party is already exposing potential fault lines and creating headaches for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's new government. Candidates who were not appointed to the cabinet, such as Emily Thornberry, are using the platform to voice criticism on sensitive policy areas like wealth taxes and the government's stance on Gaza. The contest highlights the internal party dynamics that the government will need to navigate as it establishes its agenda.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has reportedly engaged with William Parker, a scientist promoting a theory that acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a primary cause of autism in children. This theory is considered to be on the fringes of academia and has been largely rejected by mainstream researchers. Kennedy's interest in the idea is part of his broader, controversial pledge to identify and eliminate the causes of autism, raising concerns among scientists about the promotion of unsubstantiated claims at high government levels.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter has been fined $57,222 by the NFL after he was ejected for spitting on an opponent during the season-opening game against the Dallas Cowboys. While the fine is substantial, he will not face an additional suspension, as the league is considering his ejection as a one-game suspension with time served. The incident, which occurred before Carter played a single snap, adds to a pattern of disciplinary issues for the talented but controversial player.</p>

          <p>Following intense criticism from customers and conservative commentators, Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending its plans to remodel its restaurants with a more contemporary design. This move comes just weeks after the company was forced to reverse a change to a minimalist logo that sparked a political firestorm and a public rebuke from Donald Trump. The company stated it was listening to feedback that the modern designs did not reflect what customers love about its traditional, country-store aesthetic.</p>

          <p>In the ongoing trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, two of the five Supreme Court justices have voted to find him guilty of plotting a coup following his 2022 election defeat. A conviction, which could lead to over 40 years in prison, now hinges on at least one more guilty vote from the remaining three justices. The first justice to vote, Alexandre de Moraes, stated there was "no doubt" that Bolsonaro led a "criminal organisation" that attempted to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.</p>

          <p>Massive youth-led protests against government corruption have erupted across Nepal, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The demonstrations were initially sparked by a since-revoked ban on several social media platforms but have grown to represent a deeper public frustration with political elites. The movement, largely organized by young people identifying as "Gen Z," has seen violent clashes with police and highlights a significant wave of social and political unrest in the country.</p>

          <p>The man accused of the unprovoked fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina, has been charged with a federal crime. The new charge of causing a death on a mass transportation system makes the suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., eligible for the death penalty. The tragic killing of Zarutska, who had fled the war in Ukraine, has ignited a fierce national debate about urban crime, mental health services, and judicial policies in the United States.</p>
