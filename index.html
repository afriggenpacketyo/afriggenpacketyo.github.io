          <p>China's top leadership has concluded its "Fourth Plenum" meeting, outlining a five-year plan prioritizing domestic consumption and technological self-reliance. The plan aims to balance consumption with effective investment and expand domestic demand to create a virtuous cycle of supply and demand. While reaffirming a 5% growth target for 2025, the strategy emphasizes developing key sectors like quantum computing and elderly care, signaling a continued focus on investment-driven growth rather than direct consumer stimulus. This push for self-sufficiency is also a response to ongoing technological restrictions from the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet next week on the sidelines of the APEC summit, marking their first face-to-face discussion since Trump's return to office. The high-stakes meeting occurs as a fragile trade detente nears expiration and both nations have recently imposed new restrictive measures, including tariffs and export controls on rare earth minerals. Key topics for discussion are expected to include trade imbalances, fentanyl flows, and geopolitical issues like Taiwan. Analysts anticipate the meeting may reset dialogue but is unlikely to produce a comprehensive trade deal.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists from Peking University and Harbin Engineering University has developed a new super-tough, flexible, and ultra-thin coating designed for stealth aircraft. The material, a metasurface detailed in the journal Advanced Materials, can withstand extreme temperatures up to 1,000 degrees Celsius. Its tunable impedance properties make it highly effective for absorbing electromagnetic waves, a key characteristic for aerospace and stealth applications. The breakthrough builds on previous research in large-scale graphene production using chemical vapor deposition.</p>

          <p>A tragic accident in Andhra Pradesh, southern India, has resulted in the deaths of at least 20 people after a bus caught fire. The blaze reportedly started when a motorcycle crashed into the bus and became lodged under its fuel tank, causing an explosion. While eighteen passengers managed to escape, many were asleep and trapped inside, with some reports suggesting a jammed door contributed to the high death toll. The incident has intensified concerns about the safety of public transportation in India, prompting calls for greater accountability and vehicle maintenance.</p>

          <p>Stock markets across Asia experienced gains, with South Korea's Kospi index surging 2% to a new record high, following the announcement of an upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The news has fostered investor optimism that dialogue between the leaders of the world's two largest economies could help de-escalate trade tensions. Japan's Nikkei 225 also climbed, even as new data showed the country's core inflation rate accelerated to 2.9% in September, adding a complex element to the regional economic outlook.

          <p>A major federal investigation has resulted in the arrests of dozens of individuals, including Miami Heat player Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, for their alleged roles in illegal gambling operations.

Participants say the costumes make it difficult for authorities to portray them as a threat and create a disarming, festive atmosphere.

          <p>North Korea has held a groundbreaking ceremony for a new memorial museum in Pyongyang to honor its soldiers who have died fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. Leader Kim Jong Un attended the event, praising the "historic peak" in relations between Pyongyang and Moscow and describing the memorial as a "sacred sanctuary" for patriots. The move publicly reaffirms the close military alliance between the two nations, which includes a mutual defense pact. South Korean intelligence estimates that at least 2,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed in the conflict so far.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers delivered a commanding performance on Thursday night, defeating the Minnesota Vikings 37-10 and ending a recent losing streak. Quarterback Justin Herbert threw for 227 yards and three touchdowns, leading an offense that topped 30 points for the first time this season. The Chargers' defense was relentless, sacking Vikings quarterback Carson Wentz five times and allowing only three third-down conversions. In a remarkable statistic, the Chargers did not punt a single time in the game, showcasing their offensive control and bouncing back decisively from a poor performance just four days earlier.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have detailed the sophisticated technology allegedly used in a multi-million dollar illegal poker scheme involving NBA figures and organized crime members. The operation reportedly employed devices such as altered card shuffling machines that could predict the winning hand, an X-ray table to read face-down cards, and special contact lenses for reading pre-marked cards. Victims, referred to as "fish," were lured into rigged games with the promise of playing alongside well-known athletes. The scheme, which officials said cheated victims out of at least $7 million, allegedly served as a major financial pipeline for several of New York's mafia families.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged 34 individuals in a sweeping crackdown on illegal gambling, with indictments naming prominent figures from the sports and organized crime worlds. Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier are among those charged, alongside alleged members and associates of the Bonanno, Gambino, and Genovese crime families. The charges stem from two separate schemes: one involving insider information to manipulate bets on NBA games, and another concerning elaborately rigged high-stakes poker games.

          <p>The United States is considering new export controls targeting products that use American software, a potential escalation in its trade dispute with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that "everything is on the table" as a response to Beijing's recent restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. This development comes as high-level officials from both countries prepare for crucial trade negotiations in Malaysia, which are seen as a prelude to a potential meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi. The move signals that the U.S. is prepared to broaden its technological restrictions on China if a resolution is not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lawyers for New York Attorney General Letitia James are moving to dismiss her federal bank fraud indictment, arguing that the interim U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed. The legal team also criticized Halligan for what they termed an "unusual and improper" text message conversation with a journalist about the case, claiming it violated Justice Department rules. James, who has pleaded not guilty, is accused of making false statements on a mortgage application for a house in Virginia. Her defense has consistently maintained that the prosecution is a politically motivated act of retribution by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has issued a direct warning to Russia, stating "We're hunting your submarines," in response to what he described as a 30% rise in Russian naval threats in UK waters. He noted that Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic has returned to Cold War levels, reflecting broader Russian aggression. The statement was made during a flight on a new P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, which is part of a stepped-up surveillance effort by the RAF and Royal Navy.

          <p>A rare mid-decade push to redraw congressional maps is underway in states like Texas, California, Missouri, and North Carolina, creating potential shake-ups for the next elections. Sparked by a call from President Trump, Republicans in Texas and Missouri have redrawn districts to favor their party, while California Democrats have retaliated with their own gerrymandering effort. These moves, which normally only occur after a decennial census, are aimed at securing or expanding razor-thin party majorities in the House of Representatives. The new maps are already facing legal challenges, creating significant uncertainty about the future congressional landscape.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Rinderknecht, the 29-year-old man charged with starting the catastrophic Palisades fire, has pleaded not guilty in a Los Angeles federal court. The fire, which occurred earlier this year, resulted in 12 deaths and the destruction of over 6,800 structures. Prosecutors allege that Rinderknecht started an initial fire that later reignited and spread due to Santa Ana winds, citing geolocation data from his phone and his online search history as evidence. Rinderknecht's defense questions why firefighters did not fully extinguish the original blaze and emphasizes his lack of a prior criminal record.</p>
