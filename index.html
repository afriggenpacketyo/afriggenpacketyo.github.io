          <p>Hamas announced it would release Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage held in Gaza, ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East, as a gesture of goodwill and to facilitate ceasefire negotiations. Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas‚Äôs lead negotiator, stated the decision came after talks with the United States, though the timing of the release remains unclear. The article notes that Alexander, an Israeli-American dual citizen, was abducted during the October 7, 2023, attacks and that the U.S. pledged to make ‚Äúgreat efforts‚Äù to end the war in Gaza during negotiations, according to a Hamas official.

          <p>Researchers in Switzerland have developed a 'digital bridge' that wirelessly connects the brain to the spinal cord, helping paralyzed individuals regain movement and bodily functions. The article details how the technology, developed by French neuroscientist Gregoire Courtine and Swiss neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, bypasses spinal cord injuries to restore communication between the brain and limbs. CEO of Onward Medical, Dave Marver, explains that patients prioritize regaining functions like bladder control, sexual function, and blood pressure regulation over walking. The system has also shown promise in Parkinson's disease patients, improving their mobility by stimulating the spinal cord. The scientists are now focused on conducting clinical trials to ensure safety and efficacy for wider accessibility.</p>

This flurry of exchanges came after Putin effectively rejected the Monday cease-fire deadline and proposed direct talks in Istanbul.
