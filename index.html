        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is lagging behind global leaders like China and Europe in electric vehicle adoption, despite a recent surge in sales. Analysts attribute this gap to weaker government incentives, higher average vehicle costs, and political uncertainty, with the recent expiration of a key tax credit expected to slow momentum further. While the Biden administration pushed for increased EV uptake, the Trump administration has sought to roll back many of these measures, leaving the market's future dependent on automaker pricing strategies and consumer demand in a challenging economic environment. The article questions whether the U.S. is truly "behind" in a still-evolving industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to give police broader authority to impose conditions on repeated protests, citing the cumulative impact on communities. The move allows senior officers to restrict demonstrations at sites that have seen frequent activity, with breaches leading to arrest and prosecution. This decision follows recent mass arrests at a pro-Palestine demonstration and comes amid heightened security concerns for the Jewish community after a deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the powers aim to balance the right to protest with residents' freedom to live without fear.</p>

          <p>Authorities in three Indian states have banned the sale of Coldrif cough syrup after it was linked to the deaths of at least nine children. India's Health Ministry confirmed that samples of the syrup, manufactured by Sresan Pharma, contained toxic levels of diethylene glycol, a dangerous industrial solvent. The incident places India's large pharmaceutical industry, a major global supplier of generic medicines, under renewed scrutiny. This follows previous international warnings from the World Health Organization regarding other contaminated Indian-made cough syrups linked to child deaths in The Gambia and Uzbekistan.</p>

          <p>Russia conducted a significant overnight missile and drone attack on western Ukraine, with the city of Lviv being a primary target, resulting in at least two deaths and injuries. The strikes also targeted energy infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, causing power outages for over 73,000 people and killing one person. In response to the proximity of the attacks, neighboring Poland scrambled its fighter jets to secure its airspace, highlighting the escalating regional tensions. The assault occurred just days after a US official indicated support for Ukrainian strikes deep within Russian territory.</p>

          <p>Indonesian rescue teams are searching for 26 missing students following the collapse of a prayer hall at an Islamic boarding school in Sidoarjo, East Java, nearly a week ago. The death toll has risen to 37 after more bodies were recovered from the rubble over the weekend. The collapse occurred while a third story was being added to the building, which police say was done without a proper permit, leading to structural failure. The incident has sparked public anger over illegal construction practices, with investigations now focused on potential negligence by the school's management.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a British doctoral student at Cornell University recounts his decision to flee the United States after participating in a pro-Palestine protest on campus. Amandla Thomas-Johnson, who is Black and Muslim, describes being banned from campus and going into hiding after fearing he was being targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the Trump administration. His fears were amplified when he received notifications that his student visa was terminated and that Google had handed his data to the Department of Homeland Security, leading him to believe he was under surveillance for his activism.</p>

          <p>Ethan Mbappe, the 18-year-old brother of global football superstar Kylian Mbappe, is beginning to forge his own career after moving from Paris St-Germain to Lille. As a midfielder, he is not expected to match his brother's goal-scoring prowess but is highly regarded for his football intelligence and calm demeanor under the pressure of his famous surname. After making his professional debut for PSG at 16, he left the club last summer when his contract was not renewed, a situation his brother Kylian suggested was linked to his own departure for Real Madrid. Now, Ethan is focused on making his own name in the sport.</p>

However, the club's journey has been a gradual build rather than a rapid spending spree, constrained by the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules. While on-field success and off-field revenue have grown, the club still faces challenges in competing financially with established giants and continues to draw criticism from human rights groups like Amnesty International over its ownership, who argue the takeover is a form of "sportswashing" for Saudi Arabia's human rights record.</p>

The judge stated that while there have been inexcusable incidents during protests, they do not constitute a level of chaos that state and local law enforcement cannot handle, and that the president's move risked blurring the line between civil and military authority.</p>

          <p>A market preview for the upcoming week highlights a significant disconnect between ongoing political instability, such as the U.S. government shutdown, and the persistent bullish sentiment in global equity markets. Despite worries about the shutdown's economic impact, major indexes have reached record highs, with massive fund flows into stocks, particularly in the technology sector. However, this optimism is countered by a growing chorus of analysts warning of market bubbles, especially in credit markets, which could lead to a major correction. The article also notes the economic impact of cultural phenomena, dubbed "Swiftonomics." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers demonstrated their postseason resilience by overcoming an early three-run deficit to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-3 in Game 1 of the National League Division Series. After falling behind in a hostile road environment, the Dodgers' pitching, led by starter Shohei Ohtani, settled down to shut out the Phillies for the final seven innings. The comeback was sealed in the seventh inning when Teoscar Hernández hit a go-ahead three-run home run, silencing the previously raucous Philadelphia crowd. The victory gives the Dodgers a crucial 1-0 lead in the best-of-five series.</p>
