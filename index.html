        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Koyo Kouoh, a prominent figure in the global art world and the slated curator of the 2026 Venice Biennale, has died at age 57 in Switzerland, just before announcing the event's theme. As the executive director of Zeitz MOCAA, she championed artists of color from Africa and beyond, revitalizing the museum and changing its relationship with the local community. Kouoh curated acclaimed shows, including a Tracey Rose retrospective and 'When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting,' and she was known for her sophisticated curatorial approach that blended aesthetic, art historical, painterly, and political elements. Kouoh's career was marked by a commitment to bringing African artists to the forefront, and her passing leaves a significant void in the contemporary art landscape.</p>

A search operation was launched after a report by a member of the public, and the 16-year-old was rescued but later died in the hospital. The body of the 18-year-old was recovered from the water on Saturday evening, while a third teenage boy managed to make it back to shore and was hospitalized.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Li-Young Lee's poem 'Infant Longing' delves into profound themes of loss, innocence, and the cyclical nature of the world, reflecting on the speaker's mother and the act of kissing as a means of sealing and opening, closing and revealing. The poem intertwines personal grief with broader existential questions, such as the persistence of violence and the search for solace. The speaker finds comfort in the memory of his mother's love and nourishment amidst suffering, and the act of kissing becomes a symbolic gesture that transcends time and connects the speaker to an infinite longing.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. The new rules will require care firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas for overseas workers already in the country, aiming to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled workers coming to the UK over the next year. The government will also increase the threshold for skilled visas to graduate level and introduce stricter requirements for training commitments to reintegrate unemployed individuals into the UK labor market, and the government plans to introduce a fair pay agreement for care workers.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for two days of negotiations aimed at easing trade tensions stemming from tariffs imposed by both countries. The talks, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng, have significant implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by the tariffs. While Mr. Trump hailed the initial conversations as a success, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick deal, with concerns that the trade dispute will slow global growth and fuel inflation. The United States has accused China of unfair trade practices, while China has insisted it will not make concessions in response to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has launched an unprecedented smear campaign against Ukraine, urging citizens to vote against its EU accession. The campaign, filled with propaganda and racist undertones, portrays Ukraine as a hub for drug trafficking and organized crime. This move is seen as an attempt to discredit opposition leader Peter Magyar, whose popularity threatens Orban's power. Orban's anti-Ukrainian stance also aligns with his pro-Russian sentiments and nostalgic revisionist views, while deflecting from the corruption within his own government.</p>

          <p>A pitch invasion at Hamburg's Volksparkstadion on Saturday, following Hamburg's promotion to the Bundesliga, resulted in 44 injuries, including one life-threatening injury. Thousands of fans rushed the field after Hamburg's 6-1 victory over Ulm, leading to chaotic scenes and the deployment of approximately 65 emergency personnel from the Hamburg rescue service and fire brigade. Victory for Hamburg earned them promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time since suffering relegation in 2017-18, and they could be crowned champions if they match or better Cologne's result on the final day.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump and his Republican colleagues frequently criticize the US media, accusing them of fake news and bias. However, there are instances where news organizations have seemingly yielded to Trump's influence, with billionaire owners potentially compromising journalistic independence to remain in his favor. Despite this, Trump has continued to attack journalists and threaten investigations into media outlets. Examples include Jeff Bezos allegedly ordering an overhaul to the Washington Post's editorial pages and the Los Angeles Times dropping its endorsement of Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>Faced with the challenges of parenthood and a lack of structural support for families in America, some parents are choosing to build family life around friends, creating a village of their own for support. This involves co-housing, living near friends, or sharing homes to create extended family-like networks. These arrangements offer benefits such as shared child care, emotional support, and deeper friendships, but also come with challenges like differing parenting styles and a need for clear communication and coordination.

This behavior is deeply rooted in American identity, stemming from a historical emphasis on self-sufficiency and frontier survival. The article discusses how this trend has been fueled by extreme weather events and a perceived inadequacy of government response, leading individuals to take responsibility for their own safety through consumption choices. The ultra-wealthy's elaborate preparation plans, such as building private islands and bunkers, are also examined as a form of conspicuous consumption.</p>

          <p>South Korea's upcoming presidential election features Lee Jae-myung, a former sweatshop worker, against Kim Moon-soo, a former political prisoner, representing opposite sides of a deeply divided nation. The election follows the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol over his attempt to impose martial law, turning the campaign into a referendum on Yoon and his right-wing party. Lee, leading in pre-election surveys, promises to end the 'old era of insurrection,' while Kim warns of a left-wing behemoth if Lee wins. Both candidates faced last-minute hurdles to run, adding to the uncertainty surrounding South Korean politics.</p>

          <p>Following a US-mediated ceasefire between India and Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir region, diplomats from both countries expressed cautious optimism, acknowledging that it will take more than a ceasefire to address the long-term distrust. While the US mediation provided a useful off-ramp, analysts from both sides believe the ceasefire won't easily lead to an enduring peace. Experts highlight that the US, Saudi Arabia, and Iran played key mediating roles due to their strong ties with both nations. Issues such as terrorism and water security pose long-term challenges to sustainable peace.</p>

          <p>A proposal to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities on Fort Lauderdale's historic beachfront has ignited controversy, with some residents suggesting underlying racial motives. The basketball courts, built shortly after the end of segregation, are popular among a diverse community, while the new development is feared to exclude lower-income, minority residents. The developers insist the decision was based on pickleball's broader appeal, while critics accuse the city of trying to 'whiten' the beach and displace a long-standing community tradition.</p>
