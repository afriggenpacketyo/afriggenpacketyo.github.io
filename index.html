        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial markets in the Asia-Pacific region largely saw positive movement, influenced by gains on Wall Street. China's central bank decided to keep its one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision to hold rates steady at 3.0% and 3.5% respectively comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented a rate cut. The stability in China's rates provided a degree of certainty for investors, though Hong Kong's Hang Seng index experienced a slight decline.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old is in a life-threatening condition after being shot in the early hours of Sunday morning near London's Wembley Stadium. Metropolitan Police were called to the scene on Atlantic Crescent and discovered the victim with a gunshot wound, who was then transported to a major trauma center. Authorities have informed the teenager's family and are providing support, but no arrests have been made as the investigation is in its preliminary stages. An increased police presence is now in the area as they appeal to the public for any information regarding the incident.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk were seen meeting and shaking hands at a memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, signaling a potential reconciliation after a public falling out. The two, who previously collaborated on a government efficiency initiative, had a severe disagreement over a tax bill, leading to a feud on social media. Their meeting in Arizona, documented and shared by the White House on Musk's platform X, has fueled speculation about their renewed alliance. Musk had been a significant donor to Trump's campaign before their acrimonious split.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Democratic-leaning audiences are turning away from established media corporations, feeling that these outlets have become too accommodating to the Trump administration. This disillusionment has fueled the rise of independent, left-of-center digital platforms like The Bulwark and Crooked Media, which have seen significant growth in subscribers and engagement. The trend is also benefiting platforms like Substack, where many journalists and political figures have migrated after leaving legacy institutions. This shift reflects a broader frustration and is leading to a realignment in how political news and commentary are consumed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy, in a joint operation with Dominican authorities, destroyed a speedboat carrying an estimated 1,000 kilograms of cocaine off the coast of the Dominican Republic. Officials from the Dominican Republic's drug control agency confirmed they recovered 377 packages of the drug from the vessel, which was targeted by an aerial military strike about 80 nautical miles south of Isla Beata. This operation is described as the first of its kind against "narco-terrorism" in the Caribbean, part of a broader U.S. mission to combat drug trafficking in the region.

          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one death and two injuries during a wedding event. Authorities arrested a 23-year-old former employee, Hunter Nadeau, and charged him with second-degree murder for the death of 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare. One of the wounded was a wedding host shot in the face, who is in critical but stable condition, while the other was a restaurant patron. Witnesses reported that a patron hit the gunman with a chair, potentially preventing further tragedy before the suspect fled and was apprehended by police shortly after.</p>

The incident, which police classified as a drive-by shooting, occurred on Friday afternoon and resulted in at least three bullets striking the building's windows, though no injuries were reported. The suspect, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, was initially arrested by local police and released on bail before being taken back into custody by federal authorities on charges of interfering with a radio communications station. The motive remains under investigation, and the event has been condemned by public officials as an attack on democracy.</p>

          <p>Farmers across the United Kingdom are grappling with a significant shortage of hay and grass following the country's hottest and driest spring and summer on record. The extreme weather has led to diminished yields, with some producers reporting being down by as much as 60%, creating what is being called a "nationwide problem." This shortage impacts livestock producers who rely on local hay for animal feed, forcing them to source more expensive supplies from elsewhere. Experts warn that unless global heat-trapping pollution is curbed, such agricultural challenges and resulting price increases are likely to become more common.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance took a central role following the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, positioning himself as a leader for Kirk's young, religious followers with an eye toward a potential 2028 presidential run. At Kirk's memorial, Vance emphasized his Christian faith, a move seen as an effort to connect with the evangelical base that will be crucial in a post-Trump Republican party. His actions, including personally escorting Kirk's casket and guest-hosting his podcast, are interpreted as part of a "soft launch" for a future campaign. This strategy combines Trump's populism with a focus on cultural warfare, aiming to consolidate his position as the frontrunner for the next Republican nomination.</p>

          <p>A child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that exceptional social skills are cultivated through early, consistent parental modeling rather than memorized pleasantries. Key practices include openly discussing feelings to build emotional vocabulary, demonstrating empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Parents are also advised to teach conflict resolution, validate their child's feelings, and help them recognize social cues. By creating an environment of emotional safety and connection, parents can equip their children with the tools for healthy, real-world relationships.</p>

By introducing an antibody gene into the mice, they can create a heritable immunity that is passed down through generations, breaking the infection cycle where ticks feed on mice.

          <p>An investment of $10,000 in Nvidia stock five years ago would be worth over $145,000 today, representing a total return of 1,350%. This performance has significantly outpaced major market indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. The company's massive growth is attributed to its dominant position in supplying essential chips and software for the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence sector. While the company's valuation is high, with a price-to-earnings ratio nearly double that of the S&P 500, continued high expectations are fueled by projections of soaring AI-related spending in the coming years.

          <p>Apple has taken full control of the core chips in its new iPhone lineup, introducing the A19 Pro processor, N1 wireless chip, and C1X modem to prioritize on-device artificial intelligence. The A19 Pro features a new architecture with neural accelerators on each GPU core, significantly increasing its machine learning compute power for AI workloads. This move allows Apple to enhance features, improve power efficiency, and maintain user privacy by processing more data directly on the device rather than in the cloud. The company's strategy aims to make the iPhone the premier platform for developers to run their AI applications seamlessly and efficiently.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to expedite investigations and prosecute his political adversaries, including former FBI Director James Comey and Senator Adam Schiff. In a social media post, Trump expressed frustration that "nothing is being done," a statement that drew sharp criticism from Democrats who warned it was a step toward authoritarianism. The call for action tests the long-standing norm of the Justice Department's independence from the White House. This move follows the recent departure of a federal prosecutor who reportedly concluded there was insufficient evidence to prosecute one of Trump's targets, New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p>

Their story highlights a devastating and widespread hunger crisis that the UN warns is placing over three million children in peril. A sharp decline in international aid, severe drought, and the forced return of Afghans from neighboring countries have compounded the emergency. With humanitarian funding set to run out, organizations like the World Food Programme are already being forced to turn away malnourished women and children, raising fears of a catastrophic winter ahead.</p>

The Philippines, which also claims the shoal and refers to it as Bajo de Masinloc, has condemned the potential move as "illegitimate and unlawful," asserting that the feature lies within its exclusive economic zone.

The sale is mandated by a U.S. law requiring the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its American arm due to national security concerns over user data.
