          <p>Erin has officially strengthened into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasters anticipating it could become a major hurricane. The storm is currently on a path over the Atlantic Ocean, prompting the National Hurricane Center to issue warnings for the Caribbean islands regarding heavy rainfall and life-threatening surf conditions. While current forecast models show the storm curving northward and remaining offshore from the U.S. East Coast, meteorologists are monitoring its development closely as the hurricane season approaches its peak period.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods and landslides triggered by intense monsoon rains have resulted in the deaths of more than 250 people across northern India and Pakistan. In Pakistan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has been hit hardest, with authorities reporting at least 199 fatalities and the evacuation of over a thousand stranded tourists. The crisis was compounded by the crash of a rescue helicopter in Pakistan, which killed five crew members. Experts suggest that climate change is exacerbating the intensity of these seasonal weather events, leading to more frequent and destructive cloudbursts in the region.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes meeting in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump stated he would be prepared to walk away from the summit if it does not proceed well. Speaking to Fox News, Trump expressed confidence about the meeting but emphasized his willingness to end the talks abruptly if they are not productive. The summit is being closely watched, particularly regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy monitoring developments from Kyiv. Historical context is also noted, as Alaska has previously served as a significant location for U.S. diplomatic engagements.</p>

          <p>Salford's Super League game against Wakefield, scheduled for Sunday, has been cancelled following discussions with the Rugby Football League over significant welfare concerns for the players. The decision comes after the financially troubled club suffered a heavy 80-6 defeat where they had to field five debutants. Due to an exodus of senior professionals, the team has been relying heavily on loanees. The club stated that of the 17 players available for the upcoming match, only two had played at the Super League level in the past year, prompting the reluctant cancellation.</p>

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group experienced their best day since 2008, soaring over 14% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new $1.6 billion stake in the company. The health insurer's stock had been down nearly 50% for the year amid a Justice Department investigation and a weakened financial outlook. The investment from such a prominent figure, along with new stakes from investors Michael Burry and David Tepper, has been interpreted as a major vote of confidence. Analysts suggest this move could establish a near-term trading floor for the managed care sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's executive chairman, Richard Walker, stated that this is not a victimless crime and that reducing theft could help lower prices for all customers. The announcement comes as police-recorded shoplifting offenses in England and Wales have reached their highest level in over two decades.</p>

          <p>Just days before a scheduled summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, Russian forces have made tactical gains in Ukraine's Donetsk region, breaching defensive lines. While not yet a strategic breakthrough, the advance creates a dangerous situation for Ukraine and provides Moscow with battlefield momentum heading into the high-stakes negotiations. President Trump acknowledged the offensive, suggesting Putin believes it strengthens his negotiating position, though Trump stated it actually hurts him. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia is creating an information backdrop to suggest Ukraine is losing ground ahead of the talks.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has officially signed 18-year-old Italian defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma in a deal worth £26 million plus add-ons. The highly-rated Italy Under-19 international has signed a long-term contract with the club that runs until 2031. Leoni, who began his career at Padova, attracted interest from major Italian clubs after an impressive debut season in Serie A. The signing provides Liverpool with needed reinforcement in their central defense following the recent sale of Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen, with the transfer now pending international clearance and a work permit.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's injunction that placed restrictions on its immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles. The order from a federal judge prohibits law enforcement from stopping or detaining individuals based solely on factors like their race, their use of the Spanish language, or their presence at day laborer sites. While the government can still consider these factors in combination with other evidence, the injunction has reportedly led to a drastic reduction in immigration arrests. The case, Noem v.

The author asserts that for too long, the U.S. has viewed the group with naivete, ignoring its role as the ideological source of modern Sunni Islamism and its direct links to groups like Hamas. The piece contends that failing to label these groups appropriately allows them to operate under the guise of political or charitable outreach while promoting extremism.

The governor's move, which included social media posts mocking President Trump, is seen by the GOP as a partisan power grab designed to undermine the state's independent Citizens Redistricting Commission. Republican lawmakers argue the plan lacks public input and erodes trust in government, accusing Newsom of prioritizing national headlines and his presidential ambitions over the will of California voters. The project could further diminish the already limited Republican representation in the state's congressional delegation.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can move forward with its plan to lay off over 1,400 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit vacates a lower court's injunction that had blocked the reduction in force, which would leave the agency with only about 200 staff members. The administration has stated its goal is a more streamlined bureau, but consumer advocates and the employees' union argue the cuts would render the CFPB unable to perform its congressionally mandated duties. The ruling is a significant development in the administration's efforts to reshape the agency created after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NCAA has imposed one of the largest financial penalties in its history on the University of Michigan for an illegal sign-stealing scheme, but the football team will not be banned from the playoffs. The university must forfeit over $20 million in postseason revenue and faces other sanctions, including scholarship reductions and recruiting restrictions. The investigation found that a former staffer orchestrated a vast in-person scouting operation to film and decode opponents' signals. While the panel classified the violations as severe, it opted for financial penalties to avoid punishing current players for the actions of former staff and coaches.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 11:40:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author Jason Okundaye explains his decision to withdraw his book from the Polari first book prize longlist in an opinion piece. The move was a protest against the nomination of author John Boyne, who had recently written an article celebrating J.K. Rowling and using controversial language regarding transgender issues. Okundaye states that the prize's defense of Boyne's inclusion, citing a commitment to diverse viewpoints, contradicted its stated values of supporting the entire LGBTQ+ community. He joins at least 16 other authors who have withdrawn, arguing that the issue is not about differing opinions but about an institution accurately representing its principles.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, who is serving four life sentences for the murder of four University of Idaho students, is reportedly being relentlessly taunted by other inmates at a maximum-security prison. Sources indicate that prisoners have been yelling at him through air vents around the clock, affecting his ability to sleep. Kohberger is housed in a restrictive unit for his own safety, confined to his cell for 23 hours a day. The Idaho Department of Correction has acknowledged Kohberger's complaints and confirmed that inmates communicate with each other, but maintains that a safe environment is being provided for everyone in custody.</p>

          <p>Stock market activity on Friday showed a continued rotation into the health-care sector, which received a significant boost from shares of UnitedHealth.

Consumers expressed growing concerns about future inflation and unemployment, though they also seemed to have dismissed worst-case scenarios regarding tariffs. Meanwhile, July retail sales figures met expectations, providing a mixed but stable picture of the U.S. consumer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.21 trillion, many households are struggling with their monthly payments. For a typical $3,000 balance, the minimum payment can range from $60 to $85, depending on the issuer's calculation method, which often involves a percentage of the balance plus interest and fees. Merely paying the minimum is a costly strategy that can trap consumers in debt for years due to compounding interest. The article outlines several strategies to escape this cycle, including balance transfers, debt consolidation loans, and negotiating with issuers through credit counseling or hardship programs.

          <p>Amid humanitarian crises in places like Sudan and Gaza, calls are intensifying to prosecute the deliberate starvation of civilians as a war crime. Although international law, including the Geneva Conventions and the Rome Statute, categorizes this as a crime, it has never been prosecuted as a standalone offense in an international court. A key legal hurdle is proving a perpetrator's intent to starve a population. However, experts note that the legal and political landscape is shifting, with recent UN resolutions and ICC warrants signaling a growing willingness to hold leaders accountable for using hunger as a weapon of war.</p>

The news caused Intel's stock to climb over 4%, on track for its best week in decades.

ABF stated that combining the two currently loss-making businesses would allow for significant cost-cutting and create a more competitive and profitable entity.
