            <h2>Chinese Exporters Resort to Abandoning Shipments Amid Tariff Hikes</h2>

            <p>Facing escalating tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, some Chinese exporters are reportedly abandoning shipments mid-voyage to avoid the crushing costs. This drastic measure, dubbed "preparing for the Long March," reflects a grim outlook on cross-Pacific trade. One export company witnessed its US-bound container volume plummet due to tariffs exceeding 100%, leading to halted shipping plans and scrapped orders. This situation highlights the severe impact of trade tensions on businesses and the lengths to which they are willing to go to mitigate losses. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Karen Read, accused of murdering her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, has requested an emergency stay of her trial from Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Read's lawyers argue that a retrial on murder and fleeing the scene charges would constitute double jeopardy, as jurors in the first trial allegedly unanimously found her not guilty on those charges but could not reach a verdict on manslaughter. The request comes as jury selection for the second trial is underway. The defense contends that a "unanimous but unannounced" decision should trigger Fifth Amendment protections, and seeks a post-trial hearing on the matter.</p>

This financing aims to make American companies more competitive against Chinese and Russian firms, as the US Exim Bank was reportedly told that China and Russia were initially slated to finance the deal.

            <p>President Trump's latest tariffs on goods from numerous countries have taken effect, imposing additional taxes ranging from 20% to 104% on Chinese products. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, typically a percentage of the product's value, paid by companies bringing the goods into the country, who may then pass the costs onto consumers. Trump argues tariffs will boost the US economy by encouraging consumers to buy American-made goods, but economists warn of potential harm to the global economy and rising prices for consumers. The tariffs aim to reduce the trade deficit and address what Trump sees as unfair trade practices.</p>

            <p>China has declared it will “strike back and fight to the very end” in response to new US tariffs on Chinese goods, reinforcing its commitment to defend its interests amid an escalating trade war. While remaining open to discussions with President Trump, China asserts it will not negotiate under US pressure. The country's state broadcaster emphasized that China's countermeasures are a response to US actions and are reasonable and legitimate. Since President Trump's return to the White House, Washington has increased tariffs on Chinese goods by a cumulative 104 per cent.</p>

This comes amid growing worries about children's exposure to misogynistic and violent online content. Some schools are implementing measures to combat derogatory language and safeguard students from harmful online ideologies.
