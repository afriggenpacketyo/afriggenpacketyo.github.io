          <p>All 50 states, Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories have agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, resolving litigation over the opioid crisis. The settlement ends the Sacklers' ownership of Purdue and prohibits them from producing or marketing opioids in the U.S. The agreement, led by a coalition of states, aims to provide funds for prevention, treatment, and recovery programs. Pennsylvania's Attorney General emphasized the importance of directing funds to communities affected by the addiction crisis.</p>

          <p>A review into abuse by grooming gangs in England and Wales reveals critical flaws in data collection, making it impossible to assess the true scale of the issue. The report emphasizes the lack of reliable ethnicity data for perpetrators, with two-thirds of cases failing to record this information. Prime Minister Starmer has accepted the report's recommendation for a full national inquiry into child sexual exploitation. The report also suggests tightening laws to ensure adults who have sex with a child under 16 are always charged with sexual assault.</p>

          <p>This article explores the evolving market for online sales of obesity drug alternatives, particularly compounded versions of drugs like tirzepatide and semaglutide. The FDA's decision that brand-name drugmakers can meet demand has ended the large-scale compounding era, prompting telehealth companies to adapt. Some companies are personalizing compounded drugs by adding supplements, testing the FDA's rules against making "essentially a copy" of available medications. Concerns remain about the safety and regulation of imported active ingredients used in compounding, as well as the ethics of marketing these drugs on social media.</p>

          <p>The Women's Super League (WSL) is set to expand from 12 to 14 teams starting in the 2026-27 season. The proposal was presented at a shareholders' meeting by WSL Football, the company now in control of the top two tiers of women's football. To facilitate the expansion, changes will be made to the promotion and relegation process, including a play-off between the second-bottom WSL team and the runners-up in WSL 2.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is likely to hold interest rates steady this week, which has various implications for consumer finances. Credit card rates, already near all-time highs, may continue to edge higher as banks protect themselves from risk. Mortgage rates are expected to remain relatively stable, keeping housing affordability a challenge. Auto loan rates, while fixed, are impacted by rising car prices, and student loan rates are mostly shielded from Fed moves. Consumers are advised to explore options like balance transfers and refinancing to manage debt effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 20 Palestinians were reportedly killed by Israeli fire near aid distribution sites in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The UN human rights chief criticized Israel's warfare tactics and accused them of weaponizing food, calling for a full investigation into the attacks. The IDF stated they are examining the reports. The incident occurred near sites operated by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, with UN agencies refusing to collaborate with the GHF.</p>

          <h2>Ethical Debate Arises in Georgia Over Brain-Dead Pregnant Woman on Life Support</h2>

          <p>The case of Adriana Smith, a brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia, has sparked a debate between pro-choice and pro-life factions regarding medical decision-making for incapacitated individuals. Smith's family was not consulted about the decision to keep her on life support to gestate her unborn child, raising questions about whose choice matters. The situation highlights the complexity of balancing maternal interests with fetal viability and the legal implications of Georgia's abortion ban. The core issue is not abortion itself, but who has the right to make decisions for a person deemed legally dead.</p>
