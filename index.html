          <p>An American Airlines flight at Denver International Airport was evacuated after a "possible landing gear incident" during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely removed from the Boeing 737 MAX 8. The airline confirmed a maintenance issue with a tire, and the FAA is investigating the event, which caused a temporary ground stop and dozens of flight delays. One person was transported for a minor injury, while several others were evaluated at the scene but did not require further medical attention.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary, marking the occasion with an event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of two new commemorative stamps. One stamp honors Benjamin Franklin, the first postmaster general, while the other celebrates postal workers. Founded on July 26, 1775, the postal service has been a crucial part of American history. The celebration comes amid discussions about the agency's future, though the new postmaster general has affirmed his commitment to keeping it a public service.</p>

          <p>Following the passing of Ozzy Osbourne, this article reflects on his unexpected second wave of fame as a reality TV star in the early 2000s. The MTV show "The Osbournes" pioneered the "reality sitcom" format, showcasing the mundane yet chaotic home life of the heavy metal legend and his family. Before the Kardashians, the show's blend of celebrity life and relatable family dynamics captivated millions and won an Emmy. Producers and critics note how the series established many reality TV tropes and paved the way for a new genre of celebrity-focused programming.</p>

          <p>With the Euro 2025 final approaching, this article explores the science behind the intense anxiety and physical reactions fans experience during high-stakes matches. Experts explain that hormones like adrenaline and cortisol surge, causing a "fight or flight" response that can raise heart rates and affect sleep and behavior. Psychologists advise fans to manage these effects by getting adequate rest, eating well, and engaging in physical movement to release energy. Ultimately, they suggest reframing the nervous jitters as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for emotional expression.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures remaining below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the 60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface and cools the air. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather as a reprieve from heatwaves elsewhere, the persistent gray, drizzly conditions are a notable departure from typical summer patterns. Experts caution that hotter weather could still arrive later in the season.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's broad use of tariffs is facing significant legal challenges in federal court, with arguments questioning the president's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A key case is set to be heard, which could impact numerous trade deals and tariffs imposed on countries like Canada, Mexico, and China. A lower court previously ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, though that decision was paused pending appeal. Legal experts and policy analysts suggest that if the courts ultimately rule against the administration, it could invalidate many of the trade developments of the past year.

          <p>England's hopes for victory against India in the fourth Test are tempered by uncertainty over captain Ben Stokes's fitness. After taking five wickets in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl on the fourth day, with assistant coach Marcus Trescothick citing stiffness and soreness. Stokes, who has a history of injuries and had to retire hurt while batting on day three, appeared weary in the field. His absence from the bowling attack is a significant concern for England as they push for a win on the final day at Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its release, the beloved film "Bend It Like Beckham" is set to get a sequel, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the current prominence of women's football make it the right time to revisit the characters. The original 2002 film, starring Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, is credited with inspiring a generation of female players. The director is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and hopes to reunite the original cast.</p>

          <p>A Reddit post from a self-described former MAGA voter has gained widespread attention for outlining five key reasons they plan to vote for Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections. The user cited Donald Trump's handling of the Epstein files, his tariff policies, and his immigration plans as major factors in their decision to abandon him. The voter explained their initial support for Trump was based on assumptions that he would de-escalate global conflicts and improve certain domestic policies. The post has sparked extensive online discussion, with many commenters expressing surprise at the user's initial reasoning.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has addressed its long-standing need for a top striker by signing Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting in a major summer transfer. The Swedish international arrives with a formidable reputation, having scored 97 goals in 102 appearances for the Portuguese club. After three consecutive second-place finishes in the Premier League, Arsenal hopes Gyokeres's goalscoring prowess can help them secure a major trophy. While he has been prolific in Portugal, the key question is whether the 27-year-old can replicate that success in the more competitive English Premier League.</p>

One victim, Mary Sheikh al-Eid, was a widow trying to get food for her seven children.
