        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has been deemed fit to resume batting on the second day of the third Test against India after an injury scare. Stokes experienced a right groin issue on the first day but was able to bowl before play resumed, signaling his readiness to continue his innings. The all-rounder's fitness is crucial for England, especially given his recent return from hamstring surgery and his history of pushing his physical limits. Vice-captain Ollie Pope emphasized the importance of managing Stokes' condition to prevent further injury during the remainder of the series.</p>

          <p>Germany's Bundestag is appointing three new judges to the Federal Constitutional Court, a process marked by political maneuvering. The conservative bloc's candidate may require votes from the far-right AfD to secure the necessary two-thirds majority, as voting is conducted by secret ballot. Concurrently, the upper house, or Bundesrat, is voting on a significant corporate tax cut package aimed at stimulating investment by reducing the rate from 15% to 10% by 2032. These legislative actions occur as German officials debate the possibility of banning the AfD, with the Interior Minister opposing the idea.</p>

          <p>As the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) celebrates its tenth anniversary, it navigates a complex geopolitical landscape, particularly concerning challenges from the United States. Initially established with a focus on Asian infrastructure rather than poverty reduction, the China-led bank has expanded its membership from 57 to 110 economies. Despite initial skepticism from the West, the AIIB has positioned itself as a key player in global development finance. The institution's leadership emphasizes its goal is to improve international practices and demonstrate that China can be a constructive force for global prosperity.</p>

          <p>The UK government has paused plans to alter the tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) following significant opposition from banks, building societies, and consumer advocates. Chancellor Rachel Reeves had considered reducing the £20,000 allowance for cash savings to encourage more investment in stocks and shares to boost the economy. However, due to the backlash and concerns it would penalize savers, the reform is now on hold, though not entirely ruled out for the future. The Treasury stated its ambition remains to ensure savings deliver better returns and drive UK investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As a regional hosepipe ban affects millions in Yorkshire, residents are voicing frustration over numerous, ongoing water leaks that waste vast quantities of water. Yorkshire Water, which has imposed the ban due to reservoir levels being at 50%, loses about 260 million litres daily to leakage, above the national average. Residents have reported major leaks flowing for weeks without repair, creating a stark contrast with the restrictions placed on households. The ban, the UK's first of the year, prohibits using hosepipes for activities like watering gardens or washing cars, with potential fines of up to £1,000.</p>

This article explores the paradox of global sports organizations finally gaining a major foothold in the lucrative US market, only to face an administration that is often openly contemptuous of international cooperation. President Trump's policies, such as travel bans and tariffs on co-hosting nations, create logistical and political challenges for these events.

This contrasts sharply with markets like Germany, where sales fell 60%.

          <p>Tensions flared in Ventura County, California, as protesters clashed with U.S. Border Patrol agents who were executing a warrant at a marijuana facility. Federal agents deployed what appeared to be tear gas and less-than-lethal rounds to disperse the crowd. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed its agents were serving a warrant, while California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the raid as inhumane. In a pointed response, a CBP official stated that ten undocumented juveniles were found at the facility, which is now under investigation for potential child labor violations, highlighting the complex intersection of immigration, labor, and law enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The past week has seen a significant escalation in global trade tensions, as the Trump administration issued letters to over 20 governments threatening new tariffs if trade deals are not reached by August 1. Major economies like Japan and South Korea were informed they face tariffs of at least 25%, while a 35% tariff was announced for Canada. The administration also threatened steep levies on developing nations and specific sectors like pharmaceuticals and copper. Despite the widespread threats, the U.S. has only secured deals with the UK and Vietnam, leaving global markets in a state of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The global pharmaceutical industry is actively developing contingency plans in response to President Trump's proposal to impose a 200% tariff on foreign-made drugs. Analysts warn that such a high tariff would drastically inflate production costs, squeeze profit margins, and could lead to significant drug shortages and price hikes for U.S. consumers. While the administration has suggested a grace period of about a year and a half, industry experts believe this is insufficient time for companies to relocate complex manufacturing operations to the U.S. The uncertainty has left firms scrambling to plan for various outcomes.

          <p>This political analysis suggests that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are both battling a rising tide of populism by advocating for patience and pragmatic politics. Both leaders face pressure from anti-establishment parties, Reform UK and National Rally respectively, which offer simple solutions to complex problems like immigration. During a recent joint news conference, Starmer and Macron implicitly argued against these 'easy answers,' emphasizing the need to address nuanced realities. The article posits that their political futures may depend on whether they can deliver tangible results before voters turn to more radical alternatives.</p>

          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a renowned professor and a pioneer of IVF treatment, has resigned from the British Medical Association (BMA) in protest of planned strikes by resident doctors. He argued that the five-day walkout over pay, scheduled for late July, is ill-timed and could damage public trust in the medical profession. Lord Winston, a BMA member since 1964, emphasized the vulnerability of patients and urged doctors to consider their responsibilities more seriously. The BMA maintains that the strike is necessary as the government has refused to negotiate on pay restoration for doctors.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study by Princeton University researchers reveals that harassment and threats against local school officials in the U.S. have increased by 170% since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Researchers found that officials across the political spectrum have been targeted, often fueled by misinformation on social media. The study raises concerns that the hostile environment could drive dedicated public servants out of their roles and deter open discussion on controversial topics in schools.</p>
