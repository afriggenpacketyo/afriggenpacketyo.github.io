This market optimism follows Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's indication that the central bank might ease monetary policy next month.

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a lower-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest level since January 2021. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, driven by falling retail, electricity, and gas prices. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) projects inflation to remain moderate, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity price hikes. The central bank has already adjusted monetary policy twice this year to address weaker growth, as the trade-dependent economy faces a "downshift" in the global trade environment.

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized the Senate's "blue slip" tradition, calling it an unconstitutional practice that gives Democrats veto power over his judicial and U.S. Attorney nominees. Trump argued that this custom has effectively stripped him of his appointment power in states with a single Democratic senator. Despite appointing numerous federal judges in his first term, his current term has seen fewer confirmations, leading to his public demands for Senator Chuck Grassley to abandon the tradition. This article highlights the ongoing political battle over judicial appointments and executive power.</p>

          <h2>Labor Markets See Shift Towards 'Great Stay' Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:14:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global labor markets are experiencing significant shifts, moving from the "Great Resignation" to a "Great Stay" phenomenon, characterized by fewer employees leaving jobs and a "no-hire, no-fire" freeze by employers. Economists attribute this trend to economic insecurity, with firms hesitant to hire due to uncertainty about the future. Despite slowing hiring momentum, initial U.S. jobless claims remain historically low, as companies are reluctant to let go of workers they struggled to re-acquire post-pandemic. The U.K. is observing a similar cooling in its labor market, with declining vacancies and businesses seeking more confidence before increasing hiring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese electric carmaker Nio surged over 14% on Monday, extending a seven-session gain, following the unveiling of its latest ES8 SUV. The new model is priced significantly lower than Nio's premium offerings, making it one of the company's most affordable vehicles under a battery subscription plan. This strategic move aims to capture a broader customer base amid intense competition in China's EV sector. Nio has also launched two cheaper brands, Onvo and Firefly, to target mass market and young urban buyers, signaling a shift in its market strategy. (not investment advice)</p>
