          <p>President Trump's new presidential proclamation, effective June 9, restricts entry to the U.S. for nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, citing national security concerns. The proclamation also imposes partial restrictions, including stricter visa checks, on individuals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Exemptions include green card holders, dual nationals with U.S. passports, athletes, diplomats, and close relatives of U.S. citizens. Critics argue the ban is discriminatory and economically damaging, while the administration claims it addresses security risks and visa overstays.</p>

          <p>The FBI is seeking a suspect who allegedly assaulted a federal officer and damaged government property during anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles, offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to their identification, arrest, and conviction. The suspect allegedly threw rocks at law enforcement vehicles, injuring a federal officer. FBI Director Kash Patel warned that assaulting a law enforcement officer would result in jail time, regardless of background or cause. Amid the demonstrations, the Trump administration has deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles, a move denounced by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is seeking to rescind the deployment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures as stimulus measures fail to boost domestic consumption. The consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, while producer prices dropped 3.3%, the steepest decline since July 2023. Analysts attribute the weak demand to price wars in the automotive industry and falling property prices. Chinese policymakers are being urged to implement more forceful stimulus measures to bolster consumption, with potential monetary easing expected at the upcoming Lujiazui forum.

          <p>Almost 350,000 nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) already dismissing the offer as inadequate. The vote is considered crucial and could lead to a ballot for strike action. The government claims the pay rise will result in new starter nurses earning over Â£30,000 for the first time. The RCN argues that nursing has been placed at the back of the queue when it comes to pay, leading to a decade of pay erosion and increased numbers of nurses quitting the profession.</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced their sharpest decline in over five years, dropping by 34.5% in May, as trade tensions continue to impact economic activity. Overall exports rose 4.8%, but imports plunged 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. The drop in exports to the U.S. was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, the European Union, and Africa. China's total trade surplus increased 25% to $103.2 billion. The decline in exports reflects the impact of tariffs, despite a temporary trade truce between Beijing and Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung agreed to build stable bilateral ties and cooperate on addressing North Korea's challenges. Japan's top tariff negotiator is planning a U.S. trip for further trade talks amid ongoing tariff disputes imposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump. Four Japan Self-Defense Force members were slightly injured in an explosion near the U.S. Kadena Air Base in Okinawa. Japan is closely monitoring China's maritime activity after a Chinese aircraft carrier was spotted near Japan's easternmost island. Japan's economy contracted slightly in the first quarter, and the current account surplus rose in April.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on destructive bottom trawling, a fishing method that drags large nets along the seafloor, from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of UK offshore protected areas. This announcement comes as the UN Ocean Conference begins in France, amid warnings about the damage caused by bottom trawling to marine life and the seabed. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and the delicate seabed they rely upon. Pressure is also building for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty to protect 30% of the ocean.</p>

          <p>Top US and Chinese officials are meeting in London to further ease the trade war between the two largest economies, building on a preliminary agreement struck in Geneva. The talks, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, aim to build on a 90-day reduction in tariff rates. A phone conversation between President Trump and President Xi Jinping preceded the negotiations, with Trump claiming Xi agreed to resume shipments of rare earth minerals to the US. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt expressed hope for comprehensive trade talks, while a UK government spokesperson welcomed the discussions.</p>

          <p>China's export growth slowed to a three-month low in May, as shipments to the United States decreased following the imposition of tariffs by President Trump.

China exported $28.8 billion worth of goods to the US in May, down from $33 billion in April.
