          <p>Representative Jim Himes criticized the White House's rhetoric against Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, warning of severe market reactions if the president attempts to fire him illegally. Himes dismissed DNI Tulsi Gabbard's accusations of treason against former officials regarding the 2016 Russia investigation as a dangerous and baseless lie, predicting no charges would be filed. He also reflected on the Democratic Party's need for introspection following the last election, acknowledging the party must do better to appeal to a broader range of voters. The interview highlighted deep partisan divisions on economic policy and national security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This poem, titled "Your Horses" and written in homage to Ted Hughes, evokes a powerful and desolate landscape on the moors. The speaker describes a vision of ten silent, statue-like horses appearing in the morning light, entities that seem both ancient and otherworldly. The poem questions whether the person it addresses ever found such peace again amidst the chaos of city life and public acclaim. It ends on a note of longing, suggesting a perpetual search for that moment of serene connection with nature.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass described a climate of fear gripping the city due to the Trump administration's intensified immigration raids. She stated that the operations, sometimes conducted by masked agents in unmarked cars, have terrorized Latino communities, affecting businesses and daily life for both undocumented and legal residents. Bass criticized the deployment of federal troops as an unnecessary show of force that misuses taxpayer money. While acknowledging the administration's help during recent wildfires, she characterized its immigration policies as punitive and designed to create misery.</p>

The projected defeat for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its partner Komeito reflects public frustration over rising prices and potential U.S. tariffs. This loss would further weaken Ishiba's political standing, potentially leading to a leadership challenge within the LDP. Analysts note that a significant loss could destabilize the government during critical trade negotiations with the United States.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has shifted to a more combative and aggressive social media strategy in response to the Trump administration, abandoning the traditional high road approach. His office has begun using sharp, sometimes coarse language and memes to push back against critics, a tactic his advisors say is necessary to challenge bullies in a language they understand. This change in tone reportedly came after the president deployed federal troops to Los Angeles for immigration enforcement. While the strategy has boosted Newsom's online engagement, some analysts question whether it risks alienating voters who prefer more respectful political discourse.</p>

          <p>Russia reported that a large-scale Ukrainian drone attack forced the temporary closure of Moscow's major airports, leading to the cancellation or redirection of over 270 flights. The Russian defense ministry claimed to have downed more than 230 drones across the country, with 27 intercepted over the capital region alone. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials reported at least three civilian deaths from Russian air strikes overnight. The disruption to Russian air travel highlights the escalating nature of the conflict, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky proposed a new round of peace talks with Moscow.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection, which is the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. The article argues that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's feelings, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their inner voice, leading to anxiety and insecurity later in life. Cultivating self-connection through validating emotions and allowing autonomy helps build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. This skill is presented as a crucial foundation for a child's long-term mental and emotional well-being.</p>

The potential meeting could happen either before the summit, possibly with a visit by Trump to China, or on the sidelines of the event itself. This development follows recent high-level talks between the two nations' top diplomats, aimed at stabilizing relations. Since Trump's return to office, the U.S. and China have worked to de-escalate tensions, reaching a preliminary trade deal earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that traditional U.S. labor market metrics, such as job creation numbers and the unemployment rate, are becoming obsolete in the modern economy. With the rise of the gig economy, remote work, and the 'over-employed' holding multiple jobs, the article suggests that focusing on 'jobs' is no longer relevant. Instead, it proposes a shift to measuring income, suggesting a new key metric could be the percentage of the working-age population earning above a certain inflation-adjusted threshold. This approach would provide a more accurate picture of economic health in an era of diverse income streams. (not investment advice)</p>
