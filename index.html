        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail traders, primarily from WallStreetBets, have driven significant premarket surges in GoPro and Krispy Kreme shares, pushing them up by 63% and 33% respectively. This speculative activity aligns with a broader market rally, with the S&P 500 reaching new record highs. Analysts attribute this "junk rally" to factors like the passage of the OBBB bill, hopes for Fed rate cuts, strong economic data, and better-than-feared tariff news. The phenomenon highlights the continued influence of online forums on stock market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating interbank interest rates (Libor and Euribor) quashed by the UK Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. They were among 19 traders jailed globally in connection with the financial crisis-era scandal. The Supreme Court ruled their trials were unfair due to jury direction errors, vindicating their long-held claims that their actions were normal commercial practices. This decision may lead to other convicted traders seeking to overturn their sentences, marking a significant development in a major financial misconduct case.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative Mike Lawler announced he will seek reelection in his Hudson Valley House district in 2026, foregoing a challenge to incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul. Lawler stated his decision was for his family and district, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the narrow Republican House majority. His seat is a key target for Democrats, and his reelection is seen as crucial for the party's control. This decision comes after speculation and a previous endorsement from former President Trump for his House seat.</p>

          <p>Russian military planes were detected flying in the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on Tuesday, as confirmed by NORAD. While this is a regular occurrence and the planes did not enter U.S. or Canadian sovereign airspace, NORAD tracked them closely. The command reiterated its layered defense network for North American security, emphasizing its readiness to respond. This incident marks another in a series of similar sightings this year, highlighting ongoing geopolitical monitoring in the Arctic region.</p>

          <p>The article explores the potential negative repercussions if President Trump were to interfere with the Federal Reserve's independence to force lower interest rates. While Trump believes lower rates would boost the economy, experts warn that such political meddling could paradoxically raise real-world interest rates. This is because it could signal a loss of trust in the central bank's credibility, leading investors to demand higher returns for holding U.S. debt and potentially causing inflation to spiral, as seen in Turkey. The Fed's current stance is influenced by concerns over tariff-induced inflation, suggesting policy stability is paramount. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates currently offer higher returns than the inflation rate, making them an attractive option for saving money. Investors can lock in these high rates for the CD's term, and the accounts are generally FDIC or NCUA insured up to $250,000, ensuring safety. Online banks typically offer the most competitive CD rates, with short-term CDs (6-12 months) often yielding higher returns due to an inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs is suggested as a strategy to capitalize on these favorable short-term rates while planning for longer-term savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined that a small plane crash in Alaska, which killed Eugene Peltola Jr., husband of former U.S. Rep.

The report cited the plane being overweight for takeoff, the added drag and imbalance from moose antlers affixed to the wing strut, and turbulent flight conditions. Peltola, the sole occupant, died from his injuries in the remote location.
