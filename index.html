          <p>A mass shooting occurred outside a Chicago nightclub, leaving four people dead and fourteen others wounded. The incident took place when occupants of a dark vehicle opened fire on a crowd leaving an album release party for a local rapper. Police have confirmed there were multiple shooters involved, but no arrests have been made as the investigation continues. This event marks the second mass shooting at this same location, which previously operated under a different name before being shut down following a similar violent incident in 2022.</p>

          <p>In a court hearing for Bryan Kohberger, the lead prosecutor detailed the key evidence that led to his guilty plea in the 2022 quadruple murder of University of Idaho students. The evidence included cell phone data placing Kohberger near the crime scene multiple times, surveillance footage of his car, and crucial DNA from a knife sheath left at the scene. Investigators matched this DNA to Kohberger by secretly collecting a Q-tip from his family's trash, which linked him to the crime through his father's DNA. Despite the detailed summary, the motive for the murders remains unclear.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has enacted new safety measures, effective June 28, requiring all power banks carried by air travelers to have a mandatory safety and quality certification known as "3C." This certification ensures products meet specific national standards for safety, health, and environmental impact. Any power bank lacking the visible 3C mark is now considered substandard and will not be allowed on flights. To accommodate travelers, airports will provide designated areas for passengers to discard, store, or mail their non-compliant devices.</p>

          <p>As generative AI becomes increasingly integrated into white-collar jobs, widespread anxiety about job security is growing, with over half of U.S. employees expressing concern. Despite the technology's current limitations and need for human oversight, major companies like Microsoft and Amazon are reorganizing and reducing their workforces to pivot towards an AI-centric future. Experts suggest that while AI may augment rather than automate many roles for now, workers should proactively learn to use these tools to adapt to the evolving job market. The article recommends spending time experimenting with advanced AI models to develop new skills.</p>

          <p>A new grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew alleges that his wife, Suzanne Morphew, was drugged with a potent animal tranquilizer before her death. Forensic analysis of her remains, found in a shallow grave in 2023, suggests her body was moved at least twice after she was murdered on Mother's Day 2020. The indictment highlights that Barry Morphew was the only private citizen in the area with access to the specific tranquilizer compound found in her system. This marks the second time he has been charged with her murder after initial charges were dismissed.</p>

          <p>This article examines the prevalence of ultra-processed foods in the American diet, particularly highlighted during holidays like the Fourth of July. It notes a growing public concern over additives like Red Dye 40 and preservatives, many of which are banned or restricted in Europe but permitted in the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has prioritized improving the nation's food supply, securing voluntary commitments from manufacturers to remove some controversial ingredients. However, the article argues that the core issue is the overall American diet, which is high in sugar, saturated fats, and excessive calories.</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted an unmanned semi-submersible vessel, or "narco sub," equipped with a Starlink antenna for the first time off its Caribbean coast. Believed to be owned by the Gulf Clan cartel, the drone vessel was likely on a trial run as it was not carrying any drugs. This seizure highlights a significant evolution in drug trafficking methods, moving towards sophisticated, unmanned systems that are harder to detect and reduce risks for cartels. The use of drone vessels eliminates the need for a human crew, making it more difficult for authorities to trace the shipments back to their organizers.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin State Supreme Court issued a significant ruling, determining that a pre-Civil War law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. This decision preserves the legality of abortion access within the state. The ruling addresses the legal ambiguity that arose following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade. The 19th-century statute had been a point of contention, with its interpretation being critical to the future of reproductive rights in Wisconsin.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's efforts to strengthen their attacking lineup this summer have yet to yield a major signing, despite the club's clear intentions. The team is reportedly focused on acquiring a new center-forward, with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres as primary targets, though negotiations have been difficult. The club is also exploring options for creative midfielders, with interest in players like Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze, but financial constraints and player availability pose significant challenges. The outcome of the striker search will likely dictate the budget for reinforcing other attacking positions.</p>

          <p>A report has found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed by heavily redacted evidence from the city council. The redactions were so extensive that some pages contained only a few words, making it impossible for police to assess their value. The council cited complex data-sharing rules, but a new, more efficient protocol has since been established. The report noted that while police have improved, past failings—such as in the case of a 15-year-old who died after reporting she was sexually assaulted—have eroded trust.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump traveled to Iowa to commence celebrations for America's 250th anniversary and to promote his administration's agenda to heartland voters. During a campaign-style speech, he aimed to reassure farmers that his trade policies, which have created economic uncertainty, are ultimately beneficial for them. The visit also served to build support for his sweeping tax and spending bill ahead of a congressional deadline. The legislation has been a source of tension, with some Iowa farmers and Republican constituents expressing concerns over retaliatory tariffs and deep cuts to the Medicaid health program.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Samuel Moyn argues that President Trump's recent actions, including his domestic "big, beautiful bill" and foreign policy strikes on Iran, confirm his alignment with long-standing neoliberal and neoconservative principles. Despite his populist appeal suggesting a break from the political establishment, his policies have ultimately doubled down on market-protective economics and militaristic foreign intervention. The domestic bill is presented as a monument to neoliberalism, while his aggressive stance on Iran is seen as a revival of neoconservatism, representing continuity with the past rather than significant change.</p>

Kashanian arrived on a student visa in 1978 and was later granted a stay of removal, a condition her family says she always complied with.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gary Shteyngart's new novel, “Vera, or Faith,” is reviewed as a potent and cynical comedy seen through the eyes of its 10-year-old protagonist. The story follows Vera as she navigates her parents' eroding marriage and the rapid decay of American democracy in a near-future setting. The novel uses her child's perspective to highlight the emotional deflections of adults and the brutal simplicity of a world in crisis. The review praises Shteyngart for capturing the powerlessness of a child living with the consequences of adult decisions, both personal and political.</p>

          <p>John Fogerty, the frontman of Creedence Clearwater Revival, recently shared the stories behind some of the band's most iconic songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s. He revealed that "Proud Mary" was inspired by his euphoria after being discharged from the Army, while the protest anthem "Fortunate Son" was born from his anger about class privilege during the Vietnam War. Fogerty also discussed the painful origins of "Have You Ever Seen the Rain," which he wrote as he watched his beloved band disintegrate. After decades of legal battles, he has regained his publishing rights and is celebrating his legacy.</p>

          <p>South Korea is experiencing a significant and growing ideological divide between its young men and women, a trend reflected in recent election results. A large majority of men in their 20s and 30s now lean conservative, driven by a perception that they are the primary victims of gender discrimination and a backlash against feminism. Experts attribute this phenomenon to socioeconomic pressures, including a hypercompetitive job market and the collapse of traditional marriage dynamics. This political polarization is fueling anti-establishment sentiment among young men, who feel disenfranchised by the current system.</p>

Trump sued over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris, claiming deceptive editing.

The LAPD's role in providing crowd control at these scenes has drawn fire from critics who argue it appears to support ICE. In response, the LAPD has created new guidelines requiring supervisors to verify agents' identities, but maintains it has no authority to interfere.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on his wavering faith in the American road trip, an experience he feels has been diluted by digital detachment and corporate sameness. He describes a cross-country drive where the journey felt more like a series of planned sightseeing stops than a genuine exploration. However, his perspective is restored by an unexpected stay at a motel in Shamrock, Texas, run by a warm South Asian immigrant family. This encounter on the Fourth of July reminds him of the road's potential for genuine human connection and the complex, shared dreams that still define the country.</p>

          <p>BBC Verify examined three key claims regarding President Trump's major legislative bill, focusing on its financial impact, effect on Medicaid, and tax implications. Contrary to White House claims of reducing the deficit, independent analyses, including from the Congressional Budget Office, project the bill will add over $3 trillion to the national deficit over ten years. The bill is also expected to cut Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over the next decade, potentially causing nearly 12 million Americans to lose health insurance. The analysis shows the bill's economic boost would be significantly outweighed by its cost. (not investment advice)</p>

This comes as businesses navigate economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies and an approaching deadline for new trade deals. While the economy has remained resilient and inflation is relatively low, retailers have warned of potential price hikes due to the levies. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the data, with Chairman Jerome Powell signaling a potential interest rate cut to stimulate the economy if necessary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.K.'s financial markets experienced a brief panic after Chancellor Rachel Reeves was seen crying in the House of Commons during a heated debate. The emotional display sparked speculation about her potential resignation, causing U.K. bond yields to spike and the pound to fall. The market turmoil was calmed after a spokesperson attributed her distress to a personal matter and Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly reaffirmed his support. The incident occurred as Reeves faces intense pressure over the government's fiscal plans, having recently reversed welfare cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Government Layoffs May Impact Upcoming June Jobs Report</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 05:14:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The gradual cooling of the U.S. labor market is coinciding with a wave of layoffs in the federal government, which could become a noticeable factor in the upcoming June jobs report. Recommendations from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have led to over 280,000 federal positions being cut, with displaced workers now seeking employment. This influx of job seekers is happening as demand for white-collar roles, particularly in the tech sector, has weakened. Economists are watching to see how this combination of layoffs and slower private sector hiring will be reflected in national employment figures. (not investment advice)</p>
