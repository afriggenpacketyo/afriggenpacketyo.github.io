          <p>An auditor's report obtained by the BBC reveals a "pervasive fraud environment" at Unite, one of the UK's largest trade unions and a former major donor to the Labour party. The report cites an "impairment" of £53.8m related to the construction of a Birmingham hotel. Auditors BDO found "unusual relationships" between former senior staff and Unite's customers and suppliers, alongside a culture that did not challenge financial transactions or ensure proper reporting. Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, initiated the probe after being elected in 2021 and has vowed to recover the funds and prevent future occurrences.</p>

Balance transfer cards offer low or 0% introductory rates, while personal loans can have lower interest rates than credit cards.

          <p>WorldPride is scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C., amidst concerns about the political climate and the Trump administration's policies toward the LGBTQ+ community. While some express fear and reluctance to attend due to safety concerns, others see it as an opportunity to take a stand and make their voices heard. The event's location was decided before Trump's re-election, and organizers are implementing safety protocols similar to high-security events, ensuring a strong police presence and additional private security. Despite the federal government's stance, the District of Columbia is largely Democratic and supportive of LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

          <p>Used vehicle prices decreased slightly in May after reaching a recent high in April, as potential tariff fears drove consumer purchases. Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index decreased 1.5% from April to May but remains 4% higher than a year earlier. Retail prices traditionally follow wholesale price changes, but the adjustment has been slower in recent years. Strong demand and low inventory levels continue to support elevated prices in the used vehicle market.</p>
