        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the fourth Test against India, England demonstrated a commanding performance on the second day, driven by both strong bowling and aggressive batting. Captain Ben Stokes secured his first five-wicket haul in eight years, playing a crucial role in restricting India's first-innings total. Following this, openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett launched a blistering attack, forging a 166-run partnership at a rapid pace. This dominant display has placed England in a strong position, trailing by only 133 runs with eight wickets remaining, creating a solid foundation to potentially clinch the series.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently imprisoned for her role as an accomplice to Jeffrey Epstein, met with high-ranking Department of Justice official Todd Blanche. The meeting was reportedly intended for Blanche to question Maxwell about her knowledge of other individuals potentially involved in Epstein's sex trafficking ring. This development occurs as the Trump administration faces mounting pressure to release evidence from the Epstein files, with the House Oversight Committee planning to issue a subpoena for the documents. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence and is appealing her conviction to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged the significant impact of recent layoffs in a memo to employees, stating the job eliminations have been "weighing heavily" on him. The company has cut over 15,000 jobs in 2025, a move that has coincided with its stock price reaching new highs, reflecting a broader trend of workforce reductions across the tech industry. Nadella framed the challenging period as an opportunity to reimagine Microsoft's mission in the age of AI, shifting from a "software factory to an intelligence engine." The memo comes as some employees have expressed disillusionment with the company's decisions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve headquarters, intensifying his public criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The visit follows Trump's recent suggestion that Powell could be fired over cost overruns on a $2.5 billion renovation of Fed buildings, a project complicated by inflation and tariffs. For months, Trump has assailed Powell for not cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy and reduce government borrowing costs. This direct engagement threatens the central bank's long-standing political independence, a principle most economists and investors consider crucial for financial stability.

          <p>Representative Darrell Issa has introduced a congressional resolution to condemn violent attacks targeting federal immigration law enforcement, such as ICE and Border Patrol agents. The move comes in response to what he describes as a significant increase in assaults on agents, which he links to anti-ICE rhetoric from Democrats. The resolution highlights recent violent incidents and calls on Democrats to engage in "soul-searching" regarding their stance on immigration enforcement. The debate also touches on related issues, such as whether agents should be required to unmask during operations, highlighting deep political divisions over immigration policy.</p>

The decision follows a motion from his lawyers to be removed from the case, citing an "irreconcilably broken" attorney-client relationship and Routh's refusal to meet with them.

The strike, part of a long-running dispute over pay, is expected to cause significant disruption to the NHS. The BMA argues that wages have fallen by about 20% in real terms since 2008 and that industrial action is a necessary last resort.

In a 2-1 decision, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's injunction against the law, which was the first of its kind in the nation. The court determined that the state failed to demonstrate that the requirement aligns with the historical tradition of firearm regulation, as mandated by a 2022 Supreme Court precedent.

          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's sweeping tariffs have not yet triggered runaway inflation, but economists warn this is likely a temporary situation. Companies have so far absorbed costs and used existing inventory to avoid sharp price hikes, but this strategy is becoming unsustainable. The staggered rollout of tariffs has also delayed the full impact, which is expected to become more noticeable to consumers by the end of summer, particularly for imported goods like electronics and apparel. Experts predict that inflation will continue to trend upward as long as the tariffs remain, with a more significant peak potentially arriving in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a 6-month CD or a high-yield savings account is a better option for parking $25,000 in the current economic environment. With today's rates, a CD could offer a slightly higher, guaranteed return, making it attractive for those who can lock away their funds. However, a high-yield savings account provides essential flexibility and liquidity, which is crucial for emergency funds, despite having a variable rate that could decrease.

          <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, has announced that he will not run for a third term in 2026, setting up the state's first open gubernatorial race in 16 years. In his announcement, the 73-year-old governor stated it was time to focus on his family after five decades of public service. His tenure has been marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively to block conservative priorities. His departure opens a key race in a major battleground state, with several potential candidates from both parties expected to contend for the position.</p>

          <p>New York Jets starting quarterback Justin Fields was carted off the practice field after sustaining a toe injury on his right foot during team drills. The severity of the injury is not yet known, but the incident has caused significant concern for the team and its fans. Fields, who was signed as a free agent in the offseason, is expected to be the team's starter. Veteran backup Tyrod Taylor took over in his absence. The injury is a worrying start to training camp for the Jets, who are hoping to avoid a repeat of last season's early, season-ending injury to their quarterback.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters jumped significantly, becoming the latest company to be swept up in a meme stock rally driven by retail investors.

The rally also coincided with the announcement that actress Sydney Sweeney will be the face of a new campaign for the retailer's denim jeans. This volatile trading follows similar recent activity for other brands like GoPro and Krispy Kreme, providing a temporary boost to the otherwise battered stock. (not investment advice)</p>

The report highlights the porosity of AI guardrails and the potential dangers of the technology's servile and engaging nature, which can lead users down harmful paths in isolated conversations.

          <p>This article examines the significant challenge of paying off a substantial credit card balance, such as $40,000, given current high interest rates. Making only minimum payments could take approximately 41 years and accrue over $76,000 in interest, trapping consumers in a long-term debt cycle. The analysis explores faster repayment scenarios with higher fixed monthly payments, which can drastically reduce the timeline and total interest paid. It also outlines alternative strategies for large balances, including debt settlement, consolidation loans, and debt management programs, to provide a more realistic path to becoming debt-free.

The airline now projects a 2025 adjusted per-share result ranging from a 20-cent loss to 80-cents earnings, a significant downgrade from its January forecast.
