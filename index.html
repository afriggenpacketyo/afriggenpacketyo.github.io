          <h2>Government Reverses Course, Will Restore International Student Status</h2>

          <p>The federal government announced a major reversal, stating it will restore the records of international students whose entries in a crucial database were abruptly terminated, a move that complicated their ability to stay in the country. This decision comes after dozens of judges issued temporary orders directing the government to reinstate students' records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The database terminations had affected thousands of students, potentially forcing them to leave the country due to minor disciplinary records. Brian Green, representing an American University student, called the reversal a "sigh of relief" for international students. </p>

          <p>New court filings reveal that a surviving roommate in the Idaho student murder case saw Xana Kernodle on the floor shortly after witnessing a masked intruder. The roommate, D.M., reported hearing strange noises and crying before seeing a man in black with a ski mask. D.M. then texted other roommates but received no immediate response, later seeing Kernodle on the floor, initially believing she was drunk. The filing also notes gaps in data on Bryan Kohberger's devices, suggesting possible attempts to clear evidence, and a crime scene analyst claimed that there were attempts to "clean up the crime scene after the homicides."</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Rep. George Santos received a sentence of more than seven years in prison on federal wire fraud and identity theft charges in New York. Prosecutors stated that Santos defrauded voters and donors by exaggerating or fabricating his backstory. Santos admitted to betraying his supporters and the institutions he served, offering apologies through tears. The sentencing followed a DOJ filing stating he remains "unrepentant for his crimes," and he was seen hugging supporters and looking somber as he entered the courthouse.</p>

          <p>Sources allege that the Pentagon established a system in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office allowing him to access Signal messages, bypassing standard security protocols. A computer monitor in Hegseth's office reportedly provided remote access to the Signal app and text messages from his personal cellphone. This setup is considered a security risk, granting access to personal communications within a sensitive compartmentalized information facility (SCIF). The Defense Department denies the existence of a "dirty line" and claims there is no current use of Signal inside Hegseth's office.</p>

Bondi dismissed accusations that the Trump administration was intimidating judges, stating that no one is above the law.

Despite the drought, Palmer has had numerous chances, suggesting the team's performance is not the primary issue.</p>

He added that he may not even ask for this concession because China may not want it.</p>

          <h2>UK Studies Link Air Pollution to Cognitive Decline</h2>

          <p>New British studies suggest a link between air pollution and cognitive decline. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter has been associated with lower levels of overall and executive brain function in older Britons. The studies highlight the need to reduce air pollution to protect brain health. Measures such as low emission zones in London have shown effectiveness in cutting pollution and improving health-related economic factors.</p>

          <p>The UN World Food Programme (WFP) has depleted all its food stocks in Gaza after Israel blocked deliveries of humanitarian aid for seven weeks. The WFP delivered its last remaining food stocks to hot meals kitchens, which are expected to run out of food in the coming days. Israel cut off aid on 2 March and resumed its offensive two weeks later after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire. The UN says Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
