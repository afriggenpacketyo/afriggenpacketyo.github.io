          <p>Severe flooding and heavy rainfall in Chattanooga, Tennessee, have led to a tragic incident where a family of three was killed. A mother, father, and their child died after a large tree, uprooted by the saturated ground, crushed their car. Officials also confirmed the recovery of a fourth victim related to the widespread flooding. This extreme weather event prompted the declaration of a local state of emergency, with first responders conducting numerous water rescues from homes and vehicles. The region remains on high alert as authorities urge caution with more precipitation in the forecast and schools have been closed for safety.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has announced it will begin preemptively canceling flights in anticipation of a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice, citing disputes over low wages and unpaid work, setting the stage for a walkout if no agreement is reached. In response, the airline issued a lockout notice and plans an orderly shutdown of operations for both Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge.

          <p>A 40-year-old New York man has been arrested and charged with cyberstalking for allegedly leaving a series of threatening and profane voicemails for the widow of Brian Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare CEO who was fatally shot in December. According to the federal criminal complaint, the man called the CEO a "capitalist pig" and warned his widow that such events would continue to happen. The FBI traced the calls to the suspect's personal phone number. When confronted, the man initially denied making the calls but conceded it was possible as he had been drinking during that time. He now faces up to five years in prison if convicted.</p>

Chilean authorities have charged him with submitting a false flight plan, an accusation his legal team denies. His lawyers claim he was forced to divert to a Chilean base on King George Island due to dangerous icing conditions and equipment failure, and that he received permission to land. The teen, who was flying to raise money for cancer research, has been confined to the island for over a month, reportedly leading to a severe decline in his health.</p>

          <h2>Four Essential Steps to Prepare for a Debt Relief Program</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by debt, preparing properly for a debt relief program is crucial for success. This article outlines four key steps to take before enrolling. First, a prospective borrower should conduct a thorough review of all debts, income, and expenses to understand their complete financial picture. Second, it is vital to research and understand how different types of debt relief, such as settlement or consolidation, will affect one's credit and overall finances. The third step involves creating a realistic monthly budget to ensure consistent payments can be made. Finally, one should pause all new credit activity to avoid accumulating more debt during the process. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are predicting a substantial decline in Arctic reindeer populations over the coming decades, with some North American herds potentially shrinking by up to 80% by the year 2100. A study led by the University of Adelaide used ancient DNA, fossils, and computer models to analyze how reindeer have responded to past climate warming events. The findings indicate that while the species has survived previous warming periods, the rapid pace of current climate change poses a more severe threat. The decline of these animals, also known as caribou, could have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and accelerated release of carbon from Arctic soils.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee has criticized Vice President JD Vance for a fishing outing with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy during an official trip to the United Kingdom. The DNC's statement framed the activity as a "vacation" at taxpayer expense while Americans face high costs.

Republicans have dismissed the attacks, with the RNC characterizing the DNC's focus on a fishing license administrative error as trivial.

          <p>Economists are increasingly predicting that the Federal Reserve will implement a quarter-point interest rate cut at its upcoming September meeting. This expectation is fueled by recent economic data, including a weaker-than-expected jobs report and a benign inflation reading, which may give the central bank justification to ease monetary policy to prevent a slowdown. Despite President Trump's persistent public pressure for lower rates, the Fed has held them steady for months, citing concerns over potential tariff-induced inflation. However, with futures markets now pricing in a nearly 96% chance of a cut, the consensus is shifting toward a policy change. (not investment advice)</p>

Economists from firms like JPMorgan Chase and UBS expect a gradual rise in inflation, potentially pushing the core inflation rate higher. While this could dampen consumer spending and GDP growth in the short term, it is not expected to deter the Federal Reserve from beginning to lower interest rates, as the inflation spike is seen as temporary.

          <p>Walmart is expanding its employee discount program to include nearly all grocery items, a move that comes as rising tariffs fuel concerns about inflation. The nation's largest private employer will now offer its 1.6 million U.S. employees a 10% discount on items like milk, meat, and frozen food year-round, extending a benefit that previously applied mainly to produce and general merchandise. In a memo, Walmart's chief people officer stated the company was responding to employee feedback. The expanded discount could also serve to boost Walmart's own sales and help with employee retention during a period of economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A jury has acquitted Karen Read of the most serious charges in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, concluding a high-profile retrial in Massachusetts. After four days of deliberation, jurors found Read not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter, though she was convicted of driving under the influence. The defense had argued that Read was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, while the prosecution alleged she struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die in the snow in 2022. The verdict follows an initial trial that ended in a hung jury, bringing a dramatic close to a case that captivated the public.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can move forward with its plan to suspend or terminate billions of dollars in foreign aid that was previously appropriated by Congress. In a 2-1 decision, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the grant recipients challenging the funding freeze did not meet the legal requirements for a preliminary injunction that had temporarily restored the aid. The ruling vacates a lower court's order that had compelled the administration to release the funds. A dissenting judge argued that the majority's decision enables the executive branch to unlawfully disobey congressional spending authority for policy reasons.</p>

          <p>The Habit Burger & Grill is escalating its marketing rivalry with In-N-Out by updating a billboard near Los Angeles International Airport that directly trolls its competitor. The new sign highlights In-N-Out's drop to fourth place in a national fast-food burger ranking, a decline from its second-place finish last year, which Habit had also advertised. The campaign is a pointed jab, with Habit's CMO noting they are "proudly Californian and not going anywhere," a reference to In-N-Out's owner and corporate expansion moving to Tennessee. This move represents the latest salvo in the so-called California "burger wars," pitting two Irvine-based chains against each other.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that U.S. homeowners' equity has reached a new record high, with approximately 48 million mortgage holders possessing tappable equity. The average homeowner now holds about $213,000 in accessible value, contributing to a total of $11.6 trillion in usable equity nationwide. The article explains that homeowners can calculate their available equity by subtracting their mortgage balance from their home's current market value, though lenders typically cap borrowing at around 80% of this amount. This financial cushion can be accessed through financial products like home equity loans or HELOCs. (not investment advice)</p>

The Mendenhall River reached an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record and threatening homes along its banks. This annual event, known as an outburst flood, occurs when water from the adjacent Suicide Basin builds enough pressure to escape under the glacier. Although some residents evacuated, temporary barriers were installed this year to protect hundreds of properties.
