          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively. The former co-stars of the 2024 film *It Ends with Us* have been engaged in a legal dispute for several months, with a trial initially scheduled for the following year. Judge Lewis Liman dismissed Baldoni's countersuit, which included allegations of extortion and defamation, after Lively filed a complaint accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment and initiating a smear campaign against her. The judge's decision brings an end to this chapter of the legal battle between the actors.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Peter Brooks, a plastic surgeon, received a life sentence for attempting to murder a colleague, Graeme Perks, who was a witness against him in disciplinary proceedings. Brooks broke into Perks's home armed with a crowbar, petrol, matches, and a knife, and stabbed him, resulting in life-threatening injuries. The judge noted Brooks's life was "falling apart" due to the disciplinary action, and he blamed Perks for his difficulties. Perks survived the attack due to quick action and surgical skill, and stated he had no ill feeling towards his former colleague, while Brooks's case was marked by numerous delays and attempts to manipulate the court system.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would arrest California Gov. Gavin Newsom if his administration obstructed ICE operations amid riots in Los Angeles. This statement followed Newsom's dare to Border Czar Tom Homan to arrest him. Newsom responded to Trump's comments on social media, stating that it was a step toward authoritarianism. Homan clarified that while he said no one is above the law, there was no specific discussion about arresting Newsom, but rather about arresting protesters who commit crimes. The situation arose amid protests against the Trump administration's immigration raids in Los Angeles, prompting the deployment of National Guard troops.</p>

          <p>An inquest into the death of Rhianan Rudd, a 16-year-old girl who was groomed before being charged with terrorism offences, concluded that authorities missed opportunities to help her. The coroner found failures by the police and Derbyshire County Council to refer Rudd earlier as a potential victim of modern slavery. Rudd, the youngest girl charged with terrorism offences in the UK, took her own life at a children's home in May 2022 after the charges were dropped. The coroner delivered an open conclusion, finding that she could not be sure Rudd intended to die, and noted missed opportunities to provide mental health support sooner.</p>

          <p>Magaga Enos, a Kenyan man accepted to Harvard University, is concerned that his grandmother's sacrifices to fund his education may be wasted due to the Trump administration's restrictions on international students. His grandmother sold land and cattle, raising approximately $3,000, to support his master's degree at the Graduate School of Education. Enos fears that his dream of educating young girls and empowering his community will be taken away. He is unsure if he will board his plane to Cambridge, hoping officials will recognize international students as dreamers, educators, and bridge builders.</p>

          <p>A medical tribunal determined that the failings of a doctor responsible for Martha Mills' care, who died from sepsis, amounted to "gross negligence" and were "particularly grave." The tribunal found consultant Prof Richard Thompson failed to appreciate the seriousness of Martha's condition after a bike accident in 2021. He did not examine her in person or send her to intensive care on a crucial afternoon, ultimately impairing his fitness to practice. Martha's death led to the creation of Martha's Rule, granting parents the right to seek an urgent second opinion in hundreds of hospitals in England.</p>

          <p>A new study in JAMA Pediatrics found that firearm-related deaths among children and teens in the U.S. sharply increased after 2010, following a Supreme Court decision that gave states greater power to set their own gun laws. Over 7,000 more children died from firearm-related injuries in the years following the decision, with most deaths occurring in states that made it easier to purchase and carry firearms. States with stricter laws, such as California and New York, saw significant drops in pediatric gun deaths, indicating a correlation between gun legislation and youth mortality.</p>

The ban primarily affects countries in Africa and the Middle East, with Trump stating that countries can be added or removed over time based on improvements in screening and vetting. This ban differs from Trump's initial travel ban, as it includes specific exemptions, waiver options, and justifications for including certain countries. While legal challenges are expected, the ban is seen as more legally precise to avoid previous pitfalls.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery will split into two separate public companies by next year, marking a retreat from CEO David Zaslav's grand ambitions. One company will focus on streaming and studios, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. movie and television studios, while the other will focus on cable networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, and Discovery. Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, while Gunnar Wiedenfels will lead the cable business. The split aims to empower the iconic brands with sharper focus and strategic flexibility to compete in the evolving media landscape, representing a collapse of Zaslav's initial vision for the mega-media company.</p>

          <p>The UK government has settled its latest spending plans, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves expected to announce funding increases for the NHS, schools, and defense. Reeves has loosened Treasury borrowing rules to invest in infrastructure projects, but must also cut budgets to meet her fiscal rules. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper secured a deal after warnings from police chiefs about funding needs. The government has pledged to increase defense spending, invest in science and technology, and provide free school meals to more children, balancing this with savings including welfare cuts.</p>

          <p>A riot at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center in Tennessee was contained overnight with the help of extra law enforcement, and all prisoners were returned to their cells. The incident began when several inmates refused to return to their cells, leading to a multi-agency response. Three guards were held hostage but were released safely with no major injuries, while chemical agents were deployed to quell the disturbance. Authorities confirmed that the prisoners never reached the main fence and posed no threat of escape.</p>

          <p>The UK government's decision to largely reverse cuts to winter fuel payments has raised questions about its spending plans and fiscal rules. The government initially planned to restrict payments to only pensioners receiving pension credit, but reversed course after criticism. Now, all pensioners will receive the payment, clawed back in the following tax year from individuals earning Â£35,000 and above. This change will cost Â£1.25 billion, requiring the Treasury to address a gap in the government's finances in the next budget. The savings from this new plan are lower than initially projected, leading to adjustments in the government's fiscal strategy.</p>

Investment horizon is the period one expects to keep money invested before needing it, aligning with specific investing practices.
