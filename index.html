          <p>President Trump issued a stern warning to Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stating that he is an "easy target" and demanded Tehran's unconditional surrender amid escalating tensions with Israel. Trump's comments followed reports of an Israeli preemptive strike against Iran and subsequent missile exchanges between the two nations. He also claimed the U.S. has "total control" over Iran's airspace, boasting about American-made military technology. The escalating geopolitical tensions have impacted financial markets, causing U.S. stocks to slide and crude oil futures to jump. </p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a Democratic mayoral candidate, was arrested by masked ICE agents at a federal immigration court in Lower Manhattan. Lander's office stated he was taken into custody while observing court and escorting a defendant to prevent ICE arrest, while a DHS spokesperson said Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer. Video footage showed Lander being handcuffed, leading to accusations of abuse of power and undermining law enforcement safety. Lander's wife and other officials condemned the arrest as an attack on democracy, while mayoral competitors reacted with demands for his release.</p>

          <p>President Trump's assertion that the U.S. has "complete and total control of the skies over Iran" has raised questions about the extent of U.S. involvement in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. This statement contradicts earlier U.S. claims that Israel's offensive was being conducted unilaterally. Trump also used menacing language toward Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stating the U.S. knows his location but will not target him "at least not for now." The White House has not provided further clarification on these comments, though Trump is reportedly considering joining Israel's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is considering whether President Trump's deployment of the California National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities is lawful. The Justice Department is seeking to halt a district judge's order that required Trump to return control of the National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who objects to the federalization. The legal battle centers on whether the president exceeded his authority under Title 10 in response to protests against immigration raids, with California officials arguing that the administration's interpretation of the law is "terrifying" and could be used to suppress dissent.</p>

          <p>The standard charge for car drivers using the Dartford Crossing, which connects Essex and Kent, will increase from £2.50 to £3.50 in September. Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood stated the road is used by 180,000 vehicles daily, making the current charge insufficient to manage demand. Significant discounts will be available for local residents, and drivers with pre-pay accounts will pay £2.80 per crossing. The increase has been met with criticism from MPs who view it as another tax on motorists and a broken promise to remove the toll once construction costs were repaid.</p>

Trump initially opposed Israel's strikes but has since offered support and suggested potential negotiations with Iran.

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a tax break for tipped workers as part of a broader tax cut package, aiming to fulfill President Trump's "no tax on tips" pledge. Similar to a House GOP plan, the Senate measure offers a deduction on qualified tips, defined as those paid in cash or received as part of a tip-sharing arrangement. However, the Senate proposal caps the deduction at $25,000 per year and gradually reduces its value for individuals earning over $150,000, while the House bill has no cap. Tax experts suggest the tax break would only benefit a small portion of workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans are proposing new work requirements for Medicaid and food stamp recipients up to age 64, arguing it will encourage employment and prevent people from "gaming the system." The proposal tightens regulations for "able-bodied adults without dependents" (ABAWDs) and would require millions to prove they are working, volunteering, or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for benefits. Experts argue that work requirements do not boost employment and often result in people losing benefits due to administrative hurdles or other challenges. The Senate Finance Committee has unveiled its portion of the bill, which includes the Medicaid work requirement.</p>

The surge has occurred amid increased focus on alternative medicines after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was sworn in as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

          <p>With healthcare costs in the U.S. remaining high, many Americans are burdened with medical debt. Effective strategies to manage this debt include negotiating directly with providers for lower rates or payment plans, applying for hospital financial assistance or charity care, and utilizing medical bill advocates to identify errors. Debt consolidation or debt management programs can also be helpful if medical debt is combined with other debts, while debt settlement should be considered as a last resort due to its potential impact on credit scores. Starting the process early is crucial for maximizing positive outcomes. (not investment advice)</p>

The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill will prevent investigation, arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment for late term abortion.
