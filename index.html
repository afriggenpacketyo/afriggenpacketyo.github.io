          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to begin on August 1. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Trump cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. as primary reasons for the new levy. This tariff is separate from existing sectoral duties and could be increased if Canada continues its retaliatory measures. The announcement comes despite ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries, which have a self-imposed deadline of July 21. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent student negotiator during Columbia University's pro-Palestinian protests, has filed a $20 million administrative complaint against the Trump administration. The claim alleges false arrest, malicious prosecution, and emotional distress following his three-month detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident, was targeted for deportation over his activism, which the administration claimed posed a risk to foreign policy. His legal team states he would accept an official apology and a policy reversal in lieu of the monetary damages.</p>

          <p>Federal agents and protesters clashed during an immigration raid at a marijuana facility in Ventura County, California. Onlookers reported agents using crowd control measures, including irritants, and pinning at least one person to the ground. This raid is part of a series of large-scale immigration enforcement operations in the region, following President Trump's directive for a mass deportation program. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office condemned the actions as "inhumane" tactics that create fear and chaos within communities.</p>

          <p>Basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley has stated he would support Auburn men's basketball coach Bruce Pearl if he decides to run for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. Barkley praised Pearl for making the university's basketball program relevant but acknowledged that a political campaign would be a loss for the team. Pearl, who has not confirmed any plans to run, has gained political visibility for his vocal support of Israel and President Trump's Middle East policies. Barkley affirmed his support for Pearl regardless of the coach's political alignment.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole by a California board. Now 74, Bianchi was involved in the murders of 12 women in the Los Angeles area and Washington state during the 1970s.

In his new book, he argues that eight specific words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together—serve as powerful "emotional shortcuts" that resonate with voters across different cultures and political affiliations. While not a guarantee of victory, these words act as building blocks for messages that convey promise and direction.

          <p>Tesla has applied for permits to test and deploy its Robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, a market where competitor Waymo has operated since 2020. According to the Arizona Department of Transportation, Tesla is seeking approval to conduct autonomous vehicle operations both with and without human safety drivers. This move follows Tesla's recent pilot launch in Austin, Texas, where its vehicles are supervised remotely and accompanied by an in-car safety supervisor. The expansion effort highlights Tesla's push to catch up in the autonomous ride-hailing space, despite some documented incidents and regulatory scrutiny in its initial Texas rollout.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third heatwave of 2025, following its warmest and sunniest spring on record. According to climate scientists, this is not just a hot summer but a clear indicator of climate change, which makes extreme weather events more likely. Global temperatures have risen over 1.3 degrees Celsius, which can translate to heatwaves being 3-4 degrees warmer in regions like the UK. While many compare current heat to the summer of 1976, data shows that was an isolated event, whereas today's extreme heat is becoming a regular feature.</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a significant boom in demand. Between 2018 and 2022, the number of fertility treatments in the country increased by nearly 50%, with one in six babies in Seoul now born with their assistance. Experts attribute this trend to a shift in attitudes, as more people delay parenthood for social and financial reasons and later turn to treatments like IVF to conceive. This has contributed to a slight, yet meaningful, increase in the nation's birth rate for the first time in nine years.</p>

          <p>A senior Israeli official has stated that Israel believes Iran could potentially retrieve deeply buried stocks of enriched uranium from its Isfahan nuclear facility, one of three sites targeted in U.S. military strikes last month. While the Trump administration has claimed the sites were "obliterated," international assessments have been more measured. The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which designed the "bunker buster" bombs used, is still awaiting data to confirm if the munitions reached their intended targets. This assessment complicates the picture of the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a rate faster than the rise in global temperatures itself. The findings indicate that the longest and rarest heat waves are showing the greatest increases in frequency, meaning each fraction of a degree of warming will have a more significant impact than the last. This accelerated effect poses growing risks to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure, particularly in tropical regions. The research underscores an urgent need for adaptation strategies to cope with longer and more intense periods of extreme heat.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Aids Agency (UNAIDS) has warned in its annual report that decades of progress in combating HIV/AIDS are at risk due to significant funding cuts, particularly from the United States. The Trump administration's decision to halt most funding for the PEPFAR program has left UNAIDS with a nearly 50% budget shortfall. The agency estimates this could lead to an additional six million new infections and four million AIDS-related deaths over the next four years. Health officials and researchers in heavily impacted countries like South Africa are already feeling the effects, with critical trials being suspended.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reversing a long-standing federal policy by excluding undocumented children from Head Start, a comprehensive early childhood education program for low-income families. The change is part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for undocumented immigrants and encourage self-deportation. The Department of Health and Human Services has reclassified Head Start and at least 12 other programs as "federal public benefits," thereby restricting access based on immigration status. Critics argue this will create fear and confusion among all families and deny critical support to vulnerable children.</p>

In response to new U.S. tariffs, the company stated it plans to absorb some of the increased costs for now, a strategy aided by strong international sales, which make up 60% of its business. The updated forecast assumes a 30% tariff on its minimal China production and a 10% tariff on goods from the rest of the world. (not investment advice)</p>
