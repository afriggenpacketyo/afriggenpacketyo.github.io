          <p>Many corporations that donated millions to President Trump's inauguration are now facing challenges due to his policies, including tariffs and regulatory uncertainty. Tech companies are grappling with higher import costs and antitrust cases, while the food and beverage industry faces scrutiny over health regulations. The retail sector is concerned about the impact of tariffs on consumer spending, and the pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential drug pricing changes. The finance sector, despite deregulation hopes, is worried about recession fears caused by trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large wildfire in New Jersey, having already consumed 13,000 acres, is causing air quality concerns in the New York City region. The Jones Road Fire in Ocean County is only 50% contained and is expected to grow due to dry conditions and winds. Air quality alerts are in effect until midnight Thursday as smoke from the fire reaches New York City and Long Island, posing a risk to sensitive groups. Winds are expected to shift, potentially bringing more smoke to the region on Friday, similar to the Canadian wildfire smoke event of 2023.</p>

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has finalized rules requiring tech firms to implement stronger protections for children online, including overhauling algorithms and age checks. Platforms hosting pornography or content promoting self-harm must take robust action to prevent access by children, with failure to comply resulting in significant fines. While some critics argue the restrictions don't go far enough, Ofcom asserts these "Children's Codes" represent transformational new protections. The rules aim to tackle algorithms that push harmful content into children's feeds and require companies to prioritize safety.</p>

          <p>A physician recounts her experience with Ozempic, detailing why she chose to discontinue the medication and embrace a more holistic view of health. Initially, she sought the drug to lose weight after childbirth, influenced by the societal pressure to regain her pre-pregnancy figure. However, the side effects, including nausea and heartburn, made her feel unhealthy, leading her to prioritize exercise, better sleep, and a more balanced relationship with food. Her story highlights the importance of focusing on overall well-being rather than solely on weight, a perspective she now shares with her patients.</p>

          <p>President Trump has softened his stance on tariffs with China, signaling a potential for a fair deal amid ongoing trade war concerns. This shift is driven by the risk of halted trade and the impact on the stock market. The Trump administration also unveiled a series of executive actions targeting higher education and K-12 schools, including proposals to eliminate college DEI programs and revise discipline guidance for public schools. These actions aim to increase intellectual diversity and hold colleges accountable for ideological overreach, solidifying Trump's conservative agenda in education.</p>
