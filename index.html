          <p>Authorities are investigating an incident where the ABC10 news station in Sacramento, California, was struck by gunfire on Friday afternoon. The shots were reportedly fired from a moving vehicle, leaving at least three bullet holes in one of the building's windows. Employees were present inside the station during the shooting, but fortunately, no one was injured. Police have not yet identified a suspect or a motive for the attack, though it follows a small protest held outside the station a day prior. Extra patrols have been placed near another ABC affiliate as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Estonia has formally requested Article 4 consultations with its NATO allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes over the Gulf of Finland. The Estonian foreign ministry described the incursion as a "brazen" and "clear provocation," noting it was the fourth such incident in 2025. NATO jets from Italy, Finland, and Sweden were scrambled to intercept the Russian aircraft, which were flying with their transponders off. Russia has denied the violation, stating its jets were on a scheduled flight over neutral waters, escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>At a major arms fair in Taipei, Taiwan has highlighted its progress in defense self-sufficiency and its growing cooperation with American firms amid increasing military pressure from Beijing. The exhibition featured two key projects: Taiwan's first locally developed anti-ballistic missile system, known as Chiang-Kong, and a cruise missile co-developed with a U.S. defense company. The Chiang-Kong system is designed to intercept ballistic missiles at altitudes up to 70km, significantly enhancing the island's layered defense capabilities.

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced in Virginia for the gubernatorial election, a key political contest viewed as a bellwether for the Trump administration's policies. The race features Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. National issues, particularly the administration's cuts to the federal workforce, are playing a significant role in a state with a large number of federal employees. Spanberger is campaigning against these policies, while Earle-Sears is aligning herself with the economic record of the state's popular Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin. The election is also proceeding under heightened security concerns following the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he authorized a third lethal military strike on a vessel in the Caribbean suspected of trafficking illicit narcotics, resulting in the deaths of three individuals described as "narcoterrorists." The strike targeted a boat in international waters within the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility. According to the administration, intelligence indicated the vessel was associated with a designated terrorist organization and was transporting drugs intended for the U.S. This action follows two similar strikes earlier in the month and reflects a policy of using military force against drug cartels, a legal justification that has drawn criticism.</p>

Hoyle stated he was "a very unhappy speaker" and believes the decision "leaves the door open" for foreign states to spy on the House.

The agreement, two decades in the making, aims to conserve marine biodiversity and reverse damage from overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Environmental groups have celebrated the milestone as a "monumental achievement" for ocean conservation and a significant step toward the goal of protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030.</p>

          <p>Recent threats from the Trump administration to revoke the broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have raised questions about the powers of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC, created in 1934, regulates over-the-air radio and television stations, which use public spectrum and are required by law to operate in the "public interest, convenience and necessity." While the FCC does not typically regulate content based on political viewpoints, its chairman, Brendan Carr, has suggested that misleading the public could violate this public interest standard. Revoking a license is a complex process that would likely face significant legal challenges based on First Amendment protections.</p>

          <p>In a satirical column, Steve Lopez of the Los Angeles Times comments on the current political climate, focusing on the controversy surrounding Jimmy Kimmel's suspension and President Trump's threats against broadcast networks. The author humorously critiques the administration's actions, including its stance on free speech, healthcare policy under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and climate science. Lopez mockingly suggests that despite various national and international crises, the president's confidence is unshaken, as exemplified by his "TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!" hat. The column uses irony to highlight what the author perceives as hypocrisy and chaos in contemporary American politics.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned from his position following significant pressure from the Trump administration to bring a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Sources indicate that after a five-month investigation into alleged mortgage fraud, Siebert's office could not find sufficient evidence to file charges against James, a frequent political rival of the president. President Trump publicly stated he wanted Siebert "out," and Siebert was reportedly told to resign or be fired. The move has been condemned by James's lawyer as a "brazen attack on the rule of law."</p>

          <p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee has voted to shift its COVID-19 vaccine recommendation, now stating that individuals should consult with a healthcare provider before receiving a shot. This process, known as shared clinical decision-making, replaces the previous broad recommendation for vaccination. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) was divided on whether to also require a prescription, but that measure failed. Experts worry this change will create confusion and reduce vaccine uptake by adding an extra barrier, particularly for those without consistent healthcare access. The recommendations now await final approval from the acting CDC director.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow it to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals in the United States. The Justice Department filed an emergency application to lift a lower court's ruling that found the administration lacked the authority to terminate the humanitarian program. The administration argues that continuing to permit over 300,000 Venezuelans to remain in the country is contrary to the national interest. This marks the second time the administration has appealed to the high court in this case, reflecting its broader efforts to curtail legal immigration protections.</p>

          <p>Facing saturated markets and slowing demand in Europe and the U.S., many Chinese companies are increasingly turning their focus to Southeast Asia. A major trade fair in Nanning, China, is serving as a key testing ground for these exporters to connect with buyers from the region. Companies are attracted to Southeast Asia's rapidly growing economies, large populations, and young consumer demographics, which they see as offering significant potential for expansion. This strategic shift reflects a broader trend of Chinese businesses diversifying their export markets to sustain growth amidst global economic uncertainties and geopolitical shifts.

The judge did not rule on the lawsuit's merits but has given Trump's legal team 28 days to file an amended, more professional complaint.

          <p>Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, has publicly defended Jimmy Kimmel following his indefinite suspension by the Disney-owned ABC network. In a social media post, Eisner questioned the lack of leadership from corporations in standing up to bullies and defending the First Amendment. He characterized the suspension, which followed threats of regulatory action from the FCC chairman, as an example of "out-of-control intimidation." Eisner's comments add a significant voice to the controversy surrounding Kimmel's remarks about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and the subsequent pressure placed on the network by government officials.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation to impose a new $100,000 annual fee on H-1B visa applications, a move that could significantly impact the U.S. tech industry, which heavily relies on the program for skilled workers. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the policy is designed to incentivize companies to "Train Americans" rather than hiring foreign labor. The H-1B program is a primary channel for skilled professionals, particularly from India and China, to work in the United States.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent threats to revoke broadcast licenses of networks critical of his administration have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over a significant part of the media industry. Broadcast networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC operate on public airwaves and must obtain licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which requires them to serve the "public interest." While this has historically pertained to issues like obscenity or local programming, the current administration is framing political bias as a potential violation. Revoking a license is a complex legal process, but the threats alone can exert significant pressure on media companies and station owners.</p>
