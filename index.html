            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. has a significant advantage over China in the ongoing trade war, asserting that China is "playing with a losing hand" due to the disparity in export volumes between the two nations. Bessent's comments come ahead of the U.S. increasing tariffs on China and other countries, with the goal of bringing trading partners to the negotiating table and jobs back to the U.S. He also highlighted non-tariff barriers as a key area of concern. Bessent indicated that numerous countries have reached out to the White House to initiate discussions, while China has pledged to resist and has imposed tariffs on U.S. goods.

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to establish a task force and potentially revise CDC guidelines to no longer recommend adding fluoride to public water supplies, following Utah's recent ban on fluoride. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the EPA is also reviewing "new science" on fluoride, specifically citing a National Toxicology Program report that linked higher fluoride exposure to lower IQ in children. The American Dental Association responded by stating that fluoride at recommended levels is safe and necessary for oral health, and does not negatively impact IQ levels. This review is also prompted by a federal judge's ruling that the EPA should take steps to lower the potential risk of fluoride.</p>

            <p>The Restoring Energy Dominance Coalition, led by former energy and interior secretaries, has launched a six-figure ad campaign supporting President Trump's "all-of-the-above energy" agenda. The ad highlights the growth in various energy sectors, including solar, wind, nuclear, oil, and gas, as a result of Trump's policies, claiming this leads to more jobs and higher wages. This is the fourth major television ad launched by the group this year, part of a broader seven-figure campaign to support the administration's energy priorities. Trump has pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accord and bolster U.S. oil and gas production during his second term.</p>

            <p>American consumers are preparing for price increases on Chinese goods as President Trump's tariffs take effect, with companies like Apple rushing to import products before the duties increase. Despite efforts to diversify supply chains, a significant portion of goods, including iPhones, still undergo final assembly in China, making them susceptible to price hikes. Electronics and electrical machinery constitute the largest import category from China to the U.S., amounting to $119.9 billion in 2023. This reliance on Chinese manufacturing means that consumers will likely bear the brunt of the tariffs.</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences' announcement of successfully breeding three dire wolf puppies using genetic engineering has been met with skepticism from experts. While the company claims to have "de-extincted" the species, zoologists argue that the wolves are genetically modified gray wolves, not true dire wolves. Ancient dire wolf DNA is too degraded to clone, leading the team to use synthetic biology to insert dire wolf-like characteristics into a gray wolf. Experts emphasize the significant genetic differences between the two species.</p>

The credit is capped at $25,000 for lower-income families and aims to incentivize insurers to cover more homes in vulnerable areas.
