          <p>A recent European Central Bank report indicates that gold surpassed the euro in 2024 to become the second-largest global reserve asset, driven by central banks' increasing demand. Central banks hold liquid assets like foreign currencies and gold to hedge against inflation and diversify holdings. However, some analysts suggest that certain institutions may be nearing their gold stockpiling limits. This shift occurred amidst rising gold prices and geopolitical uncertainties, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which spurred a flight to safe-haven assets.

          <p>Chinese analysts are closely monitoring the unrest in Los Angeles, viewing President Trump's crackdown as a risky political gamble that jeopardizes public safety and stability. One commentator predicted that Trump's tactics could escalate into a constitutional crisis. The unrest stemmed from protests against immigration raids, leading to curfews and the deployment of the National Guard and Marines. Shi Yinhong, a professor at Beijing‚Äôs Renmin University, stated that Trump's deployment of troops revealed his ‚Äúdespotic nature‚Äù to Americans and did not enhance his domestic prestige.</p>

          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has secured a vote of confidence in his pro-EU government following a narrow loss in the recent presidential election. Despite the win, Tusk acknowledged the government faces increased challenges due to the election of Karol Nawrocki, who is supported by the Law and Justice (PiS) opposition. Nawrocki, a socially conservative supporter of Donald Trump, is expected to use his veto power to obstruct Tusk's coalition, which lacks the parliamentary majority to override presidential vetoes. Tusk has announced a cabinet reshuffle in July and called for full mobilization and responsibility from his government.</p>

Economists are closely monitoring when the tariffs will start impacting inflation data, with forecasts suggesting a potential rise above 3% by year-end.

          <p>Senator Rubio is reportedly pressing for a sanctions investigation into Harvard University. Experts and former officials have noted that it is unusual for a cabinet secretary to attempt to influence the Treasury Department's sanctions process to target a domestic entity. The push raises questions about political interference and the potential misuse of sanctions for domestic purposes. The situation highlights the intersection of politics, academia, and government oversight.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that 45% of American homeowners have regrets about buying their current home, with the most common complaint being frustration over maintenance costs and hidden fees. The typical homeowner spends over $18,000 annually on non-mortgage home expenses, and in some states, this can reach around $29,000. Experts advise factoring ongoing homeownership costs into the budget and obtaining a thorough accounting of potential defects to avoid surprises. Regular maintenance is more cost-effective than delaying updates until things break down.</p>
