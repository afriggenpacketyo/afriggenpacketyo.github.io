          <p>The UK government has announced new powers for police to manage repeat protests by considering their cumulative impact on communities. This move follows the arrest of nearly 500 protesters and aims to balance the right to protest with public safety, particularly for communities feeling intimidated. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood clarified that the policy is about imposing restrictions and conditions, not an outright ban, and will be brought forward promptly. The government will also review existing legislation, including powers to ban protests entirely.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has called for a calm and sober assessment of recent drone sightings over German airports, stating they have not yet posed a concrete threat. The disruptions, including at Munich Airport, have prompted discussions on enhancing national drone defense capabilities. Pistorius noted that while Russia may be using such incidents for provocation, Germany is making progress in its defense strategy. This news comes as the 190th Oktoberfest in Munich concludes after a run marked by overcrowding and a bomb threat.</p>

The eastern Ilam district was hit particularly hard, where 18 people died after several villages were swept away, including six members of a single family. Rescue efforts are being hampered by continuous rainfall and blocked roads, which have also disrupted domestic flights and cut off major highways linking the capital, Kathmandu. The government has declared a national holiday as the severe weather is expected to persist.</p>

          <p>Russia launched extensive missile and drone attacks across Ukraine overnight, resulting in the deaths of at least five people, with four fatalities reported in the western city of Lviv. The strikes targeted infrastructure in multiple regions, causing power outages and prompting neighboring Poland to scramble its fighter jets to secure its airspace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that over 50 missiles and hundreds of drones were used, reiterating the urgent need for enhanced air defense systems. The attacks follow recent statements from a US official supporting Ukrainian strikes deep within Russian territory.</p>

          <p>Syria is conducting its first parliamentary elections since the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, though it will not be a popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210 assembly seats will be chosen by electoral colleges across various districts, while the remaining third will be appointed by the interim president. The process is seen as a test of the new authorities' commitment to inclusivity, especially for women and minorities, given the absence of quotas. Due to ongoing tensions, elections have been postponed in Sweida province and Kurdish-controlled northeastern areas, leaving their seats vacant.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces conducted intense overnight strikes on Gaza City, including an attack that reportedly destroyed Al-Azhar University.

U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated that Israel has agreed to an initial withdrawal line and urged Hamas to act quickly on the deal.

          <p>Despite recent record sales, the U.S. electric vehicle market is falling behind global counterparts like China and Europe, where EV and hybrid sales constitute a much larger share of the market. Analysts attribute a recent sales boom to a rush before a significant $7,500 government tax credit expired, with carmakers now expecting a sharp decline in demand. The article suggests that comparatively weaker government support, higher average EV prices, and the effective exclusion of low-cost Chinese brands due to tariffs have slowed adoption. President Trump's policy changes are expected to further impact the industry's growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of Democratic-led states, including California, New York, and Oregon, are expanding the use of civil commitment laws, a policy also championed by President Trump to address the homelessness crisis. This legal process allows judges to compel individuals with severe addiction or mental illness into medical care or institutionalization. While proponents argue it is a necessary tool to help those unable to help themselves, critics and civil liberties advocates express alarm. They warn of the potential for over-institutionalization and argue that resources should instead be focused on housing and voluntary support programs.</p>
