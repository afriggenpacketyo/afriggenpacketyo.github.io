        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's second fiscal-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street's forecasts, although the Services division's revenue fell slightly short of estimates. The company reported strong iPhone, Mac, and iPad sales, with iPhone revenue reaching $46.84 billion. CEO Tim Cook mentioned that Apple is already sourcing about half of the iPhones for the U.S. from India and most other products from Vietnam, due to lower tariffs compared to China. The board authorized up to $100 billion in share repurchases and increased the dividend by 4%. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared that any country buying oil or petrochemicals from Iran would face secondary sanctions, barring them from doing business with the U.S. This announcement led to a rise in oil prices, with U.S. crude oil futures increasing to $59.24 per barrel. Trump stated that Iran is financing militant groups in the Middle East and that these measures are part of a "maximum pressure" campaign to halt Iran's oil exports. However, some analysts believe the sanctions are primarily directed at China, a major importer of Iranian oil, and may not significantly impact oil flow unless Chinese state-owned enterprises are targeted.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported strong first-quarter results driven by cloud computing and advertising growth but issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance for the second quarter. The company attributed this softer outlook to "tariffs and trade policies" among other factors. Amazon faces significant exposure to tariffs, particularly through its retail unit, as it sources products from China. Many third-party sellers on Amazon's marketplace also rely on China, and some have already raised prices or cut back on advertising due to higher import costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) refuted claims that ICE agents raided the "wrong home" in Oklahoma, clarifying that the raid was a lawful, court-authorized action targeting a property used for human smuggling. The warrant targeted the property, not specific individuals, and was based on an 84-page affidavit detailing probable cause that the address served as a stash house for human and drug smuggling. The DHS stated that the investigation is ongoing, and the involvement of current occupants in the smuggling ring has not been ruled out.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, David Brooks reflects on the exhausting nature of living in Donald Trump's world, defining it as a "pagan" atmosphere that celebrates power, ego, and competitiveness. He argues that this ethos, reminiscent of ancient Rome, encourages egotism and a callous tolerance of cruelty, contrasting it with Judeo-Christian values of compassion and humility. Brooks suggests that in this increasingly pagan age, it's crucial to root oneself in rehumanizing influences like art, literature, and selfless service to others, finding inspiration in moral antidotes to maintain mental and spiritual health.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to require all new vaccines to be tested against placebos and to develop new vaccines without mRNA technology, extending his reach into vaccine development. These moves raise questions about the availability of COVID boosters in the fall, as Mr. Kennedy has expressed skepticism about mRNA technology. Experts are concerned that these changes could erode trust in the vaccine approval process and delay the availability of crucial vaccines. These announcements represent an extraordinary use of his power as secretary to make decisions ordinarily left to career scientists at the F.D.A.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that medications like semaglutide, known as Wegovy and Ozempic, may offer significant benefits for patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a fatty liver condition linked to obesity and diabetes. The research showed improvements in liver health among patients receiving semaglutide treatment, with almost two-thirds experiencing a reduction in liver inflammation. Dr. Celine Gounder cautioned that longer-term studies are needed, and the FDA has already approved Rezdiffra (resmetirom) for MASH treatment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans in the Southern District of Texas, deeming the White House's use of the statute illegal. Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. determined that the president's claims about a Venezuelan gang did not constitute an "invasion" as required by the law. This ruling is the most expansive yet by any judge hearing challenges to the White House's use of the law, which was passed in 1798.</p>
