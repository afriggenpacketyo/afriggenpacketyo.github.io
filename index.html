          <p>President Trump has signed a new travel ban restricting entry to the US from nationals of 12 countries, citing national security risks and visa overstays.

Exemptions include lawful permanent residents, US government employees, and athletes traveling for major sporting events.

Mexico argued that gunmakers knowingly aided the unlawful sale of firearms to straw purchasers, who then trafficked them to drug cartels. The court ruled that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the gunmakers aided and abetted the unlawful sale of weapons, thus barring the suit under the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA).

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing punitive policies to expedite the removal of unaccompanied minors and strip them of legal representation. These policies include arresting caregivers, conducting "wellness checks" that instill terror, and making it exceedingly difficult for relatives to take custody of children. Advocates and lawyers describe these changes as a terrifying new strategy to instill fear and chaos in families, with children being used as "bait" to arrest and deport adults. The administration's actions are raising concerns about human rights violations and the safety of vulnerable children.</p>
