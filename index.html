          <p>A South African woman, Racquel "Kelly" Smith, received a life sentence for kidnapping and trafficking her six-year-old daughter, Joshlin Smith, along with her two accomplices. Judge Nathan Erasmus emphasized the lack of remorse shown by the trio, highlighting the devastating impact on the Middelpos community. The sentencing followed a six-week trial filled with shocking allegations, including claims that Smith sold her daughter to a traditional healer for her eyes and skin. Despite extensive searches, Joshlin remains missing, leaving her family and community heartbroken and fractured.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated at least 350 medical research grants at Harvard Medical School, citing concerns about antisemitism and diversity, equity, and inclusion practices on campus. This action has disrupted critical research on diseases like tuberculosis, Alzheimer's, and ALS, with scientists expressing fears that potential breakthroughs may be lost. Researchers emphasize that these grants are vital contracts supporting specific projects, not gifts to the university.

          <p>Chinese students in the U.S. are facing uncertainty after Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that some visas would be revoked, particularly for those in critical fields or with ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples, who was serving six life sentences for conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges. Despite the commutation, Hoover still faces a 200-year jail term in Illinois for murder, making his release unlikely. Hoover's lawyer expressed hope that Illinois would send him home for good, while authorities have maintained that Hoover continued to lead his gang from prison. Hoover has publicly disavowed gang life and advocated for criminal justice reform in recent years.</p>

          <p>A partial glacier collapse in Switzerland caused a massive landslide that buried 90% of the village of Blatten, prompting a search for a missing 64-year-old man. Authorities had evacuated around 300 residents and livestock prior to the event due to fears of a potential collapse. The landslide, triggered by a chunk of the Birch Glacier breaking off, also blocked the Lonza River, raising concerns about dammed water flows. Swiss glaciologists have expressed concerns about accelerated glacier retreat due to global warming, with Switzerland losing 4% of its total glacier volume in 2023.</p>

          <p>The New York Times editorial board argues that while President Trump's approach to the Ukraine war has been flawed, his frustration with the conflict's human cost and lack of progress is valid. The board suggests that Trump should not abandon cease-fire talks but instead increase pressure on both Russia and Ukraine to reach a deal. A potential agreement could involve Russia retaining control of territory in eastern and southern Ukraine, with promises of lifted sanctions and no NATO membership, while Ukraine receives military and economic support and closer integration into the European economy. The editorial emphasizes the need for Trump to demonstrate resolve against Putin to prevent further Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Ibram X. Kendi asserts that the Trump administration's systematic attacks on Black history are a betrayal of America's values and future. Kendi contends that these attacks, including purging Black historical content from websites, removing books from libraries, and defunding historical institutions, mirror historical efforts to erase Black stories and contributions. He draws parallels to the Atlanta Race Massacre of 1906, where false narratives led to violence against Black Atlantans, and argues that the administration's actions aim to protect white Americans by recasting attacks on Black history as administering justice. Kendi warns that this erasure endangers the opportunity for all Americans to understand the enduring legacy of racial inequity.</p>

While the FDA and USDA claim that streamlining operations will not affect food safety, critics worry about the loss of expertise and the rollback of safety regulations.

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson has filed a $500 million defamation lawsuit against four former housekeepers who have accused him of sexual assault. Robinson and his wife claim the women fabricated the allegations as part of an "extortionate" lawsuit, stating that the women went on family holidays with the couple and celebrated holidays together. The singer's lawyers also filed a motion to dismiss the women's lawsuit, arguing they should not have been granted anonymity. The women allege incidents dating back to 2006 and are seeking at least $50 million in damages and a jury trial.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets responded favorably to a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs on imports, leading to gains in U.S. futures, oil prices, and the U.S. dollar. The court's decision, which found that Trump exceeded his authority in imposing the tariffs, brought relief to investors after months of turmoil caused by the trade war. While the White House immediately appealed the ruling, the market's positive reaction reflects hopes that the worst of the trade-related disruptions may have passed. The ruling's long-term impact remains uncertain, but it has provided a brief respite for global commerce.</p>

          <p>English rugby is experiencing the end of an era as several prominent players, including Dan Cole, Mike Brown, Ben Youngs, and Alex Goode, are retiring from the game. These players, who were part of a fresh-looking England group that shocked the rugby world in 2012, have given a huge amount to the English game. The simultaneous departure of such a high-caliber group marks a significant shift, with younger players increasingly replacing established figures in squad dynamics. Danny Care also noted the mid-season retirements of Joe Marler and Anthony Watson, further emphasizing the changing landscape of English rugby.</p>

          <p>China's President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed plans to boost advanced manufacturing, a strategy that could clash with the Trump administration's goal of increasing domestic production of high-tech products. Xi emphasized self-reliance in advanced manufacturing as the backbone of China's economy, while the U.S. has criticized China for providing state subsidies that distort competition. Experts warn that China's commitment to manufacturing-led growth is unlikely to change, despite U.S. demands to address trade imbalances. China's "Made in China 2025" plan aims to transform the country into a leading high-end manufacturer, but it has faced challenges and criticism for fostering unhealthy industrial competition.</p>

As part of the voluntary agreement, known as the Mansion House accord, agreed earlier in May, the 17 firms involved committed to investing 10% of their assets in things other than publicly traded shares, so that more money would flow into homebuilding, infrastructure projects and start-up businesses in fast-growing sectors.

          <p>A federal court in New York handed President Donald Trump a big setback Wednesday, blocking his audacious plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country in the world. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency and justify the sweeping tariffs. The tariffs overturned decades of U.S. trade policy, disrupted global commerce, rattled financial markets and raised the risk of higher prices and recession in the United States and around the world. Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official who is now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, says the court's decision "throws the president’s trade policy into turmoil.”</p>

          <p>Beijing should be ready for Washington to adopt alternative pressure tactics in future tariff negotiations, according to a renowned Chinese scholar who noted that the Trump administration had recognised the limitations of imposing heavy tariffs. Wu Xinbo , dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said that while US President Donald Trump might continue using tariffs as a negotiating tool, he was likely to show more restraint after seeing their mixed results.
