          <p>The upcoming Tokyo metropolitan assembly election on June 22 is being viewed as a crucial test for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's long-term prospects, serving as a bellwether for national politics in Japan. A poor outcome could lead to Ishiba's resignation, especially given his declining popularity due to concerns about his economic policies and attempts to curb rising rice prices. Past Tokyo assembly elections have significantly influenced Japan's political landscape, sometimes triggering dissolutions of the House of Representatives or changes in prime ministers. Ishiba's cabinet support rate has reached its lowest levels, making the election a critical juncture for his leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by Ernst's remarks about potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst's comment, "Well, we're all going to die," made at a town hall meeting, drew criticism and prompted Scholten to enter the race. Scholten, a former congressional candidate and professional baseball player, aims to make the election a referendum on President Trump's trade policy, particularly its impact on Iowa soybean farmers. Democrats have not won a Senate race in Iowa since 2008, making this a challenging but potentially impactful campaign.</p>

          <p>A former Taiwanese defense official, Andrew Yang Nien-dzu, has cautioned that the risk of a military accident across the Taiwan Strait is increasing due to heightened pressure from Beijing and a lack of direct communication channels between the two sides. Yang highlighted the growing "grey zone operations" by Beijing, including frequent activities by its coastguard forces near Taiwan. These operations are difficult to manage as they carry a military message without being actual military actions. The absence of official communication since 2016 further exacerbates the risk of miscalculation and accidental conflict.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has paused its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision marks an abrupt policy shift, as the administration had previously announced it would resume collection activity on the country's $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio. The pause provides older student borrowers more time to address their defaulted loans and avoid a reduction in their Social Security benefits. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers age 62 and older are in default, potentially facing reduced benefit checks. (not investment advice)</p>
