          <p>China's Commerce Ministry has responded to a US threat of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, calling it a typical example of American 'double standards' and warning of potential countermeasures. The escalation follows Beijing's move to tighten export controls on rare earths, which the US administration labeled a hostile act. This sharp exchange has rattled financial markets and renewed fears of a trade war between the two economic giants, jeopardizing a potential meeting between their leaders later this month.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has declared that universities must take decisive action to protect Jewish students from a recent surge in antisemitism, harassment, and discrimination on campuses. She announced government funding for training to help university staff and students identify and address antisemitic behavior, stating that such intimidation has no place in higher education. The move comes after a report found a significant increase in antisemitic incidents at universities, with many Jewish students reporting that they do not feel safe.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has sealed its major border crossings at Torkham and Chaman after intense overnight firefights with Afghan Taliban forces. Both sides claim to have inflicted heavy casualties, with the Taliban stating its actions were in retaliation for recent Pakistani airstrikes inside Afghanistan. The conflict escalated after the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), allegedly harbored in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for attacks that killed over 20 Pakistani security personnel. The clashes represent a dangerous escalation in tensions between the neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>As a peace summit in Egypt approaches, Israel's defense minister has announced plans to destroy all of Hamas's underground tunnels in Gaza once the agreed-upon hostage release is complete. The operation is set to be conducted by the Israeli military under US supervision. This development comes as Hamas is expected to begin releasing hostages on Monday, a key part of the ceasefire agreement brokered with the help of the United States.

          <p>A review of current money market account rates indicates that while the national average is low at 0.59%, some high-yield accounts are offering rates of 4% APY or higher. Following recent rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, deposit rates have begun to fall, making it increasingly important for savers to compare options to maximize their earnings. The article illustrates how choosing an account with a higher APY can significantly increase the interest earned on deposits over the course of a year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Car dealers across China are facing a severe financial squeeze, with many operating at significant losses due to an intense price war and growing competition from e-commerce platforms. The country's 14 major dealership groups reported a 10% sales slump in the first half of 2025, following a steep decline the previous year. Industry associations have warned that many of the nation's 30,000 dealerships could fail within two years, prompting calls for banks to provide financial support to stabilize the crucial auto distribution sector.</p>

          <p>According to a Financial Times report, U.S. intelligence agencies have been providing crucial support to Ukraine for months to help it conduct long-range drone strikes on Russian energy facilities. Citing unnamed officials, the article claims that Washington is closely involved in planning stages, providing intelligence on target vulnerabilities and route planning to help Ukrainian drones evade Russian air defenses. This joint effort is reportedly aimed at weakening Russia's economy and pressuring Moscow to negotiate an end to the war.</p>

          <p>The European Union has begun a gradual six-month rollout of its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the 29-country Schengen Area. The system requires travelers from countries like the UK to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a photo, on their first use. While EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel by eventually replacing passport stamps, there are concerns that the initial registration process could cause significant delays at ports, airports, and rail terminals.</p>

          <p>At its party conference, Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has committed to creating a detailed plan for Welsh independence, though it will not be a priority within the first term of a potential Plaid-led government. Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth proposed establishing a 'standing commission' to engage the public and prepare a white paper on the path to independence. This marks a shift from the party's previous pledge to hold an independence referendum within five years, signaling a more gradual, long-term approach to achieving its ultimate constitutional goal.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered the mechanism that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a new plant. Their research, published in the journal 'Cell', identifies two key genetic switches that can revert a differentiated somatic cell back to an embryonic state. This process, known as somatic embryogenesis, was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs. The breakthrough provides fundamental insights into one of biology's most profound processes and could have significant implications for agriculture and plant science.</p>

          <p>An Indiana woman, Alison Davis, has been found not guilty of murdering her husband, Kevin Davis, who died from head trauma after what she claimed was a fall down their home's stairs. Prosecutors had argued she beat him to death, but no murder weapon was ever found. Police were unable to search the master bedroom on the night of the incident because the couple's protective dog, Willow, was inside, leading to speculation that a weapon could have been concealed there. The jury acquitted Alison after just six hours of deliberation.</p>
