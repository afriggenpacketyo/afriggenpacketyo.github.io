          <p>A REACH medical helicopter crashed on eastbound Highway 50 in Sacramento, California, critically injuring all three crew members on board. The incident occurred shortly after 7 p.m. near 59th Street, leading to a full closure of the freeway and significant traffic disruption. Prompt action from a fire captain and bystanders was crucial in lifting the aircraft off one trapped crew member, who was then transported to an area hospital along with the other two critically injured individuals. Officials are now investigating the cause of the crash, with the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office providing assistance to the California Highway Patrol as the scene is cleared.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence, celebrating his 26th birthday, orchestrated a dramatic 31-28 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday night. In a memorable play, Lawrence stumbled on the snap but recovered to scramble for a one-yard touchdown with just 23 seconds remaining, securing the thrilling late win. This improbable score snapped the Jaguars' eight-game losing streak against the Chiefs and saw Lawrence account for two rushing touchdowns and one passing score, despite two turnovers earlier in the game. The crucial comeback performance improves Jacksonville's record to 4-1, while Kansas City falls to 2-3 after a game they initially led by 14 points.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has urged students not to participate in pro-Palestinian protests on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack, warning of increased antisemitism. He described such demonstrations as "un-British" and a "despicable excuse to attack British Jews," referencing heightened security after a recent synagogue attack in Manchester. Universities across the UK are preparing for planned student marches, with Starmer emphasizing the nation's unity against those harming Jewish communities.

          <p>Illinois and Chicago have filed a lawsuit to block President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to the city, arguing it's an "unconstitutional invasion" and a political power grab. Despite the legal challenge, a judge declined an immediate restraining order, revealing that Texas National Guard troops are already en route. Governor J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson accuse the administration of creating chaos to justify military intervention and violating the Posse Comitatus Act.

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying over the Pacific Ocean off southwest Mexico and is forecast to become a Category 2 hurricane, potentially approaching major hurricane status in the coming days. The Mexican government has issued a tropical storm watch for Baja California Sur, stretching from Cabo San Lucas, as the storm is expected to move parallel to the coast. Although Priscilla is projected to remain several hundred miles offshore, heavy rains, tropical storm-force winds, and life-threatening surf and rip currents are anticipated along affected coastal areas. Forecasters warn that 2-4 inches of rain, with up to 6 inches in some spots, could bring a risk of flash flooding, especially in higher terrain.</p>

          <p>Unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2025 have fallen to their lowest annual level since 1970, with approximately 238,000 apprehensions recorded. This significant decline is attributed to the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies, including sealing the border and ending the practice of releasing migrants. While praised by the White House for securing the border, these measures have drawn criticism from civil liberties groups for being inhumane and unconstitutional. The article highlights the dramatic shift in migration patterns and the ongoing debate over enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Hong Kong's potential accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) will significantly bolster its role as a "superconnector" in the global economy. With strong support from ASEAN, RCEP membership would deepen Hong Kong's trade ties and interconnectivity with Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. The agreement aims to eliminate 90% of tariffs over two decades, benefiting Hong Kong's small and medium-sized enterprises by reducing overhead costs and logistical barriers. This would also increase the inflow of high-quality consumer goods and lower manufacturing costs for downstream firms. (not investment advice)</p>

His complaints, filed through "Resident Concern Forms," include delayed access to the JPay system for commissary orders and issues with supply bags, which he should have been familiar with. Meanwhile, a judge recently blocked the release of graphic crime scene photos, citing privacy concerns for victims' families, but allowed other case documents to be public.

This historic shift was driven by robust growth in solar and wind power, which met all new electricity demand and slightly reduced fossil fuel use globally. While developing countries, especially China, led this clean energy charge, developed nations like the US and EU saw increased reliance on fossil fuels due to demand and weak renewable performance.
