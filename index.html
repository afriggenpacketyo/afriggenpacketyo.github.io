          <p>This article recounts the intricate case of Dana Chandler, who was convicted of the 2002 murders of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, and his girlfriend, Karen Harkness, after three trials. The article details the initial investigation, the lack of direct evidence, and the family's unwavering belief in Chandler's guilt, which led to years of pursuing justice. Chandler's first conviction was overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct, leading to a retrial that ended in a hung jury. Ultimately, in her third trial where she represented herself, Chandler was found guilty, bringing a measure of closure to the victims' families after more than two decades of legal battles and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant increase in obesity rates, ranking among the highest in Europe, with experts linking the trend to poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. A substantial portion of children primarily consume bread and pasta, contributing to nutritional imbalances. While the Health Ministry has launched a campaign to combat obesity, critics argue that it overlooks broader economic struggles and the inaccessibility of healthy foods for low-income communities.</p>
