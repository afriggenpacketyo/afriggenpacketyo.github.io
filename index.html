          <p>House Republicans are expressing growing concern about meeting a self-imposed July 4 deadline for a major tax and immigration bill, prioritizing accuracy over speed. Despite President Trump's insistence, key members from various factions suggest a delay may be necessary to resolve contentious issues like Medicaid funding and state tax deductions. Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged the deadline could slip but is pushing to meet it. The bill's passage is also tied to the urgent need to raise the U.S. debt limit to avoid a potential default this summer.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit alleges that the network, particularly anchor Jesse Watters, knowingly broadcast false statements claiming Newsom lied about a phone call with President Donald Trump. The complaint accuses Fox News of acting with malice to support Trump and undermine Newsom due to his progressive political stance. Newsom's legal team has offered to drop the lawsuit in exchange for a retraction and an on-air apology, a proposal Fox News has dismissed as a frivolous publicity stunt.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concerns, President Trump's recent tariffs have not led to a significant spike in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering inventory to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and utilizing legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. While these short-term strategies have buffered the initial shock, experts caution that prices could still rise in the latter half of the year. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations has also made businesses hesitant to immediately pass on increased costs to customers.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has emerged as the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, driven by its recent inclusion in the index, positive regulatory news, and new product launches. The stock's rally is also fueled by its close revenue-sharing relationship with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, which has seen its own stock soar. Analysts suggest that as legislative clarity for the crypto industry improves, such as with the passage of the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, investor sentiment is shifting. Coinbase is increasingly seen as a key way to invest in the evolution of crypto from a speculative asset to one with practical utility. (not investment advice)</p>

Her comments follow similar revelations from compatriot Katie Boulter and calls from Sir Andy Murray for greater action against the abuse of athletes on social media. Watson stated that such threats and abusive messages are a daily occurrence but that she has learned to put them in perspective. She attributes the behavior to unhappy individuals and considers it madness for someone to abuse a person they have never met.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has abruptly ended all trade discussions with Canada, citing Ottawa's decision to implement a digital services tax on large technology companies. President Trump announced the move on social media, calling the tax a "blatant attack" and vowing to announce new tariffs on Canadian goods within a week. The 3% tax, which affects U.S. tech giants like Google and Amazon, has been a major point of contention between the two allied nations. The announcement caused U.S. stock markets to retreat from record highs, highlighting the economic stakes of the trade dispute.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have finalized an agreement aimed at accelerating the shipment of rare-earth minerals to the U.S., a move that briefly sent stock markets to new highs. The deal addresses China's previous suspension of critical mineral exports, which had disrupted global supply chains for industries like automotive manufacturing and defense. As part of the understanding, China will streamline export permit approvals, and the U.S. will subsequently remove its countermeasures. This development signals potential progress in easing trade tensions, although the situation was complicated by a simultaneous announcement of terminated trade talks with Canada.</p>

While a proposal to cap states' provider taxes was struck down, other measures like new work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks were approved to proceed. Policy analysts warn that these changes could still lead to deep cuts in federal health spending and cause millions to lose coverage. The House version of the bill was estimated to reduce federal Medicaid spending by nearly $800 billion, and critics argue the remaining provisions are still deeply harmful to the program.</p>

          <p>Homeowners with significant equity are weighing whether a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a traditional home equity loan will be the more affordable borrowing option this summer. While both currently have similar interest rates, the variable nature of HELOC rates means they could decrease if the Federal Reserve enacts anticipated rate cuts. This positions HELOCs to potentially become cheaper, though they also carry the risk of rising rates if economic predictions are wrong. In contrast, home equity loans offer a fixed rate, providing certainty for borrowers who prioritize stable payments over potential future savings. (not investment advice)</p>

Such a decision would jeopardize approximately 1,300 jobs and is being driven by disruptions from U.S. tariffs on imported cars, a key market for the brand. Production at the UK plant was already temporarily suspended due to the 25% import tax. While a new deal will lower the tariff to 10%, the ongoing volatility and costs have prompted the review.

While Red Bull insists Verstappen is under contract, performance clauses and concerns over the team's future competitiveness, especially with upcoming engine rule changes, make a move plausible.

          <p>An Afghan man who served as an interpreter and logistics provider for the U.S. military has been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in San Diego. The man, identified as Sayed Naser, was taken into custody after attending a mandatory immigration hearing and has been placed in expedited removal proceedings, stripping him of his legal protections. Naser, who has pending asylum and Special Immigrant Visa applications, fled Afghanistan after his brother was killed by the Taliban due to their family's U.S. ties. Advocates have condemned the detention as a cowardly betrayal of a wartime ally who followed all legal protocols to enter the U.S.</p>

Despite rugby taking a backseat to Australian rules football in local media, a strong crowd of over 40,000 is anticipated, largely due to traveling fans. The Force, who finished low in the Super Rugby standings and are missing key players, are considered underdogs. Lions coach Andy Farrell has praised Russell's game management and vision, positioning the Scottish star as a key general in the team's strategy to play with speed and imagination.</p>

          <p>A nearly three-decade-old story continues to captivate, recounting the day a female gorilla named Binti Jua rescued a 3-year-old boy who fell into her enclosure at the Brookfield Zoo. In 1996, the unconscious child was gently picked up by Binti Jua, who cradled him and carried him to a service door for zookeepers, protecting him from other gorillas. The event garnered international praise, with many attributing her actions to maternal instincts, as she had her own baby at the time. Binti Jua, now 37, still resides at the zoo, a living hero whose compassionate actions stand in contrast to other, more tragic zoo incidents.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would bomb Iran again 'without a question' and claimed the country's nuclear program was 'obliterated' by recent U.S. strikes. His comments came as U.S. officials offered conflicting assessments of the damage, with some Republican leaders claiming a 'major setback' for Iran. However, some Democratic lawmakers and a nuclear physicist in Congress expressed concern that Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium may have survived the attacks. They warned that if the material remains, Iran could still be a very brief period away from being able to produce a nuclear device, a situation they attribute to the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>President Trump celebrated a Supreme Court decision that curbs the power of lower federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions, calling it a 'monumental victory.' The 6-3 ruling, which stemmed from legal challenges to his executive order on birthright citizenship, found that such broad orders likely exceed the authority of district judges. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship policy itself, the decision allows the administration to proceed with numerous policies that had been blocked.

Medical bills are also frequently eligible for reduction through hospital assistance programs or direct negotiation for a lower lump-sum payment.

          <p>British tennis player Oliver Tarvet, who successfully qualified for the Wimbledon main draw, has highlighted the restrictive NCAA rules that prevent him from claiming his full prize money. The 21-year-old, who plays college tennis at the University of San Diego, is limited to claiming $10,000 in profit per year plus expenses, forcing him to forfeit a large portion of the Â£66,000 earned for reaching the first round. Tarvet expressed his belief that he deserves the money he worked hard to earn and called for a change in the collegiate athletic association's rules. This issue is currently the subject of a class-action lawsuit filed by other affected players.</p>

          <h2>Review: Lorde's New Album 'Virgin' Explores Self-Obsession in a Digitally Saturated World</h2>

          <p>Lorde's fourth album, 'Virgin,' marks a return to the electronic, rhythm-driven sound of her earlier work while exploring themes of desire, heartbreak, and self-discovery in her late 20s. The album is set against a New York City backdrop and attempts to capture a visceral, physical energy, but is often diluted by a pervasive self-consciousness. This review suggests that while Lorde's influence on modern pop is undeniable, her once-pioneering introspective style now feels insular and circular. The album's production, though aiming for radicalism, often falls back on familiar textures, resulting in a work that feels more like a compromise than a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) held its first preview event inside its new, long-awaited David Geffen Galleries building. After five years of construction and considerable debate over its design, VIPs and media were invited for a sneak peek featuring an immersive concert by jazz composer Kamasi Washington. Musicians were staged throughout the still-empty concrete galleries, giving guests a sense of the space before art installation begins. The sprawling, curvilinear structure, which crosses over Wilshire Boulevard, is a new city landmark, though questions remain about how the museum's collection will function within the unique space.</p>
