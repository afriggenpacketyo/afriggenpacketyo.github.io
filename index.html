          <p>The Israeli military has intercepted the "Handala," a vessel operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition that was attempting to deliver food aid to the Gaza Strip. The group stated the boat, carrying baby formula and crewed by international activists, was boarded in international waters. Israel's foreign ministry confirmed the interception, stating the boat was stopped from illegally breaching the maritime blockade and was being safely brought to an Israeli shore.

          <p>Turkey has officially recorded its highest-ever temperature, reaching 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southeastern town of Silopi. The new record comes amid a severe heatwave affecting much of the eastern Mediterranean, with temperatures up to 12 degrees Celsius above seasonal averages. This extreme heat has exacerbated conditions for dozens of wildfires across Turkey, leading to evacuations and a surge in heat-related hospitalizations. President Erdoğan has described the situation as a "great disaster," with thousands of personnel deployed to combat the blazes.</p>

In contrast, Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw struggled with his command, allowing four runs in less than five innings.

The departures come as the administration has also proposed significant budget cuts to the agency, though Congress is considering maintaining current funding levels.

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is on the path to becoming a Catholic saint after being murdered in 2007 for his integrity. A devout Catholic, he refused to accept bribes to allow a shipment of spoiled, potentially poisonous rice to be smuggled into the country. After his "mafia-style" killing, the Catholic Church declared him a martyr for his faith and he was recently beatified. His story is being held up as an example of choosing honesty over the "filth of corruption."</p>

          <p>For fans experiencing intense physical and emotional reactions during high-stakes football matches like the Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the hormonal science behind the stress. The body's fight-or-flight response, driven by adrenaline and cortisol, can cause an elevated heart rate and a buzzy feeling. Experts advise managing these effects by getting good rest, having a clear match day plan, and engaging in movement to release energy. Ultimately, they suggest reframing the anxiety as part of the enjoyable, communal experience of supporting a team.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While some residents are enjoying the temperate conditions, the pattern is a stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of the state. Forecasters warn that summer isn't over, as the city's hottest days often occur in September.</p>
