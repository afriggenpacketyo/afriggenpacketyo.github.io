          <h2>Singapore Inflation Remains Low Amid Upcoming Election</h2>

          <p>Singapore's March inflation remained at a four-year low, with the consumer price index rising 0.9% year-on-year, aligning with February's figures and slightly below Reuters' expectations. This stable inflation rate arrives as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3, where cost-of-living pressures are a significant concern. In response to the subdued economic growth, the Monetary Authority of Singapore eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time, aiming to stimulate the economy amid forecasts of potential zero growth for the year, highlighting concerns about manufacturing and financial services sectors. Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry has downgraded its GDP forecast to 0%-2% for 2025, reflecting concerns about declines in manufacturing and certain services sectors.</p>

          <p>Several news outlets are covering a reported peace plan where Donald Trump would allow Vladimir Putin to keep seized Ukrainian territory, while Ukraine would receive no clear US security guarantee. The Financial Times reports pressure on Kyiv to concede territory so Trump can claim victory, and that Trump's attacks on Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell have caused gold prices to surge. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has criticized Trump's tariffs as a "major negative shock" to the global economy, leading to cuts in growth forecasts for the US, UK, and globally. Other news stories include the UK hosting US and European negotiators for Ukraine peace talks, Kemi Badenoch's criticism of Keir Starmer's stance on transgender issues, and the death of Pope Francis.</p>

          <p>The popularity of 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services for travel is surging, with companies like Klarna and Affirm reporting significant growth in travel bookings and transaction volumes. This trend is especially prominent among Gen Z and millennial travelers, who are using BNPL plans to finance flights, hotels, and event tickets, extending beyond luxury vacations to essential travel expenses like family visits. While BNPL offers convenience and flexibility, spreading out costs without immediate interest, concerns arise regarding potential debt stacking and inflexible repayment terms that could lead to late fees and credit score damage. Financial experts advise responsible use, emphasizing the importance of having sufficient funds for repayment to avoid financial strain.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell was convicted in Arizona for conspiring to murder her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019, adding to her previous convictions for killing her two children in Idaho. Prosecutors argued that Vallow Daybell sought to benefit from Vallow's life insurance and to marry Chad Daybell, who shared her doomsday religious beliefs. The case involved claims of zombies and Vallow Daybell's belief that she was a goddess ushering in an apocalypse. Vallow Daybell, who defended herself, claimed her brother shot Vallow in self-defense, but jurors found her guilty, and she faces further trial for allegedly conspiring to kill her niece's ex-husband.</p>

          <p>Nassau County, New York, is considering a bill that would prohibit individuals from standing within 15 feet of police officers or first responders during emergencies, with violators facing potential misdemeanor charges and fines. Proponents argue the measure is necessary to protect first responders from interference, but critics, including the New York Civil Liberties Union, contend it infringes on constitutional rights and limits government transparency. Similar laws in other states have been struck down by courts for violating due process and infringing on press freedoms, raising concerns about the bill's potential for abuse and its impact on public accountability.</p>

CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the disruption, citing a "magnet issue" during the company's earnings call. Beijing added seven rare-earth minerals to its export control list, requiring stricter permit requirements for these dual-use materials, which have both civilian and military applications. Tesla is seeking assurances that the rare-earth magnets used in Optimus are not intended for military purposes as the company navigates the licensing process with Chinese authorities.</p>

          <p>Data from the CDC indicates a slight increase of 1% in the number of births in the US during 2024, totaling approximately 3.6 million, which marks a small uptick following a long-term decline since the Great Recession. The report highlights record-low birth rates among teenage girls and young women, coupled with an increase in births among women aged 40-44. The rise in births is primarily attributed to Hispanic and Asian women, while birth rates declined among Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native women. Despite this increase, economic uncertainty, housing and childcare costs, and shifting priorities continue to present challenges for growing families.</p>

          <p>Increased U.S. regulatory scrutiny, spurred by President Trump's "America First Investment Policy" memo, is raising concerns about the potential delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. The memo calls for a review of U.S. investments in Chinese entities and renewed scrutiny of publicly traded Chinese companies, both through listing structures and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. Political pressure is mounting, with the House Select Committee on China urging investment banks to withdraw from underwriting the Hong Kong IPO of a Chinese battery giant. While the SEC states that no issuers are currently at risk of a trading prohibition, experts suggest delisting could occur sooner than expected if regulators act swiftly.</p>

          <p>Netflix and Sonia Friedman Productions have brought "Stranger Things: The First Shadow" to Broadway, creating a franchise extension that merges the fluidity of the screen with the dynamism of the stage. The production, directed by Stephen Daldry, is visually spectacular but suffers from a convoluted plot, squeezing an entire season of the series into a 2-hour, 45-minute play. The play is a prequel set in 1959, focusing on the character Henry Creel and his unsettling past, exploring themes of teenage cruelty and supernatural forces. Despite the narrative shortcomings, the talented cast and inventive design team create a mind-blowing funhouse experience, though a script doctor is needed to remedy the chaotic storyline.</p>

          <p>Six leading policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry have joined forces to lobby the Trump administration against the imposition of 25% tariffs on auto parts, set to take effect by May 3. The groups, representing dealers, suppliers, and major automakers, warn that the tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production and harm already distressed auto suppliers. They argue that many suppliers cannot afford the additional cost increases, potentially leading to production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies. The joint letter, addressed to key Trump administration officials, highlights the automotive industry's significant contribution to the U.S. economy and its support of 10 million American jobs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that recent signals from the White House indicating a potential easing of tariffs against China do not necessarily represent a significant advancement in US-China trade negotiations, but may instead provide Beijing with an opportunity to secure a more favorable deal. President Donald Trump's recent remarks that tariffs on Chinese goods "will not be as high as 145 per cent" and "won’t be zero" are seen as a sign of anxiety from the US side. Experts argue that China is not showing similar signs of impatience and could leverage the situation to its advantage.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its 2025 GDP projections for China, India, and Japan, citing trade tensions and "high policy uncertainty." The IMF reduced China's forecast to 4% and India's to 6.2%, while also cutting Japan's growth forecast to 0.6%. Globally, growth was lowered to 2.8%, with the IMF citing tariffs announced by the U.S. and its trading partners as a "major negative shock to growth."

This could result in slower expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS).
