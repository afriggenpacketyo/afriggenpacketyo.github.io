          <p>Jing Qian, a managing director at the Asia Society’s Centre for China Analysis, provides his perspective on recent US-China trade negotiations. He notes that de-escalation was a shared interest for both Washington and Beijing during recent talks in Geneva, as both nations sought to calm rattled markets and create breathing room. The discussions involved high-level officials, including the US Treasury Secretary and China's Vice-Premier. Qian characterizes the ongoing rivalry as complex but ultimately manageable, suggesting a path forward focused on continued dialogue and strategic compromise rather than open conflict.</p>

          <p>The D.C. National Guard has stated that its members patrolling Washington may be armed, a shift from an earlier Army announcement that they would not carry weapons. This development is part of a broader federal plan to increase law enforcement presence in the capital, a move that has drawn criticism from local officials like Mayor Muriel Bowser. While supporters, including several Republican governors, are sending their own Guard members to assist, critics voice alarm over the militarization of city streets and the potential for confrontations.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of protesters have gathered across Israel, with the largest demonstration in Tel Aviv, to demand the government secure a hostage release deal with Hamas and end the war in Gaza. The protests, which included a one-day national strike, were organized by hostage families who fear that Israel's plans to occupy Gaza City endanger the remaining captives. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the demonstrations, claiming they would only harden Hamas's position and slow down any potential release of the hostages.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after previously reaching Category 5 intensity. However, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect it to strengthen again as it moves over the Atlantic. The storm's path has prompted tropical storm warnings for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its large size is forecast to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast coast by midweek.</p>

          <p>Legendary investor Peter Lynch has offered cautionary advice, stating that people who need access to their money in one or two years should not be investing in the stock market. While he affirms that stocks have historically been the best place for long-term wealth creation, he stresses that significant returns require a much longer time horizon. Lynch also shared his strategy of looking for excellent companies in struggling industries, as fast-growing sectors often attract too much competition, which can hinder returns.

          <p>Air Canada has been forced to delay its plans to resume operations after its striking flight attendants defied a government order to return to work. The strike, which began Saturday, has stranded over 100,000 travelers and led to hundreds of flight cancellations. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) stated its members will remain on the picket lines, demanding a fair, negotiated contract that includes compensation for all hours worked, not just time spent in the air, escalating the tense labor dispute.</p>

          <p>A sniper from an elite Ukrainian unit has reportedly killed two Russian soldiers with a single bullet from a distance of 4,000 meters (approximately 2.5 miles), which would be a new world record for the longest confirmed sniper kill. The shot was allegedly made in the eastern Donetsk region using a Ukrainian-made 14.5mm Snipex Alligator anti-materiel rifle. If confirmed, this feat would surpass the previous record, also held by a Ukrainian sniper, highlighting the advanced capabilities being deployed in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that both Russia and Ukraine will need to make concessions to end the war. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Rubio emphasized that a peace deal is not equivalent to surrender and requires both sides to give up something to reach an agreement. He indicated that upcoming talks with Ukrainian and European leaders would focus on narrowing the gap between the two sides on key issues like security guarantees and territorial lines.</p>

          <p>A coalition of civil liberty and anti-racism groups is calling on London's Metropolitan Police to scrap plans to use live facial recognition (LFR) technology at the Notting Hill Carnival. In a letter to the commissioner, the organizations described LFR as a mass surveillance tool that treats attendees as suspects and has a history of being less accurate for women and people of color. The Met Police defends the technology, insisting it is accurate at the settings they use and is a necessary tool to keep the large-scale event safe.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Palestinian students from Gaza who have secured places, many with full scholarships, at top UK universities are unable to leave the territory to begin their studies. An open letter signed by nearly 5,000 academics calls on the UK government to facilitate their safe passage. The students face significant bureaucratic obstacles, including the closure of the UK's biometrics registration center in Gaza, preventing them from completing their visa applications. Advocates argue the UK should follow the lead of other European nations that have evacuated students.</p>
