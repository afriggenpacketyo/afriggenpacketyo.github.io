        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins criticized rioters in Los Angeles after a VA clinic was forced to temporarily close due to violence following ICE deportation raids. Collins stated the actions of the rioters interfered with veterans' healthcare, leading to the difficult decision to shut down the LA Ambulatory Care Center. He also accused California leaders of prioritizing the interests of illegal immigrants over law-abiding citizens, resulting in veterans paying the price. The clinic is expected to reopen once it is deemed safe, with veterans able to reschedule appointments or utilize telehealth options, as Collins affirms his commitment to prioritizing the care of veterans. Optimism about the situation remains tempered by the ongoing unrest.</p>

          <p>Approximately 700 U.S. Marines have been mobilized to support the California National Guard in Los Angeles amid protests over immigration enforcement actions. President Trump stated he would support arresting California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing these federal actions. Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced they would sue Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, arguing that the federalization of the California National Guard was unlawful and exceeded Trump's authority. The civil complaint alleges that Trump's actions violate the U.S. Constitution and occurred without Newsom's consent, leading to claims of authoritarianism and abuse of power.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is reportedly deploying hundreds of U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to address protests against government immigration raids and deportations. A U.S. official indicated that a battalion of 700 Marines from the Twentynine Palms base in southern California would be sent to Los Angeles temporarily. This deployment occurs despite a relatively quiet day of protests in the city, and there is no expectation that Trump is about to invoke the Insurrection Act. Governor Newsom criticized Trump's deployment as an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism, while the state of California announced it would file a lawsuit against the Trump administration for unlawfully federalizing the state's National Guard.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced the removal of all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations. Kennedy stated that a clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science, despite HHS agencies having rigorous policies for conflicts of interest. This decision follows other moves by Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, to alter vaccination policies in the U.S., such as stopping routine COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. Health policy experts have expressed concern that this shake-up could lead to politicized recommendations that highlight the harms rather than the benefits of vaccines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid protests in Los Angeles over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, questions arise regarding the Insurrection Act and its potential invocation. The Insurrection Act, an 1807 law, allows the president to deploy the military inside the U.S. to help civilian law enforcement with law enforcement duties under specific circumstances. While Trump has mobilized the National Guard under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which allows for federal service members to be called upon in cases of rebellion or danger thereof, he has not yet invoked the Insurrection Act. Experts warn that the Insurrection Act is overly broad and vague, leading to calls for reform to provide greater checks on presidential power.</p>

The Cardiff-born player, known for his stellar career with Wigan and Great Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, will be knighted due to concerns over his health. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy described the knighthood as an historic milestone and long-overdue recognition for rugby league's contribution to national life. Boston's knighthood follows growing frustration over the lack of top honors for rugby league, with some suggesting snobbery was a factor.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles has been the site of violent protests following immigration raids, leading to dozens of arrests and the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops by President Trump. The protests began after ICE officers conducted raids in areas with prominent Latino populations, sparking clashes between protesters and law enforcement. California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned Trump's actions, accusing him of an illegal act that was putting fuel on the fire, and has filed a lawsuit against the administration. The National Guard's role is to protect federal agents, including ICE and Department of Homeland Security personnel, as they carry out their duties.</p>

          <p>President Trump invoked Title 10 to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration officials amid protests, prompting legal challenges from California Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom argues that the deployment violates state sovereignty, leading to a lawsuit against the Trump administration. Legal experts assess that the president likely has the authority to call out the National Guard in a supportive role, but concerns remain about the potential for escalating violence and the impact on the relationship between local and federal governments. The situation differs from invoking the Insurrection Act, which would grant the National Guard more substantive authority and potentially clash with historical norms.</p>

Lively had previously filed a suit against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios, alleging sexual harassment on set and retaliation for bringing those complaints.
