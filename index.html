        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New guidelines from the Chinese government may permit companies listed in Hong Kong to pursue secondary share listings on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, a move that could broaden fundraising avenues for these companies and potentially attract more businesses to list in Hong Kong. According to analysts, this would diversify fundraising options for businesses within the Greater Bay Area, enabling them to expand operations in mainland China where their brands are better known. The dual-listing opportunity could also encourage more businesses to seek initial listings in Hong Kong, as it allows them to offer shares in both markets through a single application, further boosting Hong Kong's financial appeal. This policy shift represents a reversal of the existing A+H pathway, where mainland-listed companies can pursue dual listings in Hong Kong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Austria is in a period of national mourning after a former student carried out a mass shooting at a high school in Graz, resulting in 10 fatalities before taking his own life. Authorities discovered a non-functional homemade bomb and a farewell letter at the shooter's residence, though the letter did not reveal a motive for the attack. The incident, one of Austria's deadliest post-World War II, has prompted renewed discussions about the country's gun laws, which are less restrictive than some other European nations. Vigils are being held in Graz as the community grapples with the tragedy and seeks to support the survivors and families of the victims.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated that he regrets some of his recent social media posts about Donald Trump, acknowledging they "went too far" after a public disagreement between the two figures. This statement follows a period of heated exchanges, during which Musk criticized Trump's tax bill, leading Trump to declare their relationship over and express disinterest in reconciliation. Musk's comments reflect a softening of his stance after the former president's remarks, suggesting a possible attempt to de-escalate the conflict. The initial disagreement stemmed from differing views on economic policy and personal relations, showcasing the complexities of high-profile figures engaging in public disputes.</p>

He also mentioned that UniCredit would first seek a "constructive solution" to the opposition from the German government, which has expressed resistance to the potential takeover.

Protesters have gathered in cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle, voicing their opposition to the administration's actions and expressing solidarity with affected communities. The Trump administration has pledged to arrest thousands of migrants daily, leading to raids in various locations, which have sparked widespread outrage and calls for policy changes.

          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, has experienced a second night of unrest with fireworks and bottles thrown at police after a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. Five people have been arrested, and 17 officers were injured overnight, bringing the total to 32, as riot officers used baton rounds and a water cannon to disperse protesters. The unrest began after two teenage boys appeared in court charged with the crime, leading to what police have described as "racist thuggery." Residents have begun displaying stickers indicating their nationalities, while community leaders fear the violence is overshadowing the concern for victims of sexual violence.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that the United States is at risk of losing its dominance in space due to China's rapid advancements and potential shortsighted decisions in Washington. China is aggressively expanding its commercial satellite capabilities, which could threaten U.S. intelligence and military operations that rely on space-based assets. The article advocates for increased investment in American commercial space technology and modernization of procurement processes to maintain a competitive edge. The author stresses that cutting support for commercial space assets contradicts national security priorities and could allow China to surpass the U.S. in this critical domain.</p>

The column suggests that confident regimes do not typically resort to military force to quell protests, implying that the Trump administration's approach is a reflection of its insecurity and inability to address the underlying issues driving the demonstrations.

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 aims to consolidate the McKinney-Vento federal grant program, which supports homeless students, with 17 other programs and significantly cut funding. This consolidation would give school districts more flexibility in spending but would remove the requirement to dedicate funds specifically to resources for students experiencing homelessness. Advocates worry that this change could lead to a lack of support for homeless students, who already face higher rates of absenteeism and dropout. The proposal is currently under consideration by Congress, with some lawmakers expressing concern about the potential impact on vulnerable students.</p>

          <p>President Trump is appealing his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records, arguing that the case should be moved to federal court because it involves his official acts as president. Trump's lawyers contend that the prosecution relied on evidence related to his presidential actions, which warrants federal jurisdiction. The U.S. Department of Justice has supported the president's argument in an amicus brief. Legal scholars suggest that this appeal, based on the Federal Officer Removal Statute, is unlikely to succeed, but it represents one of many legal avenues Trump is pursuing to overturn his conviction.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics reveals a correlation between state gun laws and pediatric firearm deaths, finding that states with more permissive gun laws experienced a rise in firearm-related deaths among children and teens between 2011 and 2023. The study compared firearm deaths in states with varying levels of gun control after a landmark Supreme Court case in 2010 that affirmed the Second Amendment but allowed for state regulation. Researchers grouped states into most permissive, permissive, and least permissive categories, finding that states with the most permissive laws had a 67% relative increase in pediatric firearm deaths. The study suggests that stricter gun laws may help prevent firearm deaths in children and teens, emphasizing the importance of targeted interventions.</p>

          <p>Proxima Fusion, a German start-up, has secured 130 million euros ($148 million) in a Series A funding round, marking the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date. The company aims to develop the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant, with investors optimistic about the technology's potential role in the energy transition. Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, could provide virtually limitless clean, safe, and affordable energy if replicated at an industrial scale. However, some researchers remain skeptical about the technology's readiness for commercial use in the near future.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian examines President Trump's ongoing attacks on universities like Harvard and Columbia, tracing their roots back to the 1970s when conservatives began criticizing left-leaning professors. The article highlights Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership as a blueprint for the Trump administration's actions, which include redirecting grants to vocational schools and targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The author argues that these actions are part of a broader counter-revolution aimed at undermining universities for political reasons and benefiting trade schools and military academies. The piece suggests that university leaders must understand this history to effectively respond to the Trump administration's agenda.</p>
