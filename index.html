          <p>As recession fears rise due to new tariffs, Americans are drawing parallels to the 2008 financial crisis, seeking advice and strategies to cope with potential economic hardship. Social media platforms are seeing a surge in content creators sharing tips and recipes from past recessions, teaching others how to stretch groceries and cut costs. However, some point out that inflation has made some of these hacks less effective, as minimum wage has not kept pace with the rising cost of living. Despite the uncertainty, this communal knowledge-sharing highlights a human tendency to seek guidance and support during challenging economic times.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison after being convicted on federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors argued that Santos defrauded voters and donors by fabricating his background, using campaign funds for personal expenses, and lying to federal agencies. The judge emphasized Santos' lack of remorse and the severity of his crimes, which were seen as an affront to the electoral process and democratic institutions. Santos maintains the sentence is politically motivated and hopes for a pardon from President Trump.</p>

The report underscores the US's dependence on China for these components, despite political rhetoric, and the increasing use of these minerals in US weapons over the past 15 years.

          <p>Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy met inside St Peter's Basilica ahead of Pope Francis' funeral, marking their first encounter since a contentious meeting earlier in the year. Both sides described the meeting as productive, with Zelenskyy calling it 'very symbolic' and potentially 'historic.' The meeting comes amid ongoing negotiations between the US and Russia regarding a potential deal in Ukraine, raising hopes for a resolution to the conflict.

          <p>Upcoming local elections in England are expected to result in a fragmented political landscape, with smaller parties like Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party gaining ground at the expense of Labour and the Conservatives. This 'Anyone But the Big Parties' sentiment reflects public dissatisfaction with the major parties and their performance in government. The results could lead to more councils with no overall control, forcing parties to collaborate and potentially giving Reform UK its first opportunity to defend its policies in practice.</p>
