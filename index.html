          <p>A meteorite that crashed into a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified by scientists as being older than Earth itself. Researchers determined the rock is a chondrite meteorite, approximately 4.5 billion years old, offering a rare glimpse into the early solar system. The event, which caused a loud boom, has led to the recovery of multiple fragments, which will be studied to better understand potential asteroid threats.</p>

Many are forced to barter for food, and jobs with adequate pay are scarce, pushing some toward contract work with the Russian army. The occupying authorities are also pressuring residents to accept Russian citizenship to access social benefits, creating immense difficulties for those who refuse.</p>

          <p>Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig was found shot in her bathroom in December 2022, in a case initially reported as a suicide by her colleague, Matthew Ecker. Detectives grew suspicious due to inconsistencies, such as a dry sink where Ecker claimed to have washed his hands. The case turned when investigators found a small metal piece from the bathroom door lock underneath Pennig's body, suggesting the door was forced open before she was shot, leading to Ecker's conviction for murder.</p>

She revealed that the constant hounding left her with extreme PTSD and that she wants to protect her family from similar invasive treatment. Lohan noted that while social media now allows celebrities more control over their own narratives, the privacy and safety offered in Dubai provide a more normal life for her and her family.</p>

          <p>A sweeping bill signed by President Trump, which extends tax cuts and funds mass deportations, is shaping up to be a central issue for both parties ahead of the midterm elections. Democrats are highlighting its cuts to Medicaid and the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies, arguing it will harm working-class families and benefit the wealthy. Republicans are promoting the bill's tax relief measures and stricter work requirements for welfare programs, framing it as a fulfillment of campaign promises.</p>

          <p>A "no tax on tips" provision in President Trump's new legislative bill has generated both interest and skepticism from service industry workers.

Confusion also remains over which types of gratuities, such as automatic service charges, will qualify, and how employers will need to report them for workers to receive the benefit.

Practical steps include opting for pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products and choosing larger animals like cows over chickens to minimize the number of lives impacted.</p>

          <p>The UK is anticipating its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures expected to climb above 30C and peak at 34C (93F) early next week. A yellow heat health alert has been issued for most of England from Monday to Wednesday, as warm air is drawn up from the south. The hot and sunny weather, particularly in England and Wales, marks a significant shift from the stormy conditions experienced earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a significant increase in tourism from neighboring Turkey, with thousands arriving via new and existing ferry routes. Turkish visitors are attracted by the island's relaxed atmosphere and relative affordability compared to Turkish coastal resorts. This influx of tourists is boosting the local economy and fostering friendlier cross-border relations, even as political tensions between the Greek and Turkish governments continue to simmer over maritime and territorial disputes.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists in China has developed a new set of genome editing tools that make it significantly easier and more efficient to manipulate large fragments of DNA. This breakthrough in programmable chromosome engineering (PCE) could accelerate advancements in crop improvement by altering traits and could also open new avenues for treating genetic diseases. The technology is also seen as a key step toward the development of artificial chromosomes for applications in synthetic biology.</p>

          <p>In Shanghai, the passion of young people, particularly Gen Z, for live performances is reshaping the city's nightlife and boosting its nighttime economy. Instead of traditional nightlife, many are flocking to theaters for shows, socializing, and collecting memorabilia, with some spending a large portion of their income on these cultural activities. This trend is supported by a city government initiative aimed at enriching cultural and entertainment options to stimulate consumer spending and domestic demand.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward and Egyptian star Mohamed Salah publicly questioned European football's governing body, UEFA, over its tribute to a deceased Palestinian footballer, Suleiman al-Obeid. In response to a UEFA post mourning al-Obeid, Salah asked why the tribute failed to mention how, where, or why he died. The Palestinian Football Association reported that al-Obeid was killed by Israeli gunfire while waiting for aid in Gaza, a critical detail omitted from UEFA's statement.</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, has predicted that the robotics industry could experience its own "ChatGPT moment" within the next one to three years. He defines this breakthrough as a robot being able to perform a novel task, like cleaning a room, in an environment it has never seen before. While acknowledging that hardware is sufficiently advanced, he stated that the crucial element of "AI for embodied intelligence" is still lacking but that new approaches could lead to rapid progress.</p>

          <p>Residents in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills are being asked to cease all non-essential water use, including flushing toilets, due to a major service outage. The disruption began when a critical water control valve broke, affecting about 9,200 households during a heatwave and prompting a boil-water advisory. Officials warn that continued water use is dropping pressure in the system and could significantly delay repairs and the restoration of normal service.</p>

          <p>Northern China is currently experiencing its traditional rainy season, but recent deadly floods in Beijing have been particularly severe. This year's storms have been unusual in that they primarily affected the northern part of the capital, whereas previous major floods in 2016 and 2023 were concentrated in the south. The event marks the fifth major flood disaster to hit northern China since 2012, highlighting a recurring and severe weather challenge for the region.</p>
