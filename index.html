          <p>Defense Minister Gen Nakatani announced the discovery of a body at the reservoir crash site of an Air Self-Defense Force training jet, which went down earlier in the week carrying two personnel. The accident occurred shortly after the T-4 jet's takeoff from Komaki Air Base in Aichi Prefecture, prompting a search for the missing crew members. The discovery raises the likelihood that the body is one of the missing crew members, though details are still forthcoming as the investigation continues to unfold and the remains are identified.</p>

          <p>Direct peace negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators commenced in Istanbul, marking the first such discussions since early 2022. Despite low expectations for significant breakthroughs, the meeting is seen as a diplomatic win for President Vladimir Putin, who had resisted calls for a battlefield cease-fire as a precondition for talks. While both sides have expressed willingness to engage, skepticism remains about Russia's seriousness and the potential for any meaningful progress without direct engagement between Presidents Trump and Putin, especially with the former administration pushing for a one-on-one meeting between the U.S. and Russian leaders.</p>

          <p>International students at American universities are increasingly questioning the United States' reputation as a haven for free speech, citing concerns over immigration policies and recent detentions of students involved in pro-Palestinian protests. Many students expressed fears about traveling outside the U.S. due to potential visa issues and have started avoiding public discussions on controversial topics. Some students have even deleted social media profiles and considered transferring to universities in Canada or Europe, viewing America's commitment to free expression and intellectual openness as diminished under the current administration. This article highlights the growing unease among international students who once saw the U.S. as a place of academic freedom.</p>

          <p>The initial public offering (IPO) market shows signs of recovery, potentially benefiting Goldman Sachs' investment banking segment, which contributes significantly to its revenues. Recent successful IPOs, such as eToro's debut, have renewed optimism after a period of subdued activity due to factors like trade tensions and economic uncertainty. Cooling trade tensions and a pause on tariffs have emboldened companies to consider going public, with digital health companies also planning IPOs. The article suggests that continued market stabilization is necessary for a sustained rebound in IPOs, and while some experts remain cautious about the long-term trend of companies choosing to go public, Goldman Sachs is poised to benefit from increased dealmaking activity (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that appealing property taxes can lead to significant savings by ensuring accurate assessments. Properties are often over-assessed due to inaccuracies like incorrect square footage or outdated information about home features. Appealing involves demonstrating how the assessor incorrectly applied the assessment formula, which requires comparing your property to similar homes in the neighborhood and checking for eligibility for tax exemptions. The article provides steps to appeal, including verifying assessment accuracy, comparing with neighbors, understanding exemptions, and meeting appeal deadlines, offering homeowners a path to potentially reduce their property tax burden.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday, causing a complete shutdown of train service and affecting over 300,000 daily commuters. The strike stems from a dispute over pay raises, with the union claiming they haven't received an increase in five years and that competition pays more. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan with additional bus service, but it can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders.

          <p>HiSilicon, Huawei Technologies' chip design unit, doubled its revenue in 2024 due to the company's resurgence in the high-end smartphone market, according to Counterpoint Research. The firm's strong customer base in China and the popularity of its Pura 70 and Mate 70 series smartphones contributed to the revenue jump. HiSilicon captured 12% of the global premium Android smartphone system-on-a-chip market, up from 8% in 2023, and is likely to retain its third-place position this year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge will review the Trump administration's attempts to keep details secret in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The administration is invoking state secrets privilege and other privileges to withhold information from Abrego Garcia's attorneys, who are seeking his return. The Justice Department argues it doesn't have constructive custody over detainees in El Salvador due to a financial agreement, while lawyers for Abrego Garcia are asking for additional depositions, potentially including someone with first-hand knowledge of efforts to return Abrego Garcia from the White House.</p>

The article highlights evidence from the book, including recordings from 2017 and incidents during the 2020 campaign, that suggest Biden was struggling with his cognitive abilities. The author questions whether Biden was capable of doing the job, pointing to instances of memory lapses and reliance on notecards, and suggesting that unelected staff may have been running the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 25% tariff on imported cars has raised concerns about GM's future in South Korea, where it produces budget SUVs almost exclusively for the U.S. market. Unlike Hyundai and Kia, GM relies heavily on exports to the U.S., making it uniquely vulnerable to the tariffs, which could add up to $10,000 to the sticker price. The tariffs have resurfaced long-standing concerns that GM may ultimately leave South Korea, where it operates three factories and employs around 11,000 workers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered that flamingos' seemingly odd feeding behavior is a sophisticated application of fluid dynamics. The birds create vortices in the water with their head bobbing, chattering bills, and webbed feet, stirring up prey and trapping it for consumption. This allows them to effectively filter feed on shrimp and algae, turning what appears to be a clumsy process into a highly efficient technique. The findings could inspire improvements in human technologies like water filtration systems.</p>
