        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is reportedly nearing a vote on whether to suspend Israeli teams from international competitions due to the ongoing war in Gaza. While a majority of UEFA's executive committee is said to support the suspension, the Israel Football Federation has stated it has no indication of such a vote. The potential ban has drawn a response from the U.S. State Department, which opposes the move, and Israeli officials are reportedly working to prevent it. This follows previous calls for sanctions from the Palestinian Football Association and U.N. experts.</p>

          <p>Costco reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by strong growth in membership income and e-commerce sales. The warehouse retailer has successfully attracted a younger customer base, with nearly half of its new members being under the age of 40. This growth is attributed to the company's value proposition, expanding merchandise selection, and improved online shopping options. The company's full-year revenue saw an 8.1% increase, demonstrating its resilience and appeal to value-conscious consumers across different age groups. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned a large number of generals, admirals, and their staff from around the world for a rare, in-person meeting at Quantico, Virginia. The purpose of the meeting, called on short notice, has not been disclosed by the Pentagon, leading to speculation. Theories about the agenda range from discussions on Hegseth's previously announced plan to reduce the number of four-star officers to the rollout of the new National Defense Strategy. The meeting is considered highly unusual in its scale and lack of a publicly stated purpose.</p>

Law enforcement agencies in both states used social media to provide the public with alternative, local phone numbers for emergencies. State emergency management agencies are monitoring the situation as repair crews work to restore the critical communication infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Music producer Jack Antonoff, known for his work with Taylor Swift, has publicly condemned comments from Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino suggesting that concert tickets are "underpriced." Antonoff argued that selling tickets above face value should be illegal to eliminate market chaos and protect fans from exploitation. His criticism comes as Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster face legal challenges, including an FTC lawsuit for "illegal" resale tactics and a Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit aimed at breaking up the company. Antonoff advocates for systemic changes to make concerts more affordable for audiences.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order approving a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the United States, averting a potential ban. The agreement establishes a new U.S.-based joint venture, valued at approximately $14 billion, with parent company ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake. U.S. investors, including Oracle, will hold a majority stake and control the board, with Oracle also overseeing the app's security and hosting American user data. This arrangement is designed to satisfy the national security requirements of a law passed by Congress mandating that ByteDance divest its U.S. operations.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has started a "phased restart" of its operations after a cyberattack in August forced a complete shutdown of its IT networks and production lines. The company is now processing a backlog of supplier payments and has brought its vehicle sales and registration systems back online, though its factories remain closed. The prolonged shutdown has raised serious concerns about the financial viability of smaller businesses in JLR's supply chain. The UK government is reportedly working on a support package for these suppliers as the automaker slowly recovers.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook have urged the Supreme Court to deny President Trump's request to fire her while her lawsuit is pending. They argue that allowing her removal based on "flimsy, unproven allegations" would severely compromise the Federal Reserve's political independence, a cornerstone of U.S. economic stability. Trump seeks to oust Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies and which her lawyers suggest are a pretext following the president's criticism of the Fed's interest rate policies. The case centers on whether the president has the legal cause required by the Federal Reserve Act to remove a governor.</p>

          <p>An industry analysis from Cox Automotive has revised the 2025 U.S. new vehicle sales forecast upward to 16.1 million units, citing stronger-than-expected consumer demand. This surprising boost is attributed to buyers acting preemptively due to fears of future price increases from potential tariffs and the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits. While this has benefited automakers like General Motors and Toyota in the short term, analysts predict the sales pace will likely slow in the fourth quarter. The trend highlights how policy uncertainty is currently influencing consumer purchasing behavior in the automotive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Monthly Cost of a $40,000 HELOC Following Recent Fed Interest Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 15:39:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the estimated monthly payment for a new $40,000 home equity line of credit (HELOC) has become more affordable. With average rates now around 7.88%, a 10-year HELOC would cost approximately $483 per month, while a 15-year term would be about $379 per month. These costs are lower than they were earlier in the year and significantly less than last fall. Because HELOCs have variable rates, borrowers could see their payments decrease further if the Fed continues to cut rates as is widely expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The outcome of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black will likely hinge on several key factors, including which team achieves a fast start in the opening foursomes sessions. Historically, the team that dominates the first day has gone on to win the event. Europe's chances may depend on their ability to quiet the notoriously boisterous New York crowd, while the U.S. team looks to leverage home-field advantage. The article also weighs the experience of the European players against the American squad and considers the potential impact of President Trump's planned attendance on the event's atmosphere.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) will stop issuing paper checks to its nearly 70 million beneficiaries starting September 30, transitioning fully to electronic payments. Recipients will now receive their benefits via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card. The SSA states this move will improve efficiency, enhance security, and reduce costs, noting that paper checks are far more likely to be lost or stolen. While the shift is mandatory, the agency has confirmed it will grant exceptions and continue issuing paper checks for individuals who have no other way to receive their payments.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic's archive explores the legacy of poet Allen Ginsberg, describing him as a quintessential "American poet-buffoon" known for his ecstatic and rebellious work. It contrasts his explosive style with that of his father, Louis Ginsberg, a more formal and modest poet who was also published in the magazine. The piece highlights the mutual respect between the two, noting how Louis recognized the power in his son's poem "Howl," despite its "dirty, ugly words." It concludes by quoting Allen's moving introduction to his father's work, showcasing a deep familial and artistic connection.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has suspended certain cloud services, including Azure storage and AI capabilities, for Unit 8200, a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The decision follows the company's investigation into a report by The Guardian alleging that the unit had developed a system to track Palestinians' phone calls. Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, stated that the company's review found evidence supporting the report's claims. This action comes amid pressure from Microsoft employees protesting the use of the company's technology in the Gaza conflict and a recent U.N. commission report on Israel's actions.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has not taken a firm stance on President Trump's suggestion that public companies shift from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports. Solomon acknowledged arguments on both sides of the issue, noting that less frequent reporting could encourage a longer-term business focus but would also reduce transparency for investors. The idea, which could be implemented by the SEC, has drawn varied responses from business leaders. While some, like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, have long criticized the short-term pressures of quarterly reporting, the debate over the optimal cadence for financial disclosure remains unsettled.

          <p>For the first time, a United Nations political declaration addressing non-communicable diseases has pledged to combat dementia. This inclusion is being hailed as a "watershed moment" by advocates, as it formally recognizes dementia as a major global health challenge alongside conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The move is particularly significant for lower-income countries where awareness and support for dementia are often lacking. While the declaration is a crucial first step, advocates emphasize that the next challenge will be ensuring that governments worldwide implement tangible public health campaigns and support systems for patients and caregivers.</p>
