Kebatu had been sentenced to 12 months in prison for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, Essex. He was supposed to be transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation following his sentence. The Prison Service has launched an urgent investigation into the error, and Justice Secretary David Lammy has expressed his dismay, emphasizing that Kebatu should be deported.</p>

          <p>Actor Isabelle Tate, known for her role in "9-1-1: Nashville," passed away at the age of 23 due to complications from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), her talent agency confirmed. CMT is a group of inherited conditions that cause nerve damage, leading to weaker muscles and potential difficulties with walking, sensation, and in rare cases, breathing. Tate had previously shared her diagnosis of a progressive neuromuscular disease at age 13 and had begun using a wheelchair at times. Her family has requested that memorial contributions be made to the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association.</p>

          <p>The stock for footwear company Deckers Brands experienced a significant drop of over 12% after it lowered its sales guidance for its key brands, Hoka and Ugg. The company cited concerns that new tariffs are negatively impacting consumer demand, leading to a revised growth forecast. Hoka's growth is now projected in the low-teens percentage for fiscal 2026, down from 24% in the previous period, while Ugg's growth is expected to be in the low to mid single-digits. Executives acknowledged that U.S. consumers are showing changes in purchasing behavior due to price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility, which includes Latin America and the Caribbean Sea. This move significantly escalates the Trump administration's campaign against narcotics trafficking in the region. The deployment follows a series of recent U.S. strikes against vessels allegedly operated by drug smugglers, including one that reportedly killed six members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. This marks a major increase in military assets dedicated to counter-narcotics operations in the area.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery after ingesting between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets, which he reportedly purchased online. The magnets clamped together inside his digestive system, forming four chains that caused pressure necrosis, a condition where tissue dies due to prolonged pressure. Doctors successfully removed the magnets and a portion of his bowel, and the teen was discharged after an eight-day hospital stay. The case highlights the dangers of these small, powerful magnets, which are banned in New Zealand but still accessible online.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has responded to Hillary Clinton's criticism of a new, privately-funded ballroom construction at the White House by referencing a 2001 controversy. A White House spokesman accused the former first lady of having "stole furniture" upon leaving the White House, an incident where the Clintons returned items after a cataloging error was identified. Clinton had urged Americans to oppose the ballroom project on social media, stating, "It's not his house. It's your house."

          <p>Starting in 2025, a significant IRS rule change will affect beneficiaries of inherited IRAs, potentially triggering penalties up to 25% if ignored. Many non-spouse heirs, such as adult children, who inherited an IRA from someone who had reached the age for required minimum distributions (RMDs), must now take annual RMDs themselves. This is in addition to the existing "10-year rule," which mandates the account be fully depleted by the tenth year after the original owner's death.

          <p>Scientists are increasingly studying how certain viruses, including Ebola, Zika, and measles, can remain dormant in the human body long after a patient has recovered. These viruses can take refuge in "sanctuary sites" like the eyes, testes, and brain, which have limited immune system access. This phenomenon explains how recent Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been traced back to survivors of previous outbreaks, rather than new animal-to-human transmissions. Researchers are now focused on developing treatments that can penetrate these sites to fully eliminate the viruses and prevent both personal relapse and future transmission.</p>

Prop bets, which are wagers on specific in-game occurrences rather than the final score, are particularly susceptible to manipulation by individual athletes. Unlike fixing a game's outcome, a single player can easily alter their own performance statistics to ensure a prop bet pays out. As legalized sports betting revenue soars, lawmakers and league commissioners are expressing growing concern, with some advocating for new regulations to protect the integrity of sports.</p>

Gold prices are influenced by multiple factors, including the strength of the U.S. dollar, interest rates, and overall investor sentiment. Experts suggest that what truly matters are real yields—interest rates adjusted for inflation—as lower real yields make non-interest-bearing gold more attractive.

          <p>Dahbia Benkired, 27, has been given a whole-life sentence for the sexual assault and murder of 12-year-old Lola Daviet in Paris in October 2022. This is the harshest possible penalty in the French legal system and requires her to serve a minimum of 30 years in prison. Benkired is the first woman in France to receive such a sentence. The case, which shocked the nation, involved the discovery of Lola's body in a storage box in her apartment building's courtyard. The fact that Benkired was an Algerian immigrant under a deportation order has been highlighted by right-wing politicians in France.</p>

          <p>States including North Carolina, Missouri, Texas, and California are engaging in a rare mid-decade redistricting push that could significantly impact the 2026 midterm elections. The effort, initiated after President Trump urged Texas Republicans to find more GOP-friendly seats, has prompted retaliatory map-drawing by California Democrats. In Missouri and North Carolina, Republican-led legislatures have redrawn maps to target specific Democratic incumbents. These moves, which are being challenged by lawsuits, deviate from the standard practice of redrawing congressional maps only once per decade following the U.S. Census.</p>

This action is part of a wider crackdown on press freedom in the country, which has seen a surge in journalist detentions in recent months.

Vesia, a crucial part of the team's bullpen throughout the postseason, is dealing with what the club has described as a "deeply personal family matter." He is not expected to be placed on the Family Medical Emergency List, meaning he will be unavailable for the entire series. To fill the gap in the bullpen, the Dodgers have added right-handers Edgardo Henriquez and Will Klein to the roster, marking a significant adjustment to their pitching staff.</p>

A significant 4.1% jump in gasoline prices was a major contributor to the headline figure, but other inflationary pressures appeared more subdued.
