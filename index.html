        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A grand national cathedral project in Ghana, envisioned as a symbol of unity and gratitude, has become mired in controversy and economic hardship. Former President Akufo-Addo's pledge to God to build the cathedral if he won the presidency led to the allocation of $58 million in public funds to the $400 million project, designed by architect David Adjaye. However, construction has stalled due to Ghana's severe economic crisis, leading to accusations of corruption and mismanagement. The new government has ceased funding, dissolved the managing agency, and launched an anticorruption initiative to recover misappropriated funds, leaving the cathedral's future uncertain and highlighting the challenges of prioritizing large-scale projects during economic instability. </p>

          <p>Crimean Tatars are expressing concerns over the possibility of Crimea remaining under Russian control, fearing oppression and the loss of their homeland. They highlight historical persecution under both Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union, including deportations in 1944, and the more recent challenges since the 2014 annexation. While some express a desire for an end to the war in Ukraine, many worry that recognizing Russian control would legitimize territorial concessions and endanger those living in occupied territories, emphasizing the importance of Ukraine's refusal to recognize the annexation as a crucial link to their homeland and identity. The article presents diverse perspectives within the Crimean Tatar community, including those of refugees and soldiers fighting for Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to royal experts, Prince William is reportedly unwilling to welcome Prince Harry back into the royal family, despite Harry's recent public plea for reconciliation. Hilary Fordwich and Ian Pelham Turner suggest the rift between the brothers has widened due to Harry's public criticisms of the royal family, particularly in his memoir 'Spare' and subsequent interviews. Experts suggest that William prioritizes protecting the monarchy and views Harry's actions as detrimental. Kinsey Schofield notes that Harry and Meghan Markle's recent statements seem contradictory, further complicating the situation, while Richard Fitzwilliams believes the rift is currently unbridgeable.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Doubt Ukraine Can Replace China as Critical Minerals Supplier Despite US Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 04:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that despite a recent agreement with the United States, Ukraine is unlikely to supplant China as a primary source of critical minerals in the near future. The majority of Ukraine's mineral reserves are located in areas currently occupied by Russia, and extracting and processing the remaining resources would take years due to limited infrastructure. China controls a significant portion of the world's rare earth element reserves and refining capacity, making it difficult for Ukraine to compete in the short term. The agreement between the US and Ukraine aims to establish a fund to support natural resource projects, but significant investment and time will be needed for Ukraine to become a major player in the global critical minerals market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new impact assessment suggests that assisted deaths in England and Wales could range from 1,042 to 4,559 in the tenth year after a potential law change, representing less than 1% of all deaths. The report, intended to inform MPs debating the issue, also estimates potential NHS savings due to reduced end-of-life care costs, ranging from £5.84m to £59.6m annually after a decade. However, it also acknowledges significant costs associated with staffing and training an assisted dying service, potentially exceeding £10m annually. While supporters emphasize the importance of choice and compassion, opponents raise concerns about the potential risks to vulnerable individuals and the financial incentives for an overburdened NHS.</p>

Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is facing his first major test against a strengthened opposition, with the People's Action Party (PAP) seeking a strong mandate to navigate these challenges. The opposition Workers' Party (WP) is advocating for more scrutiny of the PAP's policies and greater efforts to address the cost of living crisis.

While Trump attributes any negative economic indicators to his predecessor, Joe Biden, he quickly takes credit for positive reports. The article suggests that Trump's erratic tariff policies have created uncertainty and confusion, impacting business investment and consumer confidence.

This research could be a major step towards creating a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives each year.

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the Hong Kong dollar, which had risen above its trading band against the US dollar due to recent capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion to stabilize the currency ahead of a potential US Federal Reserve interest rate cut. This intervention, the first in two years, reflects the HKMA's commitment to maintaining the stability of Hong Kong's currency and financial markets amid global economic uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing a series of administrative reforms aimed at modernizing the state, boosting economic growth, and consolidating power. These reforms include merging ministries, streamlining state-run media, and reducing the number of provinces and municipalities. The changes are expected to eliminate around 100,000 public sector jobs and address dysfunction caused by the party's anti-corruption campaign. The restructuring also allows the top leadership to exert more direct control over local affairs and appointments ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress in 2026.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is suing Colorado, Denver, and local leaders over "sanctuary" policies, arguing they hinder federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit claims these policies, which limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities, interfere with the federal government's ability to deport individuals here illegally. The suit references a controversial apartment complex in Aurora, alleging that sanctuary policies allowed a Venezuelan gang to seize control. Local officials dispute the extent of the gang's influence, while the governor's office maintains Colorado is not a sanctuary state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 25% import tax on car parts has come into effect in the US, increasing pressure on an auto industry already navigating a complex web of policy changes. While President Trump eased the measure in response to business concerns, the tariff is expected to raise prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs. Some companies have reported double-digit sales growth due to consumers trying to buy cars before the tariffs take effect, but companies are warning that prices will rise due to the tariffs. The new tariff is intended to incentivize carmakers to do more manufacturing in the US, but analysts predict that any immediate expansions in the US will come at the expense of production elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods imported into the US is affecting online retailers and advertising revenue for tech platforms. Temu and Shein, which heavily relied on the de minimis loophole to ship low-cost goods from China, are now subject to higher tariffs, causing them to raise prices and reduce advertising spending. This shift is expected to negatively impact Meta, Alphabet, and other tech companies that benefited from the surge in advertising revenue from these retailers, with some already experiencing a decline in spending. Temu has stopped shipping products directly from China to customers in the United States, and that its U.S. orders would now be shipped from local warehouses in America, as the business “transitions to a local fulfillment model.”</p>
