          <p>Mass protests in Indonesia have escalated significantly after a 21-year-old motorcycle taxi driver, Affan Kurniawan, was fatally run over by an armored police vehicle during student demonstrations in Jakarta. This tragic incident, which occurred near parliament, ignited widespread national outrage, leading to further violent clashes and demands for justice. President Prabowo Subianto and the national police chief have publicly apologized, ordering a thorough and transparent investigation into the "excessive actions" of officers involved. The initial wave of protests targeted a new, substantial housing allowance for parliamentarians, a decision that fueled public frustration amidst rising living costs and economic struggles for many citizens.</p>

          <p>The UK government has instructed contractor Mitie to withdraw job advertisements for craft tutors at the Heathrow immigration removal centre, following public and political backlash. These roles, which included teaching balloon-craft and cake decorating to asylum seekers, were criticized by Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp as an indefensible waste of taxpayer money that should instead be focused on deportations. Mitie defended the positions, stating they were part of contractual obligations to support the physical and mental well-being of detained individuals, referencing a report that highlighted their positive impact on managing the stresses of detention. The Home Office minister, Seema Malhotra, ultimately deemed the roles unnecessary and ordered their removal.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly on the verge of securing a €60 million (£51.8 million) deal for RB Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons, with the Netherlands international having completed his medical in England. The 22-year-old, a versatile player from Barcelona's La Masia academy, previously impressed during a loan spell at PSV and two seasons at Leipzig, contributing significantly with 22 goals and 24 assists. This potential transfer highlights Simons' status as one of Europe's most sought-after talents, following interest from other major clubs.

          <p>The NHS in England and Wales will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children from January next year, administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months alongside the MMR jab. This initiative aims to protect children from severe complications of the varicella virus and is expected to save the UK an estimated £24 million annually in lost income and productivity. The decision follows a recommendation from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which addressed previous concerns about a potential increase in shingles cases, now considered minimal. This brings the UK in line with other countries like the US, where the jab has been available for decades, marking a significant public health advancement.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened lower on Friday as investors awaited critical inflation data from major economies within the region and the United States. The pan-European Stoxx 600 saw a slight decline, with the French CAC 40 experiencing the most significant losses. Defense sector companies, however, notably gained, while British lenders faced declines amidst concerns over potential government targeting to improve public finances.

          <p>Manchester United has rejected midfielder Kobbie Mainoo's request to go on loan, asserting their valuation of the player and desire for him to contend for a first-team spot. The 20-year-old, who has seen limited Premier League action despite a recent full EFL Cup appearance, is reportedly concerned about his game time as contract extension talks have stalled. Head coach Ruben Amorim views Mainoo as competing directly with captain Bruno Fernandes for an advanced midfield role, creating a challenging path for the young England international's immediate progress within the squad. This situation highlights the intense competition for places at a top-tier club.</p>

          <p>Denmark has substantially reduced its 2025 economic growth forecast from 3% to 1.4%, primarily attributing the revision to weaker expectations for pharmaceutical leader Novo Nordisk. The economy ministry cited a notable decline in Danish exports to the U.S. early this year, driven by inventory accumulation and heightened competition impacting Novo Nordisk's market share in weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. The influence of generic medicines and U.S. tariffs also contributed to this downward adjustment. Despite the revised outlook, the ministry maintains that the overall economy remains robust, with high employment and inflation projected to stay below 2% annually, while the 2026 forecast was adjusted upwards.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has determined that Denver Public Schools violated Title IX by implementing all-gender bathrooms and allowing students to use facilities based on gender identity rather than biological sex. This finding, under the Trump administration, stems from the conversion of a girls' bathroom at East High School into an all-gender facility, a change the district had made following student input. The federal government has issued a proposed resolution demanding the district revert to sex-segregated restrooms, abandon gender identity-based policies, and adopt "biology-based definitions" for gender in Title IX practices. This ruling aligns with the administration's broader stance against gender-affirming policies in educational settings.</p>

Furthermore, it reminded investors that it remains subject to US export restrictions, which introduce significant supply chain vulnerabilities and could adversely impact its operational performance and financial stability.

          <p>Former world number one Naomi Osaka has strongly condemned comments made by Jelena Ostapenko to Taylor Townsend during their US Open second-round match, labeling them "one of the worst things you could say to a black tennis player." Ostapenko reportedly told Townsend she had "no class" and "no education" after a contentious net cord. While Townsend personally stated she did not interpret the remarks as racially motivated, she acknowledged the historical stigma faced by the Black community regarding education. Ostapenko has denied any racist intent, but Osaka highlighted the profound insensitivity of such statements within the context of a predominantly white sport.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, his first in seven years, suggests a potential easing of strained India-China relations. Despite deep historical suspicions and a widening trade deficit, both nations are facing pressures from US tariffs, prompting a reluctant move towards cooperation. Discussions are anticipated to cover trade imbalances and the diversification of supply chains, as India seeks to bolster its manufacturing capabilities while depending on China for crucial components. Although experts remain cautious about the longevity of any improved ties, the meeting could represent a significant step towards finding common ground between the two Asian giants.

This latest report targets at least 14 former staff members, some of whom are still living, building upon previous convictions of nine teachers and workers. The reform school, intended for "maladjusted" boys, instead became a site of profound trauma for many pupils, leaving deep and lasting psychological scars.

The launch represents a significant undertaking for Roscosmos, which has contended with substantial funding shortfalls and the severance of ties with the European Space Agency following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Consequently, Roscosmos has relocated its launch operations to Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, leasing the facility until 2050, as it endeavors to redefine its space program.

This leadership upheaval has triggered deep divisions over vaccine policies and led to several senior CDC officials resigning, citing frustration with the administration's approach and the "weaponizing of public health."
