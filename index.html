          <h2>Trump Criticizes Fed Chair Powell as a 'Fool' After Interest Rates Remain Unchanged</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 07:19:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has once again publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, following the central bank's decision to maintain interest rates. Trump conveyed his frustration via a Truth Social post, labeling Powell a 'fool' for not lowering rates amidst low inflation and decreasing energy costs. The Fed's decision to hold steady is based on uncertainties arising from Trump's trade policies and a desire to avoid fueling inflation. Powell has stated that Trump's criticisms will not influence the Fed's decisions, which will remain focused on economic data and stability.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. may soon unveil new trade agreements, amidst mounting pressure to finalize deals before the pause on reciprocal tariffs concludes in July. Trump highlighted a potential 'major trade deal' with a 'big, highly respected country,' followed by an agreement with the United Kingdom. Negotiations are ongoing with several countries, including Canada, Italy, India, and Japan. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipates that most of these deals will be finalized by the end of the year, though some experts predict longer negotiation timelines.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the potential impacts of an expected trade deal between the United States and Britain. The agreement, spurred by President Trump's desire to reshape global trade, aims to protect the British economy from recent tariff increases. While the deal is expected to support key sectors like the auto industry and boost consumer and business sentiment, its overall impact on the British economy may be limited. The article notes that Britain's economic growth is more significantly influenced by domestic factors and broader global economic stability.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from dismantling three federal agencies that provide assistance to public resources, minority businesses, and mediation services. Judge John McConnell sided with nearly two dozen Democratic-led states, ruling that the closings violated the separation of powers. The judge affirmed that Congress makes laws and appropriates funds, while the Executive branch implements the laws and spends the funds. McConnell had previously blocked the administration from implementing a nationwide freeze on federal grants.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses President Trump's recent announcement of a 100 percent tariff on movies made outside America, which was later retracted. The article explores the problems facing Hollywood, such as the movement of filming overseas due to cheaper labor and tax credits. While Trump aims to bring movie production back to America, tariffs are seen as a messy solution with potential backfire effects. The industry prefers tax credits as an incentive.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a 'comprehensive' trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since imposing tariffs on numerous trading partners. The agreement aims to foster closer economic cooperation between the two countries. Details are unclear, but discussions have involved lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing British taxes on U.S. technology companies. The deal would offer vindication for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cultivation of Trump.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that there is 'uncertainty' about the condition of three of 24 hostages previously believed to be alive in Hamas captivity in Gaza. His comments followed statements from President Trump that 21 hostages were alive. Hostages' families have urged Netanyahu to agree to another deal with Hamas rather than expand the Gaza offensive. Meanwhile, the military's chief of staff presented operational orders that prioritize 'defeating Hamas' over 'returning the hostages'.</p>

          <p>The United States and Britain are expected to announce a trade deal that will lower the burden of President Trump's sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Britain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the U.S. wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products.

          <p>The BBC analyzes the potential components of an expected UK-US tariff deal. While not a full trade agreement, the deal is likely to involve exemptions or lowering of tariffs on specific goods, with cars being a key focus. The UK seeks a reduction in the 25% tariff on car imports, while the US demands a cut in the UK's import tax on US cars. The agreement may also address steel and aluminum tariffs, as well as potential adjustments to the UK's digital services tax on US tech firms.</p>
