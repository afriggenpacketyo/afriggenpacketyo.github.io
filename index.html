          <p>Chinese technology firm Alibaba has revealed its plans to launch a pair of AI-powered smart glasses by the end of 2025, entering the wearable technology market. The glasses will be integrated with Alibaba's Qwen large language model and its Quark AI assistant, offering features like hands-free calling, real-time translation, and navigation. This move positions Alibaba as a direct competitor to Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses and Xiaomi's similar products. The company has not yet released details regarding the price or technical specifications of the device.</p>

          <p>U.S. chipmaker Nvidia was notably absent from the World AI Conference in Shanghai, while its Chinese competitor, Huawei, prominently displayed its Ascend AI chips. This development comes despite recent hopes that Nvidia could resume sales of its less advanced H20 chips to China. Huawei showcased its "Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD" computing system, highlighting the growing capabilities of domestic alternatives in the AI hardware space. Many exhibitors at the event demonstrated AI applications powered by local technology, signaling a reduced dependency on Nvidia for certain applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England has called up fast-bowling all-rounder Jamie Overton to its squad for the decisive fifth Test against India at The Oval. The addition provides cover for an exhausted pace attack following the demanding fourth Test in Manchester. Captain Ben Stokes indicated a need for "fresh legs," as key bowlers have faced a heavy workload with a tight turnaround between matches. Overton joins Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue as available pace options, with England needing to avoid defeat to secure a series victory.</p>

          <p>A former sanitation worker from the Dharmasthala temple in Karnataka, India, has made shocking allegations, claiming he was forced to dispose of hundreds of bodies over two decades. In a police complaint, he stated that many of the deceased, including underage girls, showed signs of sexual assault and violence. He alleges that temple supervisors covered up the crimes and threatened him into silence. The confession has prompted the state government to form a Special Investigation Team and has led families of missing persons to demand their cases be reopened.</p>

          <p>Joseph Czuba, the 73-year-old Illinois landlord sentenced to 53 years in prison for a fatal hate crime, has died in custody. Czuba was convicted of murdering 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi and attempting to murder his mother, Hanan Shaheen, in October 2023. Prosecutors demonstrated that Czuba targeted the family because they were Muslim, motivated by the then-recent outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The brutal attack, in which the boy was stabbed 26 times, drew national attention and renewed fears of anti-Muslim discrimination in the United States.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Dubai are conducting a widespread crackdown on illegally sublet and partitioned apartments, citing fire safety concerns. This action is displacing numerous low-wage migrant workers who rely on these crowded, jerry-rigged living spaces as their only affordable housing option. With rents in the booming city-state soaring, many workers earning only a few hundred dollars a month have nowhere else to go. The campaign, intensified after a high-rise fire, highlights the stark contrast between Dubai's luxury image and the precarious living conditions of the foreign laborers who sustain its economy.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Automakers Face Greater Threat from Chinese Competition Than from US Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 00:01:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a new trade deal lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports to 15%, industry experts suggest the more significant challenge for Japan's carmakers is the rise of Chinese competitors. Chinese auto brands are rapidly gaining market share globally, including in Southeast Asia and Australia, which have traditionally been strongholds for Japanese companies like Toyota and Honda. China's dominance in electric vehicles and critical components is intensifying the pressure. This competitive threat, combined with domestic economic challenges in Japan, creates a difficult outlook for the country's automotive sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After more than seven decades of scientific research and expeditions, China has officially launched the Yarlung Tsangpo River downstream hydropower project in Tibet. The groundbreaking ceremony for what is anticipated to be the world's most powerful dam was announced by Premier Li Qiang in the city of Nyingchi. The project's history dates back to the first comprehensive scientific expeditions to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the 1950s.
