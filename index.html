The author recounts a maddening ordeal with a car warranty, using it as a case study for a wider problem of dropped calls, unhelpful agents, and dead-end support systems that are frequently by design. This corporate strategy, aimed at saving money and discouraging claims or cancellations, contributes to widespread consumer rage and a sense of powerlessness in an increasingly automated and impersonal service economy.</p>

          <p>An article argues that many liberals operate within a "misinformation bubble" concerning youth gender medicine, repeating claims that are not supported by evidence and have even been conceded by leading advocates. The piece points to the "transition or suicide" narrative, which was admitted to lack evidence in a Supreme Court hearing, and the assertion of thorough patient assessments, which is contradicted by some clinics' practices. It suggests that political polarization has prevented an honest appraisal of the weak evidence base for medical transition in minors.</p>
