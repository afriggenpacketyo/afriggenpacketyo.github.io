          <p>China's stock market rebound is under pressure due to revived U.S.-China trade tensions, specifically new tariff threats from Washington. Analysts warn that investor optimism, which had driven Chinese shares to multi-year highs, could quickly unravel without geopolitical stability. The possibility of a deep recession or depression looms if neither side de-escalates, as markets were unprepared for a renewed confrontation. Goldman Sachs suggests the uncertainty spans various scenarios, raising risks of market-negative outcomes, while some Chinese equities were already considered "overbought."

          <p>Major oil companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, and BP are grappling with strategic choices as crude prices weaken, impacting their "monster profits" from 2022. These firms, which previously rewarded shareholders with high dividends and buybacks, now face pressure to cut costs, potentially reducing share buybacks or even dividends. Analysts suggest that while trimming buybacks is the easier option, a dividend cut would significantly rattle Wall Street. The industry is assessing how to sustain returns in a lower-price environment, with some already announcing plans to reduce shareholder returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has denounced the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods as "double standards" and warned of unspecified countermeasures, stating it is "not afraid" of a trade war. The commerce ministry criticized U.S. export restrictions while defending China's rare earth controls as national security measures. This escalation follows President Trump's comments linking the tariff threat to China's "hostile" rare earth policies, rekindling fears of a broader trade conflict that previously saw triple-digit tariffs. The uncertainty also impacts a potential meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>Paramjit Singh, a 48-year-old US green card holder with a brain tumor and heart condition, has been detained by US immigration authorities for over two months. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) cites two decades-old cases, which his family and lawyer dispute as either inactive or mistaken identity. His family is deeply worried about his delayed second brain tumor surgery and lack of proper medical care in detention. This case highlights broader concerns about the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which critics argue targets individuals without serious criminal records.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump is considering sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, describing it as a "new step of aggression" against Russia. This contemplation follows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's repeated requests for enhanced military capabilities to launch counter-attacks against Russian forces. Moscow has previously issued strong warnings that providing such advanced missiles, which boast a range of 2,500 km and could potentially reach the Russian capital, would lead to a significant escalation of the ongoing conflict and severely strain US-Russian relations. Trump indicated he might engage in discussions with Russia regarding this possibility if the war continues without a settlement.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study, published in Cell Metabolism, indicates that fathers can epigenetically transmit the benefits of exercise to their children. Research on mice showed that offspring of exercised fathers displayed improved muscle mass, lower body fat, and stronger bones, while those with inactive fathers performed worse. The team from Nanjing University and Nanjing Medical University also found that injecting sperm microRNAs from exercised mice into fertilized eggs reproduced these beneficial traits. This groundbreaking discovery suggests a "cost-effective route to improve offspring health" through paternal exercise.</p>

          <p>Ahmed al-Sharaa, the new Syrian President and former al Qaeda affiliate leader, faces immense challenges in stabilizing and rebuilding a fractured Syria. Overthrowing the Assad regime, al-Sharaa, once designated a U.S. global terrorist, now seeks to unify the country, protect minorities, and lift economic sanctions. He discusses his past, his break from al Qaeda, and his vision for rebuilding devastated communities, estimating costs at $600-900 billion. Despite engaging with President Trump and the UN, skepticism persists regarding his transformation and ongoing sectarian violence, underscoring the need for significant international support.</p>

          <p>Mutassim Abdulsatir, a survivor of Syria's notorious Sednaya prison, has recounted the terrifying violence and systematic abuses he endured under the Assad regime. He described routine beatings, starvation, and witnessing cellmates die daily, often forced to sleep next to their bodies. Human rights organizations have extensively documented mass executions, torture, and deprivation of basic necessities within Sednaya's walls. Abdulsatir's harrowing testimony reveals the industrialized nature of human rights abuses, with bodies often dumped into mass graves. He hopes the prison can be transformed into a museum and memorial, seeking justice for the countless victims.</p>

          <p>Retired four-star General Tim Haugh, former head of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, warns that China has extensively hacked America's critical infrastructure, including water, electrical power, and transportation systems. Haugh states that China is targeting every American with these capabilities, going against international norms, with no economic or intelligence-collection value other than preparing for crisis or conflict. He revealed intrusions in utilities dating back five years, emphasizing the national threat and China's strategy to cause domestic distraction during potential Indo-Pacific conflicts. The scale of these dormant pre-positions is a significant challenge for U.S. cyber defense.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that adults often lose half their friends every seven years due to shifting life stages and priorities, leading to "relational loneliness." Experts emphasize honest communication, vulnerability, and creativity in maintaining connections, rather than waiting for "perfect moments." Psychologist Dr. Marisa Franco advises embracing "messy" lives and integrating friends into daily routines, even mundane ones. The article highlights the significant health benefits of a broad social circle and encourages overcoming "learned loneliness" from the pandemic by actively engaging, reminding individuals that they are often more liked than they perceive.</p>

          <h2>Thermal Cameras Reveal Stress Levels Through Facial Temperature Changes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are using thermal cameras to study stress, discovering that a drop in nose temperature can objectively measure stress levels. During an experimental stress test, participants' noses dipped by 3-6 degrees as blood flow shifted away from the nose towards eyes and ears, a physical reaction to perceived danger. This non-invasive technique, which can also monitor recovery, is hailed as a "game changer" for stress research. It holds potential for managing harmful stress levels and monitoring stress in non-communicative individuals, including great apes in sanctuaries.</p>

          <h2>Major "Dieselgate" Lawsuit Against Five Carmakers Begins in UK High Court</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:26:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant class action lawsuit has commenced in the UK High Court against five major carmakers—Mercedes, Ford, Peugeot/Citroën, Renault, and Nissan—accused of cheating on emissions tests. This "dieselgate" scandal alleges the companies used "defeat devices" to reduce harmful gas emissions only during test conditions, potentially affecting 1.6 million car owners. The case follows Volkswagen's previous settlement over similar claims, with lawyers arguing the carmakers deceived consumers and contributed to dangerous pollution levels. The companies deny the accusations, asserting their systems are technically and legally justifiable.</p>
