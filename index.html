          <p>The Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed Dr. Kevin O'Connor, former President Biden's White House physician, to testify regarding Biden's health and fitness for office. Representative James Comer seeks details about O'Connor's assessments and relationship with Biden, suggesting the committee aims to determine if there was an effort to conceal Biden's fitness from the public. O'Connor's lawyers initially declined the request, citing patient confidentiality, but Comer argues these concerns lack merit. The inquiry has expanded to include Biden's mental acuity and circumstances surrounding his withdrawal from the 2024 election, as well as claims regarding the use of an autopen, which Biden vehemently denies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour government is set to introduce regulations requiring developers to install solar panels on the majority of new homes in England, with Energy Secretary Ed Miliband championing the move as "common sense." The regulations, part of the Future Homes Standard, aim to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, potentially saving households £500 annually on energy bills. While the Home Builders Federation supports the initiative, they caution against overly burdensome paperwork that could hinder the construction of new homes. The government plans to publish the detailed rules in the autumn, including potential exemptions and coverage percentages for solar panels.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is challenging President Trump's ban on foreign students, arguing it is illegal retaliation for the school's rejection of White House demands. The university asserts that the ban, which blocks international students from coming to the U.S. to study at Harvard, is an attempt to circumvent a previous court order. Harvard claims the action is not to protect national interests but to pursue a vendetta against the university. The lawsuit alleges that the ban would affect thousands of students scheduled to attend the campus for summer and fall terms, who make up about a quarter of the school's student body.</p>

          <p>The family of a Florida teenager, allegedly tortured and murdered by a man she met on Grindr, is suing the app, claiming her death could have been prevented with better safety measures. The lawsuit alleges that Grindr's lax age verification and precise geolocation features contributed to the girl's death. The suit claims the app only requires a self-reported birthdate, with no cross-checking against official documentation or third-party verification at sign-up. The family seeks $750,000 and demands Grindr implement more robust age verification measures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his claims, without evidence, that former President Joe Biden's aides illegally used an autopen to enact policies Biden didn't support. Trump claimed he could identify which executive orders were signed with an autopen and that aides used it to implement "open borders" and transgender rights policies. Biden has denied the allegations, calling the probe "nothing more than a mere distraction." House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has issued a subpoena to Biden's physician as part of an investigation into Biden's cognitive state.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that anti-discrimination laws apply equally to all employees, regardless of whether they are part of a majority or minority group. The justices rejected the notion that members of a majority group must provide more evidence of discrimination to sue and win. The ruling revives a lawsuit brought by a heterosexual woman who claimed she was discriminated against by a lesbian supervisor. The court clarified that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination against "any individual" based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex, including sexual orientation.</p>
