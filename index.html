        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kroger has voluntarily recalled two deli pasta salads, "Basil Pesto Bowtie Salad" and "Smoked Mozzarella Penne Salad," due to potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination. This action follows an FDA announcement and a prior recall of pasta ingredients from Nate's Fine Foods, the manufacturer. The affected products were distributed across 1,860 Kroger Family of Stores in 31 states. Customers who purchased these items are urged to return them for a refund, as Listeria infections can cause severe symptoms, including fevers, headaches, and seizures, posing higher risks for pregnant individuals, newborns, and the elderly.</p>

          <p>Japanese equities saw a significant rise, leading gains across Asia, after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader. Takaichi, poised to become Japan's first female prime minister, is expected to advocate for a "high-pressure economy" and maintain accommodative monetary policies. Analysts anticipate her administration will shift towards expanding investment and demand through public-private partnerships. This political development also led to a weakening of the Japanese yen against the dollar, reflecting market reactions to her anticipated economic strategies.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has urged mediators to "move fast" in Gaza peace talks, as indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel are set to begin in Egypt. Hamas has reportedly agreed to some elements of a 20-point US peace plan, including hostage releases, but seeks further negotiations on other issues. Despite Trump's call for Israel to halt bombing, Israeli airstrikes continued in Gaza, destroying residential buildings and causing more casualties. The talks, involving US, Qatari, and Egyptian envoys, are considered crucial for potentially ending the prolonged conflict, amidst deep mistrust and significant humanitarian concerns in Gaza.</p>

The Commanders secured the win with a 99-yard drive, while the Chargers, despite an early 10-0 lead, conceded 27 unanswered points. Rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt was instrumental for Washington, gaining 150 combined yards and two touchdowns. The Chargers also grappled with a patchwork offensive line due to multiple injuries, contributing to their struggles in maintaining momentum and protecting Herbert.</p>

          <p>A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration, alleging that the Department of Education compelled employees to use partisan out-of-office email messages blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. The lawsuit, filed by the American Federation of Government Employees, argues this violates federal employees' First Amendment rights by forcing them to parrot political talking points. The administration defended the messages as factual, while ethics experts suggest they may violate the Hatch Act. This legal challenge is the first of its kind against the administration's use of political messaging in government communications during the ongoing shutdown.</p>

          <p>Russell Martin's brief and tumultuous 17-game tenure as Rangers head coach has concluded, marked by fan protests and a police escort after a recent draw. Despite a promising interview that secured him the role, Martin's team struggled, winning only one of seven league matches and suffering a humiliating Champions League exit. This article critically examines his performance, noting his tendency to blame others and the club's significant transfer spending under new American owners. Martin's departure, the fourth manager change in less than three years, highlights deeper dysfunction within the Ibrox club, leaving them searching for a new direction.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is set to restart some production this week, beginning with its Wolverhampton engine factory, following a significant cyber-attack in late August. The attack forced JLR to shut down operations across its UK, Slovakia, China, and India sites, impacting 30,000 direct employees and 200,000 supply chain workers. The disruption, costing an estimated £50 million weekly in lost production, led the government to underwrite a £1.5 billion loan guarantee for suppliers. While a recovery program is underway, full operational capacity is expected to take several weeks, with experts warning of ongoing supply chain challenges.</p>

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that most Americans, across party lines, do not believe the current government shutdown is justified by either party's positions. Public concern primarily centers on the shutdown's potential economic impact, with President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans all receiving net negative approval for their handling of the situation. The poll also highlights persistent public dissatisfaction with the Trump administration's focus on tariffs over lowering prices. Overall, the findings suggest a public weary of political gridlock and its perceived negative consequences on the economy and federal employees.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Salah's reduced defensive work rate is becoming a "little problem" for Liverpool, particularly against stronger teams, according to football analyst Danny Murphy. While Salah's role often allows him to conserve energy for attacking, the players behind him are not adequately covering his defensive gaps, leading to 2v1 overloads on the right flank. This tactical imbalance was evident in a recent loss to Chelsea and could be exploited by top sides. Despite concerns about team control and recent losses, Murphy believes the issues are resolvable, and Salah's scoring form will improve as the team rebuilds and players reach peak fitness.</p>

Cramer notes the unprecedented runs of certain tech stocks, often unprofitable, driven by a new generation of investors. Despite the perceived magic and belief in these companies, he advises investors to take profits, especially after significant gains, to secure fortunes before the "year of magical investing" inevitably ends.

          <h2>Conservatives Propose £47 Billion Public Spending Cuts Over Five Years</h2>

          <p>The Conservatives are set to announce plans for £47 billion in public spending cuts over five years, targeting welfare, foreign aid, and civil service jobs. Shadow Chancellor Sir Mel Stride will emphasize the necessity of these cuts, including stopping welfare claims for individuals with "low-level mental health problems" and reducing civil servant numbers by a quarter. The proposals also involve cutting aid spending to 0.1% of national income. These measures aim to address rising health and disability benefit costs, though some critics warn against ignoring age-related spending like pensions, while others condemn the aid cuts as "morally indefensible."</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests China should shift its economic strategy from being the world's largest exporter to becoming the largest importer within the next five to ten years. This strategic pivot, to be discussed in the upcoming 15th five-year plan, aims to accelerate China's transition to a consumption-driven economy and address structural imbalances. Since surpassing Germany as the largest exporter in 2009 and the US as the largest trading nation in 2013, China's export dominance has propelled its economic growth. This proposed shift carries profound geopolitical and economic implications, signaling a new era focused on domestic consumption.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced he will sue the White House to prevent President Trump from deploying California National Guard members to Portland. This follows a federal judge's temporary order blocking Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard, citing insufficient justification and potential constitutional overreach. Newsom condemned Trump's actions as a "breathtaking abuse of the law and power," accusing the administration of ignoring court orders. The White House, however, defended the deployment as lawful, necessary to protect federal assets, and criticized Newsom for not supporting law-abiding citizens.</p>

The situation escalated when the driver, fearing for his life, used pepper spray and then a knife, striking Sanchez multiple times. Both men were hospitalized, with Sanchez in critical condition.

Rising water levels made the initial exit impassable, forcing a difficult retracing of steps. Despite being cold and wet for 42 hours, none of the men were injured, though they were exhausted.
