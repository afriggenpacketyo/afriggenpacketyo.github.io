          <p>Advocacy groups are organizing a second wave of "No Kings" protests across the United States to demonstrate against perceived abuses of power by the Trump administration. The rallies address issues such as immigration policies and the deployment of troops to American cities, with organizers anticipating millions of participants. Republicans have criticized the events, labeling them "Hate America" rallies and linking them to the ongoing federal government shutdown. Organizers counter that the protests are a patriotic exercise of First Amendment rights against authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured a victory in the United States Grand Prix sprint race in Austin, capitalizing on an early collision that eliminated both McLaren drivers. Title contenders Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri crashed on the first lap after Piastri made contact with another car, taking both out of the race. The incident intensified the focus on the intra-team rivalry at McLaren, which had emphasized that its drivers were free to race as long as they did not collide. Verstappen's win significantly narrows his points deficit in the championship standings.</p>

          <p>The case of Alex Murdaugh, a once-powerful South Carolina attorney convicted of murdering his wife and son, is being revisited in a new Hulu limited series. The double homicide in June 2021 unraveled a complex web of financial crimes, corruption, and deceit that spanned decades, ultimately exposing Murdaugh's double life. Investigations into his financial dealings, including stealing millions from his late housekeeper's family, were key to uncovering his motives. Murdaugh is now serving two consecutive life sentences for the murders, marking a dramatic end to his family's legal empire.</p>

Douglass, the only elected official known to be involved, faced pressure from Governor Phil Scott and other party leaders to step down. In the leaked chats, Douglass made derogatory comments about an Indian woman and was involved in an exchange containing an antisemitic remark from his wife. In his resignation statement, Douglass apologized for the offense caused and cited threats against his family.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in cities across the United States and at U.S. embassies worldwide for "No Kings" protests against President Trump's administration. Organizers report over 2,700 planned events, with millions expected to participate, voicing anger over policies they deem authoritarian. The protests mirror similar large-scale demonstrations from June, prompted by actions like the deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities. Republican leaders have dismissed the events as "Hate America" rallies, while organizers maintain they are exercising their right to peaceful protest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to transfer two survivors from a U.S. military strike on a suspected narcotics-trafficking vessel in the Caribbean to another country. This decision avoids the legal complexities of long-term military detention for individuals not covered under the laws of war. The strike, which occurred on Thursday, destroyed a semi-submersible vessel and killed two other crew members. The survivors were rescued and temporarily held on a U.S. Navy warship, and officials expect they will be repatriated to their home countries.</p>

Huerta was arrested during a protest against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid in Los Angeles earlier this year and was initially charged with felony obstruction. Supporters, including the AFL-CIO and California Governor Gavin Newsom, condemned the arrest as a politically motivated abuse of power by the Trump administration.

          <p>Following a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, experts project that rebuilding the Gaza Strip will be a monumental task, potentially costing $70 billion and spanning several decades. The two-year war resulted in immense destruction, with assessments indicating that over 80% of buildings in Gaza City alone were damaged or destroyed. Key infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, and water systems, has been devastated, posing severe challenges for survival and recovery. The international community, including the U.S., European, and Arab nations, has shown willingness to fund the reconstruction effort.</p>

          <p>The influential musician D'Angelo, born Michael Eugene Archer, has died at age 51 after a battle with pancreatic cancer, leaving behind a profound legacy in R&B and soul music. Known for his landmark albums "Brown Sugar," "Voodoo," and "Black Messiah," he was a pivotal figure in the neo-soul movement, though he preferred to describe his work simply as "Black music." D'Angelo's career was marked by both immense critical acclaim and a famous 14-year hiatus, driven by discomfort with his public image and personal struggles. His music masterfully blended the sacred and profane, drawing on gospel, funk, and hip-hop to create a unique and enduring sound.</p>

The study found this pattern was consistent across various media outlets, regardless of their political orientation. Criminologists argue this "migrantization" of crime is misleading, as risk factors are tied to poverty and lack of opportunity, not nationality.</p>

          <p>A new study from the Kinsey Institute challenges the stereotype that women are more eager to commit to relationships, finding that men are more likely to want to move in together or marry sooner. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found that financial savings were a key motivator for men. Experts suggest that beyond finances, men often rely more heavily on romantic relationships for their primary social and emotional support, a trend linked to traditional notions of masculinity that can limit their other intimate friendships. Consequently, men report lower psychological well-being when single compared to women.</p>

          <p>A NASA astrophysicist has proposed a new solution to the Fermi Paradox, suggesting the lack of contact with alien civilizations is due to "radical mundanity." In his paper, Robin Corbet theorizes that other intelligent life in the Milky Way is likely only slightly more advanced than humans and faces similar technological and financial limitations to interstellar travel and communication. This view posits that aliens, finding space exploration too slow and costly, eventually abandon the effort, explaining why we don't observe technosignatures like megastructures. This contrasts with more dramatic theories like the "dark forest" or "zoo" hypotheses.</p>

          <p>Efforts are underway to repair the external power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, according to the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. The plant, which is Europe's largest, has been relying on backup diesel generators for four weeks after its last power line was severed, creating a precarious safety situation. The IAEA stated that both Russian and Ukrainian forces engaged constructively to establish ceasefire zones, allowing the complex repairs to proceed. Although not in service, the plant requires constant power to cool its reactors and prevent a potential nuclear incident.</p>

          <p>Zions Bancorporation's stock value dropped by $1 billion after the company disclosed it had made $60 million in loans that are unlikely to be repaid, sparking wider fears about the regional banking sector. Its subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, has filed a lawsuit alleging a "sweeping betrayal of trust" by the managers of several investment funds. The bank claims the borrowers manipulated the loan structures, secretly subordinated the bank's claim on collateral, and effectively eliminated the assets meant to secure the loans. The discovery was made after a related fund was sued for fraud by another bank. (not investment advice)</p>

Greene emphasizes that applying is a numbers game and recommends submitting applications for 100 to 200 scholarships to increase the odds of success.
