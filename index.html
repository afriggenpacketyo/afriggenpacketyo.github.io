          <p>Ukrainian drones attacked Moscow for the second consecutive night, disrupting preparations for Victory Day celebrations, which Chinese President Xi Jinping and other world leaders are expected to attend. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reported that at least 19 Ukrainian drones were shot down en route to the capital, with debris falling on a major highway, while Russian aviation authorities suspended flights at four airports. Ukraine has continued its drone barrages into Russia as the country prepares to mark Victory Day, prompting authorities in occupied Crimea to cancel their planned Victory Day parade due to security concerns. Zelenskyy warned that Kyiv could not guarantee the safety of anyone traveling to attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow, adding that Russia could orchestrate provocations to blame Ukraine. </p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a surge after the fashion retailer announced a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales, while also reaffirming its full-year guidance amidst macroeconomic and tariff uncertainty. Revenues fell 2% on a currency-adjusted basis, primarily due to weaker demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China. The company is closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and trade tensions, and is prepared to respond flexibly to changing circumstances. Hugo Boss has been implementing a strategic overhaul to revive consumer demand, with improvements in store formats, product diversification, and engagement with younger consumers, although womenswear remains a weak spot. </p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, a corporate lawyer turned politician, is attempting to become Germany's next chancellor at a challenging time for the nation, facing a stagnant economy and strained relations with the United States. Despite his party's victory in the February national election, Merz fell six votes short in the initial parliamentary vote, signaling the difficulties ahead. He has criticized President Trump and aims to lead a stronger Europe, even breaking a campaign promise on fiscal restraint to bolster national defense. Some observers praise his agility and potential, while others criticize his inconsistency and alienation of his conservative base, as the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) gains traction in the polls. </p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative leader, unexpectedly failed to secure the required majority in parliament to become chancellor, receiving only 310 votes out of the 630-seat Bundestag. This significant blow comes two and a half months after his party won the federal elections, raising questions about the cohesion within his coalition with the center-left. Despite having enough seats in parliament, 18 MPs who were expected to support him dissented, marking an unprecedented failure in modern German history. The Bundestag now has 14 days to choose Merz or another candidate as chancellor, highlighting the challenges he faces in forming a stable government.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in "foreign countries" has generated confusion and concern in Hollywood, with industry leaders questioning the practicality and impact of such measures. The move, seemingly influenced by discussions with Jon Voight, aims to restore US film production but lacks clear details on implementation. Experts argue that the streaming industry and the pandemic are bigger threats to US cinema admissions than foreign tax breaks, and that tariffs could harm the industry by increasing costs for consumers and stalling production plans. The threat of tariffs, even if not fully implemented, is already causing unease and potentially damaging the film industry.</p>

          <p>After a decade of prioritizing "supply-side reform," China is signaling a potential shift towards boosting domestic consumption, as indicated by recent policy statements from the Communist Party's Politburo. President Xi Jinping introduced the concept in 2015, focusing on boosting productivity, eliminating excess capacity, and cultivating new technologies. The shift comes as China has become a powerhouse in emerging sectors, including electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, but faces challenges in translating supply-side success into strength in demand. Policymakers are now emphasizing the "four stabilities" – employment, enterprises, markets, and expectations – while acknowledging the need to boost household income and consumption. </p>

          <p>The UK government announced a plan to modernize 1,000 GP practice buildings in England, allocating £102m to expand and improve surgeries, with work set to begin this summer. This investment aims to address record-low satisfaction levels with GP services and reports indicating that two in five practices are not fit for purpose. Health Secretary Wes Streeting described the plan as a "significant step" towards tackling waiting lists and improving patient services. The Royal College of GPs welcomed the funding as an "encouraging interim measure," but emphasized the need for long-term investment to address inadequate infrastructure and improve patient experience. </p>

          <p>Royal experts suggest that King Charles' trust in Prince Harry has been shattered beyond repair due to Harry's public airing of private family matters. Despite missing his grandchildren, the King reportedly has no plans to reconcile with Harry anytime soon, viewing his approach as undignified and contrary to basic decency. Harry's interviews, books, and television appearances detailing family disputes are seen as a violation of royal norms, further alienating him from his family and the British public. While Harry seeks reconciliation and believes security concerns are the primary obstacle, experts argue that his actions have caused irreparable harm and that he is primarily serving himself rather than his country.</p>

The annual Human Development Index (HDI) report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) warns that this slowdown could set human development back by decades. UNDP chief Achim Steiner attributed the situation to recent cuts in international aid, particularly by the United States under President Donald Trump, which exacerbate the ramifications. The report also highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revitalize development, but cautions that its benefits must be shared equitably to avoid deepening divides. </p>

Israel maintains that its objective is the return of hostages and the "dismantling and decisive defeat" of Hamas.</p>

          <p>Jon Voight has reportedly provided President Trump with a partial roadmap to aid the Hollywood film industry, following Trump's desire to impose tariffs on foreign-made films. The proposal includes federal tax incentives, tax code changes, co-production treaties with other countries, and infrastructure subsidies for cinema owners, film and television production companies, and post-production companies. Voight, one of Trump’s “special ambassadors” to Hollywood, claimed that many Americans have lost jobs to productions that have gone overseas. The plan aims to level the playing field so that producing in America is not only a competitive option but the first choice.</p>

          <p>Police in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong have arrested a driver after a car ploughed into a crowd of people at a bus stop on Sunday afternoon. The incident occurred during the May Day holiday, and questions remain about the number of casualties and whether it was a deliberate “lone wolf” attack. Authorities in the city of Tengzhou confirmed the crash and the driver's detention but have not released further details. The lack of official information initially drew criticism, with concerns raised about transparency in the aftermath of the incident.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's Champions League fate hinges on which version of Gianluigi Donnarumma they face in France, whether he will be the "calamity keeper" or the "human wall." After PSG escaped Emirates Stadium with a 1-0 win due to Donnarumma's shot-stopping, Arsenal must score at Parc des Princes to advance. While Donnarumma's form has improved, his supposed weaknesses have lingered in PSG's domestic season, with mistakes in Ligue 1 games. Despite this, Donnarumma has been the scourge of Liverpool and Aston Villa in Europe this season and helped Italy overcome England in the Euro 2020 final.</p>

          <p>After the Miami Grand Prix, Ferrari team principal Frederic Vasseur addressed concerns about the team's performance, stating that the car's pace was a match for Red Bull and Mercedes but they paid the price for poor grid positions. The team struggled to get the best out of new tires, causing them to qualify poorly. Ferrari is planning to introduce some small upgrades at the next two races in Imola and Monaco, and hopes that stricter rules on front wing deflection will make a difference. Vasseur remains confident that Ferrari can improve, drawing on their progress with upgrades in previous seasons.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's ordered his armed forces to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027, if necessary, but an ongoing purge of top military ranks casts doubt on that deadline. Over the past two years, two defense ministers and senior People’s Liberation Army officers have been removed, including top leaders of the Rocket Force. The dismissals raise questions about the competence and reliability of Mr. Xi’s military commanders, which may weaken his appetite for war, offering Taiwan and the United States time to strengthen their defenses. China's military has been rehearsing an invasion or blockade of Taiwan for years, but military effectiveness depends heavily on experienced commanders, which China lacks. </p>

          <p>In recent years it has become more appealing for the children of senior officials to follow their parents into the public sector in China. At the height of China’s rapid economic growth and embrace of globalisation it was unusual for the children of senior officials to follow their parents into the public sector. Government jobs are seen as decent and secure, but they are low-paid and demanding, and there are more constraints on personal choices compared to those in the private sector. The trend appears to be reversing in recent years as the ruling Communist Party has tightened the rules around officials and their families as part of its sprawling anti-corruption drive, and amid a slowing economy.</p>

Medics administered a sedative before detaching him and applying a tight bandage to the wound, and he was then taken to a local hospital in critical condition. The man, who is also reported to be a resident of Taiwan, underwent emergency surgery and received 80 stitches to close the wound.</p>

          <p>Officials in Russia say President Vladimir Putin will deliver a speech Friday at what is being billed as the "grandest" Victory Day parade ever to mark 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Putin has elevated the May 9 celebration throughout the course of his 25-year reign, framing it as a massive celebration of Russian patriotism. He has also sought to justify his own war of aggression in neighboring Ukraine as a mission to "de-Nazify" the country — echoing the "Great Patriotic War" against Nazi Germany. Kyiv has also denounced a Russian three-day ceasefire coinciding with the event as a gimmick "for the parade," noting that Moscow has ignored US calls for a 30-day pause to facilitate peace talks, continuing instead to shell Ukraine daily despite international outcry over the three-year invasion.</p>
