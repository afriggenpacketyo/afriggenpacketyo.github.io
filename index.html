            <p>A coroner in Lancashire is urging the UK government to reassess eyesight regulations for motorists, deeming the current self-reporting system "ineffective and unsafe" after inquests into four deaths caused by drivers with impaired vision. The coroner's report highlights that the UK is one of the few European countries without mandatory visual checks for drivers throughout their licensing period, raising concerns about public safety. Families of the victims expressed their grief and frustration, emphasizing that the tragedies were avoidable and calling for stricter enforcement of visual standards. The government has acknowledged the need for reassessment and will consider changes as part of its road safety strategy.</p>

            <p>A 20-year-old Florida State University student, Phoenix Ikner, opened fire on campus, killing two and injuring six others before being shot by police.

Investigators are searching for a motive, and it has been revealed that the suspect's stepmother is a local sheriff's deputy, and he had access to one of her weapons. The university has canceled classes and sporting events through the weekend, and a vigil is planned. President Trump addressed the shooting by affirming his support for the Second Amendment.</p>

The Nintendo Switch 2 will cost $449.99 in the U.S., with a bundle including "Mario Kart World" priced at $499.99. Accessories for the new console will see slight price increases.

            <p>Phoenix Ikner, the suspect in the Florida State University shooting, was involved in a long custody battle between his birth parents, according to court records. The weapon used in the shooting was a former service weapon belonging to his stepmother, a Leon County Sheriff's deputy. Two former schoolmates revealed that the suspect used to go by the name Christian Eriksen. The suspect's birth mother was found guilty in 2016 of removing her child from the state and failing to return him. The suspect was also a "long-standing member" of the Leon County Sheriff's Office's Youth Advisory Council, according to Sheriff Walter McNeil.</p>

            <p>A group of Democratic researchers and strategists, led by Mitch Landrieu, are launching the Working Class Project to understand and address the party's declining support among working-class voters. The project will focus on research, polling, and focus groups in 21 states to identify key messages and strategies for rebuilding the Democratic brand. Democrats have experienced a significant net loss of support among working-class voters since 2008, including voters of color. The project aims to develop a blueprint for victory in future elections by understanding the motivations and media consumption habits of these voters.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has ordered a halt to construction on the Empire Wind 1 offshore wind farm project off the coast of Long Island, citing concerns that the Biden administration rushed through the approval process without sufficient analysis. The project, which promised to create over 1,500 jobs and power 500,000 homes, is now under review. This decision could have significant ramifications for New York state's climate goals and green job opportunities, particularly in low-income communities that would benefit from the project. Labor unions and environmental groups have criticized the move, warning of potential job losses and delays in the state's energy transition.</p>

This experience led Makayla to become a special education teacher, shaping her patience and understanding towards children with diverse needs.

The claim is based on the possible detection of dimethyl sulfide in the atmosphere of K2-18b, a molecule produced by living organisms on Earth. However, other scientists are more cautious, noting that the detection is not definitive and that dimethyl sulfide can also be produced by non-biological processes. The University of Cambridge issued the only major press release about the finding, and some worry about a "boy-who-cried-wolf effect" if such claims are frequently walked back.</p>

            <p>In Medford, Oregon, Detective Bill Ford solved a missing persons case by offering a suspect, Russell Jones, a cigarette during an interview. Jones confessed to helping load the body of Aaron Friar and led police to the location where the body was dumped. Jones confessed that he was not responsible for Aaron's death, but he helped load the body. Jones was eager to talk, but he wanted something first: a cigarette.</p>

The 4-3 ruling affirms the governor's ability to partially veto spending bills, striking words, numbers, and punctuation to create new meaning. Gov. Tony Evers used a partial veto to increase how much revenue K-12 public schools can raise per student by $325 a year until 2425. Republicans argued that the veto was barred under a 1990 constitutional amendment, but the court disagreed.</p>

The article argues that this incident is an example of antisemitism, as Shapiro actually supports Palestinian statehood and has criticized Israel's leadership. The author highlights a previous campaign that falsely labeled Shapiro as "Genocide Josh," which may have contributed to the attacker's distorted perception.

            <p>The author argues that the focus on the "diploma divide" in politics is misguided and that class remains the most salient division. While it's easy to categorize voters by education level, emphasizing education over class risks suggesting that political behavior is related to intelligence or achievement. Democrats' reliance on college-educated voters has led to a neglect of working-class interests, contributing to disaffection among white, Latino, and Black working-class voters.

The Hope Florida Foundation, a non-profit supporting her welfare initiative, is under scrutiny for failing to file required tax documents and for a questionable $10 million donation from a legal settlement. This scandal has angered some Florida Republicans and raised questions about the legality of the donation's redirection.
