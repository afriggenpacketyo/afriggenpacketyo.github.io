          <p>CNBC's Investing Club analyzed recent market movements, noting a modest rise in stocks driven by Nvidia's strong performance in the AI sector, with the market receiving a brief boost after a court ruling on tariffs. Goldman Sachs' President John Waldron cautioned that investment banking activity in the second quarter has been weaker due to market volatility, but Goldman's trading desk has remained strong. Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner defended the company's schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, despite a failed trial, emphasizing its potential as a primary treatment. The report also mentions upcoming earnings reports from Costco, Marvell Technology, and Dell Technologies, and the expected release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index.

          <p>The resumption of student loan repayments after years of government leniency is causing a significant drop in credit scores for delinquent borrowers, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Millions of borrowers have experienced credit score declines, impacting their ability to secure future loans and achieve financial milestones like buying a home. The end of the "on ramp" period, which provided leniency as payments resumed, means that missed payments are now being reported to credit bureaus. Experts warn that these credit score drops will have long-lasting consequences, potentially exacerbating the divide between low-income and higher-income Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration intends to take the case to the Supreme Court unless the ruling striking down the import taxes is put on hold. The legal battle has raised questions about the future of the tariffs, which have caused global economic disruption.

          <p>Twenty-two young Americans have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that its anti-environment executive orders violate their constitutional rights to life and liberty. The lawsuit claims that by intentionally boosting oil and gas production and hindering carbon-free energy, federal officials are contributing to climate change, thus breaching congressional mandates to protect ecosystems and public health. Plaintiffs argue that these actions also violate the state-created danger doctrine. The lawsuit targets three executive orders aimed at bolstering U.S. energy production, claiming they suppress climate research and data while flaunting environmental protections.</p>

          <p>Best Buy has lowered its full-year sales and profit guidance due to the impact of higher tariffs on consumer electronics. The retailer has already increased prices on some items to offset the costs, but CEO Corie Barry noted that the recent court ruling striking down some of Trump's tariffs has reinforced the need for nimbleness. Best Buy's net income for the first quarter dropped 18%, and comparable sales also declined. The company is adjusting to current tariffs by encouraging vendors to manufacture in multiple countries, negotiating lower costs, and adjusting its merchandise mix. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the world's glaciers are on track to shrink significantly over hundreds of years, regardless of climate mitigation strategies. Even if global temperatures remained at current levels, glaciers outside of ice sheets would lose about one-third of their mass. However, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius could save twice as much ice compared to the current trajectory of 2.7 degrees Celsius. The melting glaciers contribute to sea level rise, increase the risk of floods and landslides, and threaten crucial freshwater sources for communities.</p>

          <p>Julius Jordan Priester, a 24-year-old Kansas man, is facing federal charges after allegedly attacking an American Airlines flight attendant on a flight from Connecticut to Chicago. Priester reportedly stood up, removed his shirt, and ran to the back of the plane yelling for help before grabbing a flight attendant and attempting to drag the attendant up the aisle. Other staff and passengers intervened, and the flight was diverted back to Connecticut, where Priester was taken into custody. Priester is charged with interference with flight crew members and attendants, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk attempted to derail a major artificial intelligence infrastructure deal in the Middle East after learning that his startup, xAI, would be excluded from the initiative, which involved OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, Cisco and Emirati firm G42. Musk argued that President Trump would not approve the deal and intervened to get xAI involved, delaying the announcement. The rivalry between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has complicated Trump's efforts to solidify U.S. leadership in AI, with Musk criticizing Altman and OpenAI's close alliance with Microsoft.</p>
