          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 12:54:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, has limited the authority of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block executive branch policies across the country. The ruling stems from legal challenges to a Trump administration executive order on birthright citizenship, though the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued that such universal orders exceed the power granted to federal courts by Congress. The decision is seen as a significant victory for the executive branch, curtailing a tool frequently used to halt policies from both Democratic and Republican administrations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic pressures are intensifying within the U.S. economy as tariffs contribute to rising consumer prices and shrinking retail inventories. According to logistics and distribution insiders, companies are re-ticketing millions of products with price hikes ranging from 8% to 15% to offset tariff costs. In response to trade uncertainty and softer consumer demand, retailers are also reducing their inventory, holding about half of what they did previously. This trend, combined with fewer imports, suggests a milder peak shopping season and points to sustained inflationary pressures affecting both businesses and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision curbing the use of nationwide injunctions is being interpreted as a significant expansion of presidential authority, particularly for the Trump administration. The ruling allows the White House to proceed with its policy to end birthright citizenship for now, while also empowering it to challenge judicial blocks on other key initiatives. While legal battles over the policies themselves will continue in lower courts, the decision gives presidents more immediate latitude to implement their agendas. This shift affects the balance of power, reducing the ability of single federal judges to halt executive actions nationwide.</p>

          <p>The third and final season of the Netflix hit "Squid Game" has drawn criticism for shifting away from the sharp capitalist satire that defined its first season. This review argues that by focusing more on generic human cruelty and less on systemic inequality, the show has become a parody of itself. The return of the cartoonishly evil "VIP" characters and the introduction of increasingly contrived and deadly games are seen as shallow thrills rather than insightful social commentary. While still visually impressive and watchable, the series is said to have abandoned its nuanced exploration of economic desperation in favor of more superficial observations about human nature.</p>

The president has downplayed the deadline's firmness, stating it's important but "not the end all." The legislative push faces obstacles, including a recent rejection of a key Medicaid provision by the Senate parliamentarian. Trump has blamed Democrats for the gridlock, claiming they oppose the bill due to its political benefits for Republicans, and has also expressed frustration with the parliamentarian's decisions, which complicate the bill's path forward.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 in favor of parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, affirming their right to opt their elementary school children out of instruction involving LGBTQ-themed storybooks. The case, brought by a religiously diverse group of parents, argued the school district's no-opt-out policy violated their First Amendment right to guide their children's religious upbringing. Justice Samuel Alito's majority opinion stated that forcing participation in lessons that conflict with family beliefs imposes an unconstitutional burden. The decision orders the school district to provide advance notice and allow opt-outs while the lawsuit proceeds.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Toni at Random," sheds light on the influential career of Nobel laureate Toni Morrison as a book editor at Random House during the 1970s. Before achieving global fame for her own novels, Morrison championed a generation of Black writers, including Angela Davis and Muhammad Ali. She fought to publish their uncompromising work for a mainstream audience without diluting their integrity, believing that stories written for a specific community could still achieve universal appeal. This work reveals her definition of a literary legacy: creating art so profound that it transcends its intended audience and endures for generations.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund, a federal program that subsidizes internet and phone service for low-income households, schools, libraries, and rural healthcare providers. The challenge was brought by conservative groups arguing that Congress improperly delegated its taxing power to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which administers the fund. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the majority, rejected this argument, ensuring the continuation of the program. The ruling is a significant affirmation of the FCC's authority and a key support for maintaining telecommunications access in underserved areas.</p>

The changes, which also include fast-tracking a support-to-work package, aim to strike a balance between fiscal responsibility and supporting those with health conditions, though some MPs still plan to vote against the bill.</p>

          <p>A large and exceptionally bright meteor, known as a fireball, was seen streaking across the sky over Georgia and South Carolina. According to NASA, the space rock, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weigh over a ton, entered the atmosphere at 30,000 miles per hour. It ultimately exploded about 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, releasing energy equivalent to 20 tons of TNT and creating a pressure wave that was heard as a sonic boom on the ground. The rare daylight event, which generated over 160 reports, may have been part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

          <p>Dame Anna Wintour has announced she is stepping back from her role as editor-in-chief of U.S. Vogue, a position she has held for 37 years.
