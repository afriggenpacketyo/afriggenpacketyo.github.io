          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing volatility due to rising lumber prices, exacerbated by potential increases in U.S. duties on Canadian lumber. Softwood lumber prices have surged, impacting homebuilders like Lennar, D.R. Horton, and Toll Brothers, whose stocks have declined. The Trump administration's interest in tightening trade restrictions and a possible jump in tariffs on Canadian lumber, which accounts for a significant portion of U.S. supply, could further disrupt the sector. The article emphasizes the unpredictability of lumber prices, adding complexity to construction planning and budgeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged members of an Armenian organized crime ring with stealing over $83 million in cargo from Amazon by posing as truck drivers. Since 2021, the group allegedly stole truckloads of merchandise, including smart TVs and appliances, using fraudulent transportation companies contracted through Amazon Relay. The DOJ seized iPhones containing evidence of warehouses filled with stolen goods, and Amazon cooperated with the investigation by providing information about the fraudulent accounts. The article notes that cargo theft is a significant problem for retailers, costing an estimated $1 billion or more annually.</p>

          <p>Target has revised its full-year sales outlook downward, citing weaker discretionary spending, consumer uncertainty surrounding tariffs, and negative reactions to the company's changes in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. First-quarter sales fell short of Wall Street's forecasts, dropping nearly 3% year-over-year, while transactions at Target stores and online also decreased. CEO Brian Cornell attributed many of the retailer's challenges to the economy, but acknowledged the company's need to improve market share across various merchandise categories.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for allegedly providing false statements to Congress regarding his decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This inquiry follows accusations from House Republicans who claimed Cuomo intentionally misrepresented data related to nursing home deaths. The investigation centers on Cuomo's March 2020 directive that initially required nursing homes to accept patients who had tested positive for COVID-19, a policy later rescinded amid concerns it accelerated outbreaks. Cuomo's spokesperson asserts that he testified truthfully and that the investigation is politically motivated.</p>

Dr. Bedard argues that leaders in powerful positions have a responsibility to acknowledge the realities of aging and plan for potential health challenges. She concludes by expressing hope for Mr. Biden's health while suggesting he could have better prepared for potential decline earlier in his term.</p>

The assessment, published in Modern Defence Technology, found the 70-year-old B-52 poses a significant threat across all combat phases, surpassing more advanced platforms like the F-35A and B-2 Spirit bombers. The researchers emphasized the potential use of B61-12 air-launched tactical thermonuclear bombs to cripple critical anti-access/area denial facilities, enhancing lethality through blast waves, radiation penetration, and radioactive contamination.</p>

          <p>Kid Cudi, also known as Scott Mescudi, is set to testify in Sean Combs' sexual assault and racketeering trial, according to The New York Times. The testimony stems from Casandra Ventura's claims that Combs threatened Mescudi after discovering their relationship in 2011, including a threat to blow up Mescudi's car. Ventura testified about a pattern of physical abuse and drug-fueled sexual encounters, and the prosecution is lining up witnesses to corroborate her account. The government has accused Combs of running a criminal enterprise that helped him commit a series of crimes dating back to 2004.</p>

Researchers at Harvard have found that LLMs track characteristics like gender, socioeconomic status, education level, and age, using these assumptions to tailor their responses. The article highlights the potential for these models to perpetuate stereotypes and the need for transparency and control over the assumptions they make.

          <p>This article from The Atlantic explores the rise of multi-level-marketing (MLM) schemes and their surprising connections to corporate America. The journalist Bridget Read argues that MLM outfits, often dismissed as kooky sideshows, share key characteristics with corporate practices, such as relying on temporary workers and pushing employees to think like entrepreneurs. MLM participants are portrayed as victims of a multigenerational swindle, with 99 percent of participants in one MLM losing money. The article suggests that the low quality of many legitimate jobs provides cover for these shadier schemes, blurring the lines between MLM rackets and other forms of temporary or part-time work.</p>

          <p>US singer Chris Brown has been released on bail by a court in London after being charged with inflicting an "unprovoked attack" in a nightclub in 2023. The Grammy-winning star, who has not yet been asked to enter a plea in the case, is able to begin his world tour next month as planned as part of his bail conditions. He was arrested last week and later charged with grievous bodily harm over an incident in which he allegedly attacked a music producer with a tequila bottle. He was not present at Southwark Crown Court for Wednesday's bail hearing, at which the judge said he must pay a Â£5m security fee to the court.</p>

          <p>A senior Palestinian pediatric doctor describes the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as "unbelievable," with children dying from hunger and preventable injuries due to a total aid blockade and intensified attacks from Israel. Hospitals are collapsing, and patients are dying on the operating table due to a lack of essential equipment and medication. The doctor highlights the severe malnutrition among children, with cases of marasmus and children weighing just 40% of their expected weight.

The dismissal came after opposition lawmakers criticized Eto's comment as insensitive, given rising inflation and wage stagnation.

While the use of xenon has been criticized and the science around it is disputed, organizers claim it made the rapid ascent possible.

The Bank of England, tasked with keeping inflation at 2%, may now consider fewer interest rate cuts this year.

Investors are monitoring discussions around President Trump's budget bill, with Republicans seeking larger deductions for state and local taxes.

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's trip to the Middle East was successful due to his focus on using the American private sector as an instrument of national power. By bringing business leaders and emphasizing commercial partnerships, Trump positioned the U.S. differently than previous administrations. He also showed a willingness to navigate Middle East politics without being constrained by domestic concerns, allowing him to make decisions that other presidents might have avoided. The article suggests that Trump's approach resonates with both Gulf Arabs and Middle America, who are weary of military entanglement and nation-building projects.</p>

          <p>Mortgage applications fell by 5.1% as mortgage rates jumped to their highest level since February. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 6.92% from 6.86%. The Mortgage Bankers Association attributed the rise to investors' concerns about rising inflation and the impact of increasing deficits and debt. Applications for a mortgage to buy a home dropped 5% for the week, while applications to refinance a home loan also fell 5%. (not investment advice)</p>
