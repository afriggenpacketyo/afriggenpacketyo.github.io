          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended President Trump's new reciprocal tariffs, asserting they would compel other nations to adopt fairer trade practices and increase market access for American goods.  Despite immediate market reactions showing Dow futures plunging over 1,100 points, Lutnick remained optimistic about the long-term effects, emphasizing a shift toward global trade fairness. He dismissed the idea of exemptions, focusing instead on achieving equitable trade relationships worldwide.  This announcement represents a significant escalation in Trump's trade policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 46% tariff on Vietnamese imports will significantly impact major American retailers and brands that rely heavily on Vietnamese manufacturing, including Nike, American Eagle, and Wayfair.

The move is a continuation of Trump's protectionist trade strategy, potentially exacerbating economic challenges for these companies and the broader market.

          <p>BBC Verify analyzed the methodology behind President Trump's new tariffs, revealing a relatively simple calculation based on the US goods trade deficit with each country.  The tariffs are not strictly reciprocal, as they don't solely consider existing tariffs and non-tariff barriers imposed by other nations.  The calculation aims to eliminate the US goods trade deficit, but the approach has been criticized for its lack of reciprocity and potential for unintended consequences.  The impact on global trade remains a significant concern.</p>
