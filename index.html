          <p>In a jailhouse interview, Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to the 2017 murder of hairstylist Fabio Sementilli, adamantly stated his former lover and the victim's wife, Monica Sementilli, was not involved in the crime. Baker claimed Monica knew nothing about the plan to kill her husband, a statement that contradicts the prosecution's conspiracy case against her. Despite his claims, Baker expressed reluctance to discuss most details of the case, deferring answers until after Monica's trial, where his potential testimony could be a pivotal, albeit risky, development.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Alvarado, Texas, was shot and injured near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center, prompting a "zero tolerance" response from the Trump administration regarding attacks on law enforcement. The officer was responding to a report of a suspicious person when shots were fired, striking him in the neck; he has since been released from the hospital. Several armed suspects who fled the scene were later arrested, amid rising concerns over assaults on federal officers and facilities in other cities.</p>

          <p>Monica Sementilli was found guilty of orchestrating the murder of her husband, celebrity hairdresser Fabio Sementilli, in a case driven by what prosecutors described as lust and greed. The investigation revealed she was having an affair with racquetball coach Robert Baker, whose DNA was found at the crime scene. Prosecutors argued Monica used her phone to monitor her home's security cameras, providing an opening for Baker and an accomplice to attack Fabio, while she established an alibi at a Target store. Despite her defense's claims that she was merely a grieving widow unaware of the plot, a jury convicted her of murder and conspiracy.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has demonstrated that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping the brain's "criticality," the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition. This balance is known to be vital for optimizing the brain's information processing capabilities and is linked to overall cognitive function. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the findings establish brain criticality as a biological phenotype. This research opens new avenues for understanding how genetics influence brain function and may contribute to future studies on neurological dysfunctions.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been indicted again for the murder of his wife, Suzanne, with new evidence alleging her body was moved at least twice after she was killed. The indictment follows the 2023 discovery of her remains in a shallow grave, where forensic analysis concluded she had decomposed elsewhere before being moved. Toxicologists also found a mixture of tranquilizer chemicals, known as BAM, in her bone marrow, a compound Barry Morphew had access to and admitted to using on deer. This new evidence led to his second arrest after initial charges were dismissed in 2022.</p>

          <p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, made his first public appearance since the beginning of the recent 12-day war with Israel, attending a religious mourning ceremony in Tehran. His absence had fueled speculation that he was in seclusion in a bunker, especially after the U.S. bombed key Iranian nuclear sites. The war caused significant damage and over 900 acknowledged deaths in Iran, which has since suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog. Khamenei's appearance occurred during a major Shiite religious event under heavy security.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the United Nations is facing an acute crisis, threatened by potential funding cuts from the Trump administration and a broader decline in multilateral cooperation. The U.S., the UN's largest contributor, is reviewing its financial commitments, which could devastate key agencies like UNICEF and the World Food Programme. The author contends that the failure of member states, including Russia and the U.S., to uphold the UN charter has undermined the international rules-based order. The piece warns that a world without a functioning UN would be more dangerous and unstable, urging democracies to defend the institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's High Court has ruled that internal investigations by MI5 into its use of false evidence were "deficient" and ordered a new, more robust inquiry. The case stems from the Security Service repeatedly lying to courts about its relationship with a neo-Nazi agent who was also a violent misogynist. The BBC uncovered that MI5 misled judges to maintain secrecy, a fact later proven by recordings. This article details how MI5 continued to provide misleading information even during the subsequent inquiries, withholding key evidence and misrepresenting facts to conceal the extent of its misconduct.</p>

Musk, who is ineligible to run for president, did not specify who would lead the party or if it has been formally registered with election authorities.

According to state media, these bodies are now directed to focus on "planning, discussing and checking on major matters."
