          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Central Texas to survey the extensive damage from last week's deadly floods. The disaster has resulted in at least 121 fatalities, with over 170 people still missing as rescue operations continue. The visit will include a roundtable with local officials and first responders in Kerr County, one of the hardest-hit areas, where a summer camp suffered catastrophic losses. The president has signed a disaster declaration, enabling federal assistance for the region's recovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are warning that AI-driven deepfake technology is being increasingly used by fraudulent job applicants to deceive companies during remote interviews. This trend not only defrauds U.S. businesses but also poses a national security threat, as some impostors have been linked to sanctioned nations like North Korea. A recent survey found that 17% of hiring managers have encountered deepfake candidates, and analysts predict a significant increase in fake applicants in the coming years. The phenomenon complicates the hiring process, potentially causing real candidates to be overlooked due to suspicion.</p>

          <p>Major healthcare providers in California, including Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) and Stanford Medicine, are scaling back or shutting down gender-affirming care services for transgender youth. The closures are a direct response to threats from the Trump administration to pull significant federal funding from institutions that provide such treatments. This has left thousands of young patients and their families in a state of panic, scrambling to find alternative care in a state previously considered a sanctuary. Families express fear and disbelief, with some considering leaving the country to ensure their children's access to what they describe as life-saving medical care.</p>

          <p>A Tunisian court has handed down lengthy prison sentences, ranging from 12 to 35 years, to 21 political opponents of President Kais Saied. Among those sentenced is Rached Ghannouchi, the 86-year-old leader of the Ennahda party, who received an additional 14 years. Many of the convicted individuals, including a former prime minister and Ghannouchi's children, are in exile and were tried in absentia, while others are already imprisoned. Human rights organizations and opposition figures have condemned the verdicts as politically motivated and part of a broader, abusive crackdown designed to eliminate all political dissent in the country.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump will significantly reform the federal student loan system, consolidating the many repayment plans into just two options: a standard 10-to-25-year plan and a new income-driven plan. This new income-driven plan, the Repayment Assistance Plan, will require payments for up to 30 years before loan forgiveness, an extension from current options. The law also introduces new borrowing caps for Parent PLUS loans and eliminates Grad PLUS loans for new students starting in 2026. Additionally, eligibility for Pell Grants will be tightened, making it harder for students with full scholarships or from higher-income families to receive the aid.</p>

          <p>Families are facing higher prices for back-to-school essentials this year, a trend expected to worsen with the implementation of new tariffs by the Trump administration. A Deloitte survey indicates that average spending per child is projected to decrease slightly, as families plan to cut back and seek more affordable options in response to economic concerns. Retail experts warn that while the full impact of the tariffs has not yet reached consumers, sustained levies will inevitably lead to higher prices. In response, a majority of parents are starting their shopping earlier and are prepared to switch brands to manage costs.</p>

The price movement also triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward trend.

          <h2>Advocates Question Lack of a Mass Movement for U.S. Childcare Reform</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the widespread and severe challenges American families face in finding and affording quality childcare, there has been a surprising lack of a sustained, mass political movement demanding systemic change. The article explores the historical and cultural reasons for this, from a 1970s presidential veto of a national childcare bill to a persistent ideology that frames childcare as a private family issue rather than a public responsibility. While other developed nations have invested in robust childcare systems, the U.S. system remains fragmented and expensive. However, a recent increase in parent-led advocacy groups and local-level policy experiments suggests a potential shift toward greater political action.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. continues its aggressive tariff policies, analysts advise that China should adopt a more pragmatic and long-term approach to fortify its position against Washington's protectionism. Instead of relying solely on strong rhetoric, Beijing is being encouraged to offer tangible benefits, such as broader market access, to its regional trade partners to build a more unified economic bloc. This strategy involves playing a "long game" to strengthen regional integration and collectively push back against U.S. trade pressure. The comments come as Chinese officials increase diplomatic efforts ahead of another round of trade negotiations with the United States.</p>

          <p>In a notable development, the Shanghai branch of China's state-asset watchdog (SASAC) is encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to research the potential application of stablecoins and other digital assets. The agency urged SOEs to study how emerging technologies like blockchain could be used in cross-border trade, supply chain finance, and asset tokenization. This call for exploration is significant given the Chinese government's long-standing ban on most cryptocurrency-related activities. It aligns with recent suggestions in state-owned media that China should consider regulating stablecoins and leveraging them to promote the yuan's global role.</p>

          <p>A new book, "A Flower Traveled in My Blood," examines Argentina's decades-long effort to grapple with the trauma of its "Dirty War," a period of state-sponsored terror from 1976 to 1983. The article uses the book to explore how a nation recovers from such violence, highlighting the persistent tension between seeking justice and the desire to move on. It focuses on the work of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who used pioneering genetic science to identify and reunite families with children who were stolen by the military junta. Argentina's journey of memory and justice serves as a powerful case study for other countries confronting their own histories of violence.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Arizona, named the White Sage Fire, is spreading rapidly near Grand Canyon National Park, forcing the immediate evacuation of the park's North Rim and nearby residents. The lightning-sparked blaze has burned approximately 1,000 acres and remains completely uncontained as of Thursday. Officials state that dangerous fire conditions, including high temperatures, strong winds, and dry vegetation, are fueling the fire's swift advance. This is part of a broader wildfire threat in the region, with another national park in Colorado also evacuating due to multiple lightning-ignited fires.</p>

The move comes after Rayner urged the striking workers, who are Unite members, to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council to end the long-running industrial action. The union, which is Labour's largest financial backer, passed an emergency motion stating it would also reconsider its relationship with the party if the council makes any members redundant.

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service suspended six personnel without pay following the assassination attempt on President Trump in July 2024. The disciplinary actions, which included leave ranging from 10 to 42 days, were a response to the significant security failures that allowed a gunman to open fire at a campaign rally. A senior Secret Service official stated the agency is focused on fixing the root causes of the operational failure rather than simply firing staff. A subsequent bipartisan House report found that pre-existing issues in leadership, training, and coordination created an environment where such a preventable tragedy could occur.</p>

          <p>A trend toward lighter, faster, and more athletic back-row forwards is changing the dynamics of modern rugby, exemplified by players like England's Henry Pollock. This new breed of loose forward, weighing less than traditional heavyweights, offers incredible speed and endurance, allowing them to cover more ground and be highly effective at the breakdown. Coaches and players note that as the ball-in-play time increases, speed and agility are becoming more critical than sheer size. This evolution presents a strategic choice for coaches, who must balance the benefits of a warp-speed, dynamic back row against the power of more traditional, heavier opponents.</p>

Under the new rules, organizations must document all expenses and will only be reimbursed for actual costs tied to state-approved services.
