            <p>Global markets experienced a rise as US futures indicated a potential increase, amidst uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff plans. An announcement of exemptions for consumer electronics initially boosted markets, and Trump signaled a willingness to ease tariffs further for car companies. European markets also saw gains following the European Commission's tariff countermeasures pause. However, markets in China showed less enthusiasm due to existing tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of strain as job vacancies decline to a near four-year low, indicating weakening demand for workers. This trend coincides with rising employment costs, including increased employer National Insurance Contributions and National Minimum Wage hikes. While average UK pay continues to rise, the number of workers on payrolls has decreased, suggesting a cautious approach to hiring by businesses. The unemployment rate remains relatively stable, but concerns linger about the impact of rising costs on future employment trends.</p>

            <p>Europe's concerns over 'chlorinated chicken' from the U.S. highlight a long-standing trade dispute centered on food safety practices. While the use of chlorine rinses in U.S. poultry processing has decreased, the EU prohibits any chemical treatment, viewing it as masking inadequate hygiene standards. The U.S. poultry industry argues its practices are safe, but European regulators maintain a 'farm to fork' approach focused on pre-harvest interventions. Despite differing regulations, infection rates from Salmonella and Campylobacter remain high in both regions, emphasizing the importance of proper cooking hygiene.</p>

            <p>A bipartisan group of senators is criticizing the White House's decision to end a federal contract providing legal representation to unaccompanied migrant children. They argue that terminating the contract puts vulnerable children at risk of trafficking and exploitation, hindering their access to a fair legal process. The decision is seen as a potential violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which requires HHS to ensure legal counsel for unaccompanied children. A federal judge has temporarily ordered HHS to restore funding, but the long-term protections for these children remain uncertain.</p>

            <p>A new study suggests that long-term meditation may reduce stress and slow aging by affecting gene expression. Researchers found that practitioners of transcendental meditation had lower expression of genes associated with inflammation and aging. Cognitive function was also analyzed via EEG tests. The study also found that the meditators had a better cortisol-to-cortisone ratio, suggesting more resilience to stress. The study highlights the potential of meditation as a tool for promoting healthy aging and overall well-being.</p>
