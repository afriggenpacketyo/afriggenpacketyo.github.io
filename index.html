        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has confirmed it is investigating Jack Smith, the former special counsel who prosecuted cases against Donald Trump. The probe follows a request from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged Smith's actions, particularly pushing for a rushed trial, constituted illegal political activity under the Hatch Act. This independent agency investigates federal employees for partisan political activities, though its recourse is limited as Smith is no longer a government employee. The investigation adds another layer to the political and legal fallout from the cases against the former president.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the stories of Robert Violante and Carl Denaro, two survivors of attacks by the 'Son of Sam' serial killer, David Berkowitz. Violante, who was on a first date with Stacy Moskowitz when they were shot, was left permanently blind while Moskowitz died from her injuries. Denaro was also severely wounded in a separate attack months earlier. Both men reflect on how the traumatic events reshaped their lives, the challenges they overcame, and their relief upon Berkowitz's capture in 1977. Their accounts provide a personal and harrowing perspective on the terror that gripped New York City during that time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, Idaho prosecutor Bill Thompson discussed new details regarding the case against Bryan Kohberger, who is accused of murdering four university students. Thompson stated that investigators cannot rule out the possibility of a second weapon, as some of victim Kaylee Goncalves's injuries were inconsistent with the primary knife. He also speculated that Kohberger may have spared a surviving roommate because he panicked after spending more time and killing more people than planned. The prosecutor emphasized the critical role that DNA evidence found on a knife sheath played in identifying and charging Kohberger.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people were arrested across England following clashes between anti-migrant groups and counter-demonstrators outside hotels housing asylum seekers. Protests occurred in London, Newcastle, and Manchester, prompting a significant police presence to manage the confrontations. The events coincide with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's announcement of plans to fast-track the asylum appeals process to reduce the number of people housed in hotels. The government aims to end the use of hotels for migrants by 2029, a move it claims will save £1 billion annually.</p>

          <p>A large-scale manhunt is underway in a mountainous region of western Montana for Michael Paul Brown, a U.S. Army veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda. Authorities have found the suspect's getaway vehicle but he remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous. The bar's owner stated that the suspect knew the victims and believes he 'just snapped,' as there was no known ongoing dispute. The incident has prompted authorities to advise local residents to stay indoors while they conduct their search for the gunman.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a strong return from the injured list, striking out eight batters over five innings in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. Despite his impressive performance, the Dodgers lost 4-0, largely due to two home runs by Rays slugger Yandy Díaz. Both of Díaz's homers took advantage of the unusually short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary home field in Tampa. While the result was a loss for the team, Snell's return is a positive sign for the Dodgers, who are counting on the two-time Cy Young winner to bolster their rotation for the season's stretch run.</p>

The rising costs are attributed to necessary wage increases for historically underpaid nursing staff and an increase in staffing levels.

          <p>An increasing number of young adults are turning to TikTok for news, relying on 'newsfluencers' and algorithm-driven content rather than traditional media outlets. This article examines how creators like Aaron Parnas deliver rapid-fire updates, while others use skits and memes to convey current events, a format that appeals to users with shorter attention spans. While some users trust the platform's crowdsourced fact-checking in the comments, experts worry about the potential for misinformation and the loss of nuance. The trend highlights a significant shift in media consumption, where convenience and entertainment value often take precedence over detailed, traditional reporting.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit Court panel ruled that the administration cannot use its proclamation to summarily expel migrants without considering their eligibility for certain mandatory humanitarian protections. Specifically, officials must still screen individuals for 'withholding of removal' and protections under the UN Convention Against Torture, even if they can deny discretionary asylum. The ruling stems from a lawsuit challenging the president's order to close the asylum system, which he justified by calling the situation an 'invasion.'</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts how federal agents can conduct 'roving' immigration raids in the Los Angeles area. The Ninth Circuit agreed that basing detentions solely on factors like a person's race, speaking Spanish, or their location constitutes an unconstitutional practice. The ruling requires immigration officials to have reasonable suspicion that an individual is in the country illegally before detaining them. The lawsuit was filed in response to high-profile sweeps by the Trump administration that advocates argued were discriminatory and instilled fear in the region's large Latino community.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton described his own driving as 'terrible' and 'useless' after a disappointing 12th-place finish in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix. While his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc secured a surprise pole position, Hamilton failed to advance to the final qualifying session. This result continues a pattern of qualifying struggles for Hamilton in 2025, bucking a recent trend of improved performance. Despite his personal frustration, Hamilton congratulated his teammate and the team, acknowledging that the car itself was capable of being on pole.</p>

          <p>Health officials are warning the public to avoid the water near the Camp Richardson resort in South Lake Tahoe after high levels of E. coli bacteria were discovered. The contamination is the result of a sewage leak from a nearby sewer line, which has since been located and is undergoing repairs. The U.S. Forest Service has issued an advisory for the area from Jameson Beach to the Valhalla Boathouse. This incident follows a separate, major sewage spill on the lake's northern shore last summer, raising ongoing concerns about infrastructure and water quality at the popular tourist destination.</p>

The investigation found at least 52 instances of forged names, including those of three deceased individuals, and others who claimed they were deceived into signing. While the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far more than the 7,500 required, the findings raise questions about the practices of contractors hired to collect them.

          <p>U.S. markets experienced a turbulent week, with the S&P 500 hitting a record high before ending on a four-day losing streak. The volatility was fueled by a confluence of major news, including a surprisingly weak July jobs report, which led to a significant drop in stock prices on Friday. This report prompted President Trump to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The week also saw the Federal Reserve hold interest rates steady, the administration set new international tariff rates, and major tech companies like Amazon and Apple release mixed earnings reports.

          <p>England's women's rugby team secured a dominant 97-7 victory over Spain, running in 15 tries in a lopsided warm-up match. The win, however, was overshadowed by a red card issued to captain Marlie Packer for a clumsy clearout in the second half. Packer now faces a disciplinary panel and may miss part of England's upcoming Rugby World Cup campaign. Despite the captain's dismissal, the Red Roses showcased their strength, with Helena Rowland scoring a hat-trick in the comprehensive win ahead of their final warm-up match against France.</p>
