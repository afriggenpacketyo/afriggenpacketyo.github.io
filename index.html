          <h2>Trump Administration Closes De Minimis Loophole, Increasing Prices for Shein and Temu</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 08:25:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has closed the 'de minimis' loophole, a trade rule that allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to the US without duties or taxes, impacting Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu. The move, intended to combat the smuggling of illegal goods and protect American businesses, has led to price increases for US consumers. Shein and Temu have already raised prices in anticipation of the change, and experts estimate that eliminating the exemption could add billions in annual costs for consumers. The UK and EU are considering similar measures, which could lead to price increases for consumers there as well.</p>

          <p>A suspected glitch on the Deliveroo app caused some Co-op product prices to drop by as much as 100%, allowing some shoppers to acquire items like pasta sauce, coffee, and cookies for free. The Co-op acknowledged the pricing error, attributing it to a 'clerical error' that was quickly resolved. Some shoppers were able to take advantage of the low prices before the error was fixed, with one person obtaining over Â£80 worth of goods for just Â£3.29 and donating them to a local food bank. The incident is unrelated to a recent cyber attack affecting the Co-op's IT systems.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan will prioritize its national interests in ongoing tariff negotiations with the United States, emphasizing that both nations need to make substantial efforts to reach an agreement. While describing the talks as 'very positive and constructive,' Ishiba acknowledged remaining gaps between the two countries. Japan is seeking exemption from higher tariffs on imports of cars, iron, steel, and aluminum, while the U.S. aims for Japan to further open its auto and farm sectors. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato suggested using Japan's holdings of U.S. Treasuries as a bargaining chip in the trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert, Jackie Dorman, discusses the public's fascination and scrutiny surrounding the romance between Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson, highlighting the unusual nature of the relationship given Belichick's past. Dorman suggests that the public's speculation stems from the significant age gap and questions about the motivations behind the relationship. She notes that while age differences are not inherently problematic, a nearly 50-year age gap often raises concerns about transactional dynamics. Dorman also points out that statistics indicate a low success rate for marriages with large age gaps, emphasizing the importance of shared life goals and compatibility.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio has taken on four prominent government positions, including Secretary of State, Acting Administrator of USAID, Acting Archivist for the National Archives, and Interim National Security Advisor, potentially setting a modern record. The multiple roles raise questions about his capacity to effectively manage all responsibilities, particularly given President Trump's unconventional governance style. While the State Department spokeswoman learned of Rubio's new role through social media, the appointment highlights the trust placed in him by Trump and his close relationship with Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. Some analysts have expressed concerns about conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the archivist role overseeing record preservation for agencies Rubio also leads.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election, signaling a potential rise in influence. Sarah Pochin, Reform's candidate, won by a slim margin over the Labour Party in Runcorn and Helsby, a seat previously considered safe for Labour. The victory could indicate a broader shift towards a more polarized political landscape in Britain, potentially challenging both the Labour and Conservative parties. Reform's success is attributed to capitalizing on anti-incumbent sentiment and concerns over immigration, particularly related to the housing of migrants in local hotels.</p>

Workers aged 60 to 63 can contribute up to $11,250 in catch-up contributions, bringing their maximum deferral limit to $34,750. While this offers a valuable tool for higher earners seeking tax deductions, a small percentage of retirement plans have not yet added this feature.

TikTok plans to appeal the decision, arguing that it complies with EU laws and that the fine does not account for its investments in European data protection.

          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency has classified the Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party as a 'confirmed right-wing extremist' group, a move that could lead to increased surveillance and potentially a ban. The agency cited the party's opposition to the free democratic order, racist and xenophobic views, and support for violence as justification for the classification. This designation allows authorities to observe AfD meetings, tap telephones, and recruit informants, and it could also impact elected officials. While some support a ban, others urge caution, and the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Constitutional Court.</p>

The vampires in the film are a metaphor for white power, which, in the end, is what exposes the twins and their customers to the supernatural horror. The only real monsters in the film are the Ku Klux Klan, who show up at the juke joint to kill the twins.</p>

          <p>Cities across America, particularly in California, are increasingly adopting tiny homes and tougher laws to address homelessness. The Grants Pass v.

San Jose and San Francisco are leading the charge, with plans to build more temporary housing units and enforce anti-camping bans. While critics worry about a two-tiered housing system, supporters argue that interim housing is a faster and cheaper solution. This shift is driven by a combination of political pressure and the need for more efficient and cost-effective solutions.</p>
