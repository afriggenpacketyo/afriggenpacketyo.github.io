Miller alleged she tried to protect female prosecutors from being retaliated against after they alleged they were sexually harassed by Gary LoGalbo, a former supervisor. The jury also found that the county did not take reasonable steps to prevent workplace harassment and took "adverse employment action" against Miller. The jury awarded Miller $3 million in damages, including $1.5 million for past emotional distress, and has yet to reach a verdict on punitive damages.

His attorneys argue that Khalil’s arrest and detention is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to suppress constitutionally protected speech.

Allowing security issues to dominate relations is neither wise nor strategic, and confining ties to maritime tensions limits their scope and potential. The article suggests that both countries should work together in areas where they can without compromising their positions. China's economic success and potential for cooperation are highlighted.

The increase in ICE arrests comes after the Trump administration replaced two of the agency's top leaders amid internal frustrations that arrest numbers were not high enough.
