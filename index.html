            <p>Precision Neuroscience, a neurotech startup, received FDA clearance for its Layer 7 Cortical Interface, a key component of its brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This marks the first full regulatory clearance for a wireless BCI developer. The microelectrode array, thinner than a human hair, can be implanted for up to 30 days to map brain signals. While not the company's ultimate goal, this clearance allows Precision to generate revenue and collect data for longer periods, potentially accelerating the development of BCI systems for patients with paralysis.

            <p>A new CDC study indicates that 1 in 31 children, or over 3%, have been identified with autism. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited the study as evidence of an autism "epidemic," a claim criticized by experts. The report suggests that improved screening and access to services contribute to the rise in diagnoses. The definitions used in the study are broad, encompassing various health and educational records. Federal spending on autism research has surged, focusing on the condition's underlying biology.

            <p>The wife of Kilmar Ábrego García, the man wrongfully deported to El Salvador, has refuted the Trump administration's claims that he is violent.
