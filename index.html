          <p>Chinese industrial 3D printing firms are increasingly focusing on the European market, as highlighted at Paris VivaTech, Europe’s largest tech fair. XDM 3D Printing Technology, among other Chinese companies, sees significant potential in Europe, especially given increasing restrictions in the United States. The company, which entered the European market in 2019, believes European companies will eventually need to integrate 3D printing into their production processes, creating a substantial demand for their services. The founder of XDM is confident about the future, envisioning a massive need for 3D printing in Europe.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has determined that Iran is failing to meet its non-proliferation obligations, marking the first such finding in 20 years. This development could complicate ongoing talks between Iran and the United States regarding a new nuclear agreement, potentially escalating tensions in the Middle East. The IAEA's report cited a lack of cooperation from Iran and raised concerns about undeclared nuclear material and secret activities at previously investigated sites. Iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful, but the IAEA reports that Iran has stockpiled over 408kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, near weapons grade, enough to make nine nuclear bombs.</p>

The Spending Review assumes councils will implement the maximum increase, contributing to an average rise in police spending power of 2.3% per year in real terms. The increase is expected to come from the police council tax precept, which helps fund regular community policing and other services.</p>

          <p>The UK's Spending Review aims to foster long-term economic growth through capital spending, while limiting day-to-day spending, even cutting it in some areas. The government is betting on patience in an era of impatience, acknowledging the public's desire for change. The Chancellor noted expansions in free school meals and breakfast clubs as examples of immediate improvements. However, the success of the Spending Review hinges on delivering sustained economic growth amid ongoing challenges, including a recent GDP contraction.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is under curfew for a second night following nearly a week of unrest sparked by U.S. immigration raids, with hundreds arrested for violating the curfew. The unrest has led to the deployment of 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to help quell the protests. Mayor Karen Bass blamed the demonstrations on President Trump's immigration raids, which she said provoked residents and caused fear. She has called on the administration to end the raids, while state officials insist local law enforcement has the situation under control.</p>
