          <p>President Donald Trump asserted he experienced a "triple sabotage" during his recent United Nations appearance, demanding an immediate investigation into the incidents. He detailed how an escalator carrying him and the First Lady came to a sudden halt, his teleprompter malfunctioned for the first part of his General Assembly speech, and the sound system was reportedly off for many world leaders. Trump characterized these events as "sinister" and not coincidental, contrasting them with the positive reviews his speech received despite the technical difficulties. A UN official, however, attributed the escalator incident to a member of Trump's entourage. The article highlights Trump's perception of targeted interference during a high-profile international event.</p>

          <p>Actress Jessica Chastain has voiced her strong disagreement with AppleTV+'s decision to indefinitely postpone her streaming series, "The Savant." The Oscar winner, who also executive produced the drama, portrays an elite investigator targeting online hate groups and extremist attacks. AppleTV+ delayed the show following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, citing careful consideration. Chastain, however, asserted that the series is critically relevant to ongoing violence in the U.S., including school shootings and political attacks, and aims to honor heroes working to prevent such incidents. She believes the show offers unique insights into confronting a pervasive mindset of violence and remains hopeful for its future release, despite respecting the streamer's immediate decision.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul was met with pronounced boos from fans during the Ryder Cup opening ceremonies at Bethpage Black on Long Island, a moment that was widely broadcast. Despite her smiling and waving an American flag, the strong negative reaction from the crowd was evident, prompting Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik to publicly criticize the governor's reception. This public display of disapproval occurs just days before President Donald Trump is scheduled to attend the start of the Ryder Cup, adding a layer of political tension to the prestigious golf event. The article underscores the intersection of sports and politics, with Trump's prior engagement with golfers also mentioned.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald sparked debate by stating his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy," in what appeared to be a subtle critique of their American rivals. This year, all 12 American players and their captain are receiving $500,000 stipends, with $300,000 earmarked for charity, a first in the tournament's 98-year history, while European players are unpaid. Donald underscored that the Ryder Cup is about pride, national representation, and legacy. American player Collin Morikawa defended the payments, emphasizing the team's desire to win and the opportunity to support their communities, countering criticism that the stipends diminish the event's spirit.</p>

Federal officials, including Vice President JD Vance and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, swiftly condemned the incident as an "attack on ICE law enforcement," with Vance alleging the shooter was a "left-wing extremist" motivated by anti-border enforcement sentiments. The FBI is investigating it as targeted violence, citing recovered bullets with "ANTI-ICE" engravings, underscoring the severe and politically charged nature of the event.</p>

          <p>Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has publicly stated that several Labour Members of Parliament have privately urged him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the role of prime minister. While not currently an MP, Burnham did not dismiss the possibility of another leadership bid, referencing his two prior attempts for the party's top position. His remarks emerge amidst internal party tensions surrounding Sir Keir, particularly following the resignation of his deputy and the dismissal of Peter Mandelson. Burnham also criticized Downing Street for cultivating a "climate of fear" within the party and called for "wholesale change" to counter an "existential" threat to Labour, indicating his willingness to play any necessary role in revitalizing the party's direction.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama vehemently denounced Donald Trump's assertions linking paracetamol, or Tylenol, to autism in infants, characterizing them as "violence against the truth." During an interview at the O2 Arena, Obama highlighted that Trump's claims, which have been consistently disproved, pose a significant public health risk by potentially deterring pregnant women from using essential pain relief. Trump had advised pregnant women to consult doctors about limiting the medication, a recommendation that also drew criticism from UK health secretary Wes Streeting. Obama positioned this issue within a broader "tug of war" between differing visions for America's future, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based information.</p>

          <p>President Trump's escalating attacks on Jimmy Kimmel and ABC, following Kimmel's remarks about Charlie Kirk's killing, have ironically united the late-night host with prominent conservatives on free speech grounds. Despite Trump's threats of lawsuits and FCC Chair Brendan Carr's suggestions of regulatory action, conservative figures like Senator Ted Cruz and Joe Rogan voiced strong opposition to government intervention in broadcast content, warning of a "slippery slope to oblivion" for all speech. This contentious situation has ignited a significant debate over whether these actions represent an attempt to balance media or a coordinated effort to silence dissenting voices, leading to a congressional inquiry into the FCC's conduct.</p>

Kimmel expressed that it was "never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man," but then criticized FCC Chair Brendan Carr's tactics as "un-American." The show's strong viewership, including 26 million views for his monologue across social media, highlighted public engagement with the controversy and Kimmel's firm stance on freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>Parents of Mason Connor shared a remarkable story of their son, diagnosed with autism, who began speaking just three days after starting leucovorin, an off-label drug primarily used to mitigate chemotherapy side effects. Pediatric neurologist Dr. Richard Frye is actively researching leucovorin, which is theorized to bypass a folic acid transport blockage in the brain, potentially improving speech in some autistic children. While preliminary evidence from several blinded controlled studies shows positive effects on speech, larger phase 3 clinical trials are still required for formal FDA approval.

Among the ideas being explored are the government directly purchasing component parts to keep these firms solvent, or providing government-backed loans. A Covid-style furlough scheme, however, has been dismissed by ministers due to its high cost. The Business and Trade Select Committee will convene to gather testimonies from affected businesses.

This cautious forecast aligns with a broader slowdown in the U.S. job market, which saw only 22,000 jobs added in August, and a recent uptick in the Consumer Price Index.

          <p>China's Global Governance Initiative seeks to rectify significant shortcomings within the existing international governance framework, as detailed in an opinion piece. The article identifies three primary deficits: the severe underrepresentation of the Global South, which necessitates boosting their voice and correcting historical injustices; the erosion of authoritativeness stemming from violations of the UN Charter and the imposition of unilateral sanctions; and an urgent demand for greater effectiveness in tackling global issues like climate change and the digital divide. China's initiative aims to address these imbalances by advocating for enhanced inclusivity, stronger adherence to international law, and accelerated progress on the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, reflecting its vision for a more equitable and efficient global order.</p>

          <p>A preliminary trial of a novel one-time gene therapy, AMT-130, has shown highly promising results, indicating a 75% reduction in the progression of Huntington's disease over three years in patients receiving a high dose. This experimental treatment, developed by University College London, operates by employing a harmless virus to deliver specific genetic instructions to the brain, effectively deactivating the toxic proteins responsible for brain cell damage. While these early findings offer significant hope, the therapy remains years away from potential FDA approval, requiring larger-scale studies to confirm its safety and efficacy. If successful, AMT-130 could revolutionize treatment by being the first to slow disease progression, rather than just managing symptoms.</p>

          <p>More than 100 former ABC News employees, including prominent figures such as Sam Donaldson and Judy Muller, have sent a letter to Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger. While commending his decision to reinstate "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," they urged him to take a more assertive public stance in defending free speech and press freedom against political intimidation. The letter argues that the $16 million settlement with Donald Trump, combined with a perceived absence of strong public defense for ABC journalists under attack, has emboldened administration efforts to silence the press. They call on Iger to unequivocally declare that ABC News and Disney will not be intimidated and to actively push back against government attempts to undermine the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>Medical professionals and public health officials are vigorously challenging President Trump's assertions that pregnant women should avoid acetaminophen, or Tylenol, and "tough it out" when experiencing fevers. Doctors warn that untreated high fevers and pain during pregnancy pose significant risks to both the mother and the developing baby, potentially leading to serious developmental issues. They unequivocally state that acetaminophen remains the safest over-the-counter option for pain and fever relief throughout pregnancy, with alternatives like ibuprofen carrying proven risks. The article underscores widespread concern that Trump's statements could lead expectant mothers to forgo necessary medical treatment, directly contradicting extensive scientific research that has found no causal link between Tylenol use and autism.</p>

The lawsuit claims LAFS created temporary, often two-day, employment positions for its graduates with paid-off vendors and nonprofits, specifically to satisfy federal accreditation criteria requiring 70% of students to secure relevant jobs. The institution allegedly garnered over $85 million annually in federal financial assistance, including significant student loans and veterans' aid, by misrepresenting job availability and misleading Department of Education auditors. The former Vice Presidents of career development and admissions, who worked at the school for 12 years, argue this constitutes a systematic fraud against taxpayers and students.</p>

Vice President JD Vance and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem echoed these claims, citing "anti-ICE messaging" on recovered shell casings. Conversely, Democrats, including Texas Rep. Marc Veasey, criticized the focus on law enforcement over victims and urged for gun control and a rejection of xenophobic sentiment, highlighting escalating political "gamesmanship."</p>

His attorneys assert that he likely suffered repeated head strikes against a restraint during the ride's downward thrusts, remaining unconscious for much of the experience. They strongly dispute Universal's internal findings that the ride functioned as intended, arguing that mechanical function does not negate potential safety flaws.
