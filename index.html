        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging the legality of the Trump administration's extensive global tariffs. The case, which will be heard on an expedited timeline in November, examines whether the president had the authority to impose the levies under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Lower courts previously ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority, a decision that, if upheld, could force the U.S. to refund billions of dollars collected from the tariffs. This legal battle represents a significant test of presidential economic power.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock price increased by 27% in extended trading, driven by optimistic projections for its cloud infrastructure business fueled by artificial intelligence demands. This significant investor confidence came even as the company's quarterly earnings and revenue slightly missed Wall Street estimates. Oracle announced it had signed several multi-billion dollar cloud contracts and raised its future revenue forecasts, highlighting a massive 359% increase in its remaining performance obligation. The growth reflects the high demand for cloud services and AI-powering GPUs, positioning Oracle as a major competitor in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple introduced its latest iPhone 17 series, featuring incremental updates to the base and Pro models and a newly designed, ultra-thin iPhone Air. While the event did not reveal major breakthroughs in Apple's generative AI strategy, the hardware updates, including better processors and cameras, are seen as sufficient to maintain consumer interest. The company also implemented a new pricing structure that effectively raises the average selling price for its Pro models by adjusting storage configurations. Analysts believe these updates provide Apple with the necessary time to further develop its "Apple Intelligence" offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a U.S. official, Israel informed the U.S. military of its intent to strike Hamas but did not provide specific details about the location or timing of the attack in Doha, Qatar. This vague notification was deemed insufficient to adequately warn regional partners before the explosions occurred. The strike, which targeted Hamas's political leadership during ceasefire talks, killed five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer. The White House has since stated the attack was a "unilateral" Israeli action and assured Qatar that such an event would not happen again on its soil.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, has allowed federal agents to consider race and ethnicity as contributing factors when stopping individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. The ruling sets aside a lower court's order that had barred this practice, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh writing that apparent ethnicity can be a "relevant factor" among others. Critics and legal experts have condemned the decision, arguing it authorizes racial profiling and contradicts previous court stances against racial discrimination.

          <p>A district court judge in Michigan has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 Republicans accused of acting as false electors for Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The group faced multiple felony counts, including forgery, for signing a document that falsely claimed they were the state's official electors. The judge's decision marks a significant setback for the Michigan Attorney General's office and complicates similar prosecutions underway in other states like Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada. The defendants had maintained that their actions were not illegal, and the ruling came after nearly a year of deliberation.</p>

          <p>Key inflation data to be released this week, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is anticipated to show a rise in prices for August. Economists predict a 0.3% monthly increase, which would push the annual inflation rate to 2.9%, largely due to tariff-sensitive goods. Despite this expected uptick, analysts believe the Federal Reserve will likely proceed with an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. Policymakers are expected to focus on the unchanged "core" inflation rate and a weakening job market, viewing the tariff-related price hikes as a temporary issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the ongoing trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, two of the five Supreme Court justices have voted to find him guilty on all charges related to plotting a coup after his 2022 election loss. A conviction requires at least one more guilty vote from the remaining three justices. The first two justices presented damning evidence, alleging Bolsonaro led a "criminal organisation" that planned to prevent his successor from taking office and culminated in the January 8th riots. If convicted, Bolsonaro, who denies the charges and claims the trial is political, could face over 40 years in prison.</p>

The protests quickly escalated, with thousands taking to the streets to voice deeper frustrations over government corruption and the lavish lifestyles of political elites.

This action complicates Qatar's long-standing role as a key mediator, as the nation has hosted Hamas's political office while also being a major U.S. ally. The strike signals a hardening of Israel's stance and raises questions about the future of diplomatic efforts in the region.</p>

          <p>This article examines Qatar's established role as a crucial mediator in global conflicts, a position now under strain following an Israeli airstrike in its capital, Doha. The small Gulf nation has a history of successfully negotiating hostage releases, ceasefires, and diplomatic breakthroughs, including the recent temporary truce between Israel and Hamas. By maintaining relationships with a wide range of actors, from the U.S. to Iran and Hamas, Qatar has positioned itself as an indispensable diplomatic player. This strategy enhances its global influence and security, though it also involves a dangerous balancing act, as demonstrated by the recent attack.</p>

          <p>Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol official who oversaw controversial immigration raids in Southern California, has been deployed to Chicago to lead a new enforcement blitz. Bovino became a public face of the Trump administration's crackdown, leading operations far from the border that were criticized for their aggressive tactics. A federal judge had previously ruled that some of Bovino's operations in California were based on factors like race rather than reasonable suspicion, though the Supreme Court recently paused that order. His arrival in Chicago signals an expansion of the administration's interior immigration enforcement efforts, now targeting major northern cities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that the tax cuts signed into law by President Trump will have a varied impact across different states. Residents of high-income states like Wyoming are projected to receive the largest average tax cut, while those in lower-income states such as Mississippi and West Virginia will see the smallest benefits. This geographic disparity is driven by provisions that favor higher earners and business owners, as well as an increased deduction cap for state and local taxes, which benefits residents of high-tax states. The typical filer nationwide could see an average tax reduction of $3,752 in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

Hallgrimsson acknowledged that the performance was poor in nearly every aspect, from defense to possession, and admitted his position would now be under scrutiny. He stated that the team was not "on it" and that Armenia deserved the victory, leaving Ireland needing a near-perfect run in their remaining, more difficult fixtures.</p>

          <p>Following the ousting of his predecessor in a no-confidence vote, French President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Sébastien Lecornu as the new prime minister. Lecornu, 39, who previously served as the armed forces minister, is a close Macron ally and now becomes the fifth prime minister of Macron's second term. His immediate and most critical task will be to negotiate a national budget with a fractious and hung parliament, the same issue that led to the collapse of the previous government.

          <p>A large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai facility in Georgia, which resulted in the detention of nearly 500 workers, is prompting other foreign companies to reassess their U.S. operations. The raid, part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on illegal immigration, highlights the risks for companies that rely on foreign contractors and subcontractors for specialized labor. Experts suggest the incident could have a chilling effect on foreign investment, as companies may now prioritize hiring and training more American workers to avoid similar disruptions. The administration has stated it expects foreign companies investing in the U.S. to hire American citizens.</p>
