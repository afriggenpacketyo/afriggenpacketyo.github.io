            <p>A tragic roof collapse at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, resulted in the deaths of at least 67 people, including former MLB players Octavio Dotel and Tony Blanco, as well as governor Nelsy Cruz. Rescue workers are diligently searching the rubble for potential survivors, while over 140 injured individuals have been hospitalized. The cause of the collapse remains under investigation, and President Luis Abinader has expressed his condolences and assured that all rescue agencies are working tirelessly to assist those affected by this devastating event. The nightclub was hosting a performance by merengue singer Rubby Pérez, who also perished in the collapse.</p>

            <p>The acting commissioner of the IRS has resigned due to a disagreement over the Treasury Department's plan to share immigrants' tax data with ICE. This decision allows ICE to cross-verify the names and addresses of immigrants in the U.S. illegally with their IRS tax records. Treasury argues this will help enforce immigration laws, while advocates claim it violates privacy and could lead to civil and criminal sanctions for IRS officials. The data-sharing agreement has sparked controversy and concerns about the privacy rights of all Americans.</p>

            <p>President Trump's administration is set to impose a significant 104% tariff rate on China, as part of broader tariffs against numerous U.S. trading partners. Trump describes these tariffs as "reciprocal," aiming to address what he perceives as unfair trade imbalances that have persisted for decades. This move has sparked concerns about potential economic repercussions, including losses in the stock market, but the administration asserts it will prompt countries to negotiate deals with the U.S. and boost the economy.

            <p>A US judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore the Associated Press's access to presidential events after the White House blocked the news agency in a dispute over the term "Gulf of America". The judge ruled that the administration's restriction on AP journalists was "contrary to the First Amendment", which guarantees freedom of speech. The AP had argued that the administration violated the news agency's constitutional right to free speech by restricting access due to disagreements over the its language. The ruling was welcomed by other organizations who had criticised the initial restrictions on the AP.</p>

            <p>The State Department has significantly reduced foreign aid, terminating contracts supporting the delivery of food, water, and medicine to several countries, including Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia. The cuts, totaling over $1.3 billion, have drawn criticism from aid organizations, with the World Food Programme warning of a potential "death sentence for millions." The State Department cited concerns about funding benefiting terrorist groups and misuse of cash-based assistance, while some officials claim the cuts were ordered by a USAID deputy administrator.</p>

            <p>The UK government is investigating claims of significant fraud surrounding a fast-growing "green fuel" called HVO diesel. HVO, touted for its ability to reduce carbon emissions by up to 90%, is suspected of being made from fraudulently relabeled virgin palm oil instead of waste materials. Data analysis suggests that Europe is using more palm sludge waste for biofuels than the world can produce, raising concerns about the fuel's sustainability. The investigation aims to address the integrity of biofuel certifications and ensure the environmental benefits of HVO are genuine.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Army is exploring options to make its 250th birthday celebration in June "bigger," with possible demonstrations and vehicle displays on the National Mall. This has fueled speculation that President Trump will try to turn the event into the kind of grand military parade he wanted in his first administration. City officials have been approached about a parade route from the Pentagon into Washington. The Army says no decisions have been made yet, but is planning to celebrate its milestone birthday with "multiple events" leading up to June 14.</p>

            <p>As Tesla shares plummeted, CEO Elon Musk launched a series of attacks on President Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, calling him a "moron" and "dumber than a sack of bricks." Musk's outburst was triggered by Navarro's remark that Tesla is more of a "car assembler" than a car manufacturer. The feud highlights the divide within the Trump administration over trade policies and tariffs. Musk's attacks on Navarro represent the most public spat between members of Trump's inner circle since the president took office in January.</p>

Rice explained that he made the decision to take the free kicks because he felt confident about his ability to score from those positions.

This was his biggest moment so far in an Arsenal shirt, former Arsenal defender Matthew Upson told BBC Radio 5 Live it was "a night to remember" for Rice and he had "single-handedly made the difference".</p>

            <p>There is a battle between Hannah Hampton and Mary Earps in the England goalkeeper battle for the Women's Euros. Wiegman's arrival in 2021 proved a turning point, with Earps starting each of her first seven games in charge and going on to be ever present during Euro 2022, the 2023 World Cup. However, since the beginning of 2024, Wiegman has favoured rotating her goalkeepers, selecting Hampton in six of England's past 10 matches. Hampton is eight years younger than 32-year-old Earps, is this a sign that Wiegman and England are looking to the future?</p>

The proposals are part of a broader effort by the California Latino Legislative Caucus to safeguard undocumented immigrants and counter what they perceive as harmful national policies.</p>
