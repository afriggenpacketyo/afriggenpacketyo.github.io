            <p>A recent poll by the NASUWT teaching union in the UK indicates that social media influencers are contributing to increased misogyny and sexism in schools.  Nearly three in five teachers believe social media negatively impacts student behavior, with influencer Andrew Tate specifically mentioned by several teachers.  Teachers shared anecdotes of young boys mimicking Tate's views, including refusing to speak to female teachers and writing essays praising his controversial opinions on women. The Department for Education has stated its support for teachers in addressing the harmful influence of these figures.</p>
