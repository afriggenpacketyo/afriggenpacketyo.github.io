          <p>Graham Linehan, co-creator of the sitcom "Father Ted," was arrested at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of inciting violence through his posts on the social media platform X. The arrest pertains to three posts from April where he discussed challenging transgender individuals in female-only spaces, which he claims were serious points made with humor. The incident has sparked a significant debate on free speech, with figures like J.K. Rowling and several politicians criticizing the police's actions as disproportionate and an example of "thought-policing." Linehan has been bailed with the condition that he not use X.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Power and the Palace," reveals that Queen Camilla, as a teenager in the mid-1960s, fought off a man who groped her on a London train. She reportedly struck the assailant with her shoe and subsequently reported him to an official, leading to his arrest. This personal experience is believed to be a key reason for her dedicated support of charities that assist survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. The story, shared by a former aide to Boris Johnson, highlights a formative event that has shaped her public advocacy work for decades.</p>

          <p>Elias Morgan, an armed robber, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 45 years for the murder of former prison officer Lenny Scott. The court determined the killing was a "revenge execution" planned for four years after Scott lawfully confiscated a phone from Morgan's cell, which exposed an illicit relationship with another officer. Morgan shot the 33-year-old father of three six times outside a gym in Skelmersdale, Lancashire. The judge described the act as a cold-blooded assassination, and the victim's family delivered powerful statements in court condemning Morgan's cowardice.</p>

          <p>A federal court in California has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard members and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement, which the judge found occurred when troops were used for crowd control and other policing activities during protests. The ruling blocks the administration from using military forces for such purposes in California, though it does not require the withdrawal of troops currently protecting federal property.

While generally easier to obtain than traditional mortgages, applicants must meet specific federal criteria for the common Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). Key requirements include being at least 62 years old, using the property as a primary residence, and having sufficient home equity. Lenders also conduct a financial assessment to ensure borrowers can cover ongoing costs like taxes and insurance, and mandatory counseling is required to explain the loan's implications.

The rising costs are fueling expectations that tax increases may be necessary for the government to meet its fiscal rules.

          <p>A magnitude-5.2 aftershock has struck eastern Afghanistan, compounding the devastation from a powerful earthquake that killed over 1,400 people and injured thousands more.

The market activity was driven by concerns over the legality of U.S. tariffs and their potential economic impact.

The lawsuit, filed in the High Court, claims that they have been underpaid for their contributions to the band's iconic songs, including "Every Breath You Take." Summers and Copeland argue that an oral agreement from 1977 to share publishing income was formalized in later contracts and should apply to both performance and mechanical royalties. Sting's legal team has denied the claims, calling them "illegitimate" and arguing a 2016 agreement prevents such disputes.</p>
