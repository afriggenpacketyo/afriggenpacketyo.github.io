        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A guest essay in the New York Times explores why millennials are increasingly hesitant about having children, noting the record low U.S. fertility rate in 2023. The article suggests that financial burdens, career priorities, climate change anxieties, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade are contributing factors. It also highlights a cultural shift where emotional and relational struggles, previously considered normal, are now labeled as harm or abuse, leading to heightened parenting standards. Adult children are more likely to cut off contact with parents, citing various forms of abuse or feeling unsupported, thus creating an almost impossible standard for parenting, and possibly deterring potential parents. The essay considers these redefined standards and expectations of modern parenthood.</p>

          <p>Charlotte May Lee, a 21-year-old British woman, appeared in a Sri Lankan court after being accused of attempting to smuggle 46kg of cannabis into the country. Lee was arrested upon arrival from Thailand and has denied knowing the drugs were in her luggage, and she could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. During the court appearance, authorities presented the alleged cannabis as evidence, and Lee's lawyer requested that the substance be tested by government authorities. Lee described her prison conditions as sharing a cell with five other women and sleeping on a thin mattress, and she expressed concern for other women who have been waiting for their cases to progress for years.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revised its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for children, now stating that healthy children "may receive" the vaccine based on shared clinical decision-making between parents and healthcare providers. This update follows an announcement that the agency would no longer broadly recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The CDC still broadly recommends the vaccines for immunocompromised children and most adults, while guidance for pregnant women is listed as "No Guidance/Not Applicable." This change means health insurance companies will still be required to cover the shots for now, and the CDC deleted a statement that the guidance was recommended by the committee, approved by the CDC, and backed by medical groups.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly renewing its efforts to "decouple" the United States from China through various measures. These measures include initiating a trade war, imposing export controls, and potentially revoking student visas. This push represents a second chance for Trump administration officials to sever economic and other ties with China. This renewed focus suggests a more aggressive stance towards China during Trump's second term.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a U.S. Steel mill in Pennsylvania as a deal with Japan's Nippon Steel is being finalized, and this follows Trump's announcement of a "planned partnership" between the two companies. The agreement aims to keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pennsylvania, with Trump characterizing it as an investment controlled by the United States. Senator David McCormick indicated that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of U.S. board members, with the U.S. retaining a golden share to ensure production levels are maintained. The United Steelworkers union has opposed the sale, while U.S. Steel warned that without an acquisition, it would pivot away from blast furnace facilities, risking jobs.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to terminate a program that allowed over 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians, and Venezuelans to temporarily live and work in the United States. This decision allows the administration to proceed with ending humanitarian parole for these migrants while a legal battle over the issue continues. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented, with Jackson criticizing the majority for enabling human suffering before a final legal judgment. The program, created by the Biden administration, provided temporary legal status and work authorization for two years, but Trump's administration sought to end it as part of broader immigration restrictions.</p>

          <p>The discovery of five musicians' bodies in Reynosa, Mexico, underscores the ongoing violence in the region. The musicians, members of Grupo Fugitivo, were kidnapped, and their deaths have sparked outrage in Tamaulipas, a state plagued by cartel warfare. The band's disappearance led to protests and calls for support, with people blocking international bridges and praying for the disappeared. Reynosa, a border city adjacent to the U.S., has experienced escalating violence since 2017 due to internal disputes among groups vying for control of drug trafficking, human smuggling, and fuel theft.</p>

The motive for the killings remains unclear, though relatives had received ransom demands. The band played Mexican regional music, a genre that has gained international attention but sometimes faces scrutiny for glorifying drug cartels, but it is not clear if the band played such songs.</p>

The report identifies the Amazon Fire Stick as a key enabler of piracy, allowing access to illegal streams.

          <p>A higher education expert warns that the House Republicans' proposed changes to federal student loans could lead to repayment terms lasting up to 30 years. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would offer just two repayment options: a fixed payment plan over 10 to 25 years, or an income-driven repayment plan (RAP) with loan forgiveness after 30 years. Experts like Mark Kantrowitz suggest that a 30-year repayment term could be akin to "indentured servitude." Monthly bills under RAP would be set as a percentage of a borrower's income, ranging from 1% to 10%.</p>

          <p>A 17-year-old known as The Hull Boy has become the youngest person to run the entire length of the UK, raising about Â£130,000 for a mental health charity. Marcus completed the journey from Land's End to John O'Groats in 58 days, describing it as "the best months of his life." He openly discussed his past struggles with physical and mental health, including a suicide attempt at age 15, and he started running one mile a day before taking on the challenge. The run garnered celebrity attention, including messages from Sir Mo Farah and former NFL star JJ Watt.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by stripping the school of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, jeopardizing the visas of nearly 6,800 international students. This action followed demands for Harvard to turn over five years of footage of protests and disciplinary files, which is described as a chilling attack on free expression. The administration justified its actions by invoking Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, but critics argue that the proper enforcement of Title VI requires an investigation, negotiation, and formal hearing, none of which were followed. The administration's actions are seen as a threat to academic freedom and free speech on college campuses.</p>

          <p>The United States' technology-export restrictions targeting Chinese plane makers are expected to delay China's jet engine indigenization process in the near term, according to analysts. However, this setback is likely to strengthen Beijing's resolve to achieve technological self-reliance and develop a home-grown engine. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has criticized the U.S. engine controls, accusing the U.S. of "maliciously blocking and suppressing China." Analysts anticipate that China will increase resources to develop a domestic jet aircraft engine within the next few years, while Comac may need to slow aircraft production.</p>

A trade agreement earlier this month had reduced tariffs between the two countries, but the remaining tariffs faced a setback when a court invalidated the legal justification for the levies.
