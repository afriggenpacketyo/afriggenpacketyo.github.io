        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. consumer price index increased by 0.3% in June, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.7%, the highest since February. This rise, which met analyst expectations, shows early signs of President Trump's tariffs influencing costs, particularly in apparel and household furnishings. Despite the price increases, which led to a 0.1% decline in real hourly earnings, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its current interest rate policy. The central bank continues to monitor the economic impact of trade policies before considering any adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old man, Daniel Braga Figueiredo, died tragically in Utah's Silver Lake Flat Reservoir after saving a 12-year-old girl. He had borrowed a paddleboard to reach the girl, who was drifting away on an inflatable tube. After a struggle in which both fell into the water, Figueiredo managed to lift the girl to safety on an inflatable device before he submerged and did not resurface. His body was later recovered by rescue teams, prompting condolences from the local sheriff's office.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has officially declared a drought in the East and West Midlands regions of England, following the country's driest start to a year since 1976. The declaration follows similar ones in the North West and Yorkshire, where hosepipe bans are already in effect for millions. The prolonged dry and hot weather has left many rivers at critically low levels, impacting agriculture and wildlife. While the declaration does not automatically trigger water use restrictions, it signals that water companies may introduce them if conditions do not improve with substantial rainfall.</p>

          <p>China's top leadership has called for a fundamental shift in the country's urban development model, moving away from large-scale expansion towards optimizing existing resources and improving quality of life. At a high-level meeting attended by President Xi Jinping, officials emphasized a focus on human well-being, efficiency, and better governance as urban growth stabilizes. This new approach includes creating a new model for property development, renovating urban villages, and repairing dilapidated housing. The change in strategy aims to adapt to new circumstances as 67% of the population now lives in urban areas.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully used publicly available satellite data from NASA to identify promising locations for deep-sea mineral mining in the Indian Ocean. Researchers analyzed gravitational anomaly data from NASA's GRACE satellites, which pointed to areas along the Ninety East Ridge with unusually thick and dense crust. These geological features are often associated with rich deposits of valuable minerals like copper, cobalt, and rare earths. This use of open-source data potentially saved the research team years of effort and significant financial resources in their exploration efforts.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) by offering discounts of up to £3,750 on new cars. The grants, funded by a £650 million program, will apply to eligible models costing up to £37,000, with carmakers applying the discount directly at the point of sale. This initiative is part of the government's strategy to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030.

          <p>This book review examines Linn Ullmann's latest novel, "Girl, 1983," which challenges the conventions of memoir and autobiographical fiction. The book centers on a writer who attempts to reconstruct a painful memory from her adolescence involving a relationship with an older photographer, grappling with the gaps and absences in her recollection. The reviewer notes that Ullmann, daughter of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, uses the novel form to explore the fluid nature of memory, suggesting that all autobiography is a form of fiction. The work is praised for its deft experimentation with genre and its profound meditation on how experiences persist.</p>

The decision is a significant development in U.S.-China tech trade relations and a major boost for Nvidia, which can now better compete with rivals like Huawei in the critical Chinese market. The previous export controls were implemented over national security concerns, but tech leaders have argued that such limits hinder U.S. competitiveness.
