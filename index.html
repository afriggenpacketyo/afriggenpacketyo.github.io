          <p>Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik has denied any responsibility for the death of American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who died from a suspected suicide. Kramnik had publicly accused the 29-year-old of online cheating, which Naroditsky denied but admitted had taken a toll on his mental health. In a statement, Kramnik called the death a tragedy and claimed he was the target of a harassment campaign, while also stating his lawyers were preparing lawsuits over false accusations. The International Chess Federation (Fide) has referred Kramnik's public statements to its Ethics and Disciplinary Commission for review.</p>

          <p>Bijou Phillips, the former wife of actor Danny Masterson, has filed a petition to legally change their 11-year-old daughter's surname from Masterson to Phillips. This move comes after Masterson was convicted in 2023 for sexually assaulting two women and is currently serving a sentence of 30 years to life in a California prison. Phillips filed for divorce shortly after the verdict, and a judge recently declared both her and Masterson legally single. Masterson's legal team is currently appealing his conviction, arguing that procedural errors undermined the fairness of his trial.</p>

          <p>Melissa has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane and is on a path to deliver potentially catastrophic flash flooding and landslides to Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The National Hurricane Center warns that the storm, currently moving slowly in the Caribbean, is expected to intensify rapidly into a major hurricane by Sunday. Forecasters predict rainfall of up to 25 inches in some areas, creating life-threatening conditions, particularly in mountainous terrain. While the storm is not expected to directly impact the mainland United States, it could become the strongest of the Atlantic season.</p>

          <p>The recent daylight robbery at the Louvre museum in Paris, where thieves stole nine jewels valued at over $100 million, has unexpectedly become a source of viral internet content. While French authorities continue their investigation, brands, influencers, and even celebrities have capitalized on the event's cinematic quality, creating memes and tongue-in-cheek advertisements. For instance, the German machinery company whose lift was used in the heist posted a cheeky ad about its equipment's speed and silence. This cultural phenomenon highlights a public fascination with non-violent, high-stakes crimes, turning the audacious theft into a widespread topic of online humor and commentary.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated that she is considering another run for the presidency, stating, "I am not done." While promoting her new book, Harris reflected on her 2024 campaign and criticized President Trump's leadership, labeling him a "tyrant." When asked directly about a future presidential bid, she responded "possibly," but clarified it is not her immediate focus. Recent polling in her home state of California, however, shows limited support for another run, with fewer than a third of voters endorsing the idea compared to Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>England's rugby league team experienced a significant setback, losing 26-6 to Australia in the first Ashes match in 22 years, a performance their head coach described as "torture." The English side was plagued by simple mistakes and wasted opportunities, allowing Australia to secure a comfortable victory despite a slow start. The Australian team's superior quality was evident, particularly in the second half, and they now need just one more win to retain the Ashes. The defeat has prompted calls for changes to England's lineup ahead of the next match in Liverpool.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery after ingesting between 80 and 100 small, high-powered magnets, which he reportedly purchased online.

          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index funds, sometimes called "VOO and chill," may be losing its appeal due to a lack of diversification. With the technology sector now accounting for a record 35% of the index, some strategists argue that investors are overly exposed to a small number of large-cap stocks. As a result, there is renewed interest in other market segments, particularly small-cap stocks, which have recently outperformed the S&P 500. This potential shift indicates that investors are seeking broader exposure beyond the dominant tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

Cuban calculates that saving 40% on $2,000 worth of annual consumables yields $800 in savings, emphasizing this as a smart, accessible money move.

          <p>Law enforcement officers opened fire on a U-Haul truck outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, California, during a protest against a planned immigration crackdown. The incident occurred when the driver abruptly reversed the vehicle toward a line of security personnel, who then discharged their weapons. The driver, who was wounded in the stomach, drove away but later returned and abandoned the vehicle before being taken into custody for a mental health evaluation. The protest was in response to the base being designated as a staging area for Border Patrol agents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent demolition of the White House's historic East Wing to make way for a new, privately-funded $300 million ballroom has drawn significant criticism. The rapid destruction of the structure, which housed the First Lady's office and held historical significance dating back to Theodore Roosevelt's administration, was described as shocking by commentators. Critics view the move as a disregard for historical preservation and another example of President Trump's unconventional approach to the presidency. The action has raised questions about the extent of presidential authority over modifying such a cherished national landmark.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the controversial demolition of the White House East Wing, a journalist embarked on a quest to locate the historic rubble, uncovering a secretive and scattered disposal process. Some of the soil was transported to East Potomac Golf Links, a public course, reportedly to be used in creating a new hole as part of a potential Trump-led rebranding. However, finding the actual structural debris proved more difficult, with dump sites denying any involvement and workers instructed not to speak to the press. The search highlights how remnants of a public landmark can be quietly removed and repurposed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to end trade negotiations with Canada could lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers on goods like automobiles, auto parts, and home appliances. The halt in talks was reportedly triggered by a Canadian TV ad critical of tariffs, and it may keep existing 50% levies on Canadian steel and aluminum in place for an extended period. Since these metals are key components in many manufactured goods, trade experts warn that U.S. companies will face higher input costs, which are likely to be passed on to consumers. </p>

          <p>A new report reveals that more than one-third of Manhattan condo apartments sold over the last year were sold at a loss, reflecting a decade of stagnant prices in the market. The median price per square foot for condos has remained flat since 2015, a stark contrast to the significant home price increases seen across most of the U.S. When accounting for inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual share of unprofitable sales is likely even higher. The luxury segment of the market, however, has bucked this trend, with properties sold for over $10 million consistently yielding profits. (not investment advice)</p>

The video shows a car tailgating, attempting a dangerous pass that nearly caused a collision, and the driver gesturing aggressively out the window. The Tesla owner reported the incident to the police but noted they seemed uninterested, even with video evidence and a license plate number. The event adds to a growing number of reported harassment incidents targeting Tesla drivers, potentially linked to the public profile of CEO Elon Musk.</p>

This major real estate transaction coincides with Bezos steadily reducing his ownership stake in Amazon, which has fallen below 10% for the first time since the company went public.

While the result was not a landslide, it places Powell in a senior, directly elected role. Following the announcement, Powell and Starmer held a meeting, and she has indicated her critiques of the party's direction will primarily be articulated privately.</p>
