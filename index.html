          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, was released from federal custody after a judge ordered her immediate release. She had been detained for six weeks, sparking outrage over immigration policies. Ozturk's visa was canceled amidst the Trump administration's crackdown on higher education, with accusations of antisemitism. Supporters argue she was detained in retaliation for criticizing the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands in a student newspaper. The article highlights the emotional toll on Ozturk and her supporters, with her release delayed due to the government's attempt to make her wear an ankle monitor.</p>

          <p>David Thornley, a livestock farmer, is taking legal action against East Midlands Airport, alleging that a leaking pipe polluted a brook running through his grazing land, leading to the loss of valuable pedigree lambs. He claims 25 of his ewes lost their lambs after drinking from the brook in 2022. The airport has pleaded guilty to exceeding environmental permit limits but denies any link between the discharge and bacterial pollution in the brook. Environmental studies suggest de-icing chemicals from airport runways can affect water quality, encouraging the growth of sewage fungus.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland to discuss tariffs, with President Trump claiming "great progress" and a "total reset" in a friendly manner. The talks aimed to de-escalate trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, which have been engaged in a trade war involving tariffs on each other's goods. Discussions likely focused on de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade deal, with both countries acknowledging the unsustainability of current tariff levels. Trump has suggested lowering tariffs on China, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth offered the victim investment opportunities promising high returns with no risk, eventually depleting her savings and leading her to take out a reverse mortgage. Prosecutors revealed that Cohen-Roth was running a Ponzi scheme, using new deposits to pay off earlier investors and funding a lavish lifestyle.

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to stop considering the economic damage caused by climate change when developing policies and regulations. This directive effectively shelves the “social cost of carbon,” a metric used to weigh the costs and benefits of policies limiting carbon pollution. Jeffrey B. Clark, acting administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, questioned the scientific consensus on anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and environmental groups criticize the move as denying reality and ignoring the economic impacts of climate change.</p>
