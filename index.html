        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, through her attorney Abbe Lowell, has announced plans to sue President Donald Trump over his attempt to remove her from office, a move Lowell asserts lacks legal or factual basis. Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud predating Cook's Fed appointment, but the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 permits removal only "for cause" related to official duties, not prior conduct. Cook has publicly stated her refusal to resign, emphasizing her commitment to the American economy and her intent to continue her responsibilities. This high-stakes legal challenge is poised to ignite a significant constitutional debate, potentially reaching the Supreme Court and raising critical questions about the independence and political insulation of the nation's central bank, a cornerstone of economic stability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to seek the death penalty for all murder prosecutions in Washington, D.C., despite the city's decades-old repeal of capital punishment. During a Cabinet meeting, he also revealed plans for "very substantial" tariffs on furniture imports, aiming to complete an investigation within 50 days, which analysts predict will likely raise consumer prices. Additionally, Trump touted his crime record amid federal takeovers of cities and confirmed Dan Scavino, his longest-serving aide, would become the new director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office. These announcements signal significant policy shifts and administrative appointments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cracker Barrel's recent logo redesign, which removed the iconic image of founder Dan Evins' Uncle Herschel, has triggered a significant public backlash and contributed to a nearly $100 million drop in the company's value. Marketing experts describe the rebrand as a "flop," arguing it severed the company's design from its folksy, "homestyle country cooking" roots, alienating loyal customers who associate the old logo with a "simpler time." While the company acknowledges missteps in communication and insists Uncle Herschel remains part of its brand, the incident highlights the perils of altering a legacy brand's identity without fully understanding customer emotional investment, especially in a polarized cultural environment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The City of Los Angeles is facing a request for an additional $5 million in legal fees from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP, the high-powered law firm defending the city in a lawsuit concerning its homeless programs. This new request would raise the firm's contract to $5.9 million, following an initial $900,000 approval and prior billings of $3.2 million for just weeks of work. City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto defends the firm's role in preventing a federal takeover of homeless initiatives, but council members and the opposing L.A. Alliance argue the money would be better spent on housing solutions. The escalating costs highlight a contentious legal battle amid the city's financial challenges.</p>

          <p>Whirlpool, the American appliance manufacturer, expects President Trump's tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to provide a competitive edge against foreign rivals like LG and Samsung, who rely heavily on cheaper imports. With 80% of its products made in the U.S. across 10 factories, Whirlpool believes the 50% tariffs will level the playing field by increasing the cost for competitors, aligning their prices with Whirlpool's domestically sourced products. While the company has seen declining volumes recently, it is prepared to ramp up hiring and production if demand for American-made appliances rises, potentially revitalizing domestic manufacturing but also raising consumer prices.

Talarico, known for his unique approach, has notably referred to President Donald Trump as a "child of God," a statement that sets him apart in the polarized political landscape. His ability to connect with a broad range of voters, even those not typically aligned with the Democratic party, suggests a nuanced political strategy aimed at expanding the party's reach in conservative strongholds.

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, successfully met its primary goal in a late-stage trial for patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, paving the way for global regulatory approval. The drug helped patients lose an average of 10.5% of their weight over 72 weeks and significantly lowered blood sugar levels, with most no longer meeting Type 2 diabetes criteria. This needle-free alternative to existing GLP-1 injections could boost supply and accessibility in the lucrative weight loss market, offering a more convenient option without dietary restrictions. While some side effects, mainly gastrointestinal, led to discontinuations, the overall efficacy and potential for widespread access are seen as highly positive.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's attempt to dismiss Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is raising serious concerns about the central bank's independence and its potential impact on the U.S. economy. Historically, presidents have clashed with the Fed over interest rates, but Trump's aim to reshape the entire board with politically aligned individuals is unprecedented. Economists warn that political interference in monetary policy, such as forcing interest rate cuts, could lead to increased inflation, market instability, and higher borrowing costs for the government, potentially eroding global investor confidence in the U.S. financial system. This ongoing dispute highlights the critical role of the Fed's autonomy in maintaining economic stability.</p>

          <p>Germany's auto industry has experienced significant job losses, cutting approximately 51,500 positions, nearly 7% of its workforce, within the past year, making it the most affected sector in the ongoing economic downturn. This decline is attributed to falling sales, intense competition from China, the costly transition to electric vehicles, and the impact of U.S. tariffs. Overall industrial employment in Germany has shrunk by 114,000 jobs, or 2.1%, compared to a year prior, with revenue falling for the eighth consecutive quarter. Experts warn this trend will persist, potentially leading to rising unemployment among young engineers, a rare occurrence for Germany.</p>

          <p>An open letter signed by 209 former EU and member state ambassadors and staff has called for the immediate implementation of EU measures against Israel, citing its "unlawful actions in Gaza and the West Bank." The diplomats proposed nine actions, including suspending arms export licenses, halting funding for co-financed projects involving Israeli entities, and enforcing human rights sanctions such as visa bans and asset freezes. The letter expressed profound disappointment over the lack of substantive EU action despite the deteriorating situation and mounting Palestinian casualties, urging pressure on Israel to end the conflict and allow humanitarian access.</p>

          <p>Protests have escalated across Israel, with demonstrators blocking major highways and rallying outside government offices to demand the immediate release of remaining hostages and an end to the Gaza war. Families of the captives accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government of prolonging the conflict and rejecting peace deals for political gain. Activists also voiced strong opposition to the government's plans for a new offensive to seize Gaza City, which Christian leaders in Jerusalem have called a "death sentence" for civilians sheltering there. The demonstrations reflect growing public frustration and a desire for a resolution to the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook directly challenges a recent Supreme Court decision that appeared to protect Fed leaders from presidential dismissal, despite the Court's general support for the "unitary executive" theory. This legal theory, favored by Republican justices, posits that the president should have full control over executive agencies. Critics argue Trump's claim of "cause" for Cook's firing, based on mortgage fraud allegations, is a pretext to exert political influence over the independent central bank. The impending lawsuit is expected to reach the Supreme Court, testing the judiciary's willingness to uphold the Fed's crucial independence from political manipulation, which is vital for economic stability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly weighed in on the controversial rebranding of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, urging the company to revert to its old logo and "admit a mistake based on customer response." Trump suggested the company could leverage the "Billion Dollars worth of free publicity" if handled correctly, even proposing a "major News Conference." His comments followed similar criticism from his son, Donald Trump Jr., and a drop in the company's stock after the new logo, which removed the iconic "Uncle Herschel" character, was unveiled. This intervention highlights the intersection of corporate branding, consumer sentiment, and high-profile political commentary.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order mandating a one-year jail sentence for flag burning, a move immediately challenged by critics, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, who pointed out a major contradiction. The Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that flag burning is protected under the First Amendment, rendering Trump's order legally problematic. Social media users and politicians like Rep. Jamie Raskin further highlighted the inconsistency, noting Trump's pardoning of January 6 rioters who assaulted police with flagpoles, contrasting it with his stated concern for flag desecration. Newsom's comment, "Clearly, Donald Trump really cares about the American flag," underscored the perceived hypocrisy.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has announced an ambitious "Operation Restoring Justice" plan to deport 500,000-600,000 migrants over five years, aiming to halt illegal crossings by detaining and deporting all small boat arrivals. The party proposes making £2 billion available for payments to countries like Afghanistan for migrant returns and would establish new detention centers. Key to their strategy is a new Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill, which would "disapply" international treaties such as the Refugee Convention and involve leaving the European Convention on Human Rights. This controversial plan faces significant legal and practical challenges, drawing criticism from Labour and the Conservatives for its lack of detail and feasibility.</p>

Boko announced 250 million pula in emergency funding, with military oversight for distribution, after discovering drastically lower quotes for medicine supplies compared to CMS.
