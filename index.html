            <p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise's stock experienced a significant jump after Elliott Investment Management acquired a substantial stake, exceeding $1.5 billion, with the intention of engaging in discussions to enhance shareholder value. This investment comes at a time when HPE's shares have declined considerably this year, despite the company exceeding quarterly revenue projections but issuing a weak fiscal full-year guidance. Elliott Management's move suggests a belief in HPE's potential for improvement and could lead to strategic changes within the company. The activist investor hopes to engage the company in discussions on how to improve shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Treasury yields experienced a period of relative calm after a week marked by significant volatility in the bond market, where the 10-year Treasury yield had surged by over 50 basis points. Concerns about debt and hedge fund selling, coupled with worries about foreign holdings of U.S. government debt, particularly by China and Japan, contributed to the market turbulence. Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, noted long-standing investor worries about the risk of Chinese and Japanese investors reducing their U.S. Treasury holdings. Felix Brill, chief investment officer at VP Bank, suggested that increased CDS spreads for U.S. debt could also be contributing to market stress. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A leading Republican warns that American families could face a substantial tax increase next year if Congress fails to extend President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Republican Study Committee (RSC) Chairman August Pfluger, R-Texas, is emphasizing the potential financial strain on millions of families and small businesses if the tax cuts expire, leading to a significant tax hike. Republicans are pushing to make the TCJA permanent to stimulate job creation, boost the economy, and protect family budgets. Failure to extend these cuts could have politically devastating consequences and stoke fears of an economic downturn.</p>

The council says it is working to restore regular weekly household waste collections for all residents.

The government's intervention followed accusations that British Steel's Chinese owner, Jingye, planned to shut down blast furnaces. The government is now seeking alternative private investors while not ruling out nationalization, emphasizing the need to secure the UK's steel production capabilities.</p>

            <p>Despite the short-term economic shock caused by President Trump's tariffs, some in Beijing believe the trade war with the US could serve as a catalyst for China's technological advancement and domestic market integration. An economic work official suggests that the tariffs compel China to strengthen its innovation capacity and build a fully integrated domestic economic circulation system. While Beijing has vowed to "fight until the end," the trade war may ultimately accelerate China's self-reliance and technological progress. China has matched each round of the tariffs imposed by Washington, slapping levies of 125 per cent on US imports.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to lead to a reshoring boom in the U.S., as most companies find it more cost-effective to relocate supply chains to lower-tariffed countries. The survey reveals that companies cite cost as the primary reason for not reshoring, followed by the challenge of finding skilled labor. Instead of bringing manufacturing back to the United States, a majority of respondents believe it would be more cost-effective to relocate supply chains to countries with lower tariffs. Automation is expected to dominate if manufacturing returns to the U.S., with a majority of respondents planning to use it more than human workers.</p>

            <p>China has reportedly instructed its airlines to suspend further deliveries of Boeing jets, escalating the trade war with the U.S. The Chinese government has also asked carriers to cease purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from American companies. This decision follows China's increase in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to President Trump's levies on Chinese imports. The restriction marks a significant setback for Boeing and other manufacturers navigating the trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, potentially impacting Boeing's production and financial performance.</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has launched a tourism campaign urging Canadians to visit the state, aiming to counter a decline in Canadian tourism attributed to President Trump's policies. The campaign emphasizes California's welcoming environment and diverse attractions, distancing the state from Trump's administration. Canadian tourism in California has declined, with many Canadians citing concerns about Trump's policies and negative perceptions of the U.S. The campaign seeks to reassure Canadians and promote California as a destination with "plenty of sunshine and a whole lot of love."</p>
