          <p>The United States is experiencing its worst measles outbreak this century, originating in West Texas and spreading across four states, resulting in multiple deaths. The article highlights that the number of reported cases is expected to exceed 1,000 this week, surpassing the total cases in 2019, which was previously the worst year since 1992. The article attributes the outbreak to declining vaccination rates, fueled by anti-vaccine sentiment and the influence of figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The article emphasizes the importance of vaccination and suggests adults and parents check their immunity and vaccination status, respectively, to combat the spread of measles.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the difficult position of pro-tariff liberals as President Trump's policies discredit the use of tariffs. According to the article, these liberals fear that Trump's approach will lead to a re-embracing of free trade by the Democratic Party. They must convince their side that tariffs are a valuable policy tool when applied rationally. The article explores the shift in trade consensus and the challenges faced by those who advocate for targeted tariffs.</p>

          <p>A federal court is set to decide whether to strike down President Trump's tariffs, with a hearing scheduled in the US Court of International Trade. According to the article, the plaintiffs, small businesses that import goods, argue that the tariffs are illegal under the Supreme Court's "major questions doctrine." The Yale Budget Lab estimates that Trump's tariffs are expected to reduce the average US household's income. The article notes that former Republican officials have filed an amicus brief calling for the tariffs to be ruled illegal.</p>
