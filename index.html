          <p>Nexstar Media Group is evaluating whether to reinstate "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC-affiliated stations after preempting the show's return. This decision follows host Jimmy Kimmel's controversial comments linking a conservative activist's alleged killer to the MAGA movement, leading to his temporary suspension by ABC parent Disney. Nexstar and Sinclair, two major station owners, cited concerns about the program reflecting community interests and potential FCC scrutiny. The situation highlights ongoing tensions between media corporations, political figures, and content moderation issues.</p>

          <p>The family of a victim from a tragic plane and Army helicopter collision over Washington, D.C., has filed a lawsuit against the FAA, Army, American Airlines, and PSA Airlines. This legal action, expected to be joined by over 60 other families, seeks accountability for the deadliest U.S. plane crash since 2001, which killed 67 people. The lawsuit alleges failures to address over 30 documented near-misses and inadequate pilot training regarding helicopter traffic. Investigators have already cited the helicopter flying above limits and the FAA ignoring alarming patterns, underscoring systemic safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's newly appointed U.S. Attorney in Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, plans to seek an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress. This move comes despite prosecutors and investigators concluding there was insufficient evidence to establish probable cause for charges. Justice Department guidelines generally bar charges without a high likelihood of conviction. Halligan's decision, following a direct directive from Trump, raises significant concerns about political influence in the legal system and the pursuit of charges without established evidence.</p>

Both teams enter with 2-1 records, and the Vikings will play a second consecutive game across the pond in London next week. Aaron Rodgers, in his first season with the Steelers, will face a familiar opponent from his Green Bay Packers days, while Carson Wentz starts for the Vikings due to an injury to J.J. McCarthy.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering financial support for Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain firms, which are struggling after a cyber attack halted JLR's car production since late August. With factories suspended until next month, smaller suppliers face potential collapse without aid. Options being explored include the government purchasing component parts to sustain businesses or providing COVID-style furlough schemes, though the latter is currently ruled out due to cost and a desire to keep people working. The Business and Trade Select Committee is scheduled to discuss the issue further.</p>

Unlike the claustrophobic setup in Rome, this year's stand is larger and further back, but players still anticipate significant nerves. European captain Luke Donald's team is engaging in a charm offensive, signing autographs and showing respect to the locals, hoping to temper the vitriol. However, American players and fans alike expect "absolute chaos" and "hardcore USA" chants once the tournament officially begins, with President Trump's expected appearance potentially amplifying the fervor.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the UN Climate Summit, nations are submitting new climate targets (NDCs), but many major emitters, including the EU and India, are falling short or delaying. China, the world's largest emitter, pledged a 7-10% reduction from peak emissions by 2035, which critics deem insufficient for 1.5C goals despite its massive clean energy investments. The UK has set an ambitious 81% reduction target from 1990 levels, while the Trump administration has withdrawn the US from the Paris Agreement, voiding previous commitments. This article highlights the critical gap between current pledges and the drastic cuts needed to tackle the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>Americans traveling to most European countries will soon undergo fingerprint scans and photographs upon arrival under the EU's new Entry/Exit System, starting October 12. This system, replacing passport stamps, aims to enhance security across the 29-country Schengen Area and track overstayers. Travelers refusing biometric data will be denied entry, with data retained for up to five years. The changes, developed amidst increased migration, come as President Trump criticized Europe's immigration policies at the UN General Assembly, highlighting ongoing debates about border control and security.</p>

          <p>This article expresses profound concern over an alleged "MAGA Media Takeover" under President Trump's second administration, citing instances of tech titans capitulating to the commander-in-chief and government accounts spreading hateful memes. The author warns that the impending sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to Trump allies, including Larry Ellison, could grant unprecedented control over social media, potentially weaponizing data for political targeting and surveillance. This trend, coupled with government pressure on media outlets like ABC, is viewed as an erosion of free speech and a dangerous shift towards authoritarian control over public discourse.</p>
