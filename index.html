          <p>U.S. stock markets experienced a significant downturn after the White House announced new tariffs on 14 countries, fueling investor anxiety over escalating trade tensions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both fell, reversing a recent market rally that had been partly attributed to favorable trade news. Analysts express concern that the economic impact of these tariffs is still underestimated, suggesting that the increased reliance on this revenue could pose a risk to market stability despite a recent strong jobs report. The move creates renewed uncertainty for investors globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The historic flash floods in central Texas claimed over 100 lives, with victims ranging from young summer campers to a father who died saving his family. Among the deceased were multiple children and counselors from Camp Mystic, including its longtime director, Dick Eastland, who was remembered as a hero for his efforts to save campers. Stories of tragedy and heroism have emerged, such as that of Julian Ryan, who lost his life trying to help his fiancée and two young sons escape their flooded home. Communities are mourning the profound loss of life from the devastating event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is pushing back against criticism that federal cuts to the National Weather Service may have contributed to the devastation from the Texas floods. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called such claims "a depraved lie," insisting the local NWS office was adequately staffed and issued timely warnings. However, some Democratic leaders have called for an investigation into whether staffing shortages impacted the agency's forecasting abilities. While officials detailed a timeline of alerts, questions remain about their effectiveness, as they were issued when many residents were likely asleep during the catastrophic event.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced steep new tariffs on imports from 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia, set to begin on August 1. The tariff rates vary, with some as high as 40%, in an effort to correct what the president views as persistent trade deficits. This move comes as a 90-day pause on previously announced "reciprocal tariffs" was set to expire, with the deadline now extended to align with the new levies. The letters sent to the nations warn against retaliatory duties, stating any such action would result in further increases to the U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seraphine, the maternity fashion brand famously worn by the Princess of Wales, has ceased trading and entered administration, resulting in the majority of its 95 employees being made redundant. The company, which gained international popularity after its clothes were worn by royalty, has struggled with "trading challenges" and fragile consumer confidence. Administrators are now exploring options for the business and its assets, including the brand itself. The closure marks a significant downturn for the retailer, which had listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2021 before returning to private ownership.</p>

          <p>The White House has revived its trade war by announcing new tariffs on numerous countries, including major trading partners like Japan and South Korea, effective August 1. This action follows a 90-day pause initiated in April after a previous tariff announcement caused significant market turmoil.

          <p>The UK government is set to ban the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will void any confidentiality clauses that seek to prevent workers from speaking out about such allegations. The move follows years of campaigning by activists like Zelda Perkins, Harvey Weinstein's former assistant, who argued that NDAs were being abused to cover up criminal behavior. The change aims to address the misuse of these legal agreements and ensure that inappropriate workplace conduct is addressed rather than concealed.</p>

          <p>An examination into whether Trump administration cuts to the National Weather Service (NWS) impacted the response to the fatal Texas floods reveals a complex situation. While the NWS workforce has been reduced by about 600 staff members, experts suggest that forecasting for the event was adequate, and the local office had increased staffing as is standard procedure. However, critics argue that the cuts, which left key communication-focused positions vacant in some Texas offices, may have hindered effective coordination with local emergency services. The White House denies any link, while others call for a retrospective analysis of the response.</p>

The piece focuses on National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who defended the claim by dismissing Congressional Budget Office projections that 8 million people would lose their insurance. The author argues Hassett's reasoning is flawed and points to his history of inaccurate economic forecasts, such as the book "Dow 36,000." The analysis suggests the administration's claims are a form of political messaging rather than a credible economic projection, aimed at downplaying the real-world impact of the spending bill.

          <p>A pilot project in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is testing solutions to combat the "Urban Heat Island" effect, where dense urban areas become significantly hotter than greener surroundings. The "cool block" initiative, led by the environmental group GreenRoots, involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat. Research shows such interventions can reduce peak temperatures by several degrees, a crucial strategy as climate change intensifies heat waves. The project serves as a potential model for other cities looking to mitigate extreme heat and improve livability in their most vulnerable neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced it will remove the foreign terrorist organization designation for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the rebel group whose leader now governs Syria. This policy change follows the group's successful campaign to overthrow the Assad regime. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision recognizes positive actions by the new Syrian government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, including a commitment to disband HTS and combat terrorism. The move is a significant step in normalizing relations, despite HTS's past affiliation with al Qaeda, which had led to its decade-long terrorist designation.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed the discovery of remains belonging to all seven workers who were missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The fatal blast occurred at a facility that was not permitted to store fireworks, and the property is reportedly owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. The coroner's office is now working to formally identify the victims through DNA testing. The incident, which also sparked an 80-acre grass fire, is under investigation by state and federal agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and is now being treated as a law enforcement incident.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is facing criticism for praising Mom's Meals, a company that provides taxpayer-funded meals to Medicaid and Medicare recipients. While Kennedy lauded the company for offering food "without additives," an Associated Press review found that its menu consists of ultraprocessed items containing chemical additives and high levels of sodium, sugar, or fat. This endorsement appears to contradict Kennedy's public stance against ultraprocessed foods, which he has frequently blamed for the nation's health issues. Nutrition experts who reviewed the menu confirmed the meals are heavily processed, raising questions about the administration's "Make America Healthy Again" initiative.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major U.S. medical associations and a pregnant physician have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, targeting Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policies on Covid-19 vaccines. The suit challenges Kennedy's unilateral decision to recommend against the vaccine for pregnant women and healthy children, a move that contradicted scientific evidence and expert panel reviews. The plaintiffs argue that this action, along with the firing of a key vaccine advisory panel, is part of a broader effort to promote anti-vaccine rhetoric. The lawsuit seeks to prevent what it calls the dismantling of the nation's system of preventable disease control.</p>

          <p>After five consecutive weeks of decline, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage has fallen to 6.75%, providing a slight reprieve for prospective homebuyers. This downward trend occurred while the Federal Reserve has kept its key interest rate steady, highlighting that other factors like the 10-year Treasury yield also influence mortgage rates. Future movement in July will likely depend on the upcoming inflation report and signals from the Federal Reserve's next meeting. While a rate cut is not expected, lenders may preemptively adjust their offers, creating potential opportunities for prepared buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the process of wage garnishment, a legal tool creditors use to collect unpaid debts directly from a person's paycheck. For most consumer debts, garnishment requires a court order and can continue until the debt, plus interest and fees, is fully paid. Federal law typically limits the amount to 25% of disposable income, but rules differ for specific debts like federal student loans and taxes, which often have more aggressive collection processes. The article outlines potential ways to stop or reduce garnishment, such as challenging it in court, negotiating with the creditor, or filing for bankruptcy.</p>
