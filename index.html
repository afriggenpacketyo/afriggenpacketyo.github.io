          <p>Japan, traditionally a pacifist nation, is shifting its focus towards the global arms export market to strengthen ties with allies and enhance the interoperability of its forces. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has signaled a sharper focus on the defense sector, attending defense exhibitions and advocating for increased defense spending. This strategic shift aims to bolster Japan's defense industrial base, which has suffered due to reliance on U.S. weapon purchases. By exporting arms, Japan hopes to achieve economies of scale and ensure the viability of domestic defense production, especially amid rising global defense demands. The country also aims to address concerns from the U.S. regarding defense spending among allies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of President Donald Trump's budget bill is facing potential opposition from House Republicans, creating challenges for its passage. Key disagreements revolve around state and local tax (SALT) deductions, Medicaid provider taxes, and the child tax credit. While the Senate proposes keeping the SALT deduction cap at $10,000, the House seeks a $40,000 deduction for those earning under $500,000. The Senate bill also reduces Medicaid provider taxes, potentially impacting rural hospitals, and lowers the child tax credit compared to the House version. The bill is essential for funding Trump's second-term agenda (not investment advice).</p>

An independent review found the Church's response fell short of today's standards, and Cleveland Police also acknowledged missed opportunities in their investigations.
