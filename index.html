          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 05:17:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has affirmed its intention to impose higher tariffs on the European Union starting August 1, despite ongoing negotiations. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described the date as a "hard deadline" for a baseline 30% tariff, although he expressed confidence that a deal could eventually be reached. The EU is preparing retaliatory measures but hopes to secure a more favorable agreement, similar to the 10% baseline tariff deal the U.K. arranged. However, analysts are skeptical about the EU's ability to achieve a similar outcome due to a more contentious trade relationship with the current U.S. administration.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 05:05:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government has issued a stark warning that individuals retiring in 2050 will likely be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless urgent action is taken to increase retirement savings. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to investigate the issue. Current analysis reveals that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners, the self-employed, women, and certain ethnic minorities, are not contributing to a private pension. The government projects that without intervention, those retiring in 25 years could face an 8% reduction in annual pension income compared to current retirees.</p>

          <h2>Young Black Voter Argues Democratic Party Must Address Economic Issues to Regain Trust</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion article, a young Black female voter contends that the Democratic party has until the 2028 election to regain the trust of her demographic by focusing on tangible economic solutions. The author criticizes the party's establishment figures, like Rahm Emanuel, for now lamenting the very elitism they previously embodied. She argues that while inclusivity is important, the party has prioritized identity politics over addressing core issues like skyrocketing rent, student debt, and healthcare costs. With no clear heir apparent for 2028, she views the upcoming election as a crucial opportunity for the party to embrace authenticity and address the affordability crisis facing younger Americans.</p>

          <p>WNBA players are publicly demanding better compensation, highlighted by pre-game warm-up shirts that read "Pay us what you owe us" during the All-Star Game. This article examines the financial complexities behind their protest, questioning the league's reported annual losses in the face of significant growth in revenue, attendance, and broadcast rights. While the NBA and WNBA have an integrated financial relationship, the players' share of league revenue is currently under 10%, a figure starkly lower than in other professional sports. The rapid increase in team valuations, such as the New York Liberty's estimated jump from around $14 million to $450 million in six years, further fuels the players' argument for a larger portion of the league's financial success.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is legally challenging the Trump administration's decision to freeze over $2 billion in federal grants and contracts, arguing the move is illegal and jeopardizes vital research. The administration froze the funding after accusing Harvard of failing to adequately address antisemitism on campus, a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. In its lawsuit, Harvard contends the government violated federal procedure, interfered with academic freedom, and that there is no rational link between the antisemitism claims and the scientific research being halted. The case is being closely watched by other universities that have also had federal funding suspended.</p>

          <p>Following devastating floods that killed over 130 people in the Texas Hill Country, state lawmakers have begun a special legislative session focused on disaster recovery and future prevention. The agenda includes improving early warning systems and providing relief funds, with hearings planned in the hard-hit Kerrville area. However, the session, called by Governor Greg Abbott, also includes several contentious Republican priorities, such as redrawing congressional maps, tightening abortion medication laws, and regulating transgender bathroom access. The state's recovery plans are complicated by uncertainty over the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced the "Safer Beauty Bill Package," a set of four bills aimed at regulating toxic ingredients in personal care products sold across the United States. The legislation seeks to ban hazardous chemicals like formaldehyde and phthalates, mandate full ingredient disclosure, and fund research into safer alternatives, particularly for products marketed to women of color and salon workers. This initiative follows the 2022 Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act (MoCRA), which advocates argue did not sufficiently address ingredient safety. The proposed bills aim to align U.S. standards more closely with those in the European Union, which has banned thousands more chemicals from cosmetics.</p>

In its decision, the high court panel stated that the prosecution had "utterly failed to prove the case" and found its witnesses to be unreliable. The ruling means the 11 surviving accused will be released after spending nearly two decades in prison for crimes the court now believes they did not commit, raising serious questions about the original investigation and trial.</p>

          <p>Venture capitalists often use a principle known as the "power law" to guide their investment decisions in startups. This concept, derived from the Pareto principle, posits that a very small number of investments will generate the vast majority of a fund's returns, outweighing all other losses and smaller successes combined. Consequently, VCs actively seek companies with "outsized-outcome potential" that could become massive, category-defining winners like Spotify or Klarna. To secure funding, founders are advised to pitch a compelling vision for how their company can achieve such enormous scale, supported by evidence of a strong product-market fit and an ambitious, skilled founding team.</p>

Its success reflects growing public frustration with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) over economic issues, the cost-of-living crisis, and immigration.

The proposals aim to address systemic issues like underinvestment, excessive corporate debt, sewage spills, and leaking infrastructure. While water companies are set to invest over £100 billion in upgrades, the review acknowledges that customer bills will inevitably rise to fund the necessary catch-up investment.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has stated he is "100%" confident that the club followed all correct procedures regarding former midfielder Thomas Partey, who now faces criminal charges. Partey was charged with multiple counts of sexual assault involving three women shortly after his contract with the club expired. The alleged offenses took place in 2021 and 2022, and a police investigation began in February 2022 while he was still playing for Arsenal. When questioned during a pre-season tour, Arteta affirmed the club's processes were appropriate but declined further comment on the complex legal matters. Partey denies the charges.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines experienced a system-wide IT outage Sunday night, forcing it to ground its entire fleet as well as that of its subsidiary, Horizon Air.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom may emerge as an indirect beneficiary if the U.S. administration proceeds with its threatened 30% trade tariffs on the European Union. Because the U.K. has already secured its own trade deal with the U.S. featuring lower duties, analysts suggest EU companies could be incentivized to shift manufacturing operations to Britain to avoid the steep levies. This potential shift could help the U.K. regain some of the manufacturing capacity and investment it lost following Brexit. However, other experts caution that such business relocations would be a long-term process and that the final U.S. tariff rate on the EU remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly turning to bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pushing the total assets under management in these products past US$50 billion. This surge from just $10 billion at the start of last year is driven by an environment of persistent deflation and a search for low-risk, fixed-income assets. Investors are attracted to bond ETFs for their lower costs, diversification, and better liquidity compared to direct bond ownership. The fastest-growing segment targets corporate notes, offering access to higher yields and exposure to some of the nation's technology firms while hedging against economic uncertainty.

The conflict, which also drew in Israeli airstrikes against government forces siding with the Bedouins, was marked by sectarian attacks and kidnappings.

The case highlights the flaws in the UK's leasehold system, where residents were responsible for funding repairs while management was controlled by outside firms, some registered offshore.
