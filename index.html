          <h2>US Asks China to Intervene with Iran Regarding Strait of Hormuz</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 00:12:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has requested China's assistance in preventing Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global shipping route. This request follows reports that the Iranian parliament approved a plan to close the strait, though the final decision rests with the Supreme National Security Council. Disruption to oil supplies through this route could significantly impact the global economy, particularly affecting China, which is the largest buyer of Iranian oil. Energy analysts suggest Iran risks alienating its neighbors and its key market, China, by disrupting traffic in the Strait, while the US has increased its defense presence in the region in preparation for potential Iranian counterattacks. The cost of crude oil could affect everything from how much it costs to fill up your car to the price of food at the supermarket. Optimism in this situation is low, as any escalations could have profound global economic consequences.</p>

          <p>World leaders have responded to President Trump's announcement of US strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordo, with varied reactions. Iran has reserved all options in responding to the attack, while Israel praised Trump's decision. The UN Secretary-General warned of a dangerous escalation and called for diplomacy. China condemned the US attack and singled out Israel, urging de-escalation and adherence to international law, while other Asia-Pacific leaders called for restraint. European leaders called on Iran to resume negotiations, while Saudi Arabia and Qatar expressed concern and urged a ceasefire and return to dialogue. This situation has the potential to escalate into a larger conflict.</p>

          <p>New York City is utilizing ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate secures a majority, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed based on voters' second choices. This process continues until a candidate reaches a majority, ensuring broad support for the winner. Preliminary results based on first choices will be available shortly after polls close, but the ranked choice tabulations will begin on July 1, with official certification on July 15. This is the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary, with officials hoping for a smoother process than in 2021.</p>

          <p>The Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, demonstrating its ability to peer into the universe's depths with unprecedented clarity. The telescope, equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, will continuously film the southern night sky for ten years. The observatory is expected to detect killer asteroids, map the Milky Way, and answer questions about dark matter. The observatory's design includes unique mirrors to capture faint galaxies and supernova explosions, and scientists around the world will analyze the data to understand the universe's history and formation.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has released its first images, showcasing its capabilities to capture a vivid time-lapse video of the night sky over ten years. The observatory will collect data on approximately 40 billion stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects, generating about 60 petabytes of raw data. This data will allow astronomers to detect millions of changing objects every night, enabling the study of transient phenomena like exploding stars and asteroids. The observatory has already discovered 2,104 never-before-seen asteroids in just over 10 hours of test observations, and the observatory is expected to revolutionize astronomy by enabling data mining on a massive scale.</p>

The battle, which resulted in over 200,000 military and civilian deaths, is remembered as a tragedy that should never be forgotten. Okinawa continues to host the bulk of U.S. forces in Japan, leading to local discontent due to noise, pollution, and crimes committed by American service members. Japan has been strengthening its defense capabilities in the prefecture amid growing tensions with China over Taiwan and the Senkaku Islands, raising concerns among Okinawans about becoming the front line of conflict again.</p>

          <p>President Trump disputed Iranian attempts to downplay the strikes on its nuclear facilities, asserting that "obliteration" was an accurate description of the damage. While the full extent of the damage is still being assessed, U.S. officials reported "severe damage and destruction" to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) is ongoing to determine the operability of the targets. The UN nuclear watchdog chief expressed caution, stating that it was not yet possible to assess the damage at the Fordo nuclear facility. According to a senior Iranian source, most of the highly enriched uranium at Fordo had been moved to an undisclosed location before the strikes.</p>

          <p>Japan has called for de-escalation of the conflict in Iran, stating that U.S. strikes demonstrate Washington's determination to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya expressed that it was "extremely regrettable" the situation between Israel and Iran had escalated into a cycle of retaliation. Japan hopes that dialogue will resume between the U.S. and Iran to resolve the nuclear issue. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi noted that the situation was different from Israel's earlier action against Iran, as the U.S. government has been seriously pursuing dialogue.</p>

          <p>Oil markets are experiencing increased uncertainty after the U.S. joined the conflict between Iran and Israel, leading experts to warn of potentially triple-digit oil prices. Investors are closely monitoring Iran's response to the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, with threats of blocking the Strait of Hormuz adding to market jitters. Analysts suggest that if Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz, Western forces would likely intervene, potentially driving oil prices to $100 per barrel. The situation introduces a new era of volatility for oil markets, with the potential for significant supply disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senior FBI and Homeland Security officials conducted conference calls with governors and top law enforcement officials to discuss the impact of U.S. missile strikes in Iran on the U.S. threat environment. The FBI is enhancing its posture, increasing personnel, and monitoring intelligence, but there is no specific intelligence of a direct, credible threat against the U.S. homeland. Governors were urged to be vigilant for increased cyber activity and to reach out to at-risk groups, including Jewish institutions. The Secure Community Network (SCN) reported a surge in violent posts directed at the Jewish community on social media after the strikes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia can be released on bail while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Judge Barbara Holmes stated that the government failed to prove Abrego Garcia was a flight risk, but acknowledged he would likely remain in custody regardless. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native deported to El Salvador in March despite a 2019 court order, may now be taken into ICE custody. Prosecutors argue he conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status, while the defense claims the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in his case.</p>

The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri to Iran, with additional B-2s acting as decoys.

          <p>Chinese companies, known for their risk tolerance in overseas markets, are increasingly facing escalating risks in their ventures in Africa. These risks include geopolitical instability, political unrest, abrupt policy changes, and security threats. Chinese companies have invested heavily in mineral-rich but conflict-ridden countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and countries in the Sahel. These investments come at a high price, with attacks on mining sites, kidnappings of Chinese workers, and other security incidents. President Xi Jinping has called for severe punishment for those behind attacks on Chinese nationals.</p>
