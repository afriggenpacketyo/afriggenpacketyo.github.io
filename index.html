            <p>Beijing and northern China experienced severe gales, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and suspension of train services. Wind gusts reached up to 93 mph, the strongest in over half a century, prompting an orange alert and urging residents to stay indoors. While some residents found the storm less severe than anticipated, many faced travel disruptions, including flight cancellations and suspended train lines. The strong winds, originating from a cold vortex system over Mongolia, are expected to ease by Sunday, after causing damage to vehicles and felling nearly 300 trees.</p>

            <p>Tourism in Los Angeles is facing challenges due to global tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, leading to anxieties among business owners about rising prices and supply chain disruptions. The uncertainty surrounding visa cancellations and deportations is deterring international visitors, particularly from Canada and Mexico, who tend to stay longer and spend more. Hotels are bracing for price increases on various goods and potential cancellations of conferences, while also dealing with concerns about employees who are unauthorized immigrants. The Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board expresses concern about the negative impact on perceptions of the U.S. as a travel destination.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Supreme Court has checked President Trump's authority to quickly deport individuals alleged to be members of foreign crime gangs, affirming their right to a hearing before a federal judge. The ruling mandates that individuals facing deportation receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal, potentially slowing the pace of removals. The decision stems from a case involving the mass deportation of Venezuelans and Salvadorans, prompting questions about Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act. While the court's focus on due process is seen as a victory for civil liberties, it remains unclear how the administration will comply with the rulings.</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences in Texas announced the successful reintroduction of the dire wolf through genetic engineering, raising questions from experts at the La Brea Tar Pits about the authenticity of the recreated species. The scientists extracted ancient DNA from dire wolf fossils and used gene editing to create pups with similar traits, born to surrogate domestic dogs. While La Brea Tar Pits experts appreciate the technology, they believe the terms used are misleading, emphasizing the importance of focusing on conserving endangered species rather than de-extinction. The company hopes to inspire more people to pursue careers in related fields.</p>

            <p>President Trump has appointed William “Billy” Marshall, head of the West Virginia corrections department, to lead the federal Bureau of Prisons, a move met with surprise and concern by advocates.

Jim Justice praised Marshall's ability to turn around the West Virginia Department of Corrections. The Bureau of Prisons faces similar challenges, including staffing shortages, infrastructure issues, and scrutiny over violence and abuse, raising questions about Marshall's ability to address these systemic problems.</p>

The band's music, which initially offered an escape from Venezuela's political turmoil, has increasingly touched on political themes, reflecting the struggles and hopes of their compatriots.

            <p>A plan to share IRS data with ICE agents is causing widespread fear in California's immigrant communities, where many undocumented individuals pay taxes using ITINs. Advocates argue that the plan undermines trust and could deter immigrants from paying taxes, potentially costing billions in lost revenue. State leaders are speaking out against the deal, arguing it betrays a long-standing commitment to protect taxpayer information. The Trump administration defends the plan as a legal tool to investigate criminal activity, but immigrant rights groups worry about its impact on local economies and mixed-status families.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's order to expand timber production in the U.S. includes all of California's national forests, opening up over 20 million acres to logging. The directive aims to increase timber production by 25% and reduce reliance on foreign producers. Environmental groups express concern that the order will circumvent legal protections and endanger species, prioritizing economic growth over environmental conservation. Experts debate the effectiveness of large-scale logging for wildfire risk reduction, with some arguing it can make the landscape more flammable.</p>

            <p>Ecuador's presidential election is occurring amidst record levels of drug gang violence and economic stagnation, leaving the next president with few resources to combat crime. The election is a rematch between incumbent Daniel Noboa and Luisa González, with voters primarily concerned about combating narco-fueled violence. Noboa, who declared drug trafficking gangs as terrorists, relies heavily on the military and seeks foreign assistance, while González advocates for more social spending and military technology. The country's economy is struggling, further complicating efforts to address the rising violence.</p>

            <p>A new study reveals that crows can distinguish geometric regularity in shapes, demonstrating a mathematical skill previously thought to be unique to humans. Researchers tested crows' ability to identify outlier shapes in a group of quadrilaterals, finding that they had a sense of right angles, parallel lines, and symmetry. This discovery suggests that geometric abilities in humans may build on precursor capabilities more present in the animal kingdom than previously believed. The study opens new avenues for investigating mathematical skills in other species.</p>

            <p>Farmers in the U.S. are worried about the impact of China's steep tariffs on U.S. exports, which could increase costs and lead to retaliation against U.S. crops. President Trump is considering ways to help farmers, potentially through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), as he did during his first term. However, farmers express concern that government aid is only a short-term fix and that they need markets to sell their grain at a profit. The tariffs could distort market signals and influence planting decisions.</p>

            <p>A three-year legal battle over the death of Charles Givens, an inmate with health problems and mental disabilities, concluded with a jury finding five former corrections officers not liable. Givens died in his cell at Virginia's Marion Correctional Treatment Center in 2022, leading to a lawsuit alleging that the officers beat him. The defense argued that Givens died from a seizure and a fall in his cell. The case highlighted broader questions about conditions at the facility and led to additional media coverage of hypothermia cases at Marion.</p>

            <p>A deadly measles outbreak in western Texas is being fueled by vaccine scepticism within the Mennonite community. Despite the deaths of two unvaccinated children, many residents remain hesitant to get vaccinated, influenced by misinformation and mixed messaging from federal officials. The outbreak has led to hundreds of cases and hospitalizations, prompting public health officials to advocate for stronger messaging and increased vaccination efforts. The community also faces challenges due to potential cuts in public health funding, limiting resources for immunization programs.</p>

While Kaiser management acknowledges some disparities, they argue that they pay competitively and must balance employee benefits with accessible care.</p>

The proposed increase in U.S. military presence at former U.S. bases in Panama has sparked outrage, with opposition leaders arguing it violates the canal's neutrality treaty.
