          <p>A University of California, San Francisco, professor of medicine, Rupa Marya, is suing the university, alleging that her freedom of speech rights were violated when she was suspended for online comments about Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza. Marya, an expert in decolonial theory, was placed on leave after questioning the impacts of Zionism on healthcare, which the university deemed a ‚Äúracist conspiracy theory.‚Äù The lawsuit claims Marya's posts did not impede her duties and that she received threats due to them. The suit comes amid ongoing debates about academic freedom on college campuses, especially concerning discussions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Optimism regarding the matter remains low, as the university's actions have sparked concerns about the suppression of diverse viewpoints. </p>

          <p>Pentagon investigators are examining whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth personally wrote text messages detailing military plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen, or if staff members were responsible for the leak. The Defense Department‚Äôs Office of Inspector General has been interviewing current and former staff to determine how strike details from a classified system ended up on the Signal messaging app. The information was shared in two chat groups, one including Vice President JD Vance and other officials, and another including Hegseth's wife, who is not a government employee. Investigators are also probing whether staff were asked to delete messages, as the government is required to retain federal communications as official records. The matter could raise concerns about the handling of sensitive information within the Defense Department. </p>

          <p>The recent feud between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk has raised concerns about potential divisions within the Republican Party. Musk's criticisms of Trump's policies and subsequent online attacks have created uncertainty for the GOP, particularly as they attempt to pass key legislation. Some Republicans worry that Musk's departure from Trump's inner circle could undermine negotiations and embolden critics of the administration's agenda. While some downplay the feud's political implications, others acknowledge Musk's influence and the potential for his criticism to sway public opinion. </p>

          <p>Thailand has closed two of its border crossings to tourists following a military skirmish with Cambodia, citing concerns for sovereignty and security. The decision affects tourist crossings at two permanent border checkpoints in the eastern province of Chanthaburi. The move follows the death of a Cambodian soldier in a disputed area known as the Emerald Triangle. While trade remains unaffected, the closure reflects ongoing tensions between the two countries. </p>
