          <p>Warmer-than-usual weather in March 2025 led to a 0.4% increase in UK retail sales, marking the third consecutive month of growth.  Clothing and DIY sales were particularly strong, while food sales remained weak.  Analysts, however, caution that this positive trend might not continue, given a recent decline in consumer confidence.</p>
