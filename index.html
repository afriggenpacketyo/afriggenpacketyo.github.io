        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the Justice Department and White House counsel to investigate whether Joe Biden's administration conspired to conceal his mental state while in office. Biden dismissed the investigation as a distraction, asserting his decision-making abilities during his presidency were sound and that he was fully in control. The White House claims the investigation will focus on Biden's execution of executive actions during his final years in office. Biden argues that this is merely a tactic to divert attention from disastrous Republican legislation. The investigation represents a significant escalation of political tensions between the two former presidents. The probe's findings could have far-reaching implications for both Biden and Trump's legacies. </p>

          <p>David Jolly, a former Republican congressman and vocal critic of Donald Trump, has announced his candidacy for governor of Florida as a Democrat. Jolly, who left the Republican Party in 2018, believes issues such as affordability and public education funding will resonate with voters in 2026. He argues that Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing the state and that the culture wars have become excessive. Jolly's decision to run as a Democrat draws parallels to Charlie Crist's failed bid against DeSantis in 2022, and he joins the Florida Democratic Party at a vulnerable time with a significant Republican voter advantage. The gubernatorial race is expected to be highly competitive, with potential Republican candidates including Byron Donalds, Matt Gaetz, and Casey DeSantis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has warned women using weight-loss injections that these medications may impact the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. The MHRA advises that women should use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro and for a period afterward, with specific durations depending on the medication. Concerns have arisen that the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed properly due to common side effects of the jabs such as vomiting and diarrhea, and because they slow the emptying of the stomach. The MHRA has received around 40 reports relating to pregnancy made to its Yellow Card scheme, some of which have been unintended pregnancies, prompting the new guidance to ensure women are aware of the risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed a new travel ban restricting entry to the U.S. from 12 countries, citing national security risks. Nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen will be banned from entering the U.S. unless they qualify for an exception, and seven additional countries face partial travel restrictions. The White House said the restrictions would protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors, with Trump referencing a recent attack in Boulder, Colorado. The ban, which takes effect on Monday, has drawn swift condemnation from Democrats and human rights groups, who describe it as discriminatory and cruel.</p>

          <p>China has granted approval for the mass production of its first domestically developed 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, named the AES100. This milestone underscores China's increasing ambitions in the aviation sector, particularly as it seeks to reduce reliance on foreign technologies. The move comes shortly after the U.S. announced new export restrictions targeting China, including curbs on jet engine-related technologies. While the AES100 differs from the jet engines used in commercial aircraft, Chinese experts view its development as a significant advancement for the country's aviation capabilities.</p>

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts 13 to 19 named storms, with 6 to 10 becoming hurricanes. Homeowners should review policy limits, deductibles, and the need for flood insurance, as floods are typically not covered by standard policies. Experts recommend acting promptly, as insurers often suspend policy changes when a storm is approaching, and understanding your policy can provide peace of mind during hurricane season.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that leprosy existed in the Americas prior to the arrival of European explorers, challenging the previous belief that it was solely introduced by early settlers. Researchers discovered that Mycobacterium lepromatosis, a second species of bacteria, was responsible for leprosy in the Americas. This bacterium infected humans for 1,000 years before Europeans arrived, indicating that the disease was already endemic among Indigenous populations. The study, which involved analyzing DNA samples from ancient human remains, was conducted by scientists from the Institut Pasteur, the French National Center for Scientific Research, and the University of Colorado.</p>

The Switch 2 features upgraded hardware, including a larger screen and more power, but the launch lineup is limited, with Mario Kart World being the only new Nintendo game available at launch. The gaming community is divided, with some excited about the new console and others hesitant due to the cost.</p>

Under the Biden administration, FEMA had taken steps to simplify forms and loosen requirements to prove residency, aiming to better serve vulnerable populations. However, some of those efforts have been canceled, and President Trump has moved to eliminate equity programs. The agency has cut billions of dollars of programs and lost hundreds of staff, raising concerns about its ability to adequately assist all Americans after disasters.</p>

          <p>Ken Jennings, the host of "Jeopardy!", argues that trivia and the pursuit of general knowledge are essential for a well-functioning society. He suggests that facts, though sometimes considered old-fashioned, are the building blocks of informed decisions and sound policies. Jennings laments the trivialization of trivia, noting its historical connection to fundamental academic courses. He emphasizes that shared cultural literacy and the ability to agree on verifiable answers are crucial for societal cohesion and the maintenance of democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>A BBC Arabic team was detained by Israeli forces in southern Syria while attempting to report near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The team, consisting of British, Iraqi, and Syrian journalists, was filming near a UN observation post when they were stopped by Israeli soldiers. The soldiers pointed rifles at the journalists, confiscated their equipment, and escorted them to a crossing point. The BBC has complained to the Israeli military about the incident but has not yet received a response.</p>

          <p>The government in England has announced that any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals from September 2026, regardless of their income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, with the government setting aside Â£1 billion to fund the initiative up to 2029. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the changes would save parents Â£500 a year and lift 100,000 children out of poverty. While the announcement has been largely welcomed, some critics argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective in reducing child poverty.</p>

          <p>Divorce lawyers report a seasonal pattern in divorce filings, with peaks in late summer and early spring. These trends are attributed to couples delaying divorce proceedings during holidays and family vacations. A 2016 study analyzing divorce filing data in Washington state found consistent peaks in March and August. While some experts believe sentimental reasons influence the timing, others point to the financial and logistical considerations of splitting up, with an increasing number of women initiating divorce proceedings due to increased financial independence.</p>
