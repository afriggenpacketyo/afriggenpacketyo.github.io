          <p>Comedian Ellen DeGeneres has permanently relocated to the United Kingdom with her wife, Portia de Rossi, a decision she attributes to Donald Trump's 2024 presidential election victory. DeGeneres stated that she and de Rossi decided to remain in their new English farmhouse after waking up to the election results. The article also notes her public support for fellow comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who also left the U.S. following the election and was subsequently targeted by President Trump. DeGeneres described her new life in the English countryside as simpler and more charming, a significant change from her previous life in California.</p>

          <h2>Public Support for Trump's Deportation Program Declines Amid Economic Concerns, Poll Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 19:44:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now believing it is not focused on dangerous criminals. The poll suggests this decline is linked to perceptions that the program is overly aggressive and unfairly targets Hispanic people, contributing to a drop in the president's approval among this demographic. Concurrently, the survey reveals that a large majority of Americans want the administration to prioritize lowering prices over other issues like tariffs or spending cuts. This reflects ongoing economic pressures felt by many households. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged to continue in his role despite his ruling coalition losing its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election result reflects public frustration over rising prices, potential U.S. tariffs, and a series of political scandals that have affected the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). This loss in the upper house, following a previous loss in the more powerful lower house, is expected to weaken the coalition's influence. Analysts note that the defeat could destabilize the government during critical trade negotiations and potentially trigger a leadership challenge within the LDP.</p>

First baseman Freddie Freeman exited in the sixth inning after being hit by a pitch, sustaining a left wrist contusion; while X-rays were negative, his potential absence is a blow to the team. The Dodgers' defense faltered, contributing to a three-run inning for the Brewers that erased an early lead built by a Shohei Ohtani home run.

          <p>A BBC investigation featuring insiders from the High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project suggests it was destined for massive cost overruns and delays due to fundamental challenges in the UK. The project, now billions over budget and years behind schedule, was hampered by the country's dense population, property ownership laws, and a complex democratic planning process. The initial ambition to build the world's fastest line drove up costs, while political compromises and thousands of individual petitions led to expensive route changes like extensive tunneling. This has raised questions about whether any large-scale infrastructure project can succeed in Britain without systemic reforms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child for lifelong success is self-connection, which is the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. Raouda, who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, argues that this skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence. She suggests that common parental responses like dismissing a child's fears or sadness can inadvertently teach them to distrust their own feelings. To foster self-connection, she advises parents to validate emotions, avoid micromanaging, and model healthy emotional regulation, which ultimately protects a child's long-term mental health.</p>

Better Angels is currently bidding on several projects in the Los Angeles area, including a 212-unit development, proposing to build faster and at a fraction of the typical cost. The goal is to attract for-profit developers to the affordable housing market by demonstrating a viable, capitalism-driven model to address the housing crisis.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died on Long Island, New York, after the strong magnetic field of an MRI machine pulled him in because he was wearing a heavy metallic necklace. The man, identified by his wife as Keith McAllister, had reportedly entered the MRI room to help his wife after her scan when the incident occurred. His wife stated he was wearing a 20-pound chain used for weight training, which caused him to be drawn into the machine, resulting in a fatal medical episode. Police are investigating the incident, which highlights the critical safety protocols requiring the removal of all metal objects near active MRI machines.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze has spoken out about the increasing online abuse faced by players in women's football, stating that the problem worsens as the sport's profile grows. Her comments follow teammate Jess Carter's revelation that she received racist messages during the Euro 2025 tournament, prompting a police investigation. In response, the Lionesses announced they will stop taking a knee before matches, seeking a new way to combat racism. Bronze emphasized that while players are open to criticism, they are not open to abuse, and called on social media platforms to hold users accountable for their actions.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced the creation of a new water ombudsman to address consumer complaints about issues such as leaks, incorrect billing, and sewage discharges. This new consumer champion will serve as a single point of contact and will have legal powers to protect customers in disputes with water companies. The announcement is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which has faced intense public criticism for rising bills and a record number of sewage spills into UK waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and vowed to hold companies accountable for improving water quality.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that despite a seemingly positive visit by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to China, his government's actions may be undermining its own efforts to improve relations. While Chinese media focused on the positive aspects of the visit, the author points to Australian media headlines and political rhetoric that create friction. Specifically, the article criticizes the handling of the potential sale of the Port of Darwin, suggesting that such moves contradict Albanese's attempts to assure Chinese investors that Australia is a reliable partner. The author contends that these mixed signals sabotage the goal of stabilizing the bilateral relationship.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass described the Trump administration's immigration enforcement as a "reign of terror" that has spread fear throughout the city's large immigrant community. In an interview, Bass stated that ICE raids, sometimes conducted by masked agents in unmarked cars, have left many residents, including legal citizens, afraid to leave their homes. She criticized the deployment of federal troops to the city as a misuse of taxpayer money, arguing it was an unnecessary show of force. Bass asserted that the administration's punitive approach is designed to make life miserable for immigrants rather than to create a functional immigration system.</p>

          <p>When asked how to get rich from Bitcoin, the AI tool ChatGPT outlined several potential strategies, while also cautioning about inherent risks. The primary method suggested was the long-term 'buy and hold' strategy, which has yielded massive gains for early investors who weathered market volatility. Other approaches included active day trading to capitalize on short-term price fluctuations, earning Bitcoin directly through freelance work or e-commerce, and investing in Bitcoin-related stocks or ETFs for a less direct exposure. The AI emphasized that all methods carry significant risk and that past performance does not guarantee future returns. (not investment advice)</p>
