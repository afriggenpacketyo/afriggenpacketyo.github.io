        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Fox News opinion piece argues that President Biden's last-minute pardons, including one for his son Hunter Biden, should be considered null and void due to his alleged cognitive decline. The author cites the audio from Special Counsel Robert Hur's interview with Biden as evidence of his unfitness for office, and questions whether Biden was aware of his actions when signing the pardons. The piece also criticizes the lack of consequences for top-level officials in the Biden administration and journalists who are now profiting from books detailing their own incompetence. The author concludes that Hunter Biden should be charged with his alleged crimes, and the courts should determine Biden's competency to issue the pardons.</p>

          <h2>US Credit Rating Downgraded Amid Concerns Over Government Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 08:45:45 EDT</div>

          <p>Moodyâ€™s has downgraded the US's credit rating, citing concerns about rising government debt and a widening budget deficit. This move could add pressure on US government debt, potentially leading to higher yields on Treasury bills. The downgrade reflects worries about the US's fiscal trajectory and the failure of politicians to address the country's fiscal position. Despite the downgrade, some investors believe the market impact will be limited, as the US can issue its own currency and cannot be forced to default on its debt.</p>

          <p>The approval rating for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has hit a record low due to growing dissatisfaction ahead of the upcoming House of Councillors election.

Consumers are struggling with the government's failure to address soaring rice prices, with most poll respondents favoring consumption tax cuts to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis.
