          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons, along with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen and substantially enlarge Alcatraz prison. Trump stated the reopening would serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice," aiming to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. The prison, closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, would be rebuilt on Alcatraz Island near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. Trump has been clashing with the courts over his policy of sending alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced he is authorizing the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to begin imposing 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the U.S. Trump stated that other countries are offering incentives to draw filmmakers and studios away from the United States, constituting a national security threat.

          <p>George Simion, a hard-right nationalist, won the most votes in the first round of Romania's presidential election rerun. He will face pro-EU Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan in a runoff on May 18. Simion, an ally of the previously banned Calin Georgescu, opposes military aid to Ukraine and is critical of European Union leadership. The original vote was canceled due to concerns over Russian interference in favor of Georgescu.</p>

          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing, some experts, like Vardit Ravitsky, caution against relying on the procedure, highlighting its high cost and lack of guarantees. Ravitsky argues that egg freezing sends the wrong message, creating a false sense of security about future fertility. Fertility specialist Dr. Lucky Sekhon explains that there is a drop off at every step of the process. Critics also raise concerns about the emphasis on profits in the fertility industry and the financial burden on women.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing offers women options to preserve their fertility, but it comes with a significant financial burden. The procedure has become more common, with younger women increasingly choosing to freeze their eggs.

There is a debate over whether companies offering egg freezing benefits are truly supporting women or simply seeking to retain employees.</p>

          <p>The popularity of egg freezing is increasing among young women as a way to preserve their fertility, with procedures increasing more than sixfold from 2014 to 2023. Experts say that egg freezing is a revolutionary procedure, comparable to the introduction of the birth control pill, as it allows women to delay childbearing until they are ready. The process involves hormone injections to stimulate egg production, followed by egg retrieval and freezing. While egg freezing can be empowering, it is also expensive and not a guarantee of future pregnancy.</p>

          <p>A recent report highlighted the increasing popularity of egg freezing, where women's eggs are harvested, frozen, and stored for future use.

There are also additional costs for thawing and fertilization later on. Experts caution that egg freezing is not a guarantee of pregnancy and can be emotionally and financially taxing.
