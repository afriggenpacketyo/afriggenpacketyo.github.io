          <p>Authorities in Rongjiang county, located in China's southwestern Guizhou province, are preparing for more severe flooding after record-breaking rainfall recently caused at least six fatalities. The region experienced what state media described as "exceptionally large floods," which submerged infrastructure, including the county's largest shopping center, and disrupted transportation and communication. A hydrological station recorded water levels over five meters above its safety limit, prompting new evacuation orders for several areas as forecasters predict another round of heavy downpours. The community remains on high alert as it recovers from the initial deluge while bracing for a potential second wave of destruction.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa resulted in the deaths of a married couple and injured at least 17 others, including three children. According to Ukrainian officials, a drone struck a residential tower, causing significant damage to three floors and trapping some residents inside. The attack is part of a broader series of overnight assaults, with Russia's Defense Ministry claiming to have downed over 40 Ukrainian drones across western Russia and occupied Crimea. This incident highlights the ongoing and devastating impact of aerial bombardments on civilian populations in Ukraine, far from the main front lines.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is scheduled to hold a crucial procedural vote on President Trump's major tax and spending package, though its passage remains uncertain due to internal Republican disputes. The bill, which includes significant tax cuts alongside funding for immigration and defense, proposes to pay for these priorities by slashing funds for social programs like Medicaid and food assistance. Republican leadership has faced challenges in securing enough votes, with disagreements over the extent of spending cuts and other policy provisions. The legislation's final text was released just before the vote, leaving little time for review and intensifying pressure to meet the President's July Fourth deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article from Fox News posits that the idea of the "transgender child" is a modern construct, emerging from a convergence of psychiatric classification, medical interventions like puberty blockers, and political activism. The author traces the concept's origins to the 1960s, its official inclusion in the DSM-III in 1980, and its popularization in the 2000s, arguing it pathologized gender nonconformity in children who would likely have grown up to be gay or lesbian. The piece contends that this framework locks children into a medicalized path based on ideology rather than scientific evidence, treating childhood beliefs as immutable truths. It concludes that society has abandoned reason, leading to what the author calls a tragic and manufactured crisis.</p>

          <p>Following a backbench rebellion that forced a U-turn on welfare cuts, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has declared that fixing the nation's "broken" benefits system is a moral necessity. Speaking at a party conference, Starmer emphasized that while the welfare safety net for the vulnerable will be protected, it should not trap individuals who are capable of working. The government has already conceded on its initial plans to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) for existing claimants and will now review the assessment process. Despite these concessions, there are continued calls from some MPs and unions for more significant changes or a complete overhaul of the proposed reforms.</p>

          <p>Eric Trump has suggested that he or another member of the Trump family might consider a presidential campaign after his father's term concludes. In an interview, he stated that the political path "would be an easy one" if he chose to pursue it, citing his dissatisfaction with many current politicians. However, he also expressed hesitation, questioning whether he would want to subject his own children to the "brutality" his family has experienced over the last decade. While prominent Republicans like JD Vance and Marco Rubio are seen as likely 2028 contenders, Eric Trump's comments keep the possibility of a continued Trump political dynasty in the public conversation.</p>

          <p>Human rights advocates are sounding the alarm as Pakistan and Iran escalate the forced deportation of Afghan refugees, sending them back to a country grappling with a severe humanitarian crisis. A recent U.N. report indicates over 71,000 refugees were deported in the first half of June alone, with many families arriving at the border with nothing. This surge in returns coincides with dwindling international aid for Afghanistan, where millions rely on charity for food. Aid workers warn that the influx of returnees, many of whom are women and children with no support systems, will exacerbate the crisis, potentially leading to increased child labor and begging as families struggle for survival.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the media's intense focus on military conflicts, such as the recent U.S. strikes on Iran, inevitably pushes other vital domestic news stories out of the public consciousness. The author notes that significant events like the recent shooting of Minnesota lawmakers quickly faded from the news cycle as attention shifted to the international crisis. While acknowledging the importance of covering the president's actions, the article suggests that the 24/7 coverage of war benefits both the administration seeking to project strength and the media outlets that see a ratings boost. This dynamic creates a frustrating reality where crucial issues like gun violence, voting rights, and legal decisions struggle to receive sustained attention.</p>

          <p>A domestic policy bill championed by President Trump, which is advancing through Congress, proposes to cut up to $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. The legislation aims to fund extended tax breaks for wealthy Americans by imposing stricter work requirements on SNAP recipients, including parents of children over seven and older adults. Anti-hunger advocates warn these are the largest cuts in the program's history and will have a catastrophic impact at a time when food insecurity is already rising. The changes could put millions at risk of losing their benefits, forcing them to choose between working fluctuating hours and feeding their families. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed imposing international export restrictions on all eel species under the Washington Convention, a treaty that regulates trade in endangered species. The move, which faces strong opposition from Japan, a major consumer of eels, would require proof of legal capture and an export permit for species like the Japanese eel. If the proposal is adopted at the upcoming conference in Uzbekistan, the restrictions would take effect in June 2027. The measure aims to protect dwindling eel populations worldwide by creating a more regulated and transparent global market, but it could significantly impact the fishing and culinary industries in countries like Japan.</p>

          <p>A report by the environmental nonprofit Earthsight alleges that major designer brands, including Coach, Fendi, and Hugo Boss, are using leather sourced from cattle ranches responsible for illegal deforestation in Brazil's Amazon. The investigation traced the supply chain from farms operating illegally within Indigenous territories to Brazilian meatpackers and leather exporters, and finally to Italian tanneries that supply high-end fashion houses. The report highlights gaps in supply chain monitoring, such as "cattle laundering," where animals from illegal areas are moved to legal farms before sale. While most of the accused brands have denied the specific allegations or stated they do not source leather from Brazil, the findings raise serious questions about the ethics and sustainability of luxury goods.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has announced it will stop providing crucial satellite weather data, a move that could hamper hurricane forecasting and climate monitoring just as hurricane season intensifies. For over 40 years, a Navy unit has processed and shared this data, which is vital for observing storm structures in real-time and tracking polar sea ice. The sudden termination, reportedly due to cybersecurity concerns, has surprised scientists who rely on it for early warnings of rapid storm intensification and for long-term climate records. While NOAA states its own data sources are sufficient, experts worry the loss will create critical gaps in observation, especially as rapidly intensifying storms become more common.</p>

          <p>State and local health departments across the United States are facing a crisis as funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is severely delayed, leading to layoffs and the suspension of critical public health programs. According to NPR, the CDC has not received its full fiscal year 2025 funding and has been operating on 30-day increments, preventing it from issuing grant awards. This has halted services like HIV testing hotlines, disease contact tracing, and cancer screening programs in multiple states. Health officials warn that the delays risk creating larger public health emergencies as chains of infection go unchecked and preventative services are paused. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five-time major champion Brooks Koepka withdrew from the LIV Golf event in Dallas due to illness after a frustrating start to his round. On the ninth hole, after a poor tee shot, a visibly angered Koepka smashed his club into the ground and then hit a tee box marker, sending it flying towards a small group of spectators. The marker did not appear to injure anyone. Koepka was six over par through eight holes when he decided to pull out of the tournament.

This opposition has angered many of the president's supporters in the state and prompted Trump to call for a primary challenge against Massie.

He was ultimately exonerated after 27 years when it was revealed that prosecutors had hidden key evidence, including the fact that their star witness was a police informant.

In response, some importers have halted deliveries, and retailers have had to repeatedly adjust prices, meaning consumers will likely get "a little less bang for their bucks." The uncertainty is also making it difficult for the industry to plan for 2026, which is expected to be a massive year for sales due to the nation's 250th birthday celebrations.

          <p>President Trump is navigating a pivotal week, balancing major domestic policy pushes with critical foreign policy developments. The administration is celebrating a favorable Supreme Court ruling that limits nationwide injunctions against his executive orders and touting a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. However, significant challenges remain, including the uncertain fate of his "big, beautiful bill" in the Senate and a looming deadline to finalize numerous international trade deals. The confluence of these high-stakes events at home and abroad could prove to be a defining moment for his presidency, with immense pressure to deliver on his legislative and economic promises.

          <p>In a farewell address to the Social Democratic Party (SPD) congress in Berlin, former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz defended his government's policies while also being self-critical. He warned against illusions about Vladimir Putin's intentions in Ukraine, stating the Russian president aims to expand his conquests and must not be allowed to change borders by force. Scholz affirmed the decision to strengthen Germany's military (the Bundeswehr) and enhance cooperation within NATO as a necessary response to this turning point. He also called for greater solidarity within Germany, suggesting that high earners should contribute more to finance the country's defense capabilities instead of discussing tax cuts.</p>

          <p>During a speech at Germany's Social Democratic Party congress, Ozgur Ozel, leader of Turkey's main opposition party, the CHP, called on Germany to support the Turkish opposition. He stated that his party's recent rise has led to a government panic, resulting in increased pressure and attacks on his party and other social opposition groups. Ozel emphasized his party's commitment to a democratic Turkey based on human rights and its goal of full EU membership. Following his speech, the SPD congress passed a motion demanding the release of the detained mayor of Istanbul and other political prisoners, signaling solidarity with the Turkish opposition.</p>

          <p>Thousands gathered in Tehran for an official funeral ceremony to honor approximately 60 people, including dozens of high-ranking generals, killed in recent Israeli strikes. Top military leaders like Chief of Staff Mohammed Bagheri and IRGC Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami were among those mourned. The ceremony was attended by senior government and military officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian. The Israeli attacks, which occurred over 12 days, were aimed at disrupting Iran's nuclear program, which Israel claims is a threat to its security. The public mourning highlights the significant losses sustained by Iran's military leadership and the heightened tensions in the region.</p>
