          <p>Alabama has set a September 25 execution date for Geoffrey Todd West, convicted of the 1997 murder of a convenience store clerk during a robbery. West shot Margaret Parrish Berry in the back of the head while robbing the store of $250. This will be the state's seventh execution using nitrogen gas, a method first implemented in Alabama last year. West had previously selected nitrogen as his preferred execution method when the state authorized its use.</p>

          <p>One year after securing a significant majority, the UK's Labour government under Sir Keir Starmer is facing scrutiny over its ambitious promises. BBC correspondents assessed key policy areas, noting mixed results in economic growth, immigration control, and foreign policy. While some progress has been made, such as a tariff deal with the U.S., challenges persist with rising small boat crossings, unmet teacher recruitment targets, and controversial welfare reforms. The analysis highlights the difficult balance between ambitious goals and the harsh realities of governing.</p>

          <p>Meta's newly formed AI lab, tasked with developing next-generation models for "personal superintelligence," has hired a notable number of researchers from China. Of the 11 publicly listed hires, seven are graduates of prestigious Chinese universities who later pursued careers in the United States. This recruitment strategy has reportedly heightened tensions with rival OpenAI, whose CEO Sam Altman has accused Meta of offering massive signing bonuses to attract top talent. The composition of the team is gaining attention within China.</p>

Canine Companions, a service dog organization, advises against taking dogs to fireworks shows and suggests exercising them earlier in the day to help them rest. To manage anxiety at home, owners can create a safe, comfortable space like a kennel, play calming music, and use desensitization techniques by playing firework sounds at low volumes. Providing engaging toys can also serve as a helpful distraction.</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature domestic policy bill directs approximately $170 billion towards federal immigration enforcement, marking a historic investment in this area. The funding is intended to support the administration's goals of mass detention and deportation. Key allocations include $45 billion for detention centers, $30 billion for ICE personnel and operations, and $46.5 billion to continue border wall construction. Critics are concerned the funding will expand detention and create barriers to due process, while supporters argue it is necessary for border security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the principles of the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence are misunderstood when viewed solely as a triumph of individualism. The author contends that the founders were largely acting to restore and improve upon their inherited political traditions as Englishmen. Furthermore, the declaration's famous claim that the equality of all men is "self-evident" is not a universal truth but is rooted specifically in the biblical inheritance of Western civilization. The piece concludes that this biblical and political heritage is more responsible for the U.S. than liberal rationalism alone.</p>

Merit Street, which carries McGraw's right-leaning commentary show "Dr. Phil Primetime," recently laid off 40 employees.

          <p>The comprehensive domestic policy bill passed by Congress includes a new, temporary tax break for senior citizens. The provision adds a $6,000 standard deduction for individual tax filers aged 65 and older ($12,000 for couples), effective from 2025 through 2028. This benefit begins to phase out for individuals earning over $75,000. Analysts note that this is an income tax deduction, not a cut on Social Security taxes, and will primarily benefit upper-middle-class seniors rather than those with low or very high incomes.

          <p>A High Court ruling in London has sharply criticized Britain's domestic intelligence agency, MI5, for repeatedly misleading courts about an informant accused of severe domestic abuse. The case involves a woman, "Beth," whose former partner boasted of immunity due to his work for MI5. While the agency's head apologized for providing false evidence, the court found its internal explanations inadequate and recommended a robust, independent inquiry. The ruling raises serious questions about the agency's accountability and its use of the "Neither Confirm Nor Deny" policy.</p>
