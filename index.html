          <p>North Korea has acknowledged deploying troops to assist Russia in its conflict with Ukraine, marking the first official confirmation of such involvement. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the critical importance of reaching an agreement between Russia and Ukraine within the coming week to de-escalate the ongoing hostilities. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump expressed his belief that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is prepared to cede Crimea, a territory annexed by Russia in 2014, as part of a potential resolution. Despite Moscow's claims, Zelenskyy asserted that Ukrainian forces are actively engaged in combat within the Kursk region.</p>

          <p>Japan's population has been declining for 15 years, leading to concerns about the economy, healthcare, education, housing, and national defense. The country's birth rate is falling, and more adults are single, leading to businesses catering to solo customers. The government is trying to address the problem with initiatives like dating apps and a four-day workweek. However, some experts believe a broader cultural shift is needed, encouraging people to move to rural areas and start families, especially as AI is beginning to make more personal relationships.</p>

The discovery sheds light on Denmark's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, which the country banned in 1792 but did not abolish slavery until 1847.</p>
