        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a series of escalating attacks, including an Iranian missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, both Israel and Iran have reportedly agreed to a ceasefire. The conflict began after the U.S. sent B-2 bombers to drop bunker-buster bombs on Iranian nuclear facilities in response to previous actions, with President Trump claiming monumental damage. While a full battle damage assessment is still pending, the agreement to cease hostilities suggests a move towards de-escalation after a period of intense military action and heightened tensions in the region. The initial Iranian attack on the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, according to a U.S. official. The optimism score reflects a tentative relief following a period of heightened conflict. </p>

          <p>Approximately 75% of the nation's health insurance providers have voluntarily committed to improving patient care by streamlining prior-authorization processes, which often delay treatments and create bureaucratic obstacles. Led by Dr. Mehmet Oz, the initiative aims to standardize electronic prior-authorization submissions for faster turnaround times, with a goal of operationalization by January 1, 2027. The commitments also include reductions in the use of medical prior-authorization and honoring existing approvals for 90 days when patients switch insurance plans. While the industry-led effort could improve patient experiences, it may also impact insurance companies' profits if patients seek care more frequently. </p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist recently released from ICE custody after being detained for over three months, spoke about his experiences in an interview. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained in March, with the Trump administration claiming his presence posed a risk to U.S. foreign policy, an assertion a judge rejected. Despite facing potential future detention, Khalil remains committed to advocating for Palestinian human rights, rejecting accusations of antisemitism and violence. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge's decision to release Khalil, claiming it undermined national security. </p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities without congressional approval has reignited the debate over the division of war powers between the executive and legislative branches. Article I of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, while Article II designates the president as Commander in Chief. While presidents have historically engaged in military actions without formal declarations of war, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 sought to reassert congressional authority, though its effectiveness has been debated. Some legal scholars argue the recent strikes against Iran were unconstitutional without congressional authorization, while others suggest that informing Congress fulfills the resolution's requirements. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to the global oil supply and subsequent increases in energy prices. While initial market reactions saw price surges, experts believe Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial waterway for oil transport. However, ongoing tensions and potential Israeli strikes on Iranian oil infrastructure could still disrupt the energy market, potentially driving prices above $80 per barrel. A closure of the Strait of Hormuz, though considered unlikely, could have severe economic consequences, potentially spiking prices to $130 per barrel and significantly reducing global GDP.

          <p>Satellite imagery has emerged showing the extent of damage to Iranian nuclear facilities following U.S. airstrikes, with experts analyzing the images to assess the impact on Fordo, Isfahan, and Natanz. While President Trump claimed the sites were "completely and totally obliterated," other officials have been more cautious in their assessments, pending full battle damage evaluations. The images reveal significant damage, including large diameter holes, craters, and blue ash at Fordo, extensive building destruction at Isfahan, and a large crater over an underground complex at Natanz. Experts caution that a comprehensive understanding of the damage requires on-site inspections by international agencies. </p>

          <p>Analysts in Taiwan are expressing concerns that the U.S.'s involvement in the Middle East, particularly its recent strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, could strain American military resources and political attention. This could potentially impact the U.S.'s ability to respond swiftly to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait should China take action against Taiwan. The concern arises from the possibility that the U.S., already supporting Ukraine, might have fewer resources available to dedicate to Taiwan's defense. While Taiwan remains a core U.S. interest, the question is whether the U.S. can effectively manage multiple major conflicts simultaneously. </p>

An Israeli official noted a lack of clarity on the damage and whether materials were moved beforehand, while another source indicated the operation aimed to degrade, not destroy, Iran's nuclear program.

          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, despite China's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil. Instead, China's approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its own interests, as demonstrated by its agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels. The analyst believes China's focus will remain on protecting its own economic interests rather than policing global waterways. While about 16% of China's seaborne crude comes from Iran, its approach would be shaped by long-standing economic interests. </p>

If no further Iranian attacks occur, Trump seems inclined to avoid further escalation, hoping for productive negotiations.

          <p>An Afghan national who served as a translator for U.S. troops was detained by ICE agents during a routine immigration hearing in San Diego. Sayed Naser, who entered the U.S. legally through Mexico after obtaining a humanitarian visa to Brazil, was arrested despite having no criminal record and an active asylum case. His attorney suggests the arrest may be related to a White House directive to increase ICE arrests. Naser is being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center and has been unable to contact his family in Iran. </p>

          <p>Oil futures experienced significant losses after President Trump announced that the U.S. received early notice of Iran's retaliatory missile strikes against a U.S. base in Qatar. This announcement fueled optimism that neither country intends to further escalate the conflict in the Middle East. West Texas Intermediate crude fell nearly 9% to around $67 per barrel, while Brent crude also dropped nearly 9% to almost $70 per barrel. The decline followed an initial surge in oil prices after the U.S.'s weekend strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, but the market quickly reversed course after Iran's retaliatory move.

Justice Sotomayor issued a strong dissent, accusing her colleagues of condoning "lawless" behavior and undermining fundamental principles.

The U.S. operates numerous military bases in the region, with Al Udeid in Qatar being a key base. Closing the Strait of Hormuz could significantly impact global oil supplies, while cyberattacks and state-sponsored terrorism pose long-term threats. </p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Allows Trump to Deport Migrants to Dangerous Countries</h2>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants with criminal records to countries such as South Sudan and Libya, even if those countries are deemed too dangerous for visitors. The ruling overturns a lower court order that required the government to give migrants a chance to object to being sent to countries where they may face torture or abuse. Justice Sotomayor dissented, stating the court was turning a blind eye to injustice. The decision allows the administration to proceed with deportations to politically unstable and dangerous regions. </p>
