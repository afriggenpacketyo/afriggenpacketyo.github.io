          <p>President Trump has appointed Detroit entrepreneur Mark Savaya as special envoy to Iraq, acknowledging Savaya's role in boosting Muslim American turnout for his campaign in Michigan. Trump praised Savaya's deep understanding of the Iraq-U.S. relationship and regional connections, anticipating these would advance American interests. This appointment follows a recent peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, which Trump celebrated as achieving "peace in the Middle East." The administration expressed optimism for expanding the Abraham Accords.</p>

          <p>The new film "Diamond Diplomacy" delves into the intricate historical relationship between the United States and Japan through the lens of baseball. It highlights the journeys of four Japanese players, including Shohei Ohtani, to Major League Baseball, showcasing baseball's role in cultural exchange since a 1934 Babe Ruth tour and post-WWII goodwill efforts. The article notes Ohtani's current status as a cultural icon, whose popularity signifies a significant shift in American recognition of Japanese figures. His recent performance in the World Baseball Classic and World Series underscores his impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris was forced to close following a sophisticated daytime heist where thieves stole eight "priceless" items of 19th-century French royal jewelry. The four masked robbers used a vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to enter through a first-floor window, cut through display cases with power tools, and escaped on scooters within minutes. While no one was injured, the incident has raised significant questions about the security of French cultural heritage. Authorities are investigating the professional gang, and two items, including a crown, were recovered near the scene.</p>

          <p>The fragile Gaza truce faced a major challenge after Israel accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire by targeting Israeli soldiers, resulting in the deaths of two IDF personnel. Israel responded with air and artillery strikes on dozens of alleged Hamas targets, while Hamas denied involvement in clashes and reaffirmed commitment to the ceasefire. The Israeli Prime Minister directed "strong action," and aid transfers into Gaza were halted indefinitely, with the Rafah crossing closure linked to the return of deceased hostages' remains. The U.S. State Department also warned of potential Hamas attacks on Palestinian civilians.</p>

          <p>Federal officials, including the Secret Service and FBI, discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area frequented by Air Force One during President Trump's visits to Florida. The Secret Service identified "items of interest," sharing a photo of what appeared to be a platform high in a tree, though no individuals were present. This incident occurred before Trump's arrival for a weekend stay at his Mar-A-Lago club, less than a mile from the airport. It follows an attempted assassination against the president at his golf club last year.</p>

Unlike famous paintings, these jewels are easily broken apart and sold on the black market, highlighting a shift in criminal targets.

Lagarde also observed signs of the dollar's status as a safe haven currency eroding, citing the rise of cryptocurrency, the increasing price of gold, and shifts in capital flows.

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police are "actively looking into" a report alleging that Prince Andrew asked a bodyguard in 2011 to find damaging information on his sexual assault accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The Mail on Sunday reported Andrew provided Giuffre's personal details to the officer before a photo of their first meeting was to be published. This investigation follows Buckingham Palace's announcement that Andrew relinquished his royal titles and honors after emails showed continued contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre's family called Andrew's decision a "vindication" for survivors, urging King Charles III to further strip him of his prince title.</p>

          <p>Sabrina Carpenter's recent appearance on "Saturday Night Live" cleverly addressed criticisms of her pop persona, particularly her use of suggestive imagery. In a QVC spoof, Carpenter played a designer oblivious to the phallic resemblance of her neck pillow, mirroring real-life reactions to her album art and stage performances. Her opening monologue and a "girlboss" sketch further engaged with the discourse, dismissing accusations of subservience to misogynistic fantasies. The article highlights Carpenter's self-awareness and comedic talent in using the platform to respond to critics, especially other women, by being "in on the joke."</p>

          <p>Former US Representative George Santos, recently released from prison after President Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft, announced his new mission: prison reform. Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023, described his 84-day prison experience as "dehumanizing" and "humbling," citing issues like rotting facilities and broken air conditioning. He informed Trump of his desire to assist in prison reform efforts. While his exact plans remain unclear, Santos stated he is not interested in running for office again for at least a decade.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military carried out its seventh known strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel since last month, resulting in three fatalities, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced. The strike targeted a boat linked to Ejército de Liberación Nacional, a Colombian guerrilla group designated as a terrorist organization, in international waters within the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility. Hegseth reiterated the administration's stance that such organizations would be treated as terrorists. These operations have killed at least 32 people, drawing pushback from lawmakers and Senator Mark Kelly, who question the legal justification for the attacks.</p>

Trump's statement on Truth Social followed Petro's criticism of U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats, with Petro claiming a fisherman was killed and U.S. sovereignty violated. Trump asserted that Colombia's drug production fuels death and destruction in the U.S. Petro, in turn, called Trump "rude and ignorant," defending his record against drug trafficking. This escalation deepens tensions after the Trump administration previously added Colombia to a list of non-cooperative drug war nations.</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has achieved a dramatic decline in per capita tobacco consumption over two decades, with smoking prevalence falling from 54% to 23%, according to a WHO report. This success is attributed to strong political commitment, comprehensive policies, and community engagement, including higher taxes, advertising bans, and public smoking restrictions. However, the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth. Challenges persist, particularly in Indonesia, which hasn't ratified the WHO framework and scrapped a planned tobacco tax hike. The region also faces the rising popularity of e-cigarettes, with many countries banning vaping to prevent a new generation of nicotine users.</p>

Both candidates aim to fix the exchange rate, restructure state businesses, and attract foreign investment, while also seeking to maintain social welfare programs and tackle fuel subsidies.

While not speculating ahead of the Chancellor's November Budget, Miliband stated that "all of these issues" are being reviewed to address affordability. The government faces pressure to reduce household energy costs, with Labour previously pledging to lower average bills by £300 annually by 2030. Miliband emphasized the long-term solution lies in home-grown clean energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Such a cut could save average households £86 per year.</p>
