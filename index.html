        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid ongoing trade negotiations, China is firmly rejecting U.S. demands to cease purchasing oil from Russia and Iran, framing the issue as a matter of national sovereignty and energy security. Chinese officials assert that coercion will not work and that they will defend their national interests, even as both nations express optimism about reaching a broader trade deal. This stance highlights China's strategy of leveraging its economic importance and perceived inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy, viewing these energy imports as both economically beneficial and strategically crucial.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan for higher tariffs is set to take effect this week, sparking concerns about its impact on the U.S. economy amid signs of a weakening job market and rising inflation. While economists have widely criticized the policy, negotiations have resulted in a temporary delay of tariffs on Mexican imports. Separately, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is in Israel engaging with families of hostages held in Gaza, assuring them of efforts to secure a release deal as ceasefire talks with Hamas remain stalled.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Finance and Leasing Association has criticized the financial regulator's proposed compensation plan for car finance mis-selling as "completely impractical." The trade body argues that requiring firms to address claims dating back to 2007 is unfeasible due to the likely absence of complete records from both lenders and customers. While a recent Supreme Court ruling narrowed the scope of potential payouts, millions of drivers could still be eligible for compensation, with the Financial Conduct Authority estimating the total cost could reach between £9 billion and £18 billion.

          <p>In a breathtaking conclusion to one of Test cricket's most memorable series, India defeated England by a mere six runs at The Oval. The match came down to the final moments, with a visibly injured Chris Woakes bravely coming out to bat in a last-ditch effort. Ultimately, India's Mohammed Siraj bowled Gus Atkinson to clinch the victory, leveling the hard-fought series at 2-2. The dramatic finale, marked by incredible tension and heroic performances from both sides, provided a fitting end to an outstanding series of sporting theatre.</p>

They are charged with being accessories after the fact in the case of Austin Drummond, who is wanted for the killing of four people in Tiptonville last week. Drummond remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous, with a reward of $17,500 offered for information leading to his capture.

          <p>A group of more than 50 Democratic legislators have left Texas to break the state House's quorum, aiming to block a special session vote on a new congressional map. The Republican-proposed map, backed by former President Trump, could create up to five new GOP-leaning districts. In response, Texas officials, including the Attorney General, have threatened the absent lawmakers with arrest and daily fines to compel their return. This marks the third time in recent years that Texas Democrats have used this tactic to halt Republican legislative priorities.</p>

          <p>A new legislative effort by Republican senators aims to provide independent contractors and gig workers with benefits like health insurance and retirement savings. The proposed bills would shield companies from misclassification lawsuits if they offer such perks, a concept known as portable benefits. While advocates see this as adapting to the modern workforce, labor unions strongly oppose the measures, viewing them as a way for companies to legitimize worker misclassification and prevent unionization. This Republican-led approach contrasts with earlier Democratic proposals and highlights the deep political divisions over the future of labor rights for the gig economy.</p>

          <p>Tesla has awarded CEO Elon Musk a substantial stock package of 96 million shares, currently valued at approximately $29 billion. This move comes six months after a Delaware judge invalidated his previous, larger 2018 pay package, ruling that it was improperly negotiated with a board that was not independent. To receive the new restricted stock, Musk must first pay Tesla the exercise price of $23.34 per share. The decision follows a contentious legal battle initiated by a Tesla stockholder who challenged the fairness and process behind the original compensation plan.</p>

Researchers are calling for a binding international treaty to address the crisis, comparing the threat of plastics to that of air and lead pollution.

However, the same survey shows that most children are not allowed to be in public without an adult, with many even restricted from playing unsupervised in their own yards. This disconnect suggests that children resort to phones and online worlds for social interaction because their real-world freedoms have been curtailed by parental fears.

          <p>Tensions are escalating in Switzerland as an August 7th deadline looms for striking a trade deal with the United States to avoid a new 39% tariff rate. The unexpectedly high duty, part of a broader U.S. trade policy shift, has shocked the Swiss business community, which fears significant job losses and trade disruptions. Industry groups warn that such a high rate would effectively cut off trade for many companies, as there is no substitute for the U.S. export market. The situation has increased the risk of a Swiss recession and put deflationary pressure on its central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's central bank has announced plans to accelerate the internationalization of the yuan, aiming to increase its use in global trade and finance. The move comes as Beijing perceives growing doubts about the stability of the U.S. dollar, creating an opportunity to elevate its own currency's role. The People's Bank of China pledged to strengthen the offshore yuan market, enhance its financing function, and expand its Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). This renewed focus marks the first time in three years that yuan internationalization has been a dedicated section in the central bank's midyear policy readout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is currently reviewing the legality of President Trump's broad tariffs, with the case likely to reach the U.S. Supreme Court regardless of the outcome. The litigation challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the duties, an authority historically used for sanctioning enemies. A dozen states and several businesses argue that the Constitution grants tariff authority to Congress, not the president, and that IEEPA does not cover tariffs. A loss for the administration would undermine its tariff-centric economic strategy and could lead to importers seeking refunds for billions already paid. (not investment advice)</p>

Workers told NPR they were asked to perform duties as volunteers in exchange for free housing, a situation they felt exploited their need for accommodation and love for the park. The hiring delays were reportedly caused by a strained Human Resources division following federal budget cuts and a subsequent rehiring of fired staff. While the workers are now receiving wages, they have not received backpay for the hundreds of hours they volunteered.</p>

Data suggests a decline in visitors from California, who represent the largest contingent of tourists, as well as a slump in international travel. Traffic on the I-15 border crossing was down, and air travel into the city also decreased. This downturn aligns with broader predictions of a 'Trump Slump' in international tourism due to trade policies and rhetoric, though Clark County's gambling revenue still saw a slight increase despite the lower visitor numbers.

This poor integration is especially noticeable in older shows not designed for commercial breaks.

The annual survey found that the prevalence of serious suicidal thoughts in adolescents aged 12 to 17 fell from nearly 13% to 10%, with a slight drop in suicide attempts as well. Experts suggest the improvement may be linked to more teens opening up about their struggles and getting connected to specialized treatment.
