          <p>The Bank of New York Mellon will act as the primary custodian for the reserves backing Ripple's new U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD. This partnership aims to enhance regulatory compliance and institutional credibility for Ripple amid growing interest in stablecoins from major corporations. The collaboration is seen as part of a broader trend of traditional financial institutions engaging with digital assets, spurred by a shifting U.S. regulatory landscape. Ripple has also recently applied for a national banking charter and a Federal Reserve master account to further integrate into the traditional financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hydrologists with the National Weather Service indicate that the conditions leading to the catastrophic flooding on the Guadalupe River were recognized in advance. Historical data reveals the river has experienced major, deadly floods over a dozen times in the last century, establishing the area's reputation as "Flash Flood Alley." Despite timely warnings, challenges such as the overnight timing of the storm and the region's growing population density complicated evacuation efforts. Experts are now reviewing the tragedy to improve forecasting models, floodplain maps, and public alert systems for the future.</p>

Founded in 1993, the company has seen exponential growth, crossing the $2 trillion mark in February 2024 and $3 trillion just one month prior to this new record. Nvidia is the decisive leader in producing the graphics processing units that power the large language models driving the current AI revolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration will announce new tariffs on imports from at least seven more countries. This follows his recent action of sending letters to 14 nations, including Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia, imposing steep new tariffs ranging from 25% to 40%, effective August 1. The move continues his aggressive trade strategy aimed at resetting global economic relationships. The administration's actions are an extension of the "liberation day" tariffs announced in April, which were temporarily paused but are now set to be enforced without further extensions, creating continued uncertainty in global markets.

Barclay, who had been living in a makeshift camp nearby, was linked to the crime by DNA evidence found on the victim's clothing.

          <p>Alongside broad country-specific levies, the Trump administration's sector-specific tariffs on items like cars, steel, and aluminum are creating significant economic pressure.

These product-specific tariffs add another layer of complexity for businesses and are expected to have a substantial impact on the domestic market and consumers, affecting everything from appliances to vehicles.

          <p>A new bill signed by President Trump does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits, contrary to some claims, but instead introduces a new temporary deduction for seniors. The legislation provides a "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below certain thresholds, which applies to all income, not just Social Security. Policy experts clarify that while this provides relief for many, it is not a repeal of the tax on benefits.

Critics argue that this buildup, prioritized by the administration, creates a powerful internal security apparatus with a broad mandate that could eventually extend beyond immigration enforcement.

The official emphasized the necessity of continued investment to improve livelihoods in a nation where per capita GDP recently surpassed $13,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia has launched a world-first climate visa program for citizens of Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific nation existentially threatened by rising sea levels. The Falepili Union Treaty allows up to 280 Tuvaluans annually to live, work, or study in Australia with a path to permanent residency, independent of specific job or course requirements. This "special mobility pathway" is designed to provide a dignified safety net for a population facing displacement, with over 3,000 people already applying for the first round. The treaty also commits to preserving Tuvalu's statehood and sovereignty, marking a proactive approach to climate-induced migration.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refused to rule out extending the current freeze on income tax and National Insurance thresholds beyond its scheduled end in April 2028. The freeze, introduced by the previous Conservative government, has resulted in millions of people paying higher tax rates as their wages rise with inflation, a phenomenon known as fiscal drag. When questioned in Parliament, Starmer only reiterated his commitment to Labour's manifesto, which pledged no increases to the rates of income tax, NI, or VAT but made no specific promise on thresholds. Extending the freeze could raise an estimated £7 billion annually. (not investment advice)</p>

These programs include business installment agreements, which allow for monthly payments, and an Offer in Compromise (OIC), which can settle debt for a lower amount in cases of severe financial hardship. Other options are obtaining a temporary "Currently Not Collectible" status to pause collections, or seeking penalty abatement to reduce or remove certain penalties. Experts stress that ignoring tax debt is the worst course of action, as it compounds the problem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A decade after China's "709 crackdown," which saw the arrest and interrogation of over 300 human rights lawyers, the legal and political environment has become increasingly restrictive. Lawyers convicted during the crackdown face continued surveillance and harassment after their release, while others working on social justice cases are targeted in new waves of persecution. The government's promotion of "socialist rule of law" prioritizes political control over legal transparency and accountability. Despite the immense pressure, some lawyers continue to resist, filing complaints and using social media to document the ongoing repression they and their families face.</p>

Campers recalled waking to thunder and heavy rain, which they initially thought was normal, before realizing something was terribly wrong as water began flooding their elevated cabins. By morning, they witnessed the "complete destruction" of parts of the camp. The youth camp, which had over 500 campers and 100 staff, had its emergency plans approved by state health officials just two days before the disaster struck the region.</p>

          <p>Sir Brian Langstaff, chair of the public inquiry into the UK's infected blood scandal, has stated that victims are being "harmed further" by significant delays and injustices in the government's compensation scheme. In a new report, he criticized the process, noting that only 460 of the estimated 30,000 victims have received full compensation. The scandal involved NHS patients being given contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 80s. Sir Brian's recommendations include allowing victims to apply directly for compensation rather than waiting for an invitation and prioritizing those who are seriously ill or have never received any payment.</p>

          <p>Fertility rates across the Middle East have fallen dramatically over the past three decades, a trend experts call a "quiet revolution." The average number of children per woman has more than halved since the 1960s, with factors including economic uncertainty, the high cost of marriage, increased female education, and urbanization. This demographic shift is creating a phenomenon of "waithood," where young people delay marriage and family. While a smaller population may reduce environmental pressure, it also poses challenges for the region's economic future and the sustainability of social safety nets, as many countries will face an aging population without the wealth of Western nations.</p>

The British Medical Association (BMA) stated the government has refused to negotiate on pay, leaving them with no choice but to strike. The government called the move "unnecessary and unreasonable," highlighting a recent 5.4% pay rise on top of a 22% increase over the previous two years. However, the BMA argues that real-terms pay is still about 20% lower than in 2008 and that a credible offer is needed to avert the walkouts.</p>

While authorities state this is not a precursor to the much-feared Nankai Trough earthquake, they acknowledge a major disaster is inevitable. The updated plan aims to reduce the projected death toll from a potential magnitude-9 Nankai Trough quake by 80% over the next decade through infrastructure improvements and public education.

          <p>The deadly flash floods in Texas have renewed focus on the capabilities of the National Weather Service (NWS) following significant staffing cuts under the Trump administration. Since February, the NWS has lost about 600 staff, leading to high vacancy rates in forecast offices across the country. While experts believe the NWS performed well in forecasting the Texas event, they warn that continued cuts could compromise the agency's ability to handle future catastrophes. The San Antonio office, which covered the flood zone, is notably missing its Warning Coordination Meteorologist, a key liaison role for community emergency preparedness.</p>

Other proposals include more out-of-court resolutions and creating a new court division to handle less serious cases.
