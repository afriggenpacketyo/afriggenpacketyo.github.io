          <p>President Donald Trump is set to begin an Asia trip, with key meetings planned with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC Summit, following recent North Korean ballistic missile launches. The visit comes amidst heightened trade tensions with China, including new tariffs and export controls on rare-earth magnets. Trump aims to de-escalate trade disputes, expressing confidence in a positive outcome, while also visiting Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea. North Korea's increased aggression, including recent missile tests, adds a layer of complexity to regional security discussions during the trip.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines has resumed flights after a significant nationwide technology outage caused a system-wide ground stop, leading to over 400 flight cancellations and disrupting travel for more than 49,000 passengers. The Seattle-based carrier, which includes Horizon Air, lifted the ground stop late Thursday night Pacific time. While operations are restoring, the airline has implemented a flexible travel policy to assist affected customers. The specific nature of the tech outage has not been disclosed, and the FAA, which issues ground stops, has been contacted for comment.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is projected to intensify into a Category 4 hurricane this weekend, posing a severe threat of catastrophic flash flooding and landslides to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. Hurricane conditions are expected to impact southern Haiti by Saturday and Jamaica by Saturday night or Sunday morning. The storm's unusually slow movement will allow for significant strengthening and prolonged impact, potentially making it the strongest hurricane to hit Jamaica in over 35 years. Already, one fatality has been reported in Haiti due to a downed tree.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the U.S. of "murder" and violating sovereignty by killing a Colombian fisherman in one of at least ten U.S. strikes on alleged "drug boats." In retaliation, President Trump sanctioned Petro, his wife, son, and Colombia's foreign minister, also suspending aid to the country. These actions are part of a broader U.S. campaign against drug cartels, which has killed 43 people and raises significant legal and ethical questions about the use of deadly force without clear justification. The U.S. has also deployed a large military presence to the Caribbean, escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>The recent demolition of the White House East Wing, undertaken without public notice, has drawn criticism for threatening the fundamental idea of government transparency and accountability. This article argues that President Trump's project, including plans for a $300 million privately funded ballroom, deviates from historical precedents of White House alterations. Critics view this as another instance of the Trump administration sidelining Congress and disregarding the symbolic importance of the building as a public trust. The unannounced nature and funding methods raise concerns about the presidency's evolving relationship with republican ideals.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is significantly increasing its military presence in the Caribbean, including deploying the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, fueling concerns about potential military action in Venezuela. This escalation follows a series of U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats, which have killed 43 people and led to the resignation of Admiral Alvin Holsey over concerns about the operations. Analysts suggest the military buildup aims to destabilize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government, rather than solely target drug trafficking. President Trump has indicated a willingness for "land action" in Venezuela without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>An attorney for Byron Black, a man executed on Tennessee death row, claims an electrocardiogram showed his heart remained active for nearly two minutes after he was pronounced dead. This allegation intensifies scrutiny on Tennessee's lethal injection protocols, which the attorney previously called "100% botched" after witnesses reported Black groaning in agony. The EKG evidence suggests the sedative pentobarbital may not have worked as intended, raising questions about whether Black was still alive when the curtain closed and if he experienced prolonged suffering.

          <p>The U.S. has conducted at least ten strikes on vessels suspected of drug trafficking in international waters off South America, resulting in 43 fatalities since early September. President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth assert the legality of these operations, classifying those killed as "unlawful combatants" linked to "terrorist organizations." However, Congress has not authorized military force against drug cartels, and questions persist regarding the evidence supporting these designations. One strike had survivors, but one was released without charges, fueling Colombian President Gustavo Petro's claims of "murder" and diplomatic tensions.</p>

          <p>The current government shutdown, now the second-longest in history, is characterized as a protest against President Trump's perceived challenge to Congress's constitutional taxing and spending powers. This article argues that Trump has refused to spend appropriated funds and is raising revenues without congressional approval, such as through tariffs and private donations for projects like a new White House ballroom. Democrats initiated the shutdown over COVID-era health-insurance subsidies, but the deeper issue is Trump's rejection of constitutional limits on his power.

          <h2>Pakistan Bans Hard-line Islamist Party Following Violent Clashes and Anti-Blasphemy Protests</h2>

          <p>Pakistan has banned the hard-line Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) after violent clashes with police resulted in at least five deaths. The ban, unanimously approved by the federal cabinet, cites the party's "violent and terrorist activities" and its history of using religion to spread disorder. The TLP, known for its fierce anti-blasphemy stance and calls for death sentences, has seen a rise in grassroots support and blasphemy cases. The crackdown follows a march towards the U.S. Embassy and reflects Pakistan's recent realignment with the United States, making such protests politically untenable.</p>

          <p>NBA legends Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal expressed strong disapproval over a gambling scandal that led to the arrest of over 30 individuals, including former player Chauncey Billups and current Heat guard Terry Rozier. Federal indictments detailed schemes to rig sports bets and poker games, with Rozier accused of providing insider NBA information. O’Neal voiced shame for those jeopardizing their careers and the NBA's image, while Barkley dismissed addiction as a factor, labeling the actions as "total stupidity." The league has placed Billups and Rozier on immediate leave as they face serious allegations.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is pressing for the swift deployment of an international peacekeeping force in Gaza to uphold the recent ceasefire between Israeli forces and Hamas militants. The force is a key component of the peace plan, with Israel retaining approval power over contributing nations. While fighting has subsided, the humanitarian crisis persists, and questions remain about Gaza's future governance, with Hamas excluded from any role. Rubio also reiterated the US stance against UNRWA's involvement, despite the dire need for aid.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is poised to make a landmark ruling on whether the president can deploy troops in American cities over the objections of local and state officials. This article highlights the Trump administration's broad claim of executive power to use the National Guard to "defend federal personnel, property, and functions" amidst protests. Legal experts and Democratic officials, including California's Attorney General and Governor, warn that such a ruling could set a dangerous precedent for presidential authority and the role of the military in civilian law enforcement. Lower courts have blocked deployments in Portland and Chicago, finding Trump's justifications "untethered to the facts."</p>

          <p>Six men have been jailed in London for their involvement in a Russian-ordered arson attack on a Ukrainian-owned warehouse, which caused £1.3 million in damages and was used to send aid to Ukraine. Ringleader Dylan Earl was recruited by the Wagner Group, a proscribed Russian terrorist organization, to carry out a series of "missions." This case marks the first convictions under the UK's National Security Act 2023, designed to counter hostile state threats. The incident underscores Russia's use of proxies to sow unrest and commit crimes abroad, posing a "very real threat" to national security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EU is considering using frozen Russian assets, including those of the central bank and millions of private investors not on sanctions lists, for war reparations to Ukraine. This article explains that Russian private investors, whose foreign securities are held by European depositories like Euroclear and Clearstream, face immense difficulty reclaiming their assets due to complex legal processes and high costs. Despite being legally entitled to their funds, few have succeeded, with legal fees often exceeding the frozen amounts. Activists are advocating for simplified procedures and greater transparency regarding these trapped assets. (not investment advice)</p>
