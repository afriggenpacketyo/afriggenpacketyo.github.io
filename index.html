Cox Automotive cites unexpectedly strong price appreciation throughout April, exceeding typical seasonal trends. The article highlights the significant impact of tariffs on the used car market.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its benchmark interest rate signals a continued balancing act between inflation control and recession avoidance. While mortgage rates aren't directly set by the Fed, its actions influence the broader interest rate environment.  The article explores factors influencing mortgage rates beyond the Fed's decisions, such as inflation, economic growth, and investor sentiment.  A rate decline is possible but not guaranteed, and the pause alone is unlikely to cause immediate changes.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's rate pause presents homeowners with a decision between a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and a home equity loan.  While historically home equity loans were preferred during rate pauses, the current situation, with the possibility of future rate cuts, makes HELOCs more attractive due to their lower average interest rates and potential for future decreases.  The article cautions borrowers to consider rate volatility and affordability when choosing between the two options.</p>
