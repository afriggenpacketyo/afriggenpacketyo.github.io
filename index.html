          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, has announced its intention to shift its primary listing location to the United States, a move that will be a fresh setback for the London Stock Exchange. The company plans to establish a dual listing, with its main hub in the U.S. while retaining a secondary listing in London. Wise believes this change will enable its shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, potentially increasing its visibility and attracting a broader range of investors. This decision reflects a growing trend of companies seeking U.S. listings to access deeper capital markets and a larger investor base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein have experienced a significant drop in U.S. demand following President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the 'de minimis' trade loophole. Temu's U.S. daily active users decreased by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's saw a 25% decline, according to data from Sensor Tower. This decrease in user engagement is also reflected in lower Apple App Store rankings for both platforms. The decline follows Trump's April announcement of tariffs on Chinese imports, including the end of the 'de minimis' tariff exemption, which allowed companies to ship low-cost goods worth less than $800 to the U.S. tariff-free.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov criticized NATO's efforts to draw India into 'anti-China' initiatives and reiterated Moscow's desire for India and China to restore a trilateral mechanism. Despite previous attempts, the China-India border dispute in 2020 largely froze bilateral ties until a disengagement agreement was reached in October of the previous year.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-Mexico border is increasingly militarized with the deployment of Stryker combat vehicles and thousands of soldiers. These vehicles, previously used in Iraq and Afghanistan, are now part of an effort to stop what President Trump calls an 'invasion' at the border. This deployment has raised concerns about bypassing the traditional distinction between the armed forces and domestic police. The military is using a legal loophole to patrol the border by creating National Defense Areas, allowing them to detain migrants as trespassers. Critics argue this is turning a significant portion of the southern border into a military installation.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the 2018 Lion Air crash has criticized the deal between Boeing and the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) as 'morally repugnant'. The deal, which includes Boeing paying $1.1 billion to avoid prosecution over two crashes that killed 346 people, allows the firm to 'sidestep true criminal accountability'. The agreement involves payments to families of crash victims and investments in improving compliance, safety, and quality programs. While Boeing avoids a criminal fraud trial, relatives of the victims will have the opportunity to appeal the deal when it is considered by a federal judge.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden's actions during his presidency, accusing aides of a 'conspiracy' to conceal Biden's mental state. Trump's move targets the use of an autopen to sign executive actions, questioning the validity of policy shifts enacted under Biden's signature. Trump and his Republican allies have long questioned Biden's mental acuity, attempting to overturn presidential pardons and federal rules. Biden, who ended his re-election campaign after a disastrous debate performance, has dismissed Trump's claims as 'ridiculous and false'.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should lead Pakistan's energy transition by leveraging its solar panel technology, potentially creating a model for other Global South countries. The Renewables First report argues that China must choose between its coal-fired plants and solar panels, as they cannot both succeed in the same market. The report emphasizes the need for indigenous manufacturing, given rising global trade tensions and Chinaâ€™s export restrictions on critical minerals. However, a Chinese energy scholar has questioned whether this vision is too expensive to be realistic, highlighting the complexities of balancing economic interests and sustainable development.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs have disrupted the global trading system, causing uncertainty for businesses and consumers. These tariffs undermine trade and weaken economic links that stabilize international relations. By disregarding free trade agreements and hindering the World Trade Organization, Trump has undercut the international rules-based order. This retreat from free trade will hurt consumers worldwide through higher prices and more limited choices, raising the prospect of political discontent in their countries. Ultimately, the Trump tariffs will make the world a poorer and more perilous place.</p>
