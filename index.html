          <p>A recent report indicates that U.S. housing affordability has improved to its best level in more than two and a half years, citing lower monthly principal and interest payments relative to median household income. The article suggests potential homebuyers should consider acting now due to the high likelihood of future Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could intensify buyer competition. It also advises current homeowners planning to move to account for the fact that lower home values will affect both their selling price and their purchasing power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has introduced new, more affordable standard versions of its popular electric vehicles, with the Model Y SUV now priced just below $40,000. This move is aimed at stimulating demand and attracting more buyers after a multi-quarter slump in sales and amid increasing market competition. The company's strategy also involves shifting investor focus towards its future as a robotics and autonomous driving technology business, moving beyond its aging lineup of consumer electric vehicles. The announcement comes as Tesla has yet to deliver on other long-promised products.</p>

          <h2>Financial Planner Suggests Using Effective Tax Rate to Choose Between Pretax and Roth 401(k)</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 14:52:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial planner advises that when deciding between traditional (pretax) and Roth 401(k) contributions, savers should focus on their effective tax rate rather than their marginal tax bracket. The article explains that an individual's effective tax rate in retirement is often significantly lower than their marginal rate during their peak earning years. This perspective suggests that for some, making pretax contributions could be more advantageous in the long run, as the ultimate goal is to pay taxes during the period when one's overall rate is lowest.

          <p>Following recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. A $25,000 HELOC now carries a lower monthly payment compared to earlier in the year, making it a more attractive financing option than high-interest credit cards. The article highlights that HELOCs feature variable interest rates that adjust to market conditions and offer flexible repayment options, such as making interest-only payments during the initial draw period to reduce immediate costs.

The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for parts of the coast and warned of dangerous swells likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents.

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's recent and proposed deployments of the National Guard to U.S. cities, arguing that these actions challenge the nation's long-standing tradition of limiting military involvement in civilian affairs. The piece explores the legal and constitutional complexities of such deployments, including potential conflicts with the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. It suggests the moves are an effort to normalize the presence of troops in cities, potentially eroding a cultural barrier against tyranny, more for political effect than for addressing actual unrest.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that some federal employees furloughed during the ongoing government shutdown might not receive back pay once it ends, stating, "it depends on who we're talking about." This comment follows the circulation of a draft White House memo that argues a 2019 law guaranteeing back pay is not automatic and requires specific congressional action. The stance is viewed as a political tactic to increase pressure on Democrats and has been strongly condemned by federal employee unions, who call it a clear misinterpretation of the law.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged past the $4,000 per ounce mark for the first time, setting a new record high. This significant milestone continues a two-year trend of rising prices for the precious metal, fueled by global economic uncertainty, inflation, and geopolitical instability. For those looking to invest without paying the peak price, the article suggests exploring more affordable options like purchasing fractional gold bars and coins. It also outlines strategies such as dollar-cost averaging, which allows investors to build a position over time with smaller, regular investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has announced it will appeal a judge's decision to dismiss a terrorism-related charge against Liam Og Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap. The case, which involved the alleged display of a flag supporting the proscribed organization Hezbollah, was thrown out due to a technical error in the prosecution's timeline. The band has condemned the appeal as a form of "political policing" and a waste of public funds, framing it within a broader context of a "state wide witch-hunt against Palestinian solidarity."</p>

          <p>The price of gold has soared to a record high of over $4,000 an ounce, creating significant challenges for the jewelry industry. Mid-market companies aiming to offer affordable fine jewelry are particularly squeezed, with major brands like Pandora and Signet signaling potential price increases or a shift in manufacturing methods. The sustained price climb, driven by investor demand amid global economic uncertainty, is forcing jewelers to innovate with materials like 10k gold or gold-plating to manage costs. Industry leaders view the trend as a concerning "fear indicator" for the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking new study suggests a troubling link between two of the West Coast's most dangerous fault lines, proposing that massive earthquakes on the Cascadia subduction zone have historically been followed by large quakes on the northern San Andreas fault. By analyzing deep seafloor sediment cores, researchers found evidence that this back-to-back sequence may have occurred multiple times over thousands of years, including around the year 1700. This hypothesis raises the alarming possibility of a paired catastrophic event that could devastate the Pacific coast and overwhelm national emergency response capabilities.</p>

The national unions cited concerns that the R360 model would fragment the sport, undermine investment in player development, and failed to engage collaboratively on critical issues like player welfare and calendar coordination.</p>

He argued that it is unsustainable for companies with relatively low annual recurring revenue to be valued in the tens of billions of dollars. However, Bravo also highlighted a key distinction from the past: the current AI boom is being financed by large, financially stable corporations, which provides a different foundation than the speculative venture capital of the late 1990s.
