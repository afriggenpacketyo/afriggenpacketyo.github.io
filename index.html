          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple after rejecting the government's evidence for their deportation.  The judge criticized the government for lacking meaningful evidence to support the claim that the couple were members of a terrorist organization.  The couple had been arrested and released multiple times, with their TPS status withdrawn based on the unsubstantiated claims.  The ruling highlights concerns about the government's use of evidence in deportation cases.</p>
