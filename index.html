          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>UK inflation has decreased for the second consecutive month, reaching 2.6% in March, primarily due to falling petrol and toy prices. However, analysts predict a resurgence in inflation from April onward, driven by increases in household bills, utilities, and council tax. The impact of potential tariffs and global economic performance also contribute to this uncertainty. Despite current wage growth outpacing inflation, the Bank of England faces a dilemma balancing this with rising business costs and potential economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Harvard University has refused to comply with demands from the Trump administration regarding governance, hiring, and teaching, leading to a $2.2 billion freeze in federal funding. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, defended the university's autonomy, stating that no government should dictate private universities' curriculum. This decision follows Trump's broader attacks on higher education, including scrutiny of pro-Palestinian protests and accusations of antisemitism. Harvard's substantial endowment of $53.2 billion allows it to withstand financial pressure, but the funding cut still poses challenges for specific projects and research initiatives.</p>

            <p>Global health officials are concerned about a potential polio comeback due to increasing cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan, compounded by cuts in USAID funding. Pakistan saw a spike in cases in 2024, with 74 recorded, while Afghanistan had 24, linked to disruptions in vaccination campaigns. Distrust of vaccines, security risks, and challenges in reaching all children contribute to the persistence of the virus in these regions. The dismantling of USAID projects further threatens vaccination efforts, potentially leading to a significant rise in polio cases worldwide.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that the act gives Congress the power to impose tariffs and seeks to void Trump's tariff orders, potentially placing Republican lawmakers in a politically vulnerable position.</p>

Rogan's unwavering support for Musk and his platforming of second world war revisionists have caused friction with some of his comedy friends and other members of the Rogansphere. Despite past controversies, Rogan's recent embrace of Trump and Musk has led to accusations that he has become a shill for the elites he used to distrust. While Rogan has acknowledged some policy missteps by Trump, his enthusiasm for both Trump and Musk remains.</p>

            <p>Experts warn that the Trump administration's promotion of white Christian nationalists to key government roles could lead to the dismantling of democratic institutions and the suppression of free speech. The creation of an “anti-Christian bias” taskforce and a White House Faith Office, dominated by right-wing Christian loyalists, has raised concerns about prioritizing a specific brand of Christianity over other faiths. Critics point to the appointees' anti-LGBTQ+, anti-immigration, and anti-racial equality stances, raising fears of a government influenced by these beliefs.

            <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is widely anticipated to cut interest rates due to concerns about global tariff tensions and their potential impact on the euro zone's economic growth. The ECB is expected to trim interest rates for the third time this year. Market expectations suggest a high probability of a quarter-point interest rate cut, taking the deposit facility rate to 2.25%. Global trade and tariff policies have prompted renewed concerns about euro area growth, forcing the ECB to consider further monetary easing.</p>

            <p>Tommy Robinson, the far-right activist, has lost his appeal against an 18-month prison sentence for contempt of court. Robinson was jailed for breaching a court order after falsely claiming that a Syrian teenager was a violent thug. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, stating that the judge's application of the law and reasoning were meticulous. This marks Robinson's second court defeat in less than a month, following a previous challenge to his segregation in jail.</p>

            <p>Economists are closely monitoring indicators beyond negative economic growth to assess whether the U.S. is already experiencing a recession driven by President Trump's tariffs.

Volatile bond market activity and falling gas prices, potentially signaling a weakening global economy, also raise concerns. These indicators suggest a unique recession scenario primarily affecting consumers due to tariff impacts, differing from traditional business-driven economic downturns.</p>
