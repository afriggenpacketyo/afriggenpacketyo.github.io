          <p>Recent clashes between India and Pakistan have escalated dramatically, with both sides targeting air bases and accusing each other of initiating the attacks. Pakistan claims India launched missiles at its air bases, while India reports retaliatory strikes on Pakistani military targets. International concern is growing, with the U.S. urging both nations to de-escalate the situation. The conflict is rooted in long-standing disputes over Kashmir and recent terrorist attacks, leading to heightened military engagement and diplomatic efforts to mediate the crisis. The fighting has caused civilian casualties and infrastructure damage on both sides of the border.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the resurgence of silicosis, a deadly lung disease, and the dismantling of federal programs aimed at preventing it. Recent actions, including the firing of the NIOSH Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program team and the pausing of MSHA's new silica standard enforcement, have weakened worker protections. The article highlights the importance of government regulation in preventing occupational diseases and the potential consequences of inadequate public health measures. The situation is exacerbated by a rise in silicosis cases in the artificial stone countertop industry, particularly among Latino immigrants, due to under-resourced OSHA enforcement.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how employers are exploiting part-time workers by offering too few hours, leading to underwork and financial instability. It contrasts this with the original intent of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which aimed to limit overwork. The article highlights the challenges faced by part-time workers, including difficulty obtaining loans and accessing social safety net programs. It proposes potential solutions, such as requiring employers to set schedules in advance and incentivizing full-time employment. The author argues that addressing underwork requires political attention and policy changes to ensure fair labor practices.</p>

          <p>A wayward Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in space. The spacecraft, which became stranded in Earth's orbit due to a booster malfunction, splashed down in the Indian Ocean. This event serves as a reminder of the Cold War-era space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which aimed to explore Venus. While the United States focused on the moon, the Soviets achieved several milestones in Venus exploration, including the first probes to enter its atmosphere and land on its surface.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes China's strategy under Xi Jinping to dominate global supplies of essential goods, giving it leverage in international relations. China has increased exports, state-controlled lending to industrial borrowers, and introduced economic warfare tactics like export controls. This approach has allowed China to counter tariffs imposed by the U.S. by restricting the export of critical minerals. While China still relies on the West for some advanced technologies, its willingness to weaponize the supply chain challenges U.S. supremacy and forces countries to choose sides, potentially leading to a divided world.</p>

          <p>European leaders are concerned that they may not be able to provide sufficient weapons to Ukraine due to President Trump's plan to reduce U.S. support. Ukraine's Parliament approved a deal to give the U.S. a share of future revenue over natural resources in exchange for continued arms shipments. European allies are willing to increase weapons production, but it will take years to ramp up. The shift in U.S. policy is causing European countries to focus on their own security, reducing the amount of aid they can provide to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), aims to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances. The bill would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that forbid federal funds from going towards research of Schedule I substances and that require the ONDCP to oppose any attempts to legalize Schedule I substances. The bill is simple to enact and would allow research to catch up with the US’s increasing cannabis consumption.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has launched a relentless media offensive characterized by crass language, flashy tactics, and outrageous social media posts.
