          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its key policy interest rate steady at 2.5%, a level it has maintained for a significant period. This decision comes as the nation's economy experiences a slight contraction, influenced by weakened construction and slowing export growth. Financial authorities are also addressing a surge in household loans, driven by a sharp increase in Seoul's housing prices, which has heightened concerns about financial stability. The country also faces potential economic pressure from threatened U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil, a significant escalation in trade policy. The move is explicitly linked to political matters, including Brazil's prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro and court rulings affecting U.S. social media companies. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has stated that his country will respond with reciprocal measures and warned against interference in its judicial affairs. This action is part of a broader wave of new tariff announcements targeting numerous countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed that a 50% tariff on copper imports will take effect on August 1, justifying the move on national security grounds. The administration highlighted copper's critical role in defense systems, semiconductors, and other essential technologies, noting the U.S. imports nearly half of its supply. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the goal is to onshore copper production, aligning the tariff with similar duties on steel and aluminum. This policy is categorized as a national security measure, distinct from tariffs used for negotiation or addressing trade imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

The recovery has been notably slower for Black and Hispanic Californians, highlighting persistent racial and income-based health disparities.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California, arguing that the state's animal cruelty laws for egg-laying hens are causing high egg prices and are preempted by federal law.

The suit claims these laws, passed by voters, have decreased egg production and increased prices, driven by activist concepts rather than food safety.

          <p>The Greek government has announced it will suspend processing asylum applications for at least three months for migrants arriving from Libya via the sea. The decision follows a recent influx of over 2,000 migrants to the island of Crete, which has become a major transit route. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis stated that arriving migrants will be detained, calling the measure a "necessary temporary reaction" and a message to smugglers. This move comes after diplomatic efforts by the EU to engage with Libyan authorities on migration control were unsuccessful.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Pixar's animated film "Elio," arguing that despite not being overtly political, its themes of alienation and belonging feel highly relevant in the current U.S. political climate. The story follows a Latino boy who feels like an outsider and dreams of finding his place among extraterrestrials. The author connects this narrative to the real-world anxieties of Latino communities facing aggressive immigration enforcement. The piece also notes the film's disappointing box office performance, questioning if the climate of fear might be impacting movie attendance among Latino families.</p>

          <p>Detectives in Wales are investigating historical sexual abuse claims against two former members of the Church in Wales clergy, including a recently convicted bishop. The BBC investigation reveals that concerns about one of the men, former Bishop Anthony Pierce, were reported to church officials as early as 1986 but were allegedly ignored. Four individuals have come forward, calling for an independent inquiry into what they describe as a crisis-hit church that allowed abuse to go unchecked.

According to data compiled for the BBC, a week in Cyprus this August is 23% more expensive than last year, while trips to the UAE saw a 26% jump. Travel industry experts attribute the price hikes to higher operational costs for hotels and airlines, including energy, food, and wages. In response, some holidaymakers are opting for shorter trips or mid-week travel to manage costs.</p>
