          <p>Major European airports, including London's Heathrow, are experiencing a second day of significant travel disruptions following a cyberattack. The attack targeted the 'Muse' software from Collins Aerospace, which is used by numerous airlines for check-in and baggage handling, forcing staff to resort to manual processing. While the company is working to resolve the issue, the outage has caused hundreds of delays and cancellations, with airports like Brussels asking airlines to cut half their flights.</p>

          <p>The University of Southern California's football team defeated Michigan State 45-31, maintaining their perfect record at 4-0. Wide receiver Makai Lemon was a standout performer, scoring two touchdowns and accumulating 127 receiving yards, stepping up in the absence of injured teammate Ja’Kobi Lane. Despite the offense gaining over 500 yards, USC's victory was complicated by defensive lapses and 10 penalties, which allowed Michigan State to remain competitive into the fourth quarter. The Trojans now face a more challenging schedule against three consecutive ranked opponents.</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, an elderly British couple detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan since February, have safely returned to the United Kingdom. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived in the country for nearly two decades running a charitable training program. After months of lobbying by their family, who raised concerns about their deteriorating health in detention, they were released and reunited with their daughter in Qatar before flying to London's Heathrow. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the charges.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, has been taken into federal custody in connection with a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. The incident, which occurred Friday afternoon, resulted in at least three bullets striking the building's lobby, though no injuries were reported. Hernandez-Santana was initially arrested by local police, released on $200,000 bail, and then subsequently arrested again by the FBI on a federal charge. The motive for the attack remains under investigation, and the act has been condemned as an attack on democracy and press freedom.</p>

The decision has drawn strong criticism from the Israeli government and families of hostages held by Hamas, who argue it rewards terrorism.

          <p>Top Premier League clubs, including Arsenal and Manchester City, are increasingly incorporating a more direct, long-ball style of play, a tactic once associated with less sophisticated teams. This strategic shift is a response to the effectiveness of modern high-pressing defenses, which make building up play with short passes from the back riskier. This article analyzes how goalkeepers like Arsenal's David Raya and City's use of Erling Haaland as a target man are used to bypass the press, gain territory, and create unpredictable attacking opportunities.

          <p>As several Western nations move to recognize a Palestinian state, analysis questions what this diplomatic gesture will practically achieve amid the ongoing conflict. While supporters view it as an important reaffirmation of Palestinian rights and self-determination, some critics argue it is merely a symbolic or "performative" act without tangible consequences. Recognition could, however, strengthen the Palestinians' diplomatic standing in future negotiations and legally obligate recognizing countries to review their ties with both Palestine and Israel. Experts caution that for the move to be effective, it must be accompanied by concrete actions, such as sanctions or trade measures.</p>

          <h2>California Enacts Law Banning On-Duty Law Enforcement Officers from Wearing Masks</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed the "No Secret Police Act," a new law that prohibits federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings while on duty. The legislation, which takes effect January 1, is primarily aimed at federal immigration enforcement agents who have been seen in masks during operations. The bill also requires officers to be identifiable by name and badge number, a move supporters say is necessary to protect communities from what they describe as a "terror campaign." The law is part of a package of bills designed to curb federal overreach and protect vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent statements expressing a desire for the U.S. to regain control of the Bagram air base in Afghanistan have raised concerns about a new flashpoint in the US-China rivalry. Trump justified the interest by noting the base's proximity to China's nuclear weapons facilities, a remark that drew a swift rebuke from Beijing. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson emphasized respect for Afghanistan's sovereignty and warned against stirring up regional tensions. The Taliban government has also pushed back against the suggestion, adding a layer of complexity to the potential diplomatic and military implications.</p>
