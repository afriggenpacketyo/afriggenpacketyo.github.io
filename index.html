          <p>South East Water has implemented a hosepipe and sprinkler ban affecting over 1.4 million customers across Kent, East Sussex, and West Sussex. This measure comes as demand for drinking water reached unprecedented levels since May, exacerbated by extended periods of warm and dry weather, with June 30th marking the highest usage at 680 million liters. The firm emphasizes the ban is crucial to maintain sufficient drinking water supply for everyone, though some residents are critical, pointing to the company's own leaks. Other major water providers in the UK have also introduced or are planning similar restrictions, highlighting widespread drought concerns after the second driest spring on record for England.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai municipal government has announced significant expansion plans for its shipyards on Changxing Island, located near the Yangshan Deep-Water Port, to bolster China's standing as a top global shipbuilder. This strategic development aims to transform the cluster into a world-class hub for high-end marine equipment manufacturing, with a focus on producing advanced vessels such as LNG carriers and dual-fuel container ships, which are projected to account for 80% of the industrial output. The government estimates this expansion will reach an industrial scale of over 120 billion yuan (US$16.71 billion) within three years. The initiative also seeks to attract at least three leading international institutions, positioning the area as a powerhouse for technological breakthroughs in the maritime sector.</p>

          <h2>European Union Reduces Price Cap on Russian Crude Oil in New Sanctions Round</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 04:26:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has reached an agreement on its 18th sanctions package targeting Russia, notably including a reduction in the price cap for Russian crude oil barrels. This move is designed to further constrict Russia's oil revenues, which form the economic backbone of its military operations, while still ensuring its supplies remain in the global market to prevent shortages. The original price cap, established in December 2022 by the G7 and EU, restricted access to G7 shipping and logistical services for oil purchased above $60 per barrel. Although the specific new cap level was not disclosed, the EU's top diplomat confirmed its inclusion, signaling an intensified effort to impact Russia's banking, energy, and military-industrial sectors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environment Agency has disclosed a alarming 60% surge in serious water pollution incidents caused by water companies in England, with 75 events in 2024 deemed to cause "serious or persistent" harm, marking the highest number on record. Overall pollution incidents reached 2,801, up from 2,174 in the previous year, impacting fisheries, drinking water, and human health. The Public Accounts Committee has condemned these levels as "woeful," attributing them to regulators' failure to ensure companies maintain critical infrastructure, estimating it would take 700 years to replace the entire water mains network at current rates. This concerning data comes just before a major review of the water industry, intensifying calls for immediate action and stricter accountability for major polluters like Thames Water.</p>

          <p>Former UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has defended the decision to maintain a "super-injunction" on a data breach that exposed details of nearly 19,000 Afghans and over 100 British officials. Shapps stated his primary focus was on "saving lives," believing the injunction was necessary to prevent the Taliban from targeting individuals who had assisted the British government. The breach, which occurred in February 2022, led to the covert establishment of the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR) resettlement scheme, costing an estimated £850 million, to relocate affected Afghans without informing them of the security risk. The Ministry of Defence has not disclosed how many individuals in Afghanistan may have been harmed as a result.</p>

Though he struggled with shooting in his first game, Flagg showcased his playmaking and defensive prowess, rebounding impressively with 31 points in his subsequent and final Summer League appearance. Long compared to NBA stars like Kevin Garnett and Jayson Tatum for his two-way skillset and relentless work ethic, Flagg has consistently sought out greater challenges, even reclassifying twice to accelerate his entry into college and then the NBA. His focused and reserved demeanor, coupled with an unwavering commitment to improvement, positions him as one of the most highly anticipated teenage prospects in decades.</p>

This monumental find represents the first confirmed royal tomb at the site, a major political player in Maya history from 560 through 680 AD. The tomb was richly adorned with "priceless" treasures, including 11 pottery vessels, carved bone tubes, a mosaic death mask, and jewelry crafted from jadeite, all coated in cinnabar. These artifacts, dating to 350 A.D., provide invaluable insights into the ancient culture, long-distance trade, and the societal structure of the early Caracol dynasty.</p>

          <p>China's holdings of US Treasury bonds have continued their decline for the third consecutive month, reaching $756.3 billion in April, the lowest point since March 2009. This sustained reduction has positioned China as the third-largest foreign holder of US debt, now trailing behind Japan and the United Kingdom. This financial shift occurs amid ongoing trade tensions and anxieties surrounding the US debt ceiling. Lian Ping, chairman of the China Chief Economists Forum, has cautioned that while direct US financial sanctions against Beijing are unlikely, the financial sector could indeed become a new arena for conflict.

This action, the first under Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government, aligns with a key coalition agreement to increase deportations to Afghanistan, prioritizing criminals and those deemed a threat. The decision has sparked controversy, given the severe human rights situation in Afghanistan and Germany's ongoing, yet unofficial, talks with the Taliban. Critics highlight the risks faced by returnees, despite the German government providing up to €1,000 for initial expenses to ensure legal adherence.

This development closely follows CBS parent company Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump, who alleged deceptive editing of an interview with Kamala Harris.

The Labour Party launched a new investigation into Abbott's recent defense of a 2023 letter where she distinguished between racism based on skin color and "prejudice" experienced by Jewish people, Irish people, and Travellers. Despite apologizing for her initial comments, her reaffirmation of this distinction in a BBC interview led to her latest suspension.

          <p>Tom Lynagh, the son of revered Wallaby legend Michael Lynagh, is poised to make a significant career milestone by starting for Australia against the British and Irish Lions. This achievement comes five years after his pivotal decision, at just 17, to leave England for the Queensland Reds, prioritizing his rugby ambitions down under over potential opportunities with England or Italy. His former director of rugby, Paul Burke, lauded Lynagh's exceptional talent, natural functional movement, and keen ability to read the game, but underscored his character and attitude as his most defining attributes. Despite initial perceptions, Lynagh has consistently demonstrated remarkable toughness and composure, especially in high-stakes matches against formidable opponents.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives narrowly approved President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in federal funding, primarily targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting. The 216-213 vote, which saw only two Republicans oppose the measure, was notably delayed by hours due to internal Republican demands for greater transparency regarding Jeffrey Epstein-related documents, a controversy President Trump has dismissed as a "hoax." This package includes substantial cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS, and approximately $8 billion allocated for foreign assistance programs like USAID. House Speaker Mike Johnson hailed the passage as a step towards "fiscal sanity," and the bill now proceeds to the President's desk for signature, despite Democratic warnings of potential government shutdown.

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced her intention to move the court to unseal Jeffrey Epstein's grand jury transcripts, responding to President Trump's directive amid escalating pressure from his base for more disclosures related to the case. This development follows a Justice Department memo that found no "client list" or credible evidence of blackmail by Epstein, a finding that ignited significant controversy among Trump's supporters. While Bondi's action aims to increase transparency, legal experts emphasize that grand jury records are typically kept secret under federal rules and would only constitute a fraction of the total evidence. Critics, including a Democratic Representative, question whether this limited release will truly satisfy calls for full disclosure, advocating for the release of other crucial documents like witness interviews and recordings.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has formally requested lists of incarcerated undocumented immigrants from Los Angeles County jails, with Sheriff Robert Luna reporting threats of federal charges for non-compliance. Luna stated that his department cannot fulfill this request due to California's sanctuary laws, which legally bar local law enforcement from sharing immigration status information or honoring detainer requests without federal warrants. While 20 warrants have been honored this year, the Trump administration is seeking more extensive data without judicial oversight. Republicans contend that California's sanctuary policies undermine public safety by releasing individuals back into communities, but Luna maintains that his department's ability to operate effectively relies on maintaining public trust, which would be jeopardized by engaging in immigration enforcement.</p>

These accusations emerged following an Observer investigation that suggested Winn's home repossession, a pivotal event in her memoir and its recent film adaptation, was linked to her repaying money she was accused of stealing from her former employer. While Winn has acknowledged making "mistakes" during that period and stated the case was settled on a "non-admissions basis," the Hemmings family disputes her narrative, asserting that the true context behind their financial struggles and Winn's subsequent journey needs to be revealed.</p>

While the truce aims to de-escalate the conflict, concerns persist regarding sectarian tensions, with reports of Druze militiamen launching revenge attacks on Sunni Bedouin communities, leading to displacement. Under the agreement, Druze factions and clerics are now tasked with maintaining internal security in Sweida, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to ensure the demilitarization of southern Syria and the protection of the Druze.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal has reported that President Trump allegedly sent a lewd 50th birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which included a sketch of a naked woman and a suggestive "Donald" signature.

President Trump vehemently denied authorship of the letter, labeling the report as "fake" and threatening legal action against the Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch. The alleged letter was part of an album of birthday greetings compiled by Maxwell, who was convicted for her role in facilitating Epstein's sexual assault of girls.</p>

The report also detailed "chaotic and frightening" induction processes for new prisoners, unsanitary cells, and a pervasive infestation of mice and cockroaches. Compounding these issues, oversight of prisoners under constant supervision was deemed "shockingly poor," a critical concern given the three suicides recorded at the jail in 2025.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has publicly accused foreign spy agencies and "domestic lawbreakers" of colluding in attempts to "steal" rare earths and other critical minerals, labeling these actions as a grave threat to China's national security. The ministry detailed methods such as forging labels and transshipping cargoes to circumvent export restrictions, though no specific countries were named. This stern warning follows China's decision in early April to add several rare earths and related magnets to its export restriction list, a move that has significantly impacted global supply chains essential for electric vehicles, robotics, and defense industries. While recent data suggests a 32% rise in China's rare earth exports in June, potentially indicating some easing of trade flows, the ministry's statement highlights persistent strategic competition over these vital resources.

Digital rights groups warn that these security-justified restrictions are legitimizing further erosion of online freedom in a country where the Kremlin already maintains significant internet censorship.

          <p>Chinese economists are increasingly calling for accelerated pro-market reforms to rectify economic imbalances and mitigate fierce intra-industry competition, spurred by a new report indicating a decline in the country’s marketisation index. The National Economic Research Institute's assessment showed China's overall marketisation level at 5.62 out of 10 in 2023, representing a notable decrease from its 2021 peak and 2019 levels. The most significant deterioration was identified in government-market relations, reflecting a reduced proportion of resources allocated by the market and increased government intervention in enterprises. This downward trend prompts economists to urge immediate action to reverse the course and foster a more robust, market-driven economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>
