          <p>Ma Ying-jeou, former Taiwanese leader and chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT), is scheduled to lead a student delegation to mainland China, despite warnings from Taiwanese authorities who view the trip as inappropriate. The visit, concluding on June 27, includes attending the Straits Forum in Xiamen and a ceremony honoring Fuxi in Gansu. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council has criticized the visit, deeming it inconsistent with Ma's position, while the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) accuses him of aligning with Beijing's agenda. The Straits Forum, described by Beijing as a platform for cross-strait exchanges, is viewed by the DPP as a united front tool. The article underscores the ongoing tensions and differing perspectives between Taiwan and mainland China regarding political engagement and exchanges. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage application volume increased by 12.5% last week, reaching the highest level in over a month, after adjustments for the Memorial Day holiday, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances increased slightly to 6.93%, while refinance applications rose 16% and purchase applications climbed 10% year-over-year. The increase in purchase applications may be attributed to a loosening housing inventory, with supply being approximately 31% higher than the previous year, and home prices starting to ease. Despite economic uncertainty, homebuyers appear to be taking advantage of the increased inventory, but upcoming inflation data and trade talks with China could influence bond markets.

          <p>US Congresswoman LaMonica McIver has been indicted on three counts for allegedly impeding and interfering with federal law enforcement during a visit to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) center in Newark, New Jersey. The indictment replaces previous assault charges and carries a maximum prison term of 17 years, with McIver denying the charges as a political intimidation tactic. The incident occurred during an oversight visit with other members of Congress and the Newark Mayor, which involved a confrontation outside the facility. The indictment alleges that McIver prevented a DHS agent from arresting the mayor, although the trespass case against the mayor was later dropped. </p>

          <p>The article explores the evolving role of friendship in a culture that often prioritizes romantic relationships, examining how friendships can be as significant and intimate as marriage. Historically, friendships were highly valued, with Renaissance-era men living alongside their friends and women expressing passionate affection for each other, but societal norms have shifted, placing romantic partners at the forefront. This hierarchy of connection can lead to feelings of loss when friends enter romantic relationships, and the article suggests reimagining free time to include friends and prioritizing both love and friendship. The piece highlights that close friendships can be better for mental health than romantic relationships, emphasizing the importance of encouraging connections outside of romantic partnerships. </p>

          <p>The article explores the idea of "recession pop," upbeat music from the time of the Great Recession, and whether music can predict economic downturns. Experts suggest that while there was plenty of upbeat music during uncertain times, music of all kinds existed, making the genre a slippery one. The article suggests that the current interest in recession pop may be more about millennials aging out of being cool and asserting their cultural power. The author concludes that recession pop is a made-up term that represents a lot of different kinds of music and was only recently coined. </p>

          <p>Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have banned teaching antisemitism in public schools, citing concerns that it would unfairly target educators and expose them to costly lawsuits. The bill would have prohibited teachers from promoting antisemitism or actions that create a hostile environment, with educators personally responsible for covering damages in lawsuits for violations. Hobbs argued that the bill wasn't about antisemitism but about attacking teachers, setting a dangerous precedent that unfairly targets public school teachers while shielding private school staff. Opponents of the bill argued that it aimed to silence discussion on the oppression of Palestinians and could threaten teachers' ability to provide a full account of the Holocaust. </p>

          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in Europe are experiencing a rebound in 2025, with over 2.2 million electrified vehicles registered from January to April, marking a 20% surge compared to the previous year. While factors such as advances in battery range and expanded charging infrastructure contribute, the primary driver is a January 1 EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions by 15%. Public enthusiasm for EVs, however, isn't growing as fast as policymakers would like, and charging infrastructure remains a critical barrier, while Chinese brands are gaining ground due to heavy state subsidies.
