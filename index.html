          <p>A significant security operation is underway as Donald Trump embarks on a private visit to Scotland, where he played golf at his Turnberry resort. While the day at the resort was uneventful, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to protest his visit, citing his political stances and the cost to taxpayers. The visit also includes planned meetings with UK and Scottish leaders and has prompted discussions about the financial and logistical impact of the security detail. The Scottish government also announced public funding for a golf tournament at another of Trump's courses, drawing criticism.</p>

          <p>A Japanese nutritionist living in the U.S. highlights six 'longevity foods' she found in abundance during a visit to a Costco in Kyoto, Japan. She was impressed by the incredible variety compared to American stores, particularly the wide selection of seaweed, a nutrient-dense staple in Japan. The store also offered an amazing variety of tofu and other soy-based foods, seasonal Japanese produce like enoki mushrooms and mizuna, and healthy ready-to-eat meals. The extensive options for traditional rice crackers and numerous brands of green tea also stood out as items she wishes were more common in U.S. locations.</p>

          <p>At least 42 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza due to Israeli airstrikes and gunfire, according to local hospital officials. The casualties include at least a dozen people who were shot while waiting for aid trucks near the Zikim crossing, though Israel's military stated it only fired warning shots in response to a threat. Other deadly strikes hit a Gaza City apartment building and a tent camp in Khan Younis, killing multiple civilians, including children. These events unfold as ceasefire negotiations have stalled and the United Nations warns of a growing famine in the region.</p>

          <p>Deadly border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia have entered a third day, resulting in at least 33 deaths and the displacement of over 168,000 people.

          <p>An analysis by USAID officials of over 150 incidents found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in Gaza. This finding appears to challenge claims by the Trump administration and Israel, which have been used to justify restrictions on aid and support for a new distribution system. The report, compiled before USAID ceased independent operations, noted that in most cases of lost aid, the perpetrator could not be identified. The State Department and the Israeli military have strongly pushed back against the report's conclusions, citing other evidence of looting and exploitation by Hamas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this analysis, BBC correspondent Jeremy Bowen argues that Israel's offer to allow airdrops of aid into Gaza is an act of desperation that will not solve the growing hunger crisis. Drawing on his experience covering past conflicts, he describes airdrops as a crude and inefficient method that delivers far less aid than truck convoys and poses risks, such as pallets landing in minefields or on shelters. The article contends that with a modern port nearby, airdrops are a last resort used for political appearance rather than effective relief. It concludes that only a sustained ceasefire and an unrestricted, large-scale ground operation can truly address the looming famine.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese voters have rejected a large-scale effort to recall two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature where it currently lacks a majority. The recall campaigns were initiated by critics who accused the KMT of obstructing key legislation and passing reforms that favor China. The outcome means President Lai Ching-te's government will likely continue to face significant legislative resistance, highlighting deep political divisions on the self-ruled island.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's ambitious pronouncements about driverless cars and a robotaxi service, Tesla investors are showing increased concern over the company's immediate financial challenges. Following a recent earnings report that revealed slumping vehicle sales and thinning profits, Tesla's shares fell significantly. Analysts note that the company faces headwinds from rising competition, particularly from China, and the potential loss of regulatory credits. The market's reaction suggests that investors are now prioritizing current profit and loss performance over futuristic promises that have yet to be fully realized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysts Discuss Why the Jeffrey Epstein Controversy Continues to Plague the Trump White House</h2>

          <p>The ongoing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case is consuming the White House, with analysts suggesting President Trump is unable to deflect from the issue. According to one panelist, the scandal resonates deeply with Trump's base because it involves powerful people acting in secret, a theme Trump himself often uses against his opponents. However, in this instance, Trump is perceived as defending the powerful, creating a contradiction that he cannot easily shake. This dynamic has allowed a once-fringe conspiracy theory to evolve into a spiraling political crisis for the administration, paralyzing Washington.</p>

          <p>A US research team has discovered the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals," in some reusable period products. The study found that nearly a third of the tested period underwear, menstrual cups, and reusable pads contained these toxic chemicals, which do not decompose and have been linked to cancer and other health issues. While some products had low levels likely from packaging, others had levels so high that PFAS must have been intentionally used in manufacturing. Researchers are urging consumers to demand PFAS-free products to drive industry change and reduce environmental and health risks.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the attorney general to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, an effort to control the political fallout from the scandal. However, legal experts suggest these transcripts may not reveal the full scope of Epstein's crimes or the involvement of others. They argue that more significant information likely exists in unreleased FBI interview summaries and internal Justice Department memos. While the release of grand jury files is a step, lawyers for victims insist that true transparency requires declassifying the complete investigative files, which could contain far more salacious and incriminating details.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration alters federal student loan repayment options, workplace benefits are becoming an increasingly important source of relief for indebted workers. A key provision in the recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act made the tax-free status of employer contributions (up to $5,250 annually) toward employee student loans a permanent feature. This has encouraged more companies to offer or consider these programs as a tool for attracting and retaining talent. With federal options narrowing and wage garnishments for defaulted loans set to resume, employer assistance is a critical lifeline for many borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

China's "AI plus" plan emphasizes integrating the technology across industries and offering assistance to developing nations in the Global South.

The album marks a departure from his past work, embracing a more subtle, R&B-influenced style with aqueous, muffled production that feels both comforting and complex. The article suggests the album's downtempo, melancholic yet intricate mood resonates with the current cultural moment, which seems to favor reserved, simmering music over overt hedonism. The success of "Swag" fills a void by meeting listeners in a state of emotional fragility and need for stability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) recently avoided a $400 million budget cut, but its future remains precarious. The Trump administration's broader halt on foreign aid has already disrupted clinics and services, and the program's congressional authorization expired in March without renewal. While PEPFAR has saved an estimated 26 million lives since 2003, experts worry about proposed future funding cuts and the cessation of most HIV prevention work under the current administration.

Field trials in the city of Niterói have shown dramatic success, with dengue cases plummeting by roughly 90% after the modified mosquitoes were introduced.
