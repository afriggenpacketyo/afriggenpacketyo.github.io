          <p>Oil prices experienced a 3% decrease following a ceasefire announcement between Israel and Iran, easing concerns about wider regional conflict.  The initial price increase following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites was attributed to concerns about supply disruptions.  However, the ceasefire announcement tempered these concerns, although questions remain about implementation.  The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil shipping route, remains a significant risk.</p>

          <p>Jessica Chaikof, a Ph.D. student with Usher syndrome, worries about funding cuts to research that could help save her eyesight.  The Trump administration's cuts to NIH grants at Harvard, although not directly impacting Usher 1F research yet, are still a concern.  Dr. David Corey, a Harvard scientist researching gene therapies for Usher 1F, is also concerned about the impact of the funding cuts on his work.  Chaikof and her family are hoping for a successful lawsuit challenging the funding freeze.</p>
