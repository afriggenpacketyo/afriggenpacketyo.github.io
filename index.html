          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking damages of at least $787 million. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware, alleges the network made false and damaging statements about a phone call between Newsom and former President Donald Trump. The amount sought mirrors the settlement Fox News paid to Dominion Voting Systems in 2023 for defamation claims related to the 2020 election. Newsom stated he will continue to fight against what he calls the network's "propaganda machine."</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has altered its proposed welfare reform bill after facing a significant rebellion from within the Labour Party. The initial plan aimed to save Â£5 billion annually by tightening the criteria for Personal Independence Payment (Pip), a benefit for individuals with long-term health conditions. Following backlash from about 120 Labour MPs, the stricter rules will now only apply to new claimants. Starmer stated the revised package strikes "the right balance," though some MPs still intend to vote against the proposals.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. pre-emptive strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities have raised concerns among analysts that the action could encourage China and North Korea to accelerate their own nuclear weapons programs. The strikes, intended to set back Iran's enrichment efforts, may set a precedent for adversarial nations to justify similar actions against U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific region. In response to the attack, Iran's parliament voted to suspend all cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, further escalating international tensions and complicating non-proliferation efforts.</p>

Over seven weeks, prosecutors called 34 witnesses, arguing that Combs used his power and resources to run a criminal enterprise that facilitated severe abuse. The defense rested its case quickly without calling any witnesses, instead relying on cross-examinations of the prosecution's witnesses.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has stated he "deeply regrets" using the phrase "an island of strangers" in a May speech about cutting immigration. The remark drew heavy criticism for echoing a line from Enoch Powell's infamous 1968 "Rivers of Blood" speech. In an interview, Starmer claimed he and his speechwriters were unaware of the connection and attributed his state of mind to a recent alleged arson attack on his home. The admission has angered some of his own loyalists, who view it as a sign of weakness.</p>

          <p>A study published in The Lancet Global Health revealed that approximately 17% of cancer drugs circulating in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Cameroon are defective or contain incorrect levels of active ingredients. Researchers tested nearly 200 products from hospitals and pharmacies, finding that many substandard drugs could lead to treatment failure and disease progression. The issue stems from a combination of manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products in poorly regulated markets.

The recent Israeli airstrikes, the article argues, briefly made this invisible city of military and intelligence sites visible to the world.

          <p>Experts are divided on whether buying whole life insurance for children is a sound financial strategy for parents. Proponents argue it locks in low premiums and guarantees future insurability, which is beneficial if a child develops a medical condition later in life. However, critics point out that the statistical need for it is very low and the cash value component often yields poor returns compared to other investment vehicles. Alternatives like 529 college savings plans or brokerage accounts may offer better growth and flexibility for a child's financial future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has dismissed Omead Afshar, the company's vice president of manufacturing and operations, according to reports. Afshar, who reported directly to CEO Elon Musk, oversaw key areas including North American sales and operations in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. His termination follows a period of declining car sales in key markets and a 19% drop in Tesla's stock price this year. The company has also faced reputational challenges linked to Musk's political activities and incendiary rhetoric, contributing to a difficult period for the automaker.</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed imposing international trade restrictions on all 19 species of eel under the CITES treaty, which regulates endangered species. The proposal, which would require export permits for eels, faces strong opposition from Japan, a major consumer. Japan argues its local eel populations are recovering and that such regulations could inadvertently increase poaching by driving up prices. The EU contends that eel populations have declined sharply and need protection, setting up a contentious vote at the upcoming CITES conference.</p>

          <p>Recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids targeting day laborers in Home Depot parking lots are causing a chilling effect on the informal labor market, according to experts. This crackdown, part of the Trump administration's broader immigration policies, is exacerbating an existing construction workforce shortage and could delay projects. Labor experts explain that while the practice of hiring undocumented workers creates a two-tiered system, aggressive enforcement creates uncertainty and labor scarcity, potentially driving up wages and inflation. The situation highlights the complex and often contradictory nature of U.S. immigration and labor policies.</p>

Critics argue that holding people in the remote, harsh environmentâ€”with extreme heat, humidity, and wildlife like alligators and pythonsâ€”is inhumane and environmentally destructive.

The study, published in the journal *Science*, found that a mouse's inability to regenerate ear tissue was due to a failure to produce enough retinoic acid, a key compound derived from vitamin A. By reactivating a dormant gene responsible for this process, the scientists were able to trigger regeneration in the mouse.

          <h2>Kremlin Calls Estonia's Willingness to Host Nuclear-Capable Jets a "Direct Threat"</h2>

          <p>The Kremlin has responded sharply to comments from Estonia's defense minister, stating that the country's readiness to host nuclear-capable NATO jets poses a direct threat to Russia. The statement came after Estonia's Hanno Pevkur said his country was prepared to host allied F-35A stealth jets, even those with dual-use capability, as part of NATO's rotating air policing mission in the Baltics. A Kremlin spokesperson described the move as an "immediate danger" and another example of "absurd thoughts" from Baltic politicians, underscoring the severely strained relations between Russia and the Baltic states.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has formally launched his bid for reelection, positioning himself as a "blue collar" candidate who has delivered results on crime, jobs, and housing. In his announcement, he contrasted his record with that of his chief rival, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, whom he painted as an inexperienced politician with a privileged background. Adams, who switched to run as an independent, is campaigning on his first-term accomplishments while navigating the fallout from a federal corruption probe and criticism of his policies from both the left and right.</p>
