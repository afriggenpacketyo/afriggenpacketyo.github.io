            <p>Despite Vladimir Putin's pledge of a 30-hour "Easter truce," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russian forces continued attacks, with reports of shellings and assaults. Zelensky accused Russia of creating a false impression of a ceasefire while actively engaging in military actions. Ukraine has proposed extending the truce for 30 days, but Zelensky insists that his forces will respond appropriately to the actual situation on the ground, mirroring Russia's actions. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these reports, highlighting the ongoing tension and distrust. Optimism score: 25</p>

            <p>Malaysian durian growers are projected to increase their market share in China this year due to growing consumer demand for fresh, naturally ripened fruit. Durian exports to China have surged due to steady supply and improved logistics.

            <p>The Los Angeles Lakers suffered a significant loss in Game 1 of the 2025 playoffs against the Minnesota Timberwolves, with a final score of 117-95.
