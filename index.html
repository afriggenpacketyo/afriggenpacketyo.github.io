          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared a unilateral three-day ceasefire in Ukraine from May 8-10, coinciding with Russia's World War II Victory Day. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of violating a previous Easter Sunday ceasefire. This declaration comes amid increasing pressure from the Trump administration on both Kyiv and Moscow to reach a peace agreement, with warnings that the U.S. might withdraw from the process if no progress is made. Trump officials have suggested Ukraine may need to cede some territory to end the conflict, while Russia insists on addressing the "root causes" of the war. (not investment advice)</p>

The development of this drone program comes as President Putin ordered a three-day cease-fire in Ukraine next month.</p>

          <p>China is diversifying its agricultural imports by increasing soybean shipments from Brazil, as trade tensions with the US escalate. An estimated 40 ships carrying Brazilian soybeans are expected at Ningbo Zhoushan Port this month, marking a 48% year-on-year increase. This shift follows the cancellation of orders for 12,030 metric tonnes of American pork, the largest cancellation since May 2020. The escalating trade war has resulted in tariffs totaling 145% on Chinese imports by the US, while Beijing's levies on US goods have risen to 125%.</p>

          <p>A national network of neofascist fight clubs is endorsing youth-oriented offshoots aimed at grooming the next generation of racist activists. These "active clubs" combine fitness and mixed martial arts with neo-Nazi and fascist ideologies. Youth clubs are emerging across the US, recruiting teens for mixed martial arts, racist meme sharing, and promotion of bigoted literature. The groups have close to a thousand followers and coordinate recruitment efforts, targeting young men and boys who are enthusiasts of mixed martial arts and the Tate brothers.</p>

          <p>New York City's Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) has revealed a new subway map, the first major overhaul since 1979, aiming to simplify the system's image. The new map uses a more geometric layout, simplifying borough outlines and making subway lines bolder and clearer. The design seeks to offer essential travel information in an easily readable manner, harking back to the 1972 Unimark map. While some dislike the modern look, others appreciate the improved clarity for navigating the subway system.</p>

The plan, known as Schedule F, aims to allow the president to fire employees who do not advance his policy interests. Critics argue that this move will undermine the independence of civil servants and prioritize personal fealty over expertise.
