          <p>Julia Parsons, a U.S. Navy code breaker during World War II and one of the last survivors of a top-secret team that deciphered German U-boat messages, passed away at the age of 104. Parsons's work involved unscrambling messages created by the Enigma machine, providing Allied forces with crucial information for evading and attacking enemy submarines. She joined the WAVES program in 1942 and underwent cryptology training before being assigned to the Naval Communications Annex in Washington. Parsons kept her work secret for decades, even from her family, and only began sharing her story after the Enigma project was declassified in the 1970s. The article highlights her contributions to the war effort and her later life as a storyteller and puzzle enthusiast.</p>

          <p>A judge has found Apple in contempt of court, determining that the company willfully violated a 2021 ruling from the Epic Games case and that an Apple executive lied under oath. The judge accused Apple of anticompetitive behavior by imposing commissions on purchases made through web links inside iPhone apps, and ordered the company to cease these practices immediately. The ruling also stated that Apple withheld documentation about internal discussions regarding compliance with the court order, demonstrating a desire to conceal decision-making processes. The judge ordered Apple to pay Epic Games' attorney fees related to the specific issue, and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney celebrated the decision as a victory against Apple's "junk fees."</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized a natural resources agreement aimed at aiding Ukraine's reconstruction efforts following the Russian invasion. This deal, a prerequisite set by President Trump for future security guarantees to Kyiv, involves creating a joint investment fund to explore and develop Ukraine's mineral resources. The agreement aims to signal to Russia the U.S. commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine, ensuring that no entity involved in supporting Russia's war efforts will benefit from Ukraine's reconstruction. The US Treasury Secretary stated that the deal would help unlock Ukraine's growth assets, and the Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister confirmed that the fund created by the agreement would attract global investment into their country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Ukraine have signed an economic investment deal granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare earth minerals.

The U.S. will contribute through financial input or military assistance, while Ukraine will contribute 50% of royalties from future licenses. Ukraine retains ownership of its natural resources, and profits will be reinvested in the Ukrainian economy for the first decade. The joint fund will make strategic investments in critical minerals and related infrastructure, diversifying and securing U.S. supply chains, and President Trump has framed the mineral deal as a way of paying the U.S. back for aiding the Ukrainian military.</p>

          <p>President Trump acknowledged that Americans might experience some economic hardship due to the ongoing trade war with China.

He asserted that many goods imported from China are unnecessary for Americans and reiterated his commitment to securing a fair trade deal, accusing China of being the "chief-ripper-offer" in global trade relations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade policies are creating both challenges and opportunities for different sectors of the American economy. Soybean farmers in Wisconsin are facing growing anxiety due to tariffs, as China was a major purchaser of their product. However, shrimpers in South Carolina see potential benefits from the tariffs, as they struggle to compete with lower-priced imports. Major retailers are warning that continued tariffs could lead to empty store shelves, and farmers remain cautiously realistic about the future impact. Despite the uncertainty, they maintain resilience and hope for a resolution.</p>

          <p>An effort in the Senate to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs failed due to Republican opposition, highlighting divisions over the tariffs' economic impact. The resolution, led by Senators Wyden and Paul, aimed to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs. While some Republicans joined Democrats in support, the measure fell short of the majority needed. The vote came after Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on most U.S. trading partners, with a 90-day pause for some countries. Despite the vote, anxieties remain high regarding the tariffs' potential economic consequences, with concerns over small businesses and overall economic growth.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Second Term: A Global Perspective on Trade Wars, Expansionist Intent, and Deferred Deals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's second term has been marked by a renewed "America First" policy, sparking trade wars, expansionist ambitions, and stalled diplomatic efforts. Trade disputes have intensified, with tariffs used as leverage to coerce foreign governments, while ambitions extend to territories like the Panama Canal and Greenland. Despite initial promises, conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war remain unresolved, with U.S. mediation efforts faltering. The administration has also undertaken significant cuts to diplomatic structures, shifting focus to deportation goals and border security, leading to concerns about the erosion of European trust in America.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have announced the creation of a new reconstruction and investment fund, formalizing an economic agreement intended to give the U.S. access to proceeds from Ukraine’s reserves of rare earth minerals. This agreement aims to provide Ukraine with an implicit security arrangement and addresses President Trump's concerns about the U.S. providing Kyiv with a blank check. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the Trump administration's commitment to a long-term peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine. The deal concludes months of negotiations and is intended to provide Ukraine with ongoing economic and military support.</p>

          <p>Qualcomm reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by robust chip sales growth. However, the company's share price declined in extended trading due to a revenue forecast for the current quarter that was slightly below expectations. The company's most important business is selling chips for smartphones, including high-end devices made by Samsung and Apple. Growth in automotive and Internet of Things categories signals how well the company is diversifying away from its core handset business, which expects to lose Apple as a customer in the coming years.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's vow for a large deportation operation to Mexico, numbers remain lower than under the previous administration. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum reports 33,311 deportations since Trump took office, significantly less than the 52,253 under Biden during the same period last year. The drop is attributed to decreased illegal border crossings and a focus on deporting migrants already inside the U.S., a more complex process. Mexico is also accepting third-party deportees for humanitarian reasons, but the legal status of these migrants remains unclear, leaving them vulnerable.</p>

          <p>On the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, Vietnam veterans reflect on the enduring impact of the war on American culture, politics, and their own lives. Many veterans express sadness, anger, and a sense of futility, drawing parallels between the chaotic withdrawal from Saigon and recent events in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Ukraine. They worry that the lessons learned from Vietnam, particularly regarding the limits of military intervention and the importance of understanding local contexts, have been forgotten. Despite the passage of time, the war continues to resonate, shaping perspectives on trust, government, and the use of military force.</p>

The team's strategy of collecting a large number of pitchers to maximize their chances of having five healthy starters for the postseason is well-established. However, the Dodgers, with the oldest group of position players in the majors, are now considering implementing load management strategies similar to those used in the NBA to ensure their key players are rested for the playoffs.
