          <p>A former Department of Justice employee, Sean Charles Dunn, has been charged with misdemeanor assault for allegedly throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors were unable to secure a felony indictment from a grand jury, a rare occurrence for the DOJ. The incident took place amid a deployment of federal authorities by President Trump to address what he described as a crime problem in the capital. Dunn was terminated from his position at the DOJ following his arrest for the August 10 incident.</p>

          <p>Officials in Minneapolis report that the individual who attacked a church school, killing two children and injuring 18 others, was driven by a desire to kill children rather than a specific motive. The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, used three legally purchased firearms to shoot through the church windows during a service. The victims have been identified as eight-year-old Fletcher Merkel and ten-year-old Harper Moyski, whose families have released statements mourning their loss. The attacker, a former student at the school, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene.</p>

          <p>During the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, older middle school students are being praised for their heroic actions in protecting younger children. According to officials and parents, a school 'buddy system' that pairs older students with younger ones for events like Mass proved crucial. When the attack began, middle schoolers reportedly pushed their younger buddies under the pews and shielded them, resulting in many of the older children sustaining injuries. These selfless acts are credited with saving lives and preventing an even greater tragedy during the horrific event.</p>

          <p>George Clooney's latest film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival to varied but strong reviews, with some critics hailing it as a masterpiece. In the movie, directed by Noah Baumbach, Clooney portrays an aging, successful movie star grappling with his life choices and legacy, a role that draws parallels to his own public persona. The film explores themes of identity and the gap between public presentation and private self, co-starring Adam Sandler, Laura Dern, and Billy Crudup. Clooney's nuanced performance is already generating awards season buzz in a competitive year for the best actor category.</p>

          <p>Automotive research firm Edmunds advises that this Labor Day presents a significant opportunity for consumers to find deals on electric vehicle leases. A $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV leases and a $4,000 credit for used EVs are set to expire on September 30, creating an incentive for dealers to offer promotions. Leasing has become the dominant method for acquiring EVs, accounting for 70% of transactions in July, as it allows consumers to try the technology without committing to a purchase amid rapid advancements and depreciation concerns.

          <p>World number one and defending US Open champion Jannik Sinner secured his place in the third round with a decisive victory over Alexei Popyrin. Sinner won in straight sets, 6-3 6-2 6-2, marking his 23rd consecutive win in a hard-court Grand Slam match. Despite the clinical performance, the Italian player expressed a desire to improve his first serve, which he felt was not at its best during the match. He will next face Canadian Denis Shapovalov as he continues his campaign for a third major title of the year.</p>

As President Trump dismissed most members of this panel upon taking office and has not named replacements, Lake cannot proceed with the termination.

The piece argues that both figures exhibit a childlike need for adoration, react with rage when contradicted, and claim unlimited power, citing Trump's statement, "I have the right to do anything I want to do." The author suggests that while Homelander is a supervillain, Trump is a politician constrained by the Constitution, courts, and ultimately, voters.

As the article argues, this environmental challenge cannot be solved in isolation, as it is intrinsically linked to global demand for palm oil. China, as a major importer, has a significant opportunity to influence this issue by promoting sustainable practices and rewriting the future of Indonesian palm oil. By leveraging its market power, China can help shift the industry away from a model where economic prosperity is achieved at the cost of environmental destruction.</p>

          <p>In a major NFL trade, the Dallas Cowboys have sent star edge rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers following a prolonged and public contract dispute. In exchange for the three-time All-Pro, Dallas will receive two first-round draft picks and veteran defensive tackle Kenny Clark. Parsons has reportedly agreed to a four-year, $188 million contract with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history. The move concludes a contentious period where Cowboys owner Jerry Jones refused to negotiate with Parsons' agent, leading the player to formally request a trade.</p>

          <p>Shares of Gap Inc. fell after the apparel retailer reported second-quarter sales that missed analyst expectations and warned that tariffs will negatively affect its future profits. The company increased its estimated cost of tariffs for the year and lowered its full-year operating margin forecast. While the Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy brands saw sales growth, the company's overall performance was dragged down by a 9% decline in comparable sales at its Athleta brand. The company is now focused on resetting Athleta's strategy to reconnect with its core customers. (not investment advice)</p>

Primus stated he discovered his termination after his work phone was locked upon returning from an Amtrak event. The White House said Primus "did not align with the President's America First agenda," while rail worker unions condemned the move, suggesting it was timed to influence the STB's review of a major freight rail merger that Primus had indicated he opposed.

          <p>A federal judge has scheduled a Friday hearing to consider Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request to block President Trump from firing her. Cook filed a lawsuit challenging the president's unprecedented attempt to remove her, arguing the stated reason of alleged mortgage fraud is a pretext to undermine the Fed's independence. The Federal Reserve Act states a governor can only be removed "for cause," a standard Cook's lawyers argue has not been met. The case, which could ultimately reach the Supreme Court, tests the limits of presidential power over the nation's central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece asserts that the modern administrative state, with its "independent" agencies, is at odds with the founders' vision and that Supreme Court precedent is trending towards restoring presidential removal power.

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's political pressure on the Federal Reserve is concerning, the greater threat to its independence is the nation's growing public debt. The author explains the concept of "fiscal dominance," where a central bank's monetary policy becomes subordinate to the government's need to finance its debt. As interest payments on the national debt consume a larger portion of the federal budget, the pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates low will intensify, regardless of who is president. Without congressional action to address spending and debt, the Fed's ability to fight inflation will be compromised. (not investment advice)</p>
