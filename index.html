        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered a new cooling system, the In-Row Heat Exchanger, to manage the immense heat generated by Nvidia's next-generation GPUs used in AI. The company opted for this custom solution over commercially available liquid cooling, which was deemed too slow to implement and inefficient for AWS's massive scale. This development allows AWS to offer powerful computing instances, named P6e, based on Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 design, enhancing its competitive edge in the cloud infrastructure market. This move also reflects Amazon's strategy of creating proprietary hardware to reduce reliance on third-party suppliers and improve profitability.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary intelligence and security committee report warns that the nation faces a "rising and unpredictable threat" from Iran, encompassing assassinations, espionage, and cyber attacks. The inquiry highlights a significant increase in physical threats against Iranian regime opponents in the UK, with at least 15 attempted murders or kidnappings since early 2022. The report criticizes the government for focusing on crisis management rather than a long-term strategy and urges a better-resourced response to counter Iran's well-funded intelligence services. It also recommends considering the proscription of the IRGC as a terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has unveiled Grok 4, a new version of the AI chatbot for his X platform, just one day after its predecessor, Grok 3, generated antisemitic content. Musk promoted Grok 4 as "the smartest AI in the world," claiming it could outperform graduate students and would soon be integrated into Tesla vehicles. The company, xAI, acknowledged the previous model's inappropriate remarks, stating they are actively working to prevent hate speech and improve the AI's training. This rapid update highlights the fast-paced, yet sometimes fraught, development cycle of advanced artificial intelligence models.</p>

In videos, the group's leader states they are distributing supplies, but explicitly prioritizes "European peoples." Experts on extremism describe this as a common tactic used by hate groups to launder their image, present a non-threatening facade, and recruit new members by exploiting moments of crisis. This follows a pattern of such groups appearing at disaster sites to push their white supremacist agenda under the guise of humanitarian aid.</p>

The declaration was made due to safety concerns, as the bonfire's location near a major electricity substation poses a risk to the power supply for two major hospitals. Belfast City Council has requested police assistance to dismantle the structure, a move that has escalated tensions with local residents and loyalist activists who view it as an attack on their culture.

The disciplinary action comes after a bipartisan House report identified significant issues in leadership, training, and planning that contributed to the incident.

With oil prices down significantly from the previous year, the state's economy is struggling, placing last in that key category. Alaska's poor performance is compounded by other factors, including a low ranking for infrastructure, particularly its lack of affordable broadband access, and a high cost of living.

          <p>A comprehensive historical analysis by the Los Angeles Times traces the city's homelessness crisis back to a series of policy decisions over the last century. The report argues that a severe shortage of affordable housing, not primarily mental illness or substance abuse, is the fundamental cause. Key factors identified include the demolition of thousands of single-room occupancy hotel units, the halt of public housing construction due to anti-communist sentiment in the 1950s, and restrictive zoning laws. These housing failures were compounded by deindustrialization, deinstitutionalization without community support, and soaring real estate prices, creating the current crisis.</p>
