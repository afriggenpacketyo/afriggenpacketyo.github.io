        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coroner has concluded that former England cricketer Graham Thorpe died by suicide, citing shortcomings in the mental health care he received in the months leading up to his death. The court heard that despite his wife reporting he was asking for help to end his life, he was not deemed to be in a crisis situation by healthcare professionals. The coroner noted that while there were failures in care, such as a lack of in-person appointments, it could not be determined if a different approach would have changed the outcome. His family is now working to raise awareness and reduce stigma around mental health issues.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock experienced a significant 9% drop following announcements of major cost-cutting measures and project cancellations within its struggling chip manufacturing division. The company revealed it is axing facility projects in Germany and Poland and may discontinue its foundry business entirely if it fails to secure a major customer for its next-generation technology. This news overshadowed a better-than-expected earnings report, as investors remain concerned about the company's inability to gain traction in the AI market and the uncertainty surrounding its manufacturing strategy. The company's net loss widened, and it plans to reduce its workforce by 15%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Former Alabama Coach Nick Saban Endorses Trump's Executive Order on College Athlete Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 12:21:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Alabama head football coach Nick Saban has publicly praised President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at regulating payments to college athletes. The order seeks to crack down on "pay-to-play" schemes while preserving the educational model of college sports, a distinction Saban strongly supports. He explained that the new system, including a clearinghouse, is designed to authenticate legitimate name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals and prevent collectives from creating a competitive imbalance. Saban believes this is a crucial step to protect non-revenue sports that depend on the income generated by football and basketball.</p>

          <p>A massive heat dome is creating dangerous weather conditions for more than 100 million people across the United States as it moves eastward. Heat advisories are in effect along the northeastern coast, with heat index values feeling 10 to 15 degrees above average, while the most persistent and hazardous heat is expected in the southeast. The National Weather Service warns that high humidity and warm overnight temperatures will increase the risk of heat-related illnesses and death, especially for vulnerable populations. The article explains that this phenomenon traps hot air over a region, with climate change making such events more intense.</p>

          <p>A travel essay in The Atlantic explores the subtle but significant influence of the Greek island of Corfu on John le Carré's masterpiece, "A Perfect Spy." Although Corfu only appears briefly in the novel, the author argues it is a key location for understanding the book's themes of identity, influence, and betrayal. The article reveals that a real-life encounter in Corfu with a former associate of his con-artist father provided le Carré with a pivotal insight into his own past, which he then wove into the novel's narrative. This connection highlights how a writer's personal journey in a specific place can profoundly shape their creative work.</p>

CCTV footage showed the assailants smiling during the assault on the cornered victim, who had no time to defend himself.

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar is set to secure his fourth Tour de France victory after successfully defending his substantial lead in the final mountain stage of the race.

With only two flatter stages remaining before the traditional finish in Paris, Pogačar's triumph is all but confirmed. The stage was shortened due to external factors, but still featured two extremely challenging climbs, testing the riders' endurance.</p>

Her boyfriend, who was driving the bike, was seriously injured and later had his leg amputated. The judge noted that while Muldoon did not intend to cause harm, his actions were a dangerous maneuver to frighten the victims, leading to a tragic and devastating outcome for the family.</p>

While the U.S. has recently outlined agreements with several other nations, including Japan, the outcome with the EU remains unresolved.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's five-day trip to Scotland, primarily focused on visiting his personal golf resorts, represents a significant exploitation of the presidency for private business interests at taxpayer expense. The author contends that the visit, which includes dedicating a new golf course named after his mother, lacks substantial diplomatic purpose and has been deliberately shrouded in secrecy to avoid criticism. The article highlights a pattern of behavior, citing watchdog reports on the high cost of Trump's frequent visits to his properties and the broader issue of presidential profiteering.

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed course on police accountability by ending federal investigations and consent decrees for several major police departments, including in Louisville, Kentucky. These agreements were designed to enforce reforms in departments with a history of misconduct, such as the Louisville police, which came under scrutiny after the killing of Breonna Taylor. The Department of Justice stated it was ending a "failed experiment," a move that community activists call a significant setback for civil rights and police reform.

The case has drawn attention to the deteriorating conditions of the decade-old facility, which recently secured $15 million in emergency state funding for upgrades.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to Scotland is being overshadowed by ongoing revelations about his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. New reports indicate Trump's name appeared on a contributor list for a book celebrating Epstein's 50th birthday, deepening the controversy. The president has denied contributing a lewd sketch and note, suing The Wall Street Journal for its reporting. Amid the backlash, Trump was asked about potential clemency for Epstein's convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, stating he had not thought about it. The continued drip of evidence linking the two men has thwarted the administration's efforts to downplay their past association.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has confirmed he is launching a new political party aimed at challenging the "rich and powerful." The yet-unnamed party plans to contest local elections in May before participating in the next general election. Polling suggests the new entity could capture around 10% of the vote, potentially drawing support from Labour and, most significantly, the Green Party. The move could fragment the left-wing vote, creating a complex political landscape where electoral pacts between Corbyn's party and the Greens might become crucial to avoid splitting their support base and inadvertently benefiting right-wing parties.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that while disruption is inevitable, efforts are being made to minimize it and keep as many non-urgent services running as possible. The British Medical Association (BMA) has warned of staff being stretched thin but has begun agreeing to requests for doctors to leave picket lines to work in hospitals under extreme pressure.

          <p>Wharton professor Ethan Mollick suggests that while artificial intelligence is not yet ready to fully replace human jobs, it will pose a significant challenge for the entry-level workforce. In an interview, he explains that the primary difficulty will be developing expertise, as AI can now perform many of the repetitive tasks through which apprentices traditionally learn. Mollick advises that workers should seek out "bundled" jobs with diverse responsibilities, as these are more resilient to automation. He also emphasizes that organizational leaders must articulate a clear vision for AI integration rather than leaving employees to figure it out on their own.</p>

Total sales are now down 44% from their 2022 peak, a divergence from soaring stock markets and overall wealth, which historically correlate with art prices. Experts speculate this could be a temporary dip or a more fundamental shift as wealth transfers from baby boomer collectors to younger, more digitally-focused generations. In response, auction houses are adapting by focusing on online sales and luxury goods like jewelry and watches, which have seen growth. (not investment advice)</p>
