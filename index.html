          <p>A study on the Galleri blood test indicates it could significantly advance early cancer diagnosis. The test successfully identified over 50 types of cancer, many of which lack existing screening programs, by detecting cancerous DNA fragments in the blood. In a trial involving 25,000 adults, the test detected cancer in nearly one in 100 participants, with over half found at an early, more treatable stage. While promising, researchers note that more data is needed from ongoing NHS trials to confirm if it reduces cancer mortality rates.</p>

          <p>Republican governors in states like Texas and Virginia have activated National Guard troops ahead of nationwide "No Kings" protests against former President Donald Trump. Organizers anticipate gatherings at thousands of locations, building on a previous protest that drew millions. The demonstrations aim to challenge what organizers call Trump's "authoritarianism," while some Republican allies have labeled them "Hate America" rallies. The mobilization of troops has drawn criticism from Democrats, who argue it suppresses peaceful protest.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has commuted the prison sentence of ex-congressman George Santos, leading to his immediate release. Santos had served less than three months of a seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. In his announcement, Trump cited Santos's loyalty and alleged mistreatment in prison, a move praised by some allies but sharply criticized by both Democrats and several New York Republicans. The commutation nullified any further fines, restitution, or supervised release for Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has confirmed that remains recently returned from Gaza are those of Eliyahu Margalit, a 75-year-old hostage killed during the October 7th attack. His body was taken from the Nir Oz kibbutz, and his death had been announced in December 2023. This marks the tenth deceased hostage to be repatriated, though the remains of 18 others are still in Gaza, causing significant distress in Israel. The return was part of a ceasefire deal, but disputes remain between Israel and Hamas over the process of locating and returning all bodies.</p>

          <p>Cranberry farmers in Massachusetts are facing increasing economic pressure due to high labor, utility, and real estate costs, making it difficult to compete with larger-scale operations in other regions. In response, some farmers are participating in a state-run program that compensates them for retiring older, less productive bogs and restoring them to their natural wetland state. This "green exit strategy" allows farmers to invest in more profitable land while contributing to ecological restoration. The program aims to restore 1,000 acres of former cranberry bogs over the next decade.</p>

          <p>At least 15 people were arrested during heated confrontations between protesters and Illinois state police outside the Broadview ICE detention center near Chicago. Tensions escalated when demonstrators moved from designated protest zones and officers, equipped with helmets and batons, acted to clear a roadway. The clashes are the latest in a series of tense demonstrations at the facility, where federal agents have previously used chemical irritants on crowds. The incident occurred just a day after a court ordered federal agents in Illinois to wear body cameras during immigration operations.</p>

          <p>The popular Chinese television drama "Silent Honour" has inspired a wave of public appreciation for real-life communist intelligence agents from the country's civil war era. Following the show's success, there has been a significant increase in visitors to a memorial square in Beijing, where many have laid flowers and left thank-you notes at the tomb of Wu Zhongfang. Wu was an underground party member who served as a high-ranking official in the rival Kuomintang's Ministry of National Defence.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 21:29:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, former President Donald Trump declined to authorize the immediate transfer of Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv, a move Ukraine believes is crucial for ending the war with Russia. The decision came after Trump received a surprise call from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who warned against the transfer and proposed another summit. While Trump has celebrated his role in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza, he has not applied similar pressure on Russia. Zelensky publicly maintained a positive outlook, stating the dialogue on the missiles is not over.</p>
