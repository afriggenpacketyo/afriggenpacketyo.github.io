          <p>As Ukraine celebrated its Independence Day, Russian officials accused Kyiv of launching drone attacks that caused a fire at the Kursk nuclear power plant and targeted other energy facilities. While the fire was extinguished with no reported casualties and normal radiation levels, the event prompted concern from the International Atomic Energy Agency. The attacks coincided with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's defiant holiday address, where he vowed to continue fighting for a just peace. Meanwhile, Ukraine received pledges of continued military and financial support from international allies, including Canada, the UK, and Norway, underscoring ongoing Western solidarity.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $750 million for the upcoming Monday drawing after no ticket matched all six numbers on Saturday night. This prize now stands as the tenth-largest in the lottery's history, with a cash value of approximately $338.6 million. While there was no grand prize winner, several tickets won substantial secondary prizes, including three tickets that matched five numbers for $1 million each, with one winner doubling their prize to $2 million by using the Power Play option. The drawing marks the 37th consecutive round without a jackpot winner since a ticket in California claimed a prize in May.</p>

          <p>The White House has released a list criticizing specific artworks and programs at Smithsonian institutions for focusing on themes of race, slavery, and sexuality, prompting a review to align the museums with the administration's cultural directives. The move has drawn sharp responses from the targeted artists and scholars, some of whom view the criticism as a "badge of honor" while others express deep concern about a chilling effect on artistic expression and potential censorship. Artists like Rigoberto Gonzalez and scholars like Ibram X. Kendi state their work aims to depict reality and deconstruct racism, not promote a political agenda, drawing parallels to historical attempts to suppress art and ideas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent actions by President Trump, such as proposing to eliminate mail-in voting after a suggestion from Vladimir Putin, highlight a pattern of blurring the lines between domestic grievances and foreign policy. Critics argue that his decisions are consistently viewed through the prism of personal self-interest rather than a coherent ideology or national interest. This approach is evident in his interactions with foreign leaders, where he often brings up domestic political rivals and personal obsessions, breaking from traditional presidential decorum. This conflation of personal validation with national policy creates a unique vulnerability to manipulation by foreign adversaries and complicates diplomatic relations.</p>

          <p>The animated Netflix movie 'KPop Demon Hunters' has transcended the streaming platform to become a cultural phenomenon, with nearly 1,800 theaters across the country hosting sold-out singalong screenings this past weekend. The film, about a fictional all-girl rock band fighting evil spirits, has captivated audiences and is on track to be Netflix's most-watched movie ever. This unusual leap from streaming to a theatrical event is seen as both a gift to its massive fanbase and a strategic promotional move.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un personally supervised the test-firing of two newly developed missile types designed to counter aerial threats like drones and cruise missiles, according to state media. The launches occurred as the United States and South Korea were conducting their annual 'Ulchi Freedom Shield' joint military drills, which Pyongyang condemned as reckless and destabilizing to the region. A North Korean military official described the exercises as pushing the Korean Peninsula toward "extreme tension." This latest weapons test continues a pattern of provocative military actions from North Korea in direct response to allied defensive training exercises.</p>

          <p>Amid shifting geopolitical dynamics, there is a critical opportunity for China and India to reset their bilateral relations, but it requires Beijing to view New Delhi as a partner rather than solely a rival. Recent high-level diplomatic engagements and moves to restart direct air services signal a potential thaw in relations, which have been strained since the 2020 border clashes. The article suggests that President Trump's tariff policies against India may be encouraging New Delhi to pivot towards Beijing. For a constructive long-term collaboration, China must recognize India's strategic autonomy and its goal of balancing ties with all major powers to serve its own national interests.</p>

          <p>In a significant and newly public display of military cooperation, over 500 Taiwanese soldiers participated in this year's 'Northern Strike' drills in Michigan, the largest contingent ever sent by Taiwan. The revelation, reported by a Pentagon-linked newspaper, marks a departure from the previous policy of ambiguity regarding Taiwan's involvement in US-led exercises. This development is widely interpreted as a sign of deepening defense ties between Washington and Taipei. It underscores a commitment to enhancing Taiwan's defense capabilities and interoperability with US forces, despite the often transactional nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Several bands, including The Last Dinner Party, have pulled out of the Victorious music festival in Portsmouth in protest after an Irish folk band, The Mary Wallopers, claimed their set was cut short for displaying a Palestinian flag.

They acknowledged that the sound was cut and that their handling of the situation was insensitive. In response to the boycott and backlash, the festival has pledged to make a substantial donation to humanitarian relief efforts for the Palestinian people.</p>

          <p>The government in England and Wales is planning a significant overhaul of sentencing rules that would empower courts to impose a wider range of restrictions as part of community sentences. Under the proposed reforms, offenders could be barred from pubs, concerts, and sporting events, or face driving and travel bans, even if the restrictions are unrelated to their specific crime. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the changes are intended to toughen up community punishments and restrict criminals' freedom. The move is part of a broader strategy to manage severely overcrowded prisons, though hospitality industry leaders have raised concerns about the practicalities of enforcement.</p>

The project, approved by parliament in 2019, is expected to receive funding in the 2026 federal budget, allowing a design competition to launch. Victims' associations have described the memorial as "long overdue," emphasizing the need to remember the systematic persecution and suppression under the regime, which saw hundreds killed trying to flee and thousands imprisoned for political reasons.

Others, like Simon Johnson, have condemned American isolationism as a "self-defeating foolish action."

          <p>In a significant cultural heritage collaboration, a team from the Shanghai Museum will lead a joint archaeological excavation at the ruins of the Sekhmet Temple in Egypt. This project marks a milestone in cultural cooperation between the two nations. The temple is located within the ancient Memphis archaeological site, which dates back over 5,100 years and was once the capital of ancient Egypt. The Chinese team selected this particular site after surveying multiple locations in Egypt last year, signaling a deepening of scientific and cultural ties through the shared exploration of ancient history.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 US Open begins, the central question in the men's draw is whether anyone can break the Grand Slam dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, who have won the last seven majors between them. With the top two seeds on opposite sides of the draw, contenders like Novak Djokovic and Alexander Zverev face the likely prospect of having to beat both to claim the title. In the women's singles, world number one Iga Swiatek and American star Coco Gauff are among the top contenders, while defending champion Aryna Sabalenka looks to overcome recent inconsistent form to become the first woman to win back-to-back titles in New York since 2014.</p>

          <p>In Estonia, citizens are actively preparing for a potential Russian invasion by joining volunteer defense organizations and participating in military and first-aid training. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, membership in groups like the Women's Voluntary Defense Organization has surged, reflecting a deep-rooted culture of self-defense. While a direct military assault is not seen as imminent due to Estonia's NATO membership and superior Western technology, concerns are high over Russia's hybrid warfare tactics. These include repeated acts of sabotage like damaging undersea cables and jamming GPS signals, which have already disrupted air and sea traffic in the Baltic region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising concerns over Russian aggression and doubts about US security guarantees, tens of thousands of French citizens are applying to join the military reserves. The number of operational reservists has soared in the past decade, and the government aims to more than double the current number to 105,000 by 2035. This surge in volunteerism aligns with President Emmanuel Macron's plan to significantly boost military investment. For many new recruits, the war in Ukraine served as a wake-up call, motivating them to serve their country part-time and contribute to national defense in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical climate.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Envoy Dismisses Security Concerns Over Farmland Ownership in the US</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, has firmly rejected claims that Chinese ownership of American farmland constitutes a national security threat, labeling such assertions as "completely unfounded." Speaking at a soybean industry event, Xie stated that Chinese investors own less than 0.03 percent of total U.S. farmland, an amount too small to threaten food security. He characterized legislative efforts in some states to restrict such purchases as political manipulation that uses national security as a pretext. The ambassador argued that these moves are intended to undermine China-U.S. agricultural cooperation for narrow political agendas.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Chargers' final preseason game, a 30-23 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, several players on the roster bubble made their case ahead of Tuesday's cutdown deadline. Undrafted linebacker Marlowe Wax delivered a standout performance with multiple impactful plays, including a strip-sack, potentially securing a spot on the 53-man roster. Conversely, the game was marked by sloppy play, including too many penalties and turnovers from the backup units. Quarterback Trey Lance's performance was steady but not spectacular, while rookie DJ Uiagalelei showed flashes of talent mixed with costly mistakes, including a pick-six interception.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has condemned President Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as an "abuse of power," stating there is no emergency to justify such an action. The governor accused the president of attempting to "manufacture a crisis" in a Democrat-controlled city. This move follows a similar deployment of about 2,000 troops to Washington D.C. as part of a proclaimed crackdown on urban crime. Chicago's mayor also expressed "grave concerns," calling the potential deployment "uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound," and warning it could inflame local tensions rather than reduce crime.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma mother and stepfather have been charged with felony child neglect after their 11-year-old daughter gave birth to a full-term baby at home without any medical supervision or prenatal care. The couple, Dustin and Cherie Walker, told authorities they were unaware the child was pregnant. Prosecutors were alerted to the case after the girl was taken to a hospital following the birth. Investigators noted the child had not seen a doctor in over a year. Authorities are awaiting paternity test results to identify the baby's father and anticipate filing additional charges in this deeply disturbing case.</p>
