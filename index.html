          <p>During a government shutdown, the Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago transit projects, the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought stated the hold is to ensure the funds are not used for race-based contracting, a reason also cited for freezing funds for projects in New York. This move is part of a series of funding freezes and cancellations targeting projects in states and cities led by Democrats, raising concerns about the politicization of infrastructure development.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is set to sentence Sean "Diddy" Combs following his conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, while he was acquitted of more severe racketeering and sex trafficking charges. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 11 years, citing a history of violent behavior, whereas Combs' defense is arguing for a 14-month term, emphasizing his remorse and contributions. The hearing will include statements from Combs himself and a victim, as the judge weighs arguments from both sides to determine the music mogul's fate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the deep-rooted cumbia subculture in Monterrey, Mexico, a city where the Colombian music genre was adopted and transformed by migrant communities. It details the rise of "sonideros" (DJs) and the accidental creation of "cumbia rebajada," a slower tempo style that defined the local scene and the "cholombiano" youth culture. The narrative also touches upon how the scene was driven underground by cartel violence before re-emerging, highlighting cumbia's resilience as a powerful form of cultural identity for the city's working-class neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>Deonte' Nash, a former stylist for Sean "Diddy" Combs, has filed a lawsuit accusing the music mogul of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse over a nearly decade-long period. Nash claims the lawsuit is not about financial gain but about seeking personal justice and "making myself feel whole" after enduring traumatic experiences, including an alleged choking incident. Combs' legal team has dismissed the allegations as opportunistic falsehoods, setting the stage for another legal battle for the producer, who was recently convicted on separate prostitution-related charges.</p>

          <p>Apple has removed the ICEBlock app, which used crowdsourced user reports to track the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, from its App Store, citing "objectionable content." The app, which had surpassed one million downloads, was designed to help migrants avoid arrest amid increased deportation activities by the Trump administration. The removal follows concerns from officials, including ICE's deputy director, who argued that such apps pose a danger to agents and could impede law enforcement operations.</p>

This development was further supported by advanced DNA analysis linking a Y-STR profile from the crime scene to Brashers, who had been identified in other cold cases.

          <p>The Supreme Court begins its new term with a docket of high-stakes cases involving social issues and challenges to President Trump's executive actions. The justices will hear arguments on state bans on "conversion therapy" for minors, the use of race in congressional redistricting, and laws prohibiting transgender athletes from competing in girls' sports. Also looming are significant cases concerning the legality of Trump's sweeping tariffs and his authority to fire officials at independent federal agencies, setting the stage for a term that will heavily feature disputes over executive power.</p>

          <p>The individual responsible for the deadly attack outside a Manchester synagogue has been identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old British citizen of Syrian descent who lived in the Prestwich area.

His family released a statement condemning his actions and expressing their shock and sorrow for the victims, while neighbors described him as a weightlifting enthusiast who largely kept to himself.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has expressed disappointment that pro-Palestinian demonstrations proceeded in the wake of the deadly terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue. She described the continuation of such protests as "un-British" and urged organizers to "step back" from planned weekend marches, citing the need for sensitivity after the community suffered a significant loss. Her comments come as police made 40 arrests during a protest in London, and as the UK's Chief Rabbi called for the government to "get a grip" on demonstrations he claims contain antisemitism and support for Hamas.</p>

German police, using a helicopter, searched the area but found no suspects.

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's efforts to pressure the Federal Reserve for interest rate cuts, drawing parallels to Richard Nixon's successful 1972 campaign to keep rates low for political advantage. The author suggests Trump is risking long-term economic stability, which under Nixon led to rampant inflation, for the short-term goal of boosting the economy ahead of midterm elections. While the economy currently appears solid, the piece argues that undermining the Fed's independence could spook financial markets and ultimately lead to severe economic consequences, such as stagflation.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Stop Illegal Entry Act, a Republican-led bill that would impose harsh mandatory minimum prison sentences on migrants who re-enter the country illegally. The legislation mandates a five-year minimum for re-entry followed by a crime punishable by over a year in prison, and a ten-year minimum if the subsequent crime is punishable by up to two years. While proponents call it a necessary deterrent, criminal justice groups warn the bill is impractical, would lead to mass incarceration for a non-violent offense, and would overwhelm the federal court and prison systems.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the call by over 4,500 film industry professionals to boycott Israeli cinema is a misguided effort that targets a vital source of internal dissent and critical self-examination. The author uses the example of "The Sea," Israel's Oscar entry, a state-funded film that critically portrays the Palestinian experience under occupation, to illustrate how Israeli filmmakers often challenge national policy. The article contends that instead of isolating these artists, who are also facing pressure from their own government, the international community should support them, as their work has the potential to change Israeli public opinion more effectively than any boycott.</p>

However, analysis suggests these initiatives may have a limited impact on what most Americans actually pay for their medications. The TrumpRx site, not yet launched, will likely offer cash prices that may not be better than existing services like GoodRx, and will be less beneficial for the majority of Americans with health insurance. Furthermore, the confidential nature of the Pfizer deal makes it difficult to assess whether it will result in significant savings.</p>
