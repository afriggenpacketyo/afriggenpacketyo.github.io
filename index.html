          <p>During President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom, protestors projected an image of him with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto the walls of Windsor Castle. The demonstration, which led to four arrests, also included Trump's mugshot from his indictment in Georgia. The event highlighted the controversial associations of both Trump and the Royal Family's Prince Andrew with Epstein, casting a shadow over the diplomatic proceedings. Thames Valley Police confirmed the arrests were for malicious communications and emphasized that they take unauthorized activity around the royal residence very seriously.</p>

The widespread caution reflects the global economic focus on the Fed's two-day meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut for the first time since December.

          <p>A Honduran immigrant who had been previously deported is facing murder charges after allegedly killing a 16-year-old girl in Queens, New York. The suspect, Edwin Cruz Gomez, is accused of intentionally running down Jhoanny Gomez-Alvarez and her mother with a vehicle after they rejected his sexual advances. According to an ICE source, Gomez has a history of prior DUI arrests and was released under an Alternatives to Detention program after a 2013 arrest, subsequently disappearing. The incident has drawn attention to the suspect's repeated encounters with law enforcement and the immigration system prior to the fatal attack.</p>

The pricing falls at the midpoint of the company's expected range as it prepares to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." After being acquired by eBay and later reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker's company Viagogo, StubHub's public debut follows several delays. The successful IPO is part of a broader rebound in the market for public offerings after a period of economic uncertainty had slowed activity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the Yale School of Public Health has found that thousands of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia are being subjected to forced "reeducation" and militarization at over 200 facilities. The research indicates these children are indoctrinated with pro-Russian ideologies and, in some cases, receive combat training or are made to produce military equipment. This systematic effort to erase Ukrainian identity has been labeled a war crime by the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin for the unlawful deportation of children. The findings underscore a grim aspect of the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed the two state terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. In the ruling, the judge stated that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the terrorism counts, as the targeted killing of one person did not align with the statute's definition, which involves inspiring widespread fear. Mangione still faces nine other state charges, including second-degree murder and multiple weapons-related counts, in addition to separate federal charges. The defense's motion to dismiss the entire state case on grounds of double jeopardy was denied.</p>

          <p>The Anti-Defamation League reports that the 16-year-old who opened fire at a Colorado high school was an active user of a website known for hosting graphic violence and white supremacist content.

The report highlights how these online spaces can glorify violence and radicalize young individuals, creating a network of extremist influence. Experts emphasize the need for early intervention and prevention programs to steer vulnerable youth away from such platforms before they become radicalized.</p>

According to a report from Handshake, job postings have fallen by 15% while applications have surged by 30%, leaving many qualified graduates struggling to find employment. The challenging environment is forcing many, like Jaimee Del Piano with a master's degree, to take on unrelated jobs while living at home to manage student debt.

This decision comes amid sustained political pressure from President Trump, who has been advocating for lower borrowing costs to stimulate the economy.

          <p>Following his death at age 89, Robert Redford is being remembered not just as a Hollywood star but as an artist who intentionally pursued complexity in his work. He frequently rejected simple, heroic roles, instead choosing characters that questioned the American ideal in films like "The Candidate" and "All the President’s Men." This commitment extended to his work as a director and his founding of the Sundance Institute, which has championed independent filmmaking for decades. Redford leveraged his classic movie-star looks to explore nuanced and often critical themes, leaving a lasting legacy on cinema.</p>

Kirk built his career on a platform of free speech and open debate, often in hostile environments, but his allies are now using his death to call for crackdowns on dissent and so-called "hate speech." This shift highlights a tension where free speech is championed as a tool for countercultural ideas but is seen as a danger once political power is achieved. The author warns that the embrace of censorship is a bid to silence opposition, a danger Kirk himself warned about.</p>

          <p>A young wild burro, now named Cupid, is recovering after being shot with an arrow in Moreno Valley, California, the latest in a series of similar attacks on the local donkey population. The arrow punctured the animal's lung, but she is now stable after emergency surgery. A non-profit rescue organization, DonkeyLand, is offering a $24,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for at least six such attacks since June. Wild burros are a protected and iconic species in the region, and the attacks have sparked outrage and concern within the community.</p>

The decision was driven in part by a strong desire from the players to compete for their home countries at the highest level.

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of the major sports ownership group Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, believes it is unlikely that more sports teams will go public. Speaking at a conference, the owner of stakes in the Washington Commanders and Philadelphia 76ers explained that sports assets have consistently been valued more highly as private entities. He argued that public markets have not fully embraced sports teams and that private ownership better allows for the long-term perspective needed to build a winning franchise without the short-term pressures of public shareholders. This structure is preferable for making multi-year investments.</p>

Ricks presented the situation as a cautionary tale for U.S. policymakers, stating that capital investment naturally flows to where it is most welcome and incentivized.
