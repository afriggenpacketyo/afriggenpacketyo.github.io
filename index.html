          <h2>Trump Administration Advances Seabed Mining Despite International Opposition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 20:00:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the U.S. government to aggressively pursue seabed mining in international waters, a move that disregards a long-standing treaty ratified by nearly all major coastal nations except the United States. The executive order instructs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to expedite permits for companies to mine in both international and U.S. territorial waters, positioning the U.S. as a global leader in seabed mineral exploration and development. This decision underscores the Trump administration's willingness to challenge international norms and is expected to provoke strong reactions from both allies and rivals who view international waters as off-limits to such industrial activity. The move aims to secure resources and economic advantages, but raises environmental concerns. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump Organization's online store has begun selling "Trump 2028" hats and T-shirts, sparking speculation about President Trump's intentions regarding a potential third term in office, despite constitutional limitations. The 22nd Amendment restricts presidents from serving more than two terms. Trump has repeatedly teased the idea of seeking a third term, suggesting that there are "methods" to circumvent the constitutional restriction. While the White House has not commented directly, the sale of this merchandise fuels the ongoing debate about the president's ambitions and the potential for challenging established constitutional norms. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is considering shifting U.S. policy on Crimea as part of negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, potentially recognizing Russian control over the Ukrainian peninsula seized in 2014. This move would reverse a decade of U.S. resistance and the official "Crimea Declaration" issued by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2018, which pledged non-recognition of Russia's annexation until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored. Trump's willingness to consider this shift signals a significant departure from established American foreign policy and could have major implications for international relations and the ongoing conflict in the region. The potential policy change reflects Trump's focus on negotiating an end to the war, even if it means compromising on long-held principles.</p>

          <p>Alphabet executives have indicated that President Trump's trade policies are expected to negatively impact the company's advertising business in 2025. The company anticipates a "slight headwind" due to changes in de minimis exemptions, primarily affecting retailers based in the Asia-Pacific region. While the full extent of the impact is still uncertain, Alphabet is preparing for potential budget constraints and pull-back from advertisers. The company is focused on driving efficiency and productivity to navigate these uncertain economic times, with plans to consolidate teams and cut costs to maintain a resilient organization. </p>

This situation highlights the growing complexities and challenges surrounding name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals in college athletics, particularly when athletes transfer schools before their contracts expire.

The move is seen as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to undermine Democratic fundraising capabilities and weaken the party's ability to compete in elections.

The strike underscores the challenges in achieving a ceasefire and highlights the deep divisions between the two sides, with both accusing the other of intransigence.

          <p>Warnings of potential retail shortages are increasing as the trade war between the U.S. and China disrupts supply chains. Industries such as apparel and footwear, which heavily rely on Chinese imports, are particularly vulnerable. High tariff rates are acting as an import ban, leading to order cancellations and goods being held in warehouses. The risk of shortages depends on the duration of the tariffs and the extent to which companies frontloaded inventory. Supply chain experts are closely monitoring port container volumes to assess the health of the supply chain. Lower-end stores with lean inventories are expected to be hit hardest, with toys, games, budget home goods, and apparel being among the first items to disappear from shelves.</p>

He highlights positive earnings from companies like ServiceNow, GE Vernova, Texas Instruments, and Vertiv. Cramer also notes that the White House's silence on business-related matters, particularly after President Trump's threat to fire Powell, has contributed to the market's positive performance. Cramer emphasized the government's power over stocks. He asserts that investors are reassured by Powell's perceived independence and fear political interference in interest rate decisions.
