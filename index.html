          <p>A new DNA study has traced the migration patterns of the first people to colonize the Americas, revealing insights into the ancestry of Indigenous groups. The study suggests that the first settlers migrated from modern-day Russia approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. Researchers analyzed the genomes of over 1,500 individuals from various ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, comparing their genetic codes to ancient DNA. The findings corroborate existing archaeological evidence and highlight the importance of ancestral knowledge for Indigenous communities, particularly those facing cultural loss.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service following an Instagram post that supporters of President Donald Trump claimed was a veiled threat on the president's life. The post showed seashells arranged to form the shapes "86 47," which some interpreted as a call to harm the 47th president. Comey said he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post. Trump and administration officials rejected Comey's explanation and called for legal action.</p>

Ventura described years of abuse and drug-fueled sexual encounters she allegedly endured during their relationship. Prosecutors are using her testimony to build a case that Combs was not just an abuser, but a mastermind of a criminal enterprise.
