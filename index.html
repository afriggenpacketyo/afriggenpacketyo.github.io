          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sánchez have commenced their wedding festivities in Venice, Italy, drawing a host of high-profile celebrities. Guests including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kim Kardashian attended a reception on Thursday ahead of the main ceremony. The large-scale event, with around 200 guests expected, has not been without controversy, sparking protests from some Venice locals concerned about the impact of tourism and high-profile events on the city. This marks the second marriage for both Bezos and Sánchez, who both divorced their previous spouses in 2019 before their relationship became public.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits saw a significant 9.1% drop in May compared to the previous year, marking the most substantial decline since last October and signaling challenges for the nation's economic stimulus efforts. This downturn follows a mixed set of economic data, where strong retail sales were offset by weaker-than-expected industrial output and investment. Despite first-half GDP growth tracking above the official 5% target, which may reduce the urgency for new stimulus measures, economists caution that deflationary pressures and trade tensions could soften growth later in the year. The data highlights the ongoing struggle to bolster corporate profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electronics company Xiaomi saw its shares surge to a record high following the successful launch of its new electric SUV, the YU7. The vehicle is priced to directly compete with Tesla's Model Y in China, starting at 10,000 yuan cheaper and receiving over 200,000 orders within three minutes of its launch. While the YU7 is touted as superior to the Model Y on several metrics, it reportedly falls short on driver-assist technology. The launch is part of Xiaomi's aggressive push into the competitive EV market and was accompanied by the release of other tech products, including AI-connected glasses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Honduran woman has filed a federal lawsuit against U.S. immigration authorities to prevent the immediate deportation of her and her two children from a Texas detention facility. The family was arrested by ICE agents in a courthouse hallway in Los Angeles after a judge dismissed their asylum case. A central concern of the lawsuit is the health of her 6-year-old son, who is battling leukemia and requires ongoing medical care, which she claims has been neglected in detention. The lawsuit argues the family's detention and expedited removal process violate their constitutional rights, as they were previously paroled into the country and deemed not a flight risk.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it is retiring the infamous "Blue Screen of Death," a notorious error message that has been a part of the Windows operating system for over four decades. The company will replace the blue background with a black one and streamline the displayed text to be more condensed. This change is part of a broader initiative to improve the resilience of Windows and help users recover more quickly from unexpected system restarts. The new, simplified error screen is scheduled to be rolled out to all Windows 11 devices later this summer, marking the end of a well-known, and often frustrating, era in personal computing history.</p>

          <p>In the sex trafficking trial of Sean Combs, a federal prosecutor argued during closing arguments that the hip-hop mogul ran a criminal enterprise built on controlling victims through violence and fear. The prosecution's case centers on testimony from two ex-girlfriends who alleged Combs coerced them into filmed sexual encounters with male escorts, using threats, financial control, and physical abuse. The prosecutor highlighted a 2016 hotel video showing Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, arguing it was a tool of coercion, not just domestic violence. The government contends that Combs and his inner circle conspired in multiple criminal acts, including racketeering, to facilitate and conceal these crimes over several years.</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Donald Trump may extend the 90-day pause on his reciprocal tariff scheme, which is set to expire in early July. A spokesperson stated the deadline is "not critical" and that an extension is possible, a decision that rests with the president. This comes as Japan's top tariff negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks, aiming to secure concessions on the higher duties. The pause applies to country-specific tariffs on about 60 trading partners, including an additional 14% on Japan, but does not affect the baseline 10% duty on global imports.

As part of this strategy, Nike intends to reduce its manufacturing in China from 16% to the high single-digits by next summer.

          <p>In a final pitch to congressional leaders, President Trump advocated for his major tax-and-spending bill but notably omitted any mention of his previous July 4 signing deadline. The bill, which includes extensions of his first-term tax cuts and increased funding for immigration enforcement, faces significant hurdles in the Senate. Trump framed the legislation as beneficial for working families and law enforcement. However, Democrats have strongly opposed the bill, criticizing its proposed cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), which they argue would harm millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>A classified intelligence briefing on the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities has left senators sharply divided along partisan lines regarding the operation's success. Following the briefing, Republican senators like Lindsey Graham echoed President Trump's claim that the sites were "obliterated," setting back Iran's program by years. In contrast, key Democrats, including Chris Murphy and Chuck Schumer, stated the briefing provided no coherent strategy and that Trump was misleading the public, arguing the program was set back by months, not years. The deep division highlights ongoing disputes over the military action, which was authorized without prior congressional approval.</p>

          <p>A large, bright meteor, known as a fireball, was witnessed streaking across the daytime sky over the southeastern U.S. before exploding above Georgia. The event generated a pressure wave that created audible booms heard by residents on the ground. According to NASA, the meteor was about three feet in diameter, weighed over a ton, and released energy equivalent to about 20 tons of TNT upon explosion. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the sighting. Experts suggest the fireball may have been part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower, making it a rare and spectacular daytime celestial event.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city particularly vulnerable to the urban heat island effect, a local environmental group is testing solutions on a single "cool block." The project, led by GreenRoots, involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter, heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white to reduce heat absorption. These measures are designed to combat the dangerously high temperatures found in dense, less-green urban areas, which can be up to 20 degrees hotter than surrounding leafy suburbs. This urban laboratory provides a potential template for other cities looking for practical ways to mitigate extreme heat as climate change intensifies.</p>

Fito, leader of the "Los Choneros" gang and wanted in both Ecuador and the U.S., was found hiding in the basement of a house in his hometown of Manta. His escape in early 2024 triggered a wave of extreme violence across Ecuador, including riots, kidnappings, and an armed attack on a TV station.

While overall wait times have slightly improved, over a third of hospital trusts have seen their performance worsen since a new improvement plan was announced. The national 18-week waiting time target has not been met since 2015, and patient groups warn that the current slow progress leaves many people waiting in constant pain. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the challenge but expressed confidence that the target would be met by 2029 with new investment.</p>

          <p>President Trump's intensified crackdown on immigration is reportedly causing significant disruption for U.S. businesses and stoking fear within immigrant communities. Business owners report losing authorized workers who depend on temporary permits that the administration is now targeting, creating labor shortages in sectors like cleaning, caregiving, and construction. The policies are aimed at both undocumented immigrants and those with legal work authorization through programs like TPS. Economists warn that choking off this critical supply of labor could slow economic growth, feed inflation, and have far-reaching negative consequences for the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>Rapper Fat Joe has publicly responded to a lawsuit filed by his former hype man, which includes serious allegations of underpayment, intimidation, and sexual misconduct. In an Instagram statement, the rapper called the claims "disgusting lies" and a form of extortion, vowing he would never back down. The lawsuit accuses Fat Joe of running a criminal enterprise and alleges he coerced the hype man into thousands of sexual acts and had sexual relationships with underage girls. Fat Joe's attorney has dismissed the allegations as "complete fabrications," framing the lawsuit as retaliation for a slander case the rapper previously filed against the accuser.</p>

          <h2>Criminal Trials in Post Office Horizon Scandal May Not Begin Until 2028</h2>

          <p>The police chief leading the criminal investigation into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal has stated that the first trials may not commence until 2028. The complex investigation has identified seven suspects and is examining the roles of investigators, solicitors, and wider management in the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters based on faulty IT data. While police are making progress, the timeline is dependent on the publication of the final public inquiry report. For the victims, many of whom have waited decades for justice, the prolonged delay is a source of deep frustration and a race against time.</p>
