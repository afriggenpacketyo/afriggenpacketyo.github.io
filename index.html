          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 23:22:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) fell by 3.6% in June year-over-year, marking the most significant drop in nearly two years and extending a long streak of deflationary pressure. This decline, which was worse than economists' forecasts, reflects ongoing price wars and weak domestic demand despite a slight rebound in the consumer price index. Policymakers have criticized the aggressive price-cutting by companies, which is hurting profitability without significantly boosting consumer spending. Analysts warn that persistent industrial overcapacity will likely continue to suppress prices as the effects of temporary government stimulus schemes fade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has secured guilty pleas from two individuals, Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine, on federal charges for illegally selling an SKS rifle to Ryan Routh. Routh was later arrested and charged with the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at his Florida golf club. According to court filings, Cooper acted as a middleman for the sale, knowing Routh was prohibited from owning firearms due to a prior conviction. While prosecutors have not confirmed it was the same weapon used in the attempt, the pleas reveal new details about how the alleged assailant acquired a firearm.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash flooding in Texas Hill Country has resulted in at least 110 deaths, with over 160 people still missing, primarily in hard-hit Kerr County. The disaster, which devastated Camp Mystic, a youth summer camp, occurred after the area received an immense amount of rainfall over a short period. Governor Greg Abbott has described the damage as widespread and catastrophic, emphasizing that the primary focus remains on search and rescue operations. The state had approved the camp's emergency plans just two days before the flood, raising questions about disaster preparedness and response.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat slowing sales and revitalize the agricultural sector, Chinese farmers are increasingly turning to technology, particularly livestreaming on platforms like Douyin, China's version of TikTok. Local governments are supporting this trend by offering training bootcamps to teach farmers how to effectively market their produce directly to the country's one billion internet users. This shift is part of a broader "rural revitalization" push championed by President Xi Jinping, aiming to modernize agriculture and create new economic opportunities. The movement is transforming public perception of farming from a traditional, disconnected trade to a tech-savvy, entrepreneurial endeavor.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has officially won the New York City Democratic mayoral primary with a historic 565,639 votes after three rounds of ranked-choice voting. This total surpasses the previous record set by David Dinkins in 1989, a milestone Mamdani's campaign is touting as a mandate for his progressive platform. He defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo by nearly 13 percentage points in the final tally. The victory signals a significant leftward shift in the city's politics, and attention now turns to whether Cuomo or other centrists will mount an independent challenge in the general election.</p>

          <p>Intense rainfall in the Ruidoso area of southern New Mexico triggered severe flash flooding, with dramatic video showing the fast-moving water carrying an entire house downstream. Emergency crews conducted at least 85 swift-water rescues as people were trapped in homes and vehicles, though some individuals remain unaccounted for. The Rio Ruidoso river rose approximately 19 feet in minutes, reaching a record level and demonstrating the suddenness of the event. The region's vulnerability to flooding is heightened by burn scars from wildfires in 2024, which destabilized the soil and reduced vegetation, increasing the risk of such disasters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally notified Japan and South Korea of impending tariffs, a move that could exacerbate economic headwinds for two of America's key Asian allies. Both export-dependent nations are already grappling with slowing growth, with Japan potentially facing a technical recession. The proposed 25% tariffs target major exports like automobiles and steel, which are critical to both economies. Economists warn the new duties could further depress GDP growth, which has already been revised downward in South Korea. While President Trump has indicated a willingness to negotiate if the countries open their markets, the letters increase pressure on ongoing trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

The latest figures show a significant increase, with nearly 1,200 arrests occurring in just over two weeks. The operation, which involves ICE, CBP, and the federally-controlled National Guard, has drawn widespread condemnation from local and state officials. They accuse the federal government of terrorizing immigrant communities and disrupting local life, while legal challenges to the administration's authority have so far been unsuccessful in court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on imported copper, a move that follows an investigation into whether these imports affect national security. The decision, which is expected to take effect by the end of the month, caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high. The metal is a key component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction, with the U.S. importing about half of its supply, primarily from Chile and Canada. The move is part of a broader strategy of using tariffs to protect American industries, with similar actions looming for pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in Texas, which has claimed over 100 lives, has brought renewed attention to recent staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA. Since February, the NWS has lost about 600 staff members, leading to significant vacancy rates in meteorologist and hydrologist positions at offices across the country. While experts state that the NWS issued timely warnings for the Texas event, they caution that continued cuts could compromise the agency's ability to forecast and respond to future disasters.

          <p>To combat a massive backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in England and Wales, a review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended radical reforms, including judge-only trials for certain offenses. The proposals suggest that cases like fraud and bribery could be decided by judges alone to speed up a system he warns is at risk of "total system collapse." Other recommendations include handling less serious offenses with a panel of a judge and two magistrates, and no longer allowing defendants to choose a jury trial for crimes like stalking. While some legal professionals support the changes, others argue they undermine the essential right to be tried by one's peers.</p>
