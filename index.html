          <p>The U.S. government shutdown continued into its seventh day, with the Senate unable to break a deadlock between Republicans and Democrats over the budget and ObamaCare tax credits. A new White House memo, reported by Axios, has introduced significant uncertainty, suggesting that up to 750,000 furloughed federal workers might not be entitled to back pay, despite a 2019 law designed to guarantee it. President Trump's comments further fueled confusion, stating that back pay would "depend on who we're talking about." This unexpected reinterpretation of the law has intensified pressure on lawmakers to find a resolution, as hundreds of thousands of federal employees face severe financial strain.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychology expert and author, Morgan Housel, suggests that true happiness stems from contentment rather than material wealth, outlining five rules for a more satisfied life. The core idea is to appreciate the ordinary and what one already possesses, rather than constantly chasing more. Housel observes that the happiest individuals are those most content, regardless of their financial status, drawing inspiration from his grandmother-in-law who lived happily with little. He posits that psychological wealth comes from low expectations, and happiness is ultimately the gap between expectations and circumstances, emphasizing that a rich life is about feeling nothing is missing.</p>

          <p>UK Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick stated that a lack of integration can lead the country into "a very dark place," defending remarks he made about Handsworth, Birmingham. Jenrick had previously described Handsworth as "one of the worst-integrated places," noting a lack of white faces during his visit, which drew accusations of racism from Labour. He emphasized the importance of people living alongside each other, not "parallel lives," and cited a recent terrorist attack in Manchester by an individual who was not well-integrated. This debate highlights ongoing concerns within the Conservative party about community cohesion and immigration levels.</p>

          <p>Wharton professor Ethan Mollick, a leading AI expert, asserts that "no one knows anything" definitive about generative AI's future impact on jobs and the economy, including top AI research labs. He highlights that current AI is more akin to a human, suggesting that individuals adept at interpersonal skills will leverage it effectively. Mollick emphasizes a shift from rewarding "having answers" to "asking brilliant questions" and embracing rapid iteration. He advises leaders to personally engage with AI tools for at least 10 hours weekly, fostering innovation from within rather than waiting for external solutions, and cautions against viewing AI solely as an automation tool.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The storm, currently far from land with 50 mph sustained winds, is tracking westward and is expected to steadily strengthen into a hurricane in the coming days. A tropical storm watch has been issued for several northern Leeward Islands. While not currently forecast to make landfall, Jerry is expected to bring life-threatening surf, rip currents, and up to four inches of rain to the islands by Thursday or Friday. This development follows a relatively quiet hurricane season, with only one previous storm making U.S. landfall.</p>

          <p>A major rescue operation successfully guided 580 hikers and 300 local support staff to safety after they were trapped by a severe blizzard near Mount Everest's eastern slopes in Tibet. The trekkers, caught off guard by heavy snowfall during China's Golden Week holiday, were stranded at altitudes over 4,900m. While most have reached safe areas, a final small group is still being guided to a rendezvous point with emergency supplies. Witnesses described unprecedented weather conditions, with some experiencing hypothermia and having to clear deep snow from tents. This incident highlights the dangers of high-altitude trekking, even during peak season.</p>

          <p>A new study by the National Council on Aging and the University of Massachusetts Boston reveals a stark longevity gap, finding that low-income Americans over 60 die an average of nine years earlier than their high-income counterparts. Middle-income seniors also show shorter lifespans than wealthier individuals. This disparity is attributed to factors like lack of preventative care, inability to afford medical treatment, and the chronic stress of financial instability. With the senior poverty rate rising and 80% of older adults lacking financial assets for shocks, the findings underscore widening economic inequality and its devastating impact on the health and well-being of an aging population.</p>

          <h2>Tech Investor Orlando Bravo Warns of "Bubble" in AI Company Valuations</h2>

          <p>Orlando Bravo, co-founder of Thoma Bravo, a prominent private equity firm, asserts that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are currently "at a bubble," drawing parallels to the dot-com era. He cautions that investors cannot justify extreme valuations for companies with modest revenues, as they would require improbable free cash flow generation to deliver returns. A key distinction from the dot-com bust, however, is that today's AI businesses are being financed by large companies with robust balance sheets. This dynamic, Bravo suggests, might alter the market's trajectory compared to past tech bubbles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Center for California Literature has launched in Los Angeles, founded by poet Christopher Soto, to provide a much-needed hub for the city's diverse writing community. Despite L.A.'s rich literary history, writers often struggle with a lack of local support and resources, leading many to leave. Inspired by his own research into this issue, Soto created the center to foster community through readings, workshops, and advocacy. High-profile authors like Roxane Gay support the initiative, emphasizing the need for collective strength and shared values among writers. The center aims to ensure L.A. remains a vibrant home for literary arts, providing material and creative resources.</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies' shares rose after the company significantly increased its long-term revenue and profit growth expectations, attributing this surge to robust demand in artificial intelligence. Dell now projects annual revenue growth between 7% and 9%, up from 3-4%, and diluted earnings per share growth of at least 15%, previously 8%. CEO Michael Dell highlighted the company's strong position as an "AI infrastructure solutions leader," capitalizing on the rapid technological changes. This positive outlook is supported by Dell's plan to ship $20 billion worth of AI servers in fiscal 2026, doubling last year's sales, and its key role as an Nvidia customer.

          <p>President Trump confirmed that music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, whom he referred to as "Puff Daddy," has requested a pardon following his conviction on two prostitution-related charges. Combs was sentenced to over four years in federal prison for transporting prostitutes across state lines for "freak-offs." Reports about a potential pardon first surfaced months ago, with Combs' legal team reportedly reaching out to the Trump administration. This development adds another layer to Combs' high-profile legal saga and aligns with Trump's history of issuing pardons to figures like NBA YoungBoy. Rapper 50 Cent, a known foe, quickly reacted to the news, poking fun at Combs' situation.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi's first congressional oversight hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee was a tense and partisan affair, marked by her aggressive defensive tactics. Bondi frequently attacked Democratic senators, dodged questions on sensitive topics like the James Comey indictment and Jeffrey Epstein investigation, and refused to discuss White House conversations. She consistently steered discussions towards the Trump administration's focus on crime reduction, while Democrats pressed on accusations of the Justice Department's weaponization. Republicans, conversely, focused on past grievances against the Biden administration, highlighting a deep partisan divide and a lack of substantive answers regarding the department's operations.</p>

          <p>A draft White House memo suggests that furloughed federal employees may not be legally entitled to back pay after the government shutdown, contradicting a 2019 law and previous administration guidance. President Trump's remarks further complicated the issue, stating that back pay eligibility would depend on the individual. Federal employee unions have denounced this interpretation as "frivolous" and legally questionable, while experts suggest workers might pursue legal avenues like class-action lawsuits. This development adds severe financial uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of federal employees, prompting advice to focus on cash flow and prepare for potential unemployment or extended periods without income.
