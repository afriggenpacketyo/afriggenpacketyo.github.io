          <p>Over 140 House Democrats have sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, urging the reversal of a recent halt on visitor visas for individuals from the Gaza Strip, particularly for injured children needing emergency medical care in the U.S. The lawmakers contend that this policy denies critical treatment to vulnerable children caught in the conflict, ignoring the existing rigorous vetting processes by the Israeli government for those seeking medical travel. Rubio defended the change, citing allegations of connections between some organizations involved in acquiring these visas and terrorist groups like Hamas, which prompted a review of the State Department's procedures. This article underscores the complex interplay of humanitarian concerns and national security in U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's apparent disinterest in peace, Russia's struggling economy, marked by slowing growth and a widening budget deficit, could pressure him towards negotiations with Ukraine. Government spending, heavily skewed towards defense, has been sustained by oil and gas sales and increased taxes, but declining oil revenues amid sanctions and lower global demand are forcing the Kremlin to consider cuts or further tax hikes. Experts warn that a prolonged recession is a significant risk if fiscal support is reduced, while maintaining it could lead to high inflation. The article suggests that economic realities may ultimately influence Russia's war strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

However, she also indulges in significant purchases, including a nearly $30 million mansion in Hollywood Hills and a vintage Ferrari. The article also mentions a class-action lawsuit filed against Guo and Passes in February, alleging distribution of child sexual assault material on the platform, which Guo's spokesperson vehemently denies as a "shakedown."

          <p>North Korea's state media, KCNA, has strongly criticized South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, labeling him a "hypocrite" for his comments on Korean Peninsula denuclearization during a recent visit to the United States. Lee had suggested that the alliance between South Korea and the U.S. would be "upgraded to a global level" when a path for denuclearization, peace, and coexistence emerges. Pyongyang dismissed his mention of "denuclearization" as a "naive dream," reiterating its "inevitable" status as a nuclear power due to perceived hostile threats.

The protest group, No Azure for Apartheid, drew attention to a British newspaper report suggesting Israel used Microsoft's Azure cloud platform to store phone call data obtained through mass surveillance of Palestinians. Microsoft has stated it hired an outside law firm to investigate these allegations, emphasizing that its terms of service prohibit such use.

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, following a high-profile Massachusetts murder retrial. After four days of deliberation, jurors acquitted her of the most serious charges but convicted her of driving under the influence of alcohol, for which she received one year probation.

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its tenth test flight, marking a critical step forward after previous failures. The 40-story-tall rocket performed as planned, with the Super Heavy booster returning for a controlled splashdown and the Starship upper stage deploying eight dummy Starlink satellites. Despite some reentry heating damage to the Starship's protective skirt and a control flap, the vehicle remained under control throughout its trajectory and completed a powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This article highlights a major triumph for Elon Musk's ambitious space program, crucial for NASA's moon landing plans and future Mars missions.</p>

          <p>The FBI is investigating a wave of "swatting" hoaxes targeting U.S. universities, which have triggered chaotic armed police responses as students return to campus for the new semester. Nearly a dozen institutions, including Villanova and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, have experienced false active shooter reports, leading to widespread panic and lockdowns. Authorities note a growing popularity of swatting—making prank calls to deploy SWAT teams—which drains law enforcement resources, costs thousands of dollars, and endangers innocent people.
