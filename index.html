        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have indicated that they made substantial progress during trade talks held in Geneva. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as productive and constructive, while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng called them in-depth and candid. These were the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed significant tariffs on Chinese imports in January, leading to retaliatory measures from Beijing. The talks aim to de-escalate the trade war, which has caused turmoil in financial markets and raised fears of a global recession. A joint statement detailing the outcomes is expected to be released soon, potentially including tariff cuts.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed new charges against Oren and Tal Alexander, along with their brother Alon, including additional counts of alleged sex trafficking, one of which involves a minor. The Alexander brothers, known in New York's luxury real estate market, are accused of luring women to nightclubs and parties, then drugging and sexually assaulting them. The superseding indictment includes more alleged victims, bringing the total to six. Defense attorneys maintain the charges are misguided and assert their clients' innocence, highlighting their willingness to take polygraph examinations.

          <p>The White House is reportedly in discussions with Qatar to potentially receive a luxury jumbo jet for use as Air Force One. According to reports, Qatar is offering a Boeing 747-8, which has been upgraded into a "flying palace." While Qatar denies the plane would be a gift, they acknowledge discussions are ongoing for the transfer of an aircraft for temporary use. The potential value of the plane and its handling are raising legal and ethical questions, with critics concerned about foreign influence. The current Air Force One planes have been in use since 1990 and 1991, and the White House has been facing delays in acquiring newer models from Boeing.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court has uncovered a collection of Nazi propaganda and documentation within its archives. The material, found during preparations for a museum of historical documents, includes postcards, photographs, and other items intended to promote Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina during World War II. The boxes are believed to be linked to a 1941 shipment from the German embassy in Tokyo. Argentina, home to the largest Jewish population in Latin America, was a destination for many Nazis fleeing after the war.

The recall was prompted by a routine inspection that confirmed the listeria strain matched the one causing illnesses in the 2024 outbreak. While no illnesses have been directly linked to the recalled food, the company is taking precautionary measures to ensure consumer safety.</p>

The proposal, intended to lower healthcare costs, is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that it will hurt profits and innovation.

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, known for providing affordable medical care to all residents, is facing strain from a shrinking workforce and aging population. The system's future is now entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections, including the upcoming House of Councillors contest. Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its stability and erode public trust in government. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government is seeking to secure funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings, leading to debates over increasing the burden on patients with high medical costs.</p>
