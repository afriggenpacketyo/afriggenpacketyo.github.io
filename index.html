          <p>Former CDC Director Susan Monarez testified before a Senate committee, stating that she was fired for refusing to pre-approve vaccine recommendations from a newly formed advisory panel and for not dismissing career scientists. Monarez claimed HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. demanded these actions, which she believed were unethical and inconsistent with her oath of office. Kennedy previously testified that Monarez was untrustworthy, a claim she disputes. Monarez expressed concern that the new vaccine panel could restrict access to vaccines without rigorous scientific review, while an HHS spokesperson refuted Monarez's account, alleging insubordination and malicious undermining of President Trump's agenda. The optimism score reflects the serious nature of the allegations and potential impact on public health. </p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized China's ban on Nvidia's AI chips, calling China an adversary that steals intellectual property and disregards fair trade agreements. This action follows reports that China ordered tech companies to halt purchases of Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D chip, which was designed for the Chinese market. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed disappointment but acknowledged larger agendas between the two countries, while Nvidia's stock saw a slight dip. The U.S. has been trying to balance national security concerns with access to the lucrative Chinese market for chipmakers. The relationship between the two countries is complex and may lead to further tensions. </p>

          <p>Kenya's public pension and health insurance systems are plagued by fraud, leaving retirees and citizens without promised security and healthcare. A 2024 report revealed over 260,000 cases of fraudulent activities targeting pension schemes, with billions of Kenyan shillings lost through fake payments between 2013 and 2020. The government has promised to fully digitize the pension payment system by July 2025 to combat fraud, but public confidence is low due to ongoing corruption and mismanagement within the system. Many Kenyans are forced to pay for private insurance in addition to public schemes to ensure they receive adequate care. </p>

          <p>A Yale study reveals that Russia is subjecting thousands of abducted Ukrainian children to forced re-education and militarization in at least 210 facilities in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine. The children are being indoctrinated with pro-Russian narratives and, in some cases, engaged in combat training and military equipment production. The UN's International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova for the unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children. Ukraine's "Bring Kids Back" program reports that over 19,500 children have been abducted, with only a small fraction returned, and the situation has prompted international condemnation and calls for the children's safe return to their families. </p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle responded to United CEO Scott Kirby's assertion that the deep discount airline model is failing, calling Kirby's remarks "cute" and highlighting the oversupply of flights in the U.S.. Biffle defended Frontier's lower unit costs and its ability to cater to customers seeking affordable travel options, while Kirby has publicly stated that ultra-low-cost carriers do not offer value to customers. Both airlines are vying to capture customers from Spirit Airlines, which recently entered its second bankruptcy, as the ultra-low-cost airline model has struggled with rising costs and competition from larger airlines. Frontier reported a net loss in the second quarter but anticipates revenue growth and improved profitability in 2026. </p>

          <p>Scientists are closer to resurrecting the dodo after creating gene-edited chickens that could lay eggs carrying the extinct bird's DNA. A team at Colossal Biosciences has successfully created chickens without their own primordial germ cells, ready for the insertion of reconstructed dodo DNA. They have also grown pigeon primordial germ cells, as pigeons are the dodo’s closest relatives, and this breakthrough is a pivotal step in bringing back the dodo, the team is also in talks with the government of Mauritius to find a suitable habitat. The advance also opens the door for saving other species of birds. </p>

Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport topped the list for mega airports, while John Wayne Airport in Orange County led among large airports, and Indianapolis International Airport ranked highest for medium airports for the fourth consecutive year. Airports that incorporate local food and brands tend to score higher and generate more spending. Mega airports often lag behind smaller ones due to longer wait times and larger crowds. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A drone attack on Kyiv and the appearance of drones over Polish territory have highlighted the increasing threat posed by autonomous aerial vehicles. Drones are cheap to make and can fly low to avoid radar, which creates a challenge for defense. Techniques to neutralize drones include spoofing, jamming, and conventional methods like missiles, but defenses are often more expensive than the drones themselves. Experts recommend a multi-layered approach to defense, combining RF interference, conventional munitions, and laser or microwave technology, to effectively counter the evolving drone threat. </p>

The ship, which disappeared in January 1929, was discovered in 2022 and positively identified in July 2025, with distinctive features such as a double drum trawl winch and a raised forecastle deck. The discovery provides some measure of closure to the descendants of those who perished, as previous search attempts had failed due to the wreck site's location.

Commercial pilots reported the ash, which is considered hazardous to aircraft and health, prompting an advisory from USGS.

          <p>The article reviews Brad Ingelsby’s HBO miniseries, Task, which contrasts sharply with his previous work, Mare of Easttown, by presenting a world dominated by patriarchal power structures where women are marginalized. The series follows Tom, a former priest turned FBI agent, and Robbie, a trash collector turned robber, as their lives intersect. Task explores themes of masculinity, rage, and forgiveness within institutions like the FBI and a biker gang. The choice to cast women as ancillary characters highlights the show's bleak depiction of a world where they struggle to endure. </p>
