        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview on "Face the Nation," Senator Rand Paul addressed concerns about the border and tax bill, criticizing the proposed $5 trillion debt increase and the inflated cost of the border wall. He argued that the President had already effectively stopped the border flow without new legislation or funding, suggesting that the current bill is primarily benefiting the military-industrial complex. Paul also expressed skepticism about tariffs, citing opposition from Kentucky's Farm Bureau and bourbon industry, emphasizing the Republican party's traditional stance on lower taxes. He indicated that he and at least three other Republicans would likely push for modifications to the bill, particularly concerning the debt ceiling. Optimism for the bill's chances depend on if Paul's concerns are addressed. </p>

Both men had connections to a criminal gang based in Glasgow, and Monaghan had previously been acquitted of a high-profile gangland murder. The incident occurred when a masked gunman opened fire at Monaghan's Bar, and then fled in a vehicle. Police Scotland is coordinating with Spanish authorities, and the BBC reports an increase in similar shootings in the Costa del Sol area, often linked to drug crime.

          <p>Investors are increasingly favoring short-term Treasury investments, mirroring Warren Buffett's strategy of doubling Berkshire Hathaway's ownership of T-bills. The trend is driven by concerns and volatility in the market, with ultra-short opportunities attracting significant investor flows. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) are among the top ETFs in investor flows this year. This shift reflects a preference for stability and less volatility in the shorter end of the fixed-income market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>White House budget director Russ Vought dismissed concerns that cuts to benefits in the House-passed spending bill would lead to premature deaths, calling such fears "totally ridiculous." The bill proposes cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), affecting millions of Americans. Vought defended the bill, asserting it would preserve and protect the social safety net while making it more commonsense. Critics, however, warn that the cuts will cause hardship and potentially lead to deaths, particularly for vulnerable populations.</p>

The party also wants to introduce secure armories at maximum security jails for use as a last resort and roll out high-collar stab vests to frontline officers. The Ministry of Justice stated that some prison officers will use Tasers on a trial basis this summer, but they argue that giving lethal weapons would put them at greater risk.</p>
