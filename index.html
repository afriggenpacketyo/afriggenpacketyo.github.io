          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests following ICE operations, citing the inability of California's governor and Los Angeles' mayor to manage the situation. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and unnecessary, stating that local authorities are capable of handling the situation and accusing the federal government of sowing chaos. The deployment involves at least 2,000 National Guard troops under Title 10 authority, a move that waives the Posse Comitatus Act. Protests have erupted in response to ICE raids, with clashes between protesters and authorities leading to arrests and injuries.

Despite the court ordering Katherine Hill to repay the money, the sisters express that the emotional damage is irreparable.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Italy is holding a national referendum to potentially halve the time required to apply for citizenship from 10 years to five, aligning it with most other European countries. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposes the referendum, calling the current citizenship law "excellent" and encouraging citizens to abstain from voting. The referendum aims to speed up the citizenship process for legal foreign workers and their children, potentially affecting up to 1.4 million people. Supporters argue the reform would integrate long-term residents who contribute to Italy's economy and address the country's shrinking population. The optimism score is moderate due to the divided opinions and uncertain outcome of the referendum.</p>

Tisdall argues that the UK's policy is redundant, inhuman, immoral, and unaffordable, perpetuating illusions about its global power status. He suggests that gradual disarmament, not rearmament, is the only way to escape the nightmare of nuclear warfare.

          <h2>Rhodes Argues Trump's Self-Dealing Poses Danger to US Political System</h2>

          <p>Ben Rhodes argues that President Trump's self-enrichment while in office poses a fundamental danger to the U.S. political system, transforming it into a system that no longer serves the people. He points to the flow of foreign money into Trump's businesses and the personalization of power, drawing parallels to corrupt strongmen like Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orban. Rhodes suggests that the fusion of political and personal interests undermines checks and balances, erodes ethical frameworks, and leads to the rise of oligarchs. The article expresses concern that the U.S. is becoming another country where the leader profits from power. The optimism score is very low due to the grave concerns about corruption and the erosion of democratic principles.</p>

          <p>President Trump has deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles without consulting California's governor, Gavin Newsom, who accused the White House of "sowing chaos." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened to deploy active-duty Marines, further escalating tensions. Trump stated that if local authorities cannot do their jobs, the federal government will step in, but the LAPD reports that demonstrations are now peaceful. This deployment highlights a widening divide between California's political leaders and the federal government. The optimism score is low due to the conflict and potential escalation of tensions.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing menâ€™s participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining global birth rates, addressing Chinaâ€™s demographic challenges. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This innovative policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population and a shrinking workforce. The study also found that traditional expectations place the burden on women to perform most childcare duties, clashing with rapid economic changes.
