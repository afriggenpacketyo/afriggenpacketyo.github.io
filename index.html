          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that former President Barack Obama has "no clue what he is talking about" regarding his comments on Jimmy Kimmel's cancellation. Obama had criticized the administration for allegedly threatening media companies, but Leavitt asserted that ABC executives made the decision independently. She explained that Kimmel's show was shelved due to his deliberate falsehoods about Charlie Kirk's death, not White House pressure. Leavitt also suggested that Kimmel's declining ratings likely contributed to ABC's business decision.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan court has issued an arrest warrant for a British national in connection with the 2012 murder of Agnes Wanjiru, a 21-year-old mother, allegedly by a British soldier. Her friends recall Agnes's struggle for survival and her last night out, which ended with her seen leaving a bar with a white man. The case gained wider attention after an inquest concluded a British soldier was responsible, and recent reports revealed ongoing misconduct by British troops in Kenya. UK Defence Secretary John Healey has met with Agnes's family, promising government assistance to secure justice.</p>

          <p>Several European airports, including Heathrow, experienced significant delays on Saturday due to a cyber-attack affecting an electronic check-in and baggage system. The incident impacted Collins Aerospace's Muse software, used by multiple airlines, forcing manual check-in operations. While British Airways utilized a backup, many other carriers faced disruption, leading to long queues and missed connections for passengers. The National Cyber Security Centre and European Commission are monitoring the situation, with investigations ongoing into the nature and origin of the attack, which some speculate could be ransomware.</p>

          <p>A right-wing demonstration in The Hague, Netherlands, advocating for tougher asylum policies, devolved into violence and chaos on Saturday. Rioters clashed with police, who deployed tear gas and water cannons, and vandalized an office of the centrist D66 political party. Around 1,500 anti-immigration protesters blocked a major highway, and a police car was torched. Caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing leader Geert Wilders both condemned the unrest, which occurs weeks before a general election called after Wilders' party exited the ruling coalition over migration disputes.</p>

Many commute long distances or work 30+ hours a week, often sacrificing academic or social opportunities.

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new restrictions on journalists, requiring them to agree not to disclose unauthorized information or risk losing building access. These changes, which also limit movement within the facility, follow a series of recent leaks. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth stated the press does not "run the Pentagon" and must follow rules. The Department of War asserts its commitment to transparency but emphasizes that information must be officially approved for release, even if unclassified, sparking concerns about press freedom and government transparency.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation requiring all public universities in the state to erect a "Charlie Kirk Memorial Plaza" with a statue and signage proclaiming him a "modern civil rights leader." The bill, sponsored by Senators Shane Jett and Dana Prieto, mandates prominent placement and specific statue designs, with non-compliant schools facing monthly fines. This effort to cast Kirk as a civil rights icon has drawn strong criticism, including from Martin Luther King III, who highlighted Kirk's divisive rhetoric and denigration of Black women as contrary to his father's message of unity.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals, including top CIA deputies and Democratic congressional staffers, without prior notification to the White House. This action caused significant consternation among Trump's advisors, who viewed it as a blunder and raised concerns about potential separation-of-powers issues. Gabbard defended her actions as executing the President's agenda to remove officials involved in "politicization or weaponization of intelligence," particularly those linked to 2016 Russia assessments. The episode deepened existing animosity between Gabbard and the CIA, though she is not expected to face major repercussions.</p>

          <p>The White House has outlined a deal for TikTok's US operations, stating that US companies will control the app's algorithm and Americans will hold six of seven board seats. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated a signing could occur "in the coming days," though China's Commerce Ministry offered a less clear statement. Oracle, led by Trump ally Larry Ellison, is set to manage data and privacy. This development follows President Trump's previous threats to ban TikTok unless its US operations were sold, amid national security concerns over its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed the "No Secret Police Act," banning on-duty law enforcement from wearing masks, with exceptions for riot gear, medical masks, and undercover work. Newsom, a critic of President Trump, framed the law as a stand against "authoritarianism" and a response to increased immigration enforcement by masked federal agents in California. While the law primarily targets federal agents, its impact on state and local law enforcement is also significant. Law enforcement groups oppose the ban, citing safety concerns for officers and their families, while immigrant advocates welcome the increased transparency.</p>

Critics accuse the administration of deliberately hindering the measurement of hunger and obscuring the impact of its policies, drawing comparisons to non-democratic practices of manipulating unfavorable data.</p>

          <p>New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, former Milwaukee archbishop, controversially compared the slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk to a "modern-day St. Paul" during a Fox & Friends appearance. Dolan praised Kirk as a "missionary" and "evangelist" whose death could inspire renewed faith in young people. These remarks, made after Dolan learned of Kirk's death, drew significant outrage on social media, with critics questioning the comparison and highlighting Dolan's past leadership in the church, including his handling of sexual assault allegations against clergy members.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a new $100,000 fee for high-skilled workers entering the U.S. via the H-1B visa program, a dramatic overhaul impacting the tech industry and other sectors. This one-time fee applies only to new visas, not renewals or current holders. The White House justifies the move by accusing employers of abusing the program to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign labor. While some immigration groups criticize it for shrinking the talent pipeline, the policy is seen as a blow to tech giants that heavily rely on H-1B visas and have sought to curry favor with the President.
