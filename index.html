          <p>A judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's plan to strip Harvard University of its ability to enroll foreign students after Harvard filed a lawsuit arguing the move was a blatant violation of law and free speech rights. The administration claimed Harvard had not done enough to combat antisemitism, allegations the university denied, and White House officials accused the judge of having a liberal agenda after the ruling. International students at Harvard, who comprise over 27% of the student body, expressed concerns about being forced to transfer or return home, as losing access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program would violate their visas. Eliminating foreign students would also significantly impact Harvard's finances, as they often pay full tuition, subsidizing aid for American students.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a 'planned partnership' between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, claiming it will keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh and create at least 70,000 jobs. Nippon Steel's nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel had been blocked by former President Joe Biden, but Trump subjected it to another national security review. U.S. Steel praised Trump's leadership, stating the partnership would bring massive investment and new technologies, while Nippon Steel echoed the commitment to American workers and national security. The United Steelworkers union, which had opposed the deal, had no immediate comment, and shares of U.S. Steel jumped 21% following the announcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration formally accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by failing to protect Jewish students amidst pro-Palestinian demonstrations. This action intensifies the White House's crackdown on colleges perceived as not following its agenda. The accusation centers on breaching Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits recipients of federal funds from discriminatory behavior. The administration had previously suspended over $400 million in research funding to Columbia, and legal experts note the administration's unusual approach of swift action against universities' finances, sometimes notifying news outlets before campus leaders. Columbia has announced changes to campus protest and security policies in response to previous accusations.</p>

          <p>A budget package passed by the House of Representatives includes historic spending cuts to Medicaid and SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), totaling roughly $700 billion and $300 billion respectively. The legislation, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," aims to offset tax perks primarily for the wealthy. Critics warn that many people will lose benefits, including those entitled to them, and the bill is projected to add roughly $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. President Trump has stated his desire to curb waste, fraud, and abuse in these programs, with House Republicans seeking to implement new work requirements.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly undertaking a major restructuring of the U.S. National Security Council (NSC), significantly reducing its size and scope. Staff dealing with various geopolitical issues received termination notices, with the intention of granting more authority to the State Department, the Defense Department, and other agencies. The aim is to reduce the NSC staff to just a few dozen people, down from hundreds, as the NSC is the main body used by presidents to coordinate national security strategy. While the NSC staffers who are cut from the agency will be moved to other positions in government, the restructuring is expected to impact the agency's ability to address complex global challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants, including advanced small reactors. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to streamline its rules and approve applications for new reactors within 18 months, while another encourages siting reactors on federal lands and military bases. The administration also set a goal of quadrupling the nation's nuclear power capacity by 2050, declaring a "national energy emergency" to meet growing electricity needs, particularly for data centers. While nuclear power enjoys bipartisan support, concerns remain about safety and waste disposal, and critics fear the White House pressure could cause the NRC to take shortcuts on safety.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to dismiss criminal charges against a top MS-13 leader, Vladimir Antonio Arevalo-Chavez, in order to deport him to El Salvador, igniting accusations that Trump is aiding Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. Arevalo-Chavez has knowledge of a secretive pact between Bukele's government and MS-13, involving concessions in exchange for reduced violence and electoral support. Critics view the deportation as a way to prevent Arevalo-Chavez from testifying in a U.S. court about Bukele's ties to the gang. The Justice Department cited "sensitive and important foreign policy considerations" for the dismissal, while Arevalo-Chavez's attorneys allege the government is supporting a deal with El Salvador to suppress the truth about the negotiations.</p>

Johnson previously escaped in May 2024 with a group of inmates by breaking through the jail's perimeter fence and was found hiding in a dumpster. The latest escape occurred when Johnson and another inmate opened a back door to the jail during a cleaning operation, with Johnson being lifted over the perimeter fence by another inmate. At least four individuals have been placed on administrative leave pending a full review, and the escape comes as authorities continue to search for five of the 10 inmates who escaped from a jail in New Orleans on May 16.</p>

Judge John D. Bates ruled that Trump's directive violated core rights under the U.S. Constitution, asserting that it targeted Jenner & Block based on its causes, clients, and a former employee.

The lawsuit accused the administration of exerting pressure on Harvard for exercising its First Amendment rights, and cited the administration's demands for records of protest activity and disciplinary actions involving international students.

          <p>President Trump hosted a black-tie gala for the biggest buyers of his meme coin, but attendees reported underwhelming experiences, including poor food and lax security. The price of Trump's meme coin plunged 16% following the event, which was attended by crypto influencers, industry executives, and former NBA star Lamar Odom. One attendee described the event as opulent but noted that many attendees were more focused on checking their phones to see if the price moved. Trump made a brief appearance, delivering a short address before leaving on a helicopter, and security was reportedly relaxed after his departure.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court temporarily shielded the Trump administration from a lower court order that required Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to turn over internal documents to a group seeking them under open records laws. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued a temporary stay, allowing the full court to consider an emergency application from the administration arguing that Musk's group should be exempt from public records laws. The administration argues that Musk's group is a presidential advisory body, not a federal agency, and is therefore exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The case stems from a lawsuit filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), seeking information about Musk's team.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. NPH occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. The condition is estimated to affect hundreds of thousands of older Americans, and risk increases with age. Treatment typically involves a surgery called ventricular shunting, and physical therapy may also be used to improve gait stability. The prognosis depends on when the disease is diagnosed, with early diagnosis leading to better outcomes.</p>

The plan involves creating a special development fund that would be used to target a specific area, including vacant lots, the marina, the Hyatt Regency hotel, and other nearby blocks. Carlucci envisions Bay Street as the main walkable corridor connecting Riverfront Plaza to the sports and entertainment district, and wants to emphasize residential development to bring more life to downtown. The proposal seeks to shift the city's development approach by creating a dedicated funding source for a targeted area, rather than reacting to individual projects.</p>
