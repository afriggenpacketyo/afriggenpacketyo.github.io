          <h2>Trump Administration Moves Towards Seabed Mining Despite International Opposition</h2>

          <p>President Trump has directed the U.S. government to aggressively pursue seabed mining, disregarding international treaties and norms. This executive order instructs NOAA to expedite permits for companies to mine in both international and U.S. waters. The move is likely to face strong opposition from other nations who view international waters as protected from such industrial activities. This action reflects the Trump administration's pattern of disregarding international institutions and agreements, prioritizing domestic resource exploitation over global consensus.

          <p>Just Stop Oil (JSO), known for disruptive protests, is ending its campaign of civil disobedience, citing the government's adoption of their demand for no new oil and gas licenses. However, members privately acknowledge that new policing powers targeting disruptive protests have made their operations nearly impossible. The group's actions have faced public backlash and cost the police millions, raising questions about the future of climate activism and the effectiveness of disruptive tactics.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warnings of potential retail shortages are surfacing as the trade war between the U.S. and China escalates, with apparel and footwear being particularly vulnerable. High tariff rates could effectively ban imports, leaving companies with limited options to shift sourcing, potentially resulting in product shortages and price increases. Experts suggest that lower-end stores with lean inventories will be the first to experience empty shelves, especially for items like toys, budget home goods, and fast fashion. The duration of the tariffs will be a key factor in determining the severity and persistence of these shortages. Optimism Score: 45</p>

The company's first-quarter results exceeded expectations, partly due to customers stockpiling chips ahead of tariffs. However, revenue and profit guidance fell below expectations, leading to a stock decline.
