          <p>President Trump announced his recommendation for a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union starting June 1, citing trade imbalances and stalled negotiations, which immediately impacted both U.S. and European stock markets. In a separate announcement, he also threatened Apple with a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the United States, pushing for domestic production. This move signals a significant escalation in trade tensions and a push for companies to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., with analysts estimating substantial cost increases for consumers if Apple were to comply.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the leaders of the UK, France, and Canada, accusing them of siding with Hamas following their condemnation of Israel's expanded offensive in Gaza. This sharp rebuke came after a deadly attack on Israeli embassy staff in Washington, D.C., and amidst rising international concerns over the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Netanyahu blamed the UN's humanitarian chief for inciting the attack and accused the mentioned countries of wanting Hamas to remain in power. The UK has rejected Netanyahu's criticism, reiterating its support for Israel's right to self-defense within international law while also emphasizing the need for aid to reach suffering civilians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security revoked its ability to enroll international students, affecting over 7,000 current visa holders. The lawsuit alleges the ban is a retaliatory measure for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights and rejects government demands to control its governance and curriculum. Harvard argues that the ban destabilizes the university's existence by erasing a quarter of its student body, with the university president condemning the action as unlawful and unwarranted. The administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with demands for records of protest activity involving international students.</p>

          <p>Despite numerous policy changes and reforms implemented after the murder of George Floyd, killings by police officers in the U.S. have actually increased, according to a New York Times article. The Trump administration has dropped efforts to investigate and oversee police departments, and killings by police officers rose from just over 1,000 in 2019 to around 1,200 in 2024. The article suggests that the lack of significant change is due to lawmakers not embracing all proposed reforms and the fact that the changes implemented did not go far enough to transform American policing.</p>

          <p>The New York Times editorial board critiques the Republican domestic policy bill, highlighting its attempt to undermine Obamacare by restricting access to Medicaid through work requirements. This proposal would strip Medicaid benefits from working-age adults without children who cannot prove they work at least 80 hours a month, potentially causing 7.7 million Americans to lose health insurance by 2034. The board argues that health care is a right and that work requirements don't work, citing evidence from Arkansas where similar measures did not increase workforce participation but primarily removed eligible people from coverage due to paperwork issues.</p>

          <p>An international study led by the University of Edinburgh refutes the theory that COVID-19 originated in a Wuhan lab, instead tracing the virus to bat populations in northern Laos and southwest China's Yunnan province. Researchers analyzed 167 bat coronavirus genomes, determining that the virus's most recent ancestor circulated five to seven years before the pandemic emerged. This finding contradicts claims by the White House that a Chinese lab leak was the 'real source' of the pandemic, providing evidence that supports a natural origin.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that clownfish are shrinking in size in response to severe ocean heat waves, a phenomenon observed during a 2023 event off the coast of Papua New Guinea. Scientists found that individual fish got shorter by a few millimeters over weeks, potentially as an adaptation to survive hotter ocean temperatures. The study suggests that being smaller may help clownfish better cope with energy requirements in a warmer climate, with the fish that shrank having a higher chance of survival, adding a layer of complexity to the otherwise dire consequences of climate change on coral reefs.</p>

          <p>A car bombing at a Palm Springs fertility clinic, carried out by Guy Edward Bartkus, revealed the presence of 'pro-mortalist' extremism, an offshoot of anti-natalism, rather than pro-life motivations. Bartkus, who died in the attack, opposed the creation of new life, believing it subjects new consciousness to suffering. While the FBI has classified the attack as terrorism, it highlights a deeper societal anxiety about the ethics of perpetuating human life in the face of suffering and environmental concerns, although these views remain outside the mainstream.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple iPhones made outside the United States, pushing for domestic production. This comes after Apple's supplier, Foxconn, announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations. The president also proposed a 50% tariff on the European Union, stating that discussions with them are 'going nowhere'. The announcement has caused Apple shares to fall and has raised concerns about the feasibility and cost implications of manufacturing iPhones in the U.S.</p>
