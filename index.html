        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A hosepipe and sprinkler ban is now in effect for over 1.4 million South East Water customers in Kent and Sussex due to record-level demand for drinking water. The restrictions follow an extended period of warm, dry weather and several heatwaves, with the firm warning of fines up to £1,000 for non-compliance. This measure is part of a broader trend across the UK, with other water companies also implementing or planning similar bans to manage dwindling water resources. The Environment Agency has confirmed that some parts of the UK are in a state of drought, raising concerns about environmental impacts and wildfire risks.</p>

          <h2>India's Regulatory Action Against Jane Street Highlights Gray Area Between Arbitrage and Market Manipulation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:34:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has accused U.S. trading firm Jane Street of market manipulation, sparking a debate on the fine line between legal arbitrage and illegal market distortion. SEBI alleges the firm used large trades in less liquid markets to influence India's Nifty 50 index for profit in the more liquid options market. Experts note that the key distinction lies in intent, or "mens rea," and whether a firm is creating an arbitrage opportunity by manipulating prices rather than simply exploiting existing inefficiencies. Jane Street disputes the claims, stating its actions were standard index arbitrage, a practice generally seen as beneficial for market efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:01:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has enacted a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all non-immigrant visa applicants, including tourists, business travelers, and students. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and will be collected upon visa issuance, starting in the 2025 fiscal year. The provision allows for reimbursement if travelers comply with their visa conditions, such as not overstaying, but details on implementation remain scarce. Travel industry and immigration law experts have noted significant unanswered questions about how the fee will be collected and how the complex reimbursement process will work.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the heat-seeking abilities of the fire beetle. This biomimetic technology is reportedly capable of detection speeds 20,000 times faster than conventional methods, which could have significant applications in military and industrial sectors. The fire beetle possesses a specialized organ that allows it to detect faint infrared radiation from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away, an evolutionary trait linked to its reproductive cycle. This natural marvel provides a blueprint for creating advanced optoelectronic devices that can perceive motion and detect objects through smoke or dust with high accuracy.</p>

          <p>Despite engaging in multi-front wars and facing domestic political turmoil, Israel's stock market has surged to a record high, outperforming all other Middle Eastern markets since October 2023. After an initial drop following the war's outbreak, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange rebounded, driven by strong foreign investment and renewed investor confidence. The country's robust high-tech sector, which constitutes 20% of its GDP, and a growing defense industry have significantly contributed to this economic buoyancy. Analysts credit the resilience to a perception of diminishing security risks and the fundamental dynamism of the Israeli economy. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the Sheriff's Department does not collect data on inmates' immigration status, and California's sanctuary laws prohibit sharing such information without a federal warrant.

Under the new truce, local Druze factions will manage internal security in the province. The fighting began after tit-for-tat attacks between Druze factions and local Sunni Bedouin tribes who had sided with the government, threatening to destabilize Syria's post-war transition and highlighting deep sectarian tensions in the region.</p>

Public media leaders have condemned the move, warning it will force many local NPR and PBS stations, particularly in rural and underserved areas, to shut down.

Chinese economists speaking at a recent forum highlighted the need to reverse this trend to address economic imbalances and intense, unproductive competition within industries.

          <p>A 39-year-old Canadian man, Shaheer Cassim, has been charged with hijacking constituting terrorism after a security incident involving a small plane in British Columbia. Authorities say Cassim seized control of a Cessna aircraft by threatening a flight instructor at Victoria International Airport and then flew to Vancouver. The incident prompted the scrambling of NORAD fighter jets before the plane landed safely. Investigators believe the suspect acted with an ideological motive to disrupt airspace, with social media posts under a similar name revealing messianic claims and warnings about catastrophic climate change.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a man recounts his harrowing journey with Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD), a rare cancer that began as a persistent itch in his groin. After more than a year of being misdiagnosed with fungal infections, his simple question, "Would a biopsy help?" finally led to the correct diagnosis of invasive cancer. The author details his multiple painful surgeries, the challenges of navigating a fragmented healthcare system, and the profound isolation of battling a little-known disease. His experience motivated him to create the largest online support group for EMPD, turning his personal tragedy into a global resource to raise awareness.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high in May and aligning with economists' expectations. This marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, driven by persistent price pressures. A key factor in the recent easing was a slight moderation in rice price inflation, which had surged earlier in the year. Economists note that while risks remain from a weak yen and potential U.S. tariffs, complicating the economic outlook and the central bank's policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article questions the official explanation that CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is purely financial, suggesting it may be part of a pattern of capitulation to President Donald Trump. The author points to a series of recent events, including CBS settling a lawsuit with Trump and the departure of the head of "60 Minutes," as evidence of the network's owners prioritizing a merger approval over editorial independence. Given that Colbert's show consistently leads in ratings and that he is a prominent Trump critic, the decision is framed as a potential blow to CBS's journalistic legacy.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters has admitted on-air that his program made a mistake in its reporting on a phone call between California Governor Gavin Newsom and President Trump. The admission follows a $787-million defamation lawsuit filed by Newsom, who alleged Watters' show lied about the timeline of the call. In a sarcastic segment, Watters stated he misunderstood a social media post from Newsom and said, "I'm sorry, he wasn’t lying. He was just confusing and unclear."

          <p>Veteran MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the UK's Labour Party after reiterating controversial views on racism during a BBC interview. Abbott stated there is a difference between racism based on skin color and other forms of prejudice, as you cannot always identify if someone is Jewish or a Traveller by sight. This follows a previous year-long suspension for similar comments made in a letter. Abbott, who will now sit as an independent MP pending an investigation, said it is "obvious this Labour leadership wants me out," signaling deep divisions within the party over issues of discipline and antisemitism.</p>

Cristosal has been an outspoken critic of Bukele's widespread crackdown on suspected gang members, which has led to mass incarcerations and alleged human rights abuses.

The sources corroborated Iranian state media reports that Pezeshkian sustained leg injuries while escaping through an emergency shaft during a Supreme National Security Council meeting. It is not yet clear whether the president was an intentional target of the attack. The incident was part of a 12-day conflict between the two nations that also resulted in the deaths of several high-ranking Iranian military commanders and saw U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>Tensions within the Republican party over the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents have complicated efforts to pass a $9 billion spending cuts package demanded by Donald Trump. Democrats have seized on the internal GOP conflict, repeatedly attempting to force votes on measures that would compel the release of the files. The controversy, fueled by conspiracy theories among Trump's base, has put some Republicans in a difficult political position. The procedural maneuvering and infighting delayed the House Rules Committee's work on the rescissions bill, which faced a critical deadline for passage to prevent the funds from being spent.</p>

          <p>China has publicly debuted a new military drone that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) demonstrated its reconnaissance capabilities in a recent drill in a mountainous region. The design, which resembles the U.S. military's V-BAT drone, allows for high-speed flight combined with the flexibility of not needing a runway. The drone is equipped with an intelligent control system enabling autonomous functions like route planning and threat avoidance, which are crucial for potential drone swarm operations.</p>
