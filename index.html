          <h2>Trump Expected to Announce Trade Agreement with Britain</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since imposing tariffs on trading partners. The agreement, eyed since Trump's first term, aims for closer economic cooperation. Details are unclear but may involve lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing taxes on U.S. tech companies. This agreement would be a significant win for both countries, potentially offsetting weaker relations with Europe for Britain and fulfilling Trump's desire for quick trade deals. However, some experts suggest it might be a limited agreement requiring further negotiation.</p>

          <p>Maersk, a major shipping company, has revised its 2025 global container market volume growth forecast due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, particularly U.S.-China trade tariffs. Despite posting stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit, Maersk warned that current tariff levels could restrict global container market volumes. The company now projects container volume growth between -1% and 4%, down from the previous forecast of 4%. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc noted that the issue is primarily a China-U.S. one and hasn't yet affected other trade lanes.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. projects a 34.9% decrease in net profit for the current fiscal year, attributing the downturn to uncertainties created by U.S. President Trump's tariffs.

Despite expecting record sales, operating profit is also projected to decline by 20.8%.

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026. The forecast comes after Nintendo reported a decline in fourth-quarter revenue and profit, which was expected as consumers await the new console. The Switch 2 will start at $449.99 in the U.S. and offer improved features. However, Nintendo delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. due to President Trump's tariffs on countries where its consoles are manufactured, such as Vietnam.</p>

          <p>A new study by researchers from the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force suggests that China's hypersonic weapons could potentially be launched from space-based platforms. These weapons can travel at extreme speeds of up to Mach 20 and strike global targets within half an hour. The analysis corroborates earlier reports from the U.S. about China testing hypersonic weapons released from near-Earth orbit, potentially enhancing the probability of successful penetration of adversary's early-warning systems. This development raises concerns about the compression of response time for defense systems.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that climate change exacerbated the recent deadly storms in the Midwest and South, increasing rainfall intensity by about 9%. Unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, partly due to climate change, fueled the storms, making them 14 times more likely. Researchers also expressed concern about staff shortages at the National Weather Service, which could impact real-time warnings. Without a rapid shift away from fossil fuels, extreme weather events are expected to become more common and intense, posing challenges for insurance markets and community resilience.</p>

Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's office said India's missiles "caused grave danger to commercial airlines" and "endangered lives." India says the nine sites include "terrorist infrastructure," claims Pakistan denies. Flight tracking websites showed many airlines flying over Oman, UAE and Kuwait in light of the attack.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's air defense system shot down a dozen Indian drones overnight, with one attacking a military target near Lahore, causing damage and wounding soldiers. It follows Indian missile strikes on Pakistani locations that killed 31 civilians a day earlier. Tensions between the two countries have spiked since April 22, when gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian Hindu tourists, in India-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan has vowed to avenge the killings, raising fears of a broader conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the clash between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro regarding Donald Trump's domestic and foreign trade policies. It suggests that voters in US allied countries are choosing stability over disruption, possibly in response to the chaotic trade war launched by Trump. Musk's market cap has crashed along with his personal reputation, and he is now disliked or despised by more than half of Americans. It contrasts Musk's slash-and-burn approach with Navarro's foreign trade policy and highlights the influence of economic advisors within the Trump White House.</p>

          <p>Following India's strikes against Pakistan in response to a terrorist attack, both sides are assessing their gains and losses. India claims to have targeted terrorist sites, while Pakistan asserts it downed Indian jets. Diplomats and analysts hope that the day's events might offer an offramp to avert a full-blown war, with some suggesting back-channel conversations have started. India emphasized that its action was limited and targeted, while Pakistan is keeping all options open. The question now is whether both sides have extracted enough to satisfy their people, and on whether sufficient international diplomacy can be mustered in a time of global upheaval.</p>

          <p>The British film and TV industry is concerned about President Trump's proposal to impose 100 percent tariffs on films made in "foreign lands." The industry, still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes, relies heavily on American productions. Uncertainty about tariffs could wipe out progress, potentially leading to empty studios and job losses. The British government is in discussions with the U.S. administration, but trade experts question how such tariffs could be enforced, given the international nature of film production.</p>

          <p>An Israeli military operation has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians in West Bank cities, leading to fears of annexation. The crackdown, targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad, has involved demolishing homes and expanding roads. The extended Israeli presence is undermining the Palestinian Authority's powers. Some Palestinians fear a second nakba, with one resident stating, "I’m afraid I won’t be able to go home like in 1948." The Israeli military denies forcing people to leave, but Palestinians claim they have been threatened with violence if they refused.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie, who died in 1976, has been reanimated with the help of academic researchers and a “digital prosthetic” made with artificial intelligence to “teach” an online writing course with BBC Maestro. Her family, who manage her estate, are fully on board, but others are concerned with the ethics of putting new words into the mouths of the dead. Carissa Véliz, a professor of philosophy and the Institute for Ethics in A.I. at Oxford University, calls the project "extremely problematic," stating, “Agatha Christie never said those words.

Jessica Hyde testified with scientific certainty that McCabe searched "hos (sic) long to die in cold" at 6:24 a.m., not 2:27 a.m. The defense attorney questioned Hyde's testimony and methodology, but the court restricted certain lines of questioning. Keefe's testimony helped prosecutors establish a firm timeline of when and where police found broken taillight fragments, suggesting Read's involvement in the incident.</p>
