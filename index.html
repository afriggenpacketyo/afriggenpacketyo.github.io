          <p>NASA has unveiled its 2025 astronaut class, which notably includes more women than men for the first time. The ten candidates, selected from over 8,000 applicants, bring diverse expertise, including pilots, a geologist, a biomedical engineer, and a former SpaceX launch director. They will now undergo a two-year training program for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and potentially Mars. The selection comes during a period of uncertainty for NASA, with budget cuts and the impending retirement of the ISS, but officials remain optimistic about winning the new space race against China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order designating antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization," directing his administration to investigate and disrupt its activities and funding. The move follows the president's promise to take action after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, though no official link has been established. Legal experts have questioned the order's practical impact, noting that the U.S. lacks a federal statute for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations. The White House cited a history of violence, while critics point out that antifa is a decentralized movement, not a formal group.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing, part of a broader push by major health agencies to phase out research on live animals. This move is supported by an unusual coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan politicians who question the annual federal spending on these experiments. While proponents celebrate the shift towards alternatives like AI modeling, some scientists and patient advocates express concern. They argue that animal testing remains crucial for developing life-saving treatments and that the alternative technologies are not yet advanced enough to fully replace it.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that the FDA will warn physicians about a potential association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism. The administration is recommending that pregnant women limit their use of the drug, which is the active ingredient in Tylenol, unless medically necessary. This announcement was met with significant pushback from medical experts and Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, who cite robust studies showing no causal link. They also warned that avoiding the medication could lead to greater health risks from untreated conditions like high fevers during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report from the National Weather Service has confirmed that a tornado in southeast Utah on September 13 reached EF-2 strength, with wind speeds of 120 mph. The powerful twister was one of two that touched down near Montezuma Creek, lasting for 47 minutes and destroying three homes in the area. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, though some animals went missing. Tornadoes are a rare occurrence in Utah, and this event was unusually strong for the region, which has only recorded a few weak twisters in its history.</p>

          <p>Brittany Aldean, wife of country singer Jason Aldean, shared her experience attending the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was recently assassinated. She described the event, attended by nearly 100,000 people in Arizona, as overwhelmingly faith-based and "weirdly positive" despite the tragic circumstances. Aldean noted that speakers, including former President Trump, focused on Kirk's legacy and the idea that his death could spark a religious revival. She concluded her reflections by vowing to "live like Charlie," inspired by the impact he had on his followers and the conservative movement.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown deadline of September 30 approaching, President Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The meeting comes after competing Republican and Democratic funding proposals failed in the Senate, creating a legislative impasse. Democrats are insisting on a "clean" spending bill that addresses their healthcare priorities, while Republicans argue their proposal is free of controversial provisions. The president has acknowledged the possibility of a shutdown, stating the country could be "closed... for a period of time" if an agreement is not reached.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 to allow President Trump to dismiss Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner. More significantly, the court has also agreed to hear arguments on whether to overturn a nearly century-old precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which protects the independence of federal agencies from direct presidential control. This 1935 ruling established that heads of independent agencies could only be removed for cause, such as misconduct. The dissenting justices warned that this decision could threaten the non-partisan nature of institutions designed to be insulated from political interference.</p>

The administration has also imposed new restrictions on Pentagon reporters and quashed an FBI investigation into a White House advisor.

          <h2>Detained Salvadoran Journalist Faces Imminent Deportation Despite Path to Residency</h2>

          <p>Mario Guevara, a journalist from El Salvador who founded a Spanish-language news outlet in Georgia, is facing imminent deportation after being detained by ICE in June while covering a protest. An immigration appeals board has reopened his 13-year-old immigration case and denied him bond. His lawyers, including from the ACLU, have filed for an emergency hearing, arguing his detention is retaliatory for his reporting and that he has a clear path to permanent residency through his U.S. citizen son. In a letter marking 100 days in custody, Guevara stated that if deported, he would leave with his head held high.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas has caused significant confusion among immigration attorneys and their corporate clients. While the White House clarified the fee applies only to new applicants and not renewals, lawyers point to ambiguities in the proclamation's text that could affect current visa holders who travel abroad. This uncertainty has led some tech companies to advise their H-1B employees to return to the U.S. immediately. Attorneys are advising clients to halt international travel until further guidance is issued, warning the policy will have a "chilling effect" on attracting skilled foreign talent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air on Tuesday, reversing its decision to suspend the show indefinitely. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, which drew threats of regulatory action from the Trump-appointed FCC chairman. The move to pull the show sparked a nationwide debate on free speech, with critics, Hollywood figures, and civil liberties advocates condemning it as censorship. In its statement, Disney explained the initial suspension was due to the comments being "ill-timed and thus insensitive" but that conversations with Kimmel led to the decision to reinstate the program.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new immigration pathway called the "Trump Gold Card," which offers wealthy foreigners a fast track to permanent residency. The program, established by executive order, allows individuals to obtain an employment-based visa by making a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the Department of Commerce. This shifts the focus from the investment-based EB-5 visa, which requires funding American businesses, to a direct payment to the government. Critics argue the policy redefines the American dream as a transaction, valuing personal wealth over the "extraordinary ability" traditionally required for these visa categories.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service in England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their condition does not improve after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to arrange further tests, seek second opinions, or refer to a specialist to prevent avoidable deaths from delayed diagnoses. Health officials hope this "three strikes and rethink" approach will become standard practice and improve patient safety.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan for 2026-2030, the strategic document is drawing attention for how it will navigate rising global tensions and domestic economic challenges. These expansive blueprints have guided the nation's development for over 70 years and are central to achieving President Xi Jinping's goal of becoming a "moderately developed country" by 2035. The next plan will be crucial for laying the groundwork for this long-term ambition. Experts suggest that given the current turbulent environment, Beijing may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over the rigid quantitative targets of the past. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Northern California credit an anonymous tip with preventing a potential school shooting at Menlo-Atherton High School. A student utilized the "Say Something" tip line, created by the Sandy Hook Promise organization, to report concerning online posts from a former student. This led to a swift police response, a campus lockdown, and the detainment of the individual before any violence could occur. According to the organization, this is the 19th credible planned school attack that the reporting system has helped to thwart since its launch in 2018.</p>
