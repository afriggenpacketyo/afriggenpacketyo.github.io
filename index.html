          <h2>Considering Breakthroughs for Clean Energy Transitions</h2>

          <p>An interview with Erin Baker, faculty director at the Energy Transition Institute at UMass Amherst, discusses the future of clean energy. Baker defines breakthroughs not just as inventions, but as points where technology becomes viable, like fracking. She emphasizes the importance of government investment in science and engineering, streamlined grid interconnection, and setting goals for specific technologies to facilitate clean energy progress. She also suggests green bonds could lower borrowing rates for environmentally beneficial projects, while trade wars could slow down development, but not stop innovation.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan will emphasize the benefits of free trade during upcoming tariff negotiations with the United States, despite President Trump's protectionist policies. Ishiba plans to highlight Japan's investment contributions to the US economy, while also addressing concerns about potential tariffs on key exports like automobiles. Opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda criticized the government's approach as potentially too accommodating to the US, advocating for expanding free trade agreements like the trans-Pacific pact to counter protectionism. The discussions are expected to cover non-tariff barriers and foreign exchange policies, with Japan wary of any new Plaza Accord-style agreement to weaken the US dollar.</p>

          <p>China has reportedly invited Japan to form a united front against US President Trump's tariffs, but analysts believe this is unlikely due to Japan's prioritization of its security alliance with the US. Despite facing tariffs on auto exports and other goods, Japan is wary of jeopardizing its relationship with Washington. Some analysts suggest China's proposal may be aimed at undermining Japan's ties with the US, as Japan seeks exemptions from the tariffs while carefully balancing its economic and strategic interests.</p>

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander called the current wait times unacceptable and announced plans to double training capacity for examiners and reintroduce overtime pay incentives. The goal is to reduce waiting times to no more than 7 weeks by summer 2026, and the government will consult on changes to the test booking system to address the issue of test booking bots exploiting learners.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Democrats are launching primary challenges against incumbent House Democrats, driven by dissatisfaction with the party's response to President Trump. These Gen Z and millennial candidates aim to bring fresh leadership to Washington, despite the long odds of unseating established lawmakers. Democratic leaders are divided on supporting these challenges, with some fearing internal conflict while others see it as necessary for the party's future. The challengers are fueled by a desire for bolder action and a belief that the party needs to evolve.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Populist Appeal Wanes Abroad</h2>

          <p>President Trump's initial rise inspired right-wing populists globally, but his aggressive trade policies and confrontational approach are now causing a "Trump slump." Leaders in countries like Canada and Australia, who once embraced Trump-style rhetoric, are distancing themselves from him. Trump's tariffs have become a focal point, pushing populist leaders toward moderation. While some leaders, like Italy's Giorgia Meloni, attempt to balance their positions, Trump's appeal is fading in many countries.</p>

          <p>Scotland is considering a ban on greyhound racing as the nation's last track faces closure. A bill has been lodged in parliament proposing a ban, citing animal cruelty concerns, while trainers and owners defend the sport. Animal welfare charities raise concerns about injuries and euthanasia of unfit dogs. The sport has declined in popularity, and a ban would create an offense of permitting a greyhound to compete at racetracks, with a maximum sentence of up to five years.</p>

          <p>Talks are set to resume to end the seventh week of a strike by Birmingham bin workers, which has led to significant waste accumulation. The strike stems from a dispute over pay and jobs, with recycling and garden waste collections suspended. The government has urged Unite to call off the strike and accept a council offer, as efforts continue to remove the accumulated rubbish. Some residents have reported improvements in waste collection, but challenges remain in addressing the backlog.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered a review of US-funded international organizations, including the IMF and World Bank, raising doubts about the US's future role in these institutions. Project 2025 proposes a US withdrawal from both organizations, labeling them "expensive middlemen." Concerns arise about the potential impact on global financial stability and the rise of China's influence. The US has benefited from these institutions, but Trump's policies and potential withdrawal create uncertainty for the future of the IMF and World Bank.</p>
