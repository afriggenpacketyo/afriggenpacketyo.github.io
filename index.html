          <h2>Traveler Criticizes Hotel Shower Designs for Inconvenience</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A woman's Reddit post criticizing hotel shower designs has gone viral, highlighting frustrations with features like cold water blasts and immovable glass walls. The traveler, addressing male hotel room designers, expressed her need for a way to turn on the shower without getting wet, especially since she doesn't wash her hair every day. Commenters shared similar grievances, including the lack of shower doors and counter space. The post sparked a discussion about amenities geared towards women travelers and the overall hotel room experience, revealing that expensive hotels don't necessarily equate to great shower design, and many travelers want more thoughtful features in their rooms. The shower design flaws can lead to energy waste as guests compensate for the cold with more hot water. </p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Los Angeles led to protests across the city, with dozens arrested in raids conducted in various districts. An ICE spokesperson stated that 118 arrests were made this week, including 44 during Friday's operations, which involved federal search warrants related to harboring undocumented individuals. Protests centered around the Federal Building in downtown L.A., with demonstrators alleging detainees were being held there. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed additional protests in Paramount, where federal law enforcement officers appeared to be conducting another operation, leading to traffic blockades and tear gas deployment. Los Angeles leaders, including Mayor Karen Bass, criticized the federal government's tactics, while U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli defended the operations, stating they would proceed as planned. </p>

It is expected that UCLA will follow other Power Four conference schools in using U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilkenâ€™s back-payment formula as a model for current athletes. UCLA is also committed to preserving its Olympic sports that have provided the lionâ€™s share of NCAA championships in an athletic department widely regarded as one of the best in the nation.

          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, has taken her first flight from the nest, joining her sister Sunny. The eaglet's first attempt was brief, but she quickly gained confidence and soared into the air. Gizmo's flight occurred after several days of practicing, flapping her wings and jumping between branches. The eaglets, born in March, are nearly 13 weeks old and will remain in the habitat for one to three months, returning to the nest periodically. Sunny has continued to visit the nest since her first flight, eating and sleeping at home. </p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that his relationship with Elon Musk is over following a public fallout on social media. The dispute arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a series of exchanges on social media. Trump said that Musk had been "disrespectful to the office of the president" and indicated he had no desire to mend the damaged ties. Musk, who previously donated millions to Trump's campaign, suggested he might support Democratic candidates in future elections, prompting a warning from Trump about "serious consequences". The feud underscores growing divisions between the two figures after a period of close alliance. </p>

          <p>Tanzania's government is facing scrutiny for its crackdown on activists, including the detention and alleged torture of Kenyan and Ugandan activists supporting imprisoned opposition leader Tundu Lissu. Kenyan economist James Shikwati suggests the Tanzanian government fears protests similar to those in Kenya last year. This situation has led to growing fear among Kenyans traveling to Tanzania and has strained relations within the East African Community. Despite support from neighboring countries, Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan faces domestic headwinds, with concerns raised about the country's political culture and human rights. </p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards and Nat Sciver-Brunt began their tenure with a clean sweep over a depleted West Indies side, but the team has tougher tests ahead. England has regularly dominated home bilateral series, but then crumbled on the big stage. Prior to this series, they had won 79.3% of their completed white-ball games at home since 2020, and that number rises to 87.8% when you take out Australia and India. World Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley says that England are in a "good place" because of the dominant manner in which they have been winning, but has this series provided anything to suggest things will be different and whether the "new" England can finally perform under pressure when it matters?</p>
