          <p>Brigham Young University quarterback Jake Retzlaff has formally denied allegations of sexual assault in response to a civil lawsuit filed against him. The lawsuit, filed by a woman identified as Jane Doe, claims Retzlaff assaulted her at his apartment in November 2023. In court filings, Retzlaff's attorneys stated the encounter was consensual and characterized the allegations as false. The response also accuses the plaintiff of extortion, suggesting the lawsuit is motivated by Retzlaff's potential as an NFL Draft prospect. No criminal charges have been filed in the case.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are urgently working to pass a massive budget bill, central to President Trump's second-term agenda, before a July 4th deadline. The 940-page legislation, which narrowly passed the House, proposes extending $3.8 trillion in tax cuts, which would be paid for by cuts to welfare programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The bill has faced divisions within the Republican party, leading to last-minute revisions to appease moderates, including changes to the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap. Democrats have strongly criticized the proposed healthcare cuts, which the CBO estimates could leave millions uninsured. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the week following the U.S. military strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities, the Trump administration has offered evolving descriptions of the attack's success. President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth initially claimed Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated," but subsequent intelligence reports and statements from other officials suggest a more limited impact. The conversation has shifted, with some officials now emphasizing that the primary goal was achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than total destruction of the nuclear sites. This discrepancy has raised questions about the true extent of the damage and the ultimate objectives of the mission.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators, led by students, gathered in Belgrade to demand early parliamentary elections and protest against Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's government. The protesters issued an ultimatum, threatening a campaign of civil disobedience if their call for a snap vote is not met. These ongoing demonstrations were initially sparked by a fatal rail station collapse last year, which was blamed on government corruption and negligence. President Vucic has rejected the demands, accusing foreign powers of fueling the unrest, while his supporters held a counter-rally.</p>

He expressed concern over the location of Iran's highly enriched uranium, presuming some may have been moved before the attack. Grossi called for the swift return of IAEA inspectors to verify the situation and stressed that a long-term diplomatic solution is essential.</p>

The article highlights several recent cases, including the deportation of a veteran's son to a country where he has no citizenship and the detention of a Marine veteran's wife. This trend comes as the White House has allegedly pushed ICE to increase daily arrests, leading to a significant rise in the detention of individuals with no criminal record.

          <p>Recent anti-government protests in Kenya have intensified concerns over press freedom, following a forceful response from security forces and attempts to censor media coverage. Local journalists report that police used live ammunition against demonstrators, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. The government's communications authority issued an order, later revoked by judges, to ban live coverage of the protests, citing incitement to violence.

The article argues that given the rising cost of tuition and the burden of student loan debt, college is no longer a guaranteed path to success for everyone. The author notes that for their son, who is passionate and focused on becoming an airline pilot, a specialized vocational path is a more direct and financially sensible choice.

          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than 250,000 of its 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager vehicles due to a potential problem with the side curtain airbags. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, improperly sealed seams may prevent the airbags from holding sufficient pressure during deployment in certain crashes. The automaker's parent company, Stellantis, stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this defect. Dealers will inspect the vehicles and replace the faulty airbags free of charge, and owners are urged to follow the instructions on their recall notices.</p>

England's chase faltered early, and despite resistance from captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, they were bowled out for 113. The result marks England's heaviest T20 defeat by runs and gives India a strong start in the five-match series.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people marched in the Budapest Pride parade, defying a government ban in what organizers called the largest LGBTQ+ event in Hungary's history. The march was outlawed under a controversial law passed by Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n's party, which prohibits events deemed to "promote" homosexuality to minors. However, Budapest's mayor declared the parade a municipal event to bypass the restriction, despite threats of fines and potential prison sentences for organizers. The large turnout, which included EU officials, was seen as a significant rebuke of OrbÃ¡n's policies and a defense of democratic rights.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, now Red Bull's head of global soccer, has strongly criticized the newly expanded 32-team FIFA Club World Cup, calling it "the worst idea ever."

His comments align with those from players' union Fifpro, which has also raised alarms about excessive workload. Klopp believes the relentless schedule will diminish the quality of the sport if players are not given adequate breaks.</p>

The dispute centers on the historic Preah Vihear temple, a sensitive issue that has previously led to military clashes between the two nations.

          <p>UK authorities have seized 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port in one of the country's largest-ever drug busts. The shipment, with an estimated street value of Â£96 million ($132 million), was discovered hidden beneath shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. The Home Office reported that this is the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record. Officials stated that container ships are a primary method for criminal organizations to smuggle drugs into the UK, which is one of Europe's largest cocaine markets.</p>
