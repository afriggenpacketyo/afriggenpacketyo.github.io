            <p>A Delta Air Lines airplane experienced an engine fire at Orlando International Airport before its scheduled departure to Atlanta, prompting the evacuation of all passengers. No injuries were reported among the 282 customers, 10 flight attendants, and two pilots on board the Airbus A330 aircraft. Delta flight crews followed established procedures to safely evacuate the passenger cabin after flames were observed in the tailpipe of one of the engines. Maintenance teams will conduct a thorough examination of the aircraft to determine the cause of the fire, with the Federal Aviation Administration also investigating the incident.</p>

            <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing the company of deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its Uber One subscription service. The FTC alleges that Uber misled consumers about the subscription's benefits, made it difficult to cancel, and charged users without their consent. The FTC's complaint marks the first action against a major tech company since President Donald Trump began his second term in January, with the agency continuing to scrutinize big tech companies. Uber denies the allegations and asserts that its sign-up and cancellation processes are clear and compliant with the law.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has voiced his support for US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth following reports of a second Signal chat leak involving military attack details. The controversy follows an earlier incident where a journalist was accidentally included in a Signal group chat discussing plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen. The latest reports allege Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen in a chat that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The White House has downplayed the reports, asserting that no classified information was shared, while Hegseth dismissed the news media as "hoaxsters."</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with top executives from major retailers, including Walmart, Target, Home Depot, and Lowe's, at the White House to discuss the impact of his trade policies. The meeting comes as retailers face increasing economic challenges, including consumer sensitivity to prices after years of inflation. Tariffs pose a significant threat to retailers with import-heavy business models, particularly those dealing in discretionary merchandise like clothing and home goods. Walmart, with its larger proportion of domestically sourced goods, may be better positioned than competitors like Target.</p>

Trump claimed there is virtually no inflation and that energy costs are declining. He is reportedly exploring legal options to remove Powell before his term expires in May 2026, although Powell maintains that the president lacks the authority to do so. Analysts predict that any attempt to fire Powell would likely trigger a sharp sell-off in U.S. equity markets.</p>

            <p>The "magic number" to retire comfortably has fallen to $1.26 million, but Americans are increasingly less confident in their ability to reach it. Market volatility and economic uncertainty have contributed to a decline in retirement confidence, with more than half of Americans expecting to outlive their savings. The shift towards relying on retirement savings, rather than traditional pensions, has heightened the importance of financial planning. Concerns about inflation, healthcare costs, and market performance are contributing to the growing anxiety surrounding retirement security. (not investment advice)</p>

It remains unclear when Musk will depart as head of the Department of Government Efficiency; his special government employee status will expire at the end of next month. Meanwhile, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has said that Musk should leave his government role and once again focus his efforts on Tesla, arguing that the company is facing a “code red” moment.</p>

Trump’s tariffs on goods from almost all countries have caused disruption across the world, but trade in goods between the US and China has been most affected, with levies of 145% on US imports and 125% on goods going the other way.</p>

While the Tesla CEO didn't explicitly address an upcoming funding round, the sources interpreted the comments as a sign that xAI is getting set up for a significant capital raise in the near future. The sources also said the company discussed revenue at a potential run rate of $1 billion or more on the call. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Sweeping layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services have significantly reduced the CDC's injury and violence prevention team, jeopardizing the federal government's ability to track injuries. Entire teams focused on motor vehicle crashes, child maltreatment, rape prevention, drowning, traumatic brain injury, and falls in the elderly were eliminated. Researchers warn that the firings could lead to a collapse in the field of injury prevention and a lack of comprehensive surveillance systems. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will continue collecting ER data on injuries related to products, but will stop collecting all the other data because of CDC staff cuts.</p>
