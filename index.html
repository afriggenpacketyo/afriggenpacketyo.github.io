          <p>During a Fourth of July celebration at the White House, President Donald Trump signed a controversial and expansive spending bill into law. The legislation makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent while also implementing significant cuts to social safety net programs, including Medicaid, and increasing funds for immigration enforcement. The bill passed with narrow Republican support, while Democrats heavily criticized the deep cuts to services that benefit low-income Americans.</p>

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is being accused of cultural appropriation after releasing a line of footwear that strongly resembles traditional Indian Kolhapuri sandals without giving credit.

          <p>New scientific research has revealed the significant role of tiny marine animals called zooplankton in mitigating global warming. These creatures consume carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean's surface and then migrate deep into the Antarctic Ocean, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. This natural carbon sequestration process is now understood to be much larger than previously estimated, highlighting the zooplankton as unsung heroes in the fight against climate change.</p>

He argues that embracing the founders' flaws and the era's deep divisions makes their achievements more accessible and inspiring. Burns posits that history is the best teacher for navigating current political polarization by reminding Americans of their shared, complex, and often contentious origins.</p>

          <p>While talks for a potential 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas are reportedly progressing, Israeli military strikes have intensified across Gaza. According to health officials in the enclave, at least 138 Palestinians were killed on Thursday and Friday, with many of the casualties occurring as people waited for humanitarian aid. President Trump has publicly urged Hamas to accept the deal, while Hamas has responded with its own set of demands for a permanent end to the war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deportation of eight migrants to South Sudan has been paused again by a federal judge, adding a new twist to a complex legal battle. The ruling came just hours after a Supreme Court clarification seemed to clear the way for their removal from a U.S. military base in Djibouti. The case, which concerns men with criminal convictions in the U.S. but almost no ties to war-torn South Sudan, has been sent back to the original Boston judge who first intervened, creating further legal uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A joint report from Dutch and German intelligence agencies alleges that Russia has been increasing its use of prohibited chemical weapons, including the WWI-era poison gas chloropicrin, in Ukraine. The findings suggest the use of these weapons has become a standard tactic to force Ukrainian soldiers from their trenches, where they are then targeted by conventional fire. The report has prompted Dutch officials to call for further sanctions against Moscow for its violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.</p>
