          <p>Dallas Cowboys pass rusher Micah Parsons stirred controversy during a preseason game by eating nachos and resting on a training table, actions he later clarified were not disrespectful. These events, coupled with an alleged MRI for soreness, are unfolding amidst a public contract standoff between Parsons and the Cowboys. Owner Jerry Jones and Parsons' agent, David Mulugheta, offer conflicting accounts regarding negotiation attempts, adding layers to the drama. This article highlights the escalating tension surrounding Parsons' future with the team, as he enters the fifth and final option year of his rookie deal, making his trade request public.</p>

          <p>Thousands of St George's and Union Jack flags have appeared on lampposts across various English towns, sparking a debate about national identity and patriotism. This phenomenon began in response to an incident where a 12-year-old girl was prevented from making a speech about being British, while wearing a union jack-themed dress. While supporters cite unity and pride, critics express discomfort, linking the displays to far-right movements and xenophobia, and some councils have removed them. The article explores the complex relationship many Britons have with their national flags and the differing interpretations of their presence in a politically charged time.</p>

          <p>Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo has introduced the Vivo Vision, a mixed-reality headset designed to compete with Apple's Vision Pro. This new device mirrors Apple's design and interface but boasts a significantly lighter weight at 398 grams, approximately 35% less than its rival, addressing a common concern for high-end VR headsets. It features dual 8K resolution OLED displays and is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 Platform, enhancing visual crispness. Currently, the headset operates only with specific Vivo phones and Windows computers, positioning itself as a potentially more accessible alternative in the high-end VR market.</p>

          <p>A disability charity is urging all UK airports to eliminate drop-off fees for blue badge holders, highlighting inconsistencies and complexities in current policies. Many airports offer discounts or waivers, but the system is often difficult to navigate, particularly for those less digitally literate, with some requiring online registration that can take days. Disabled Motoring UK argues that people with disabilities should not be financially penalized for needing close access to terminals. The article details varying airport policies and the challenges faced by disabled passengers, calling for a more respectful and consistent approach across the industry.</p>

          <p>Three previously unknown oil paintings attributed to avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich, potentially worth over £100 million, are on display in Bucharest, but their authenticity faces strong skepticism. The owner claims they were inherited from his wife's grandmother, who received them from her accountant father in Soviet Ukraine, explaining the lack of records due to Stalin-era repression. However, a top scholar notes incomplete provenance records, and an art historian who authenticated them has a history of validating disputed works. The article highlights the ongoing debate and the challenges in verifying the origin of such valuable art pieces.</p>

          <p>Over 50 million Americans in the Western United States are under dangerous heat alerts this weekend, with temperatures soaring into triple digits from Arizona to Washington. Cities like Seattle and Portland, less accustomed to prolonged extreme heat, are expected to see record-challenging highs, with warm night temperatures exacerbating the danger. Concurrently, the same weather pattern is fueling monsoon thunderstorms, increasing flash flood risks and lightning-sparked wildfires in already hot and dry areas of Southern California.

          <p>Former Congressman George Santos, currently serving an 87-month sentence for wire fraud and identity theft, has publicly expressed his dismay over the harsh conditions of federal prison in his "jailhouse diary."

Convicted for swindling donors to fund personal luxuries, he reflects on his "fall from grace" but also expresses a desire to rebuild his future.

          <p>A report indicates that the Pentagon has, since late spring, blocked Ukraine from using US-supplied long-range missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia. This move is reportedly part of a Trump administration effort to encourage peace talks with Vladimir Putin, with the decision-making process involving a "review mechanism" for US and allied long-range weapons. The policy applies to US-made ATACMS and even Britain's Storm Shadow missiles, which rely on US targeting data. This contrasts with earlier Biden administration approvals and has drawn criticism, with Trump having previously called such strikes a mistake.</p>

          <p>Several major European parcel companies, including DHL and national post offices, are temporarily suspending some shipments to the U.S. due to new Trump administration tariff policies. Effective August 29, the "de minimis" rule, which allowed duty-free entry for packages under $800, is being suspended for all countries. Shippers cite ambiguous policies and insufficient time to establish new logistics systems for customs duties and data transmission. The article highlights the significant disruption to international postal logistics, despite bipartisan US support for restricting such shipments due to concerns about lost revenue and illicit goods.

          <p>The UK government is planning significant sentencing reforms that could see convicted criminals barred from pubs, concerts, and sports matches through non-custodial terms. These changes would grant courts powers to impose driving and travel bans, or order offenders to remain in specific areas, aiming to "toughen up community punishments" and deter reoffending. The proposals also include mandatory drug testing for offenders on probation. The article highlights these reforms as part of a broader strategy to cut crime and manage prison overcrowding, following earlier early release programs and a recent review of sentencing policy.</p>
