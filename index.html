          <p>Ireland's Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano by majority decision, winning the third and final fight of their historic boxing trilogy at Madison Square Garden. The bout was a tactical affair, with Taylor boxing smartly and effectively to retain her undisputed light-welterweight championship. Following the victory, the 39-year-old champion acknowledged the significance of the rivalry but remained noncommittal about her future in the sport, stating she would take time to decide her next steps. The event marked a significant moment for women's boxing, featuring an all-female card at the iconic venue.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is currently experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to peak above 30C across large parts of the country. Amber heat health alerts are in effect for southern England, the Midlands, and East Anglia, while authorities have issued wildfire warnings for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The extreme heat has also impacted events like Wimbledon, where play was halted due to spectators needing medical attention. Officials are urging the public to take precautions, warning of potential travel disruptions and the increased risk of drowning as people try to cool off.</p>

          <p>A property developer has been engaged in an eight-year legal battle with companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed's family over a multi-million pound penthouse in Mayfair, London. The dispute, which began over a lift installation, has escalated to include claims of leaky roofs, botched refurbishments, and a noisy lift allegedly run at night to disturb the owner. The article notes this contentious approach is characteristic of Al Fayed's business dealings. It also references previous BBC reporting on allegations against Fayed, including claims from four women who said they experienced sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive surge. After falling behind by six runs, the Dodgers' bats came alive to make the game competitive, but they were unable to complete the comeback. The losing streak is the team's longest since 2017 and has narrowed their division lead to four games. Despite the loss, players and management expressed some encouragement at the offense showing signs of life after a prolonged slump.</p>

          <p>A fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky to face multiple charges. The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of the man, Sedrick T. Stevenson, smiling broadly while being escorted by multiple officers on a plane. Stevenson had been on the run for over a month after slipping away from a transport agent at a ticket counter. Authorities coordinated a multi-agency effort to ensure his secure return, with officials joking that he received "VIP service."</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a camp in Rafah amounts to a plan for a crime against humanity, reflecting a broader collapse of the international legal order. The author contends that international law has never effectively protected Palestinians, citing decades of failed resolutions and unenforced rulings. The article suggests that true accountability for Israel and its allies will come not from legal institutions but from global recognition of Palestinian humanity and resilience. The author expresses hope that the truth of the suffering in Gaza will eventually emerge and haunt the perpetrators.</p>

Palestinian sources accuse the Israeli delegation of deliberately stalling the process without the authority to make key decisions, using the talks to buy time.

          <p>Chinese analysts are observing a growing, though uneasy, alliance between parts of the U.S. tech sector and the 'Make America Great Again' political movement. This trend is marked by increased cooperation between tech firms and the U.S. defense industry, with some tech leaders adopting a more hawkish stance on China. Observers suggest this alignment could lead to a more aggressive U.S. policy aimed at containing China's technological development and furthering decoupling in high-tech sectors.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration raids in several Southern California counties. The ruling sides with a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other groups, which argued that federal agents were using unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests. The judge found there was a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims and enjoined agents from making stops based solely on factors like race, language, or location. The order comes amid heightened enforcement that has instilled fear in local immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>The 2015 song "The Night We Met" by indie band Lord Huron has become an unexpected global sensation, accumulating over three billion streams on Spotify alone. The track, which was not a hit upon its initial release, gained massive popularity after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017. Its momentum continued to build through its widespread use on TikTok, where it has been featured in videos with another three billion views. The song's slow-burning success has made it one of the most-streamed tracks of recent years, surpassing many new hits from major pop stars.</p>

          <p>The British soft toy company Jellycat has abruptly stopped supplying its popular products to around 100 independent shops in the UK, leaving many owners feeling devastated and confused. Retailers, some of whom have stocked the brand for over two decades, received an email stating the decision was part of a "brand elevation strategy" and was not negotiable. The move comes after the brand's popularity surged on social media, which also led to stock availability issues for smaller stores. The affected shop owners feel they are being pushed aside in favor of larger retailers and immersive brand experiences.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Perris, California, has issued a public warning urging residents to stay indoors when possible and be cautious of strangers due to ongoing immigration enforcement operations in the area. In a video message, Mayor Michael Vargas advised the community to remain calm and know their rights, stating they should not go out unless necessary. This guidance comes as intensified federal immigration raids across Southern California have created a climate of fear, particularly in predominantly Hispanic communities like Perris.

          <p>A heated debate is underway in Prague over the future of the historic Vysehrad railway bridge, an iconic 123-year-old steel landmark. The Czech Railway Authority plans to dismantle the bridge, citing corrosion and the need for a new, three-track structure to handle growing rail traffic. However, a coalition of architects, engineers, and heritage campaigners argues that the plan is unnecessary and that the bridge can be repaired and preserved in place. They have garnered public support and an endorsement from Unesco, proposing an alternative that would save the historic structure while still expanding capacity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off more than 1,300 civil and foreign service employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration. The involuntary reductions are part of a larger effort to cut the department's workforce by about 15% and consolidate numerous offices. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the mass cuts will undermine U.S. diplomacy and national security. The layoffs have notably affected bureaus focused on human rights, refugee resettlement, and foreign assistance, sparking alarm among remaining staff and foreign policy experts.</p>
