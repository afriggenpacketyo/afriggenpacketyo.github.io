            <h2>MPs Reportedly Find Some Police Forces Unprepared for Summer Riots</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-13 19:03:56 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A report by MPs has revealed that several police forces were ill-prepared for the outbreak of violence that followed the murder of three children in Southport last summer. The unrest, triggered by the fatal stabbing of Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe, and Alice da Silva Aguiar at a Taylor Swift-themed event, led to 246 events, with 88 deemed significant and some turning violent. While the report commends the officers' "bravery and professionalism" amidst 302 injuries, it emphasizes the need for better anticipation of potential disorder. The report also addresses misinformation spread online and recommends updates to media protocols regarding suspect identification. Optimism surrounding the ability of police forces to adapt and proactively prevent future violence is moderate, though impacts on officers remain.</p>

            <p>Military planners have been deployed to Birmingham to provide logistical support in response to a month-long bin strike by refuse workers. Thousands of tonnes of uncollected rubbish have accumulated on the city's streets, prompting the city council to declare a major incident and request assistance from neighboring authorities. While soldiers will not be directly involved in rubbish collection, a small team of office-based military personnel will offer operational planning expertise. Striking workers are scheduled to vote on a "partial deal" to end the strike on Monday, amid ongoing negotiations and public health concerns.</p>

Ministers have accused the plant's owners of selling existing materials without replenishment, leading to a race against time. Concerns have also arisen regarding the Chinese owner, Jingye, potentially sabotaging the site to increase reliance on Chinese imports. The government is considering offers of raw materials from various businesses, while also scrutinizing Chinese firms' investments in critical UK industries.

            <p>The Trump administration is evaluating new semiconductor tariffs following the temporary lifting of reciprocal tariffs on certain electronics. President Trump and Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett stated that semiconductors are vital for defense equipment and that the administration will investigate under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested the electronics exemptions are temporary, with semiconductor tariffs expected in a month or two. The aim is to incentivize the reshoring of semiconductor manufacturing to the U.S. as a national security measure. (not investment advice)</p>

He emphasizes China's historical narrative of resisting victimization and bullying, suggesting that Trump's tactics are likely to reinforce China's resolve to stand its ground. Brown notes China's efforts to diversify markets and address its technology deficit in response to U.S. pressure.</p>

            <p>Chinese officials are urging the U.S. to completely eliminate President Trump's reciprocal tariffs as the trade war between the two countries continues. Trump announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs but increased levies on Chinese imports to 145%. The U.S. administration also announced temporary exemptions for some electronic products, but suggested these would be replaced by a "semiconductor tariff." The Chinese commerce ministry called the exemptions a "small step" and said it was evaluating the impact of the move. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said there are no plans for Trump to speak with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.</p>

Trump has imposed a 145% tariff on goods imported from China, while China has responded with a 125% tariff on American goods. Greer insisted that the U.S. is working to reshore American manufacturing and trade. When asked if the U.S. is prepared for China to sell assets it holds in the United States, Greer said the issue is that the U.S. has become too dependent on China.</p>
