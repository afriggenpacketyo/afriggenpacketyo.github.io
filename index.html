          <p>Air Canada has postponed its plans to resume flights after its 10,000 striking flight attendants defied a government back-to-work order. The union, CUPE, is demanding a fair negotiated contract, particularly concerning pay and unpaid work hours, and has urged the airline to return to the bargaining table instead of relying on federal intervention. The strike has already caused hundreds of flight cancellations, affecting over 100,000 travelers during the peak summer season and prompting concern from Canadian business groups about the economic impact. The airline now aims to resume services on Monday evening.</p>

          <p>Conservationist Bindi Irwin has revealed she is recovering and healing after undergoing two major surgeries to treat her severe endometriosis, a condition she battled for over a decade. Doctors removed 51 lesions, a chocolate cyst, and her appendix, finally providing relief from years of debilitating pain that she had felt ashamed of as a young woman. Irwin shared her story to raise awareness and encourage open conversations about women's health issues, which are often dismissed or misdiagnosed. She reports that she is slowly regaining her strength and can now function in daily life without constant pain.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that a lasting peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine will require concessions from both Kyiv and Moscow.

He indicated that while progress was made in identifying potential areas of agreement, significant disagreements remain on issues like security guarantees and territorial boundaries. The goal is to advance talks to a point where the leaders can meet directly.</p>

          <p>A coalition of civil liberty and anti-racism organizations, including Liberty and Big Brother Watch, has called on London's Metropolitan Police to abandon plans to use live facial recognition (LFR) technology at the upcoming Notting Hill Carnival. In a letter to the commissioner, the groups described LFR as a mass surveillance tool that treats attendees as suspects and raised concerns about its potential for racial bias and inaccuracy, particularly for women and people of color. The Met Police defended the technology, stating it is accurate, balanced, and a necessary tool to help keep the large-scale event safe.</p>

Crow, a member of the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, argued that the administration failed to apply any meaningful pressure on Putin through economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, or military deterrence. He contended that the red-carpet welcome for Putin was inappropriate for a leader responsible for the war in Ukraine and the kidnapping of thousands of children, calling the administration's "both-sides-ism" a defeat for U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel conducted a "day of stoppage," blocking major highways and closing some businesses to demand the government secure a ceasefire deal with Hamas for the release of remaining hostages in Gaza. The demonstrations, organized by hostage family groups, represent an escalation of public frustration after 22 months of war, with fears that a new military offensive could further endanger the captives. Police used water cannons on crowds and made dozens of arrests, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right cabinet members condemned the protests, claiming they only benefit Hamas and delay the hostages' return.</p>

          <h2>Footballer's Free-Kick Goal Disallowed Due to Attacking Wall Infringement</h2>

          <p>A stunning free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was correctly disallowed by VAR due to a little-known rule infringement. The decision was made because a Crystal Palace player was standing less than one meter away from the defensive wall formed by Chelsea's players at the moment the kick was taken. According to IFAB's Law 13, introduced in 2019, all attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance from a wall of three or more defenders. The rule was implemented to prevent management problems and time-wasting caused by attackers positioning themselves within the wall.</p>

          <p>Award-winning Irish author Sally Rooney has publicly stated she will continue to support Palestine Action, a direct-action group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. Writing in the Irish Times, Rooney declared her intention to use her earnings and public platform to aid the group's activities, stating, "if this makes me a supporter of terror under UK law, so be it." Her remarks come as Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban, citing the group's targeting of arms companies and a manual providing guidance on how to attack targets and evade law enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent investigation and expulsion of several high-ranking officials from China's ethnic minority communities signal a significant shift in the country's anti-corruption crackdown. The downfall of figures like Qizhala, a former Tibetan chairman, and Liu Hui, a former Hui chairwoman, suggests that the previous leniency sometimes afforded to non-Han cadres no longer applies under the current push for strict political discipline. These positions have historically been reserved for ethnic minority members to promote inclusion, but the recent probes indicate that no official is exempt from President Xi Jinping's campaign to enforce party loyalty and combat corruption.</p>

          <h2>Economists Express Concern Over Rising Inflationary Pressures in Recent Data</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A hotter-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI) for July, driven by a surge in services costs, has some economists worried about underlying inflationary pressures, even as markets remain hopeful for an interest rate cut. This trend was also visible in the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI), where firming prices for services reversed a previous softening trend. While recent downward revisions to jobs data support the case for a rate cut, some economists argue the Federal Reserve should be more cautious, pointing to broad-based pressures from wages and energy that could cause inflation to become uncontrolled.

          <p>An analysis of the recent summit in Alaska suggests that Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged in a stronger position, having secured further talks without agreeing to a ceasefire, which was a key U.S. objective. President Trump shifted his stance to align with Putin's preference for a comprehensive peace deal over an immediate truce, a move that could pressure Ukraine into unfavorable concessions regarding territory like the Donbas region. This development has reportedly increased distrust among Ukrainian and European allies, who now face a more perilous negotiating landscape as Russia continues its military operations without facing new consequences.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's deployment of military assets in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles against the wishes of local leaders, mayors of other Democratic-run cities are preparing for similar federal interventions. City leaders are coordinating with police chiefs, governors, and city attorneys to strategize legal and operational responses to what they see as Trump using crime as a pretext to override local authority and create chaos. Mayors like Bruce Harrell of Seattle and Brandon Scott of Baltimore reject Trump's narrative of their cities as "lawless hellholes," arguing it's a political distraction, and are ready to defend their local control.</p>

          <p>Transgender athlete Evie Parts has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA, Swarthmore College, and several athletic department officials, alleging she was illegally removed from the women's track team. The lawsuit claims her removal, which occurred the same day the NCAA implemented a new policy limiting women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth, violated federal Title IX statutes and state law. Parts' complaint details the severe emotional distress caused by the decision, which barred her from coaching, team travel, and wearing the school uniform.

          <p>A recent string of suicides among prominent Chinese entrepreneurs is raising alarm about the immense pressure facing the country's private sector. Since April, at least five business leaders have reportedly taken their own lives, some shortly after being released from detention by anti-corruption investigators. This tragic trend has ignited a national conversation about the need to better protect and support private entrepreneurs, who are often described as resilient but are facing significant challenges. The opinion article argues that authorities must strictly adhere to the law when conducting investigations into business figures to prevent such devastating outcomes.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates a significant portion of the German public anticipates the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party will soon hold a state premiership. The survey found that 43% of respondents expect the AfD to be leading at least one of Germany's state governments by next year, with an additional 25% believing the party could lead several. This reflects the AfD's sustained strength in national polls, where it often rivals the mainstream conservative CDU/CSU alliance. The poll also showed a divided opinion on the "firewall" policy, where mainstream parties refuse to form coalitions with the AfD.</p>
