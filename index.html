          <p>Ten officials in China's Gansu province are under investigation after a probe found they manipulated lead poisoning test results for kindergarten children. The provincial disease control agency and a local hospital are accused of faking data related to the Heshi Peixin Kindergarten scandal. The government has apologized, promising free medical treatment and reimbursement for affected families, highlighting a significant public health and corruption crisis that has shocked the country and prompted high-level accountability measures.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that many companies are using terms like "restructuring" or "optimization" to mask layoffs directly caused by the implementation of artificial intelligence. While firms like IBM and Klarna have been more transparent, many are hesitant to explicitly state AI's role to avoid public and employee backlash. This strategic ambiguity allows companies to pursue automation while managing public perception, even as evidence suggests a strong correlation between AI adoption and workforce reductions in various sectors.</p>

          <p>An 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident, Luis Leon, was secretly deported to Guatemala after visiting an immigration office to replace his lost green card. Leon, a political refugee from Pinochet's Chile who had lived in the U.S. for nearly 40 years, was detained without explanation and sent to a country with which he has no connection. His family was initially told he was dead before discovering he was hospitalized in Guatemala, prompting an investigation by ICE into the highly unusual case.</p>

The article suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to insecurity and anxiety later in life. Fostering self-connection through validating emotions and allowing autonomy builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, which are foundational for mental well-being.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for flouting a 2021 law by restoring the Confederate names to several U.S. Army bases. To circumvent the law, Hegseth claims the bases are being renamed after different historical soldiers who happen to share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes, a move critics call a transparent game. The Republican-led House Armed Services Committee voted to block the action, arguing the Secretary is ignoring Congress and honoring traitors who fought to preserve slavery.</p>

          <p>In an interview about her new memoir, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, reflects on her trailblazing career and the state of American politics. She recounts facing both racism, like Senator Jesse Helms singing "Dixie" to her, and sexism, which she argues is a harder barrier to overcome. Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is "walking around in a daze" in its response to Donald Trump, but remains optimistic that Americans ultimately value democracy.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece posits that to understand America, one must understand Oklahoma, a state built on the collision of land theft, racial violence, and reinvention. The author recounts learning a sanitized history of the state's land runs, which displaced Indigenous nations, and reflects on how this foundational erasure mirrors a national struggle over historical truth. The article argues that Oklahoma's past, including its all-Black towns and the violent suppression of Black ambition, offers a raw, unvarnished portrait of America's contradictions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now believing it is not focused on dangerous criminals. This shift coincides with persistent public concern over the economy, as seven in ten Americans say the administration is not doing enough to lower prices. While the president's base remains strongly supportive, declining approval among the broader public on immigration and inflation has caused his overall approval rating to slide.</p>

          <p>A recent study analyzing Census Bureau data reveals a significant trend of retirees moving out of major U.S. cities, with New York City seeing the largest net loss of residents aged 60 and over. Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and several other California cities also saw high numbers of departures. The exodus appears linked to the high cost of living, as many of these cities are in states where over $1 million in savings is considered necessary for a comfortable retirement.</p>

          <p>An essay by a naturalized U.S. citizen expresses profound fear and uncertainty over the Trump administration's pledge to "maximally pursue" denaturalization cases. The author reflects on how this policy erodes the security of the 25 million naturalized citizens in the U.S., creating a chilling effect on their willingness to exercise First Amendment rights. The piece argues that this push, combined with challenges to birthright citizenship, undermines the core constitutional principle that citizenship is a permanent right, not a privilege revocable by the president.</p>

          <p>The electoral defeat for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition is complicated by the surge of the right-wing populist Sanseito party. Formerly a fringe movement, Sanseito gained significant traction with its "Japanese First" rhetoric, anti-immigration stance, and criticism of globalism, winning at least seven seats in the upper house. This shift in the political landscape indicates growing populist sentiment in Japan, adding another layer of complexity for Prime Minister Ishiba as he vows to remain in power.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United States' recent trade arrangements with Southeast Asian nations signal a strategic shift away from partnership and toward a rent-seeking model. Washington is accused of monetizing access to its market by imposing higher tariffs and mandatory purchases rather than fostering mutually beneficial integration. This transactional approach, the article contends, threatens to undermine the economic competitiveness and sovereignty of ASEAN members, turning them into "fee for access" economies instead of strategic partners.</p>

          <p>A report from the Lowy Institute indicates that China's influence in Southeast Asia is increasing, largely due to its role as the region's primary infrastructure financier. This growth comes as the United States and European nations are significantly cutting their foreign aid budgets, creating a vacuum that Beijing is well-positioned to fill. With Western development finance declining, the report suggests the region's "center of gravity" is shifting east, enhancing China's strategic position through projects like high-speed rail links.</p>

          <p>A new workplace trend dubbed "quiet cracking" is reportedly affecting one in five employees, describing a state of persistent burnout, stagnation, and disengagement. Unlike "quiet quitting," this phenomenon is harder to detect as performance doesn't immediately decline, but it stems from feeling unappreciated and lacking career growth opportunities. Experts suggest that this disengagement costs the global economy trillions and can be mitigated by employers through better recognition, manageable workloads, and clear paths for learning and development.</p>

          <p>Critics and scientists argue that President Trump's second-term energy policy is setting back environmental progress by decades. The administration has aggressively promoted oil, gas, and coal production while cutting green energy initiatives, often justifying these moves with a declared national energy emergency. This push for fossil fuels, coupled with budget cuts for climate research at agencies like NOAA, comes amid an increase in climate-related disasters and is seen as a dangerous, politically motivated rejection of scientific evidence.</p>
