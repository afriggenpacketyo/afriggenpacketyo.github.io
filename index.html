          <p>State inspectors in Texas approved an emergency disaster plan for Camp Mystic just two days before catastrophic flash floods on the Guadalupe River resulted in numerous fatalities, including many children. Records indicate the camp met state regulations for disaster procedures, but the specifics of the plan are not detailed, raising questions about its adequacy. Despite receiving National Weather Service flood warnings more than 12 hours in advance, the camp, which hosted over 650 people, did not evacuate to higher ground. The tragedy has intensified scrutiny over the preparedness of camps in the flood-prone Texas Hill Country region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to impose additional tariffs on imports is raising concerns of a sharper economic downturn for key Asian allies, South Korea and Japan. Both export-dependent nations are already grappling with slowing growth, and the new tariffs would heavily impact their crucial auto and steel industries. The U.S. is a top export market for both countries, with exports accounting for significant portions of their respective GDPs. Economists warn that the tariffs could push Japan's economy toward recession and have already caused South Korea's central bank to slash its 2025 growth forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 22:19:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, is legally challenging the Trump administration's use of emergency tariffs, arguing the president has overstepped his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). In an amicus brief, Cato contends that the president's actions undermine the constitutional separation of powers by allowing the executive branch to impose tariffs without a clear limiting principle. The case stems from steep tariffs imposed on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada, which have created uncertainty and financial strain for small businesses reliant on imports. The legal battle questions the extent of executive power in trade policy.</p>

          <p>At 80 years old, John Fogerty gave an explosive and powerful rock-and-roll performance at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The concert heavily featured classics from his time with Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), whose song rights he fully regained two years ago after a long legal battle. Despite his age, Fogerty's vocal performance remained remarkably consistent and strong, and he played guitar for the full two-hour show without a break. The performance showcased the enduring power of his iconic songs like "Bad Moon Rising," "Fortunate Son," and "Proud Mary," reaffirming his legendary status.</p>

          <p>Four days after deadly flash floods struck Central Texas, Governor Greg Abbott confirmed that at least 161 people are still missing in Kerr County alone, with the death toll rising to over 100 statewide. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, utilizing helicopters, drones, and hundreds of responders, but officials acknowledge the scale of destruction is immense. Questions are being raised about the adequacy of warnings and evacuation orders, though the governor described the event as an unforeseeable "30-foot high tsunami wall of water."

          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) fell by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, its largest drop in nearly two years and a signal of deepening deflationary pressures. This decline was worse than economists' expectations and marks a prolonged deflationary trend since late 2022. The drop is attributed to a fierce price war among companies and tepid consumer demand. In contrast, the consumer price index (CPI) showed a slight recovery, rising 0.1%. The data underscores the economic challenges facing Beijing as it struggles to stimulate domestic consumption amid a difficult global trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Antle, 65, pleaded guilty to illegally buying and selling endangered species, including cheetahs, lions, and a chimpanzee, for his Myrtle Beach zoo. Prosecutors stated he also laundered over $500,000, which was connected to a human smuggling operation, to obtain cash for the illegal animal purchases. In addition to prison time and a fine, Antle was ordered to forfeit three chimpanzees and over $197,000.</p>

          <p>Several Instagram users have reported extreme stress after their accounts were wrongly banned by parent company Meta for allegedly violating rules on child sexual exploitation. The BBC highlighted cases where users had their accounts permanently disabled, only to be reinstated after journalistic inquiry, with Meta apologizing for the error. The incidents have drawn attention to a petition with over 27,000 signatures, which criticizes Meta's AI-powered moderation system and its "unfit for purpose" appeals process. The false accusations have caused significant emotional distress and, for some, a loss of income and personal memories.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a decision stemming from a national security investigation into the metal's supply chain. Copper is a critical component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction, and the U.S. imports roughly half of its annual consumption. The move, which follows similar levies on steel and aluminum, caused domestic copper prices to jump to a record high. The decision is part of a broader administration strategy to use tariffs to protect and bolster American industries. (not investment advice)</p>

Following the meeting, Netanyahu stated that Israel must still finish its military campaign but affirmed that negotiators are working on a deal.

          <p>The deadly flash floods in Texas have brought renewed attention to significant staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA, under the Trump administration. Since February, the NWS has lost approximately 600 staff members, raising concerns about the agency's capacity to handle catastrophic weather events. While experts believe the NWS performed well in forecasting this specific storm, they warn that continued staff shortages could compromise future responses. The incident highlights a potential vulnerability in the nation's weather alert system, particularly as one key liaison role in the affected region was recently vacated.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind energy capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A report from Global Energy Monitor projects China will account for more than half of all new global offshore wind capacity this year, with another 22 GW already under construction. This surge is driven by strong government support, including subsidies and strategic planning, as part of President Xi Jinping's push to advance the nation's "marine economy." The expansion is seen as a key driver for job creation, energy security, and economic growth in coastal provinces.</p>

          <p>To combat a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in UK criminal courts, former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended a series of "fundamental" reforms, including the use of judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud. The proposals aim to prevent a "total system collapse" by streamlining the justice process, which currently sees some victims and defendants waiting years for a trial. Other suggestions include creating a new court division for less serious offenses and increasing sentence reductions for early guilty pleas. The proposal to limit jury trials has sparked debate among barristers about the right to be tried by one's peers.</p>

This analysis suggests that a "playbook that shields predators," including the misuse of NDAs and fears of being blacklisted, contributes to a culture of silence across the music business. Within hip-hop specifically, some argue that a desire to protect the genre from racist stereotypes can make it even harder for survivors of abuse to speak out.

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an Instagram post by TV personality Gemma Collins for illegally advertising a prescription-only weight-loss drug. The post promoted the brand Yazen, a service that combines prescription medication with a lifestyle app. It is illegal to advertise such medications directly to the public in the UK. The ASA ruled that although a specific drug wasn't named, the ad's references were a clear breach of the code.

The piece notes the history of deadly floods in the area and past failures to implement better warning systems.
