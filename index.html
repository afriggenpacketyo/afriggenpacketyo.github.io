          <p>California and 23 other states are suing the Trump administration over cuts to CDC infectious disease funding.  The lawsuit alleges that the administration is illegally overreaching its authority by suspending billions of dollars in grants already allocated by Congress. The cuts are expected to severely impact state public health programs and initiatives.  The lawsuit seeks to immediately restore the funding and highlights broader concerns about federal budget cuts under the Trump administration.</p>

          <h2>Car Manufacturers Fined for Withholding Recycling Information</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ten car manufacturers and two industry groups were fined a total of nearly £78 million for withholding information about vehicle recyclability.  The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that the companies had colluded to conceal information from customers for 15 years, breaching EU law.  The CMA stated that the carmakers also agreed not to pay companies to handle the recycling of their customers' vehicles once the cars were considered at the end of their lives.  The companies have settled with the CMA and admitted to their illegal actions.</p>

          <p>A volcano erupted in south-west Iceland, prompting the evacuation of residents and tourists from the nearby town of Grindavik and the Blue Lagoon.  The eruption created a large crack in the ground, spewing lava and smoke.  While volcanic activity eased later in the day, roads remain closed.

          <p>Airline stocks fell on Tuesday due to concerns about weaker-than-expected travel demand.  Jefferies downgraded Delta Air Lines, citing concerns about reduced travel among price-sensitive consumers.  The decline reflects broader anxieties about the impact of looming tariffs and a drop in consumer confidence on the airline industry.

          <p>A study reveals that approximately one-third of Americans have stopped buying eggs due to record-high prices.  Consumers report they won't resume purchasing eggs until prices drop below $5 per carton.  The increase in egg prices is largely attributed to the ongoing bird flu outbreak.  The issue has become a political talking point, despite the primary cause being a viral disease outbreak.</p>

          <h2>The Unexpected Alliance: Nationalist and Tech Right in the MAGA Era</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-01 13:31:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ideological differences, the nationalist and tech wings of the MAGA movement remain surprisingly aligned, united by their opposition to “wokeness.”  While personalities like Steve Bannon express distrust of tech elites like Elon Musk, practical alliances persist, particularly in efforts to reduce government spending and curb perceived liberal agendas.  This uneasy alliance mirrors historical precedents like “fusionism,” where diverse conservative factions found common ground against a shared enemy. The long-term stability of this coalition, however, remains uncertain due to power imbalances between the two factions.</p>
