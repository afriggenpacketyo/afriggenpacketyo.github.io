          <p>President Trump has announced that gold will not be subjected to tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The initial ruling would have applied a 39% duty on certain gold bars imported from Switzerland and other countries, which caused concern in the precious metals market. Following the president's announcement on Truth Social, gold futures experienced a significant drop. This decision alleviates fears from organizations like the Swiss Precious Metal Association, which had warned of negative impacts on the international flow of physical gold.

While Ukrainian President Zelenskyy might receive an invitation, Europe remains shut out of direct talks that could involve territorial concessions. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, warned that an aggressor should not be rewarded for aggression. In response, European officials are scrambling to consult with the U.S. and present a united front before the high-stakes meeting takes place.</p>

          <p>Ford is investing $5 billion to pivot its electric vehicle strategy towards affordability, announcing plans for a new midsize electric pickup truck starting at around $30,000. The initiative involves retooling its Louisville, Kentucky plant and focusing on a simplified vehicle platform to reduce costs and complexity. This move comes as the U.S. EV market faces headwinds, and Ford aims to compete with lower-priced Chinese models by innovating its manufacturing process. The company's CEO, Jim Farley, framed the ambitious plan as a critical bet on making profitable, accessible EVs an existential priority.</p>

The union faces a challenging environment two years after a lengthy strike, with Hollywood studios cutting back on production. Drescher, who was the prominent face of the 2023 strike, leaves a legacy of securing a contract with significant gains and pushing for legislative protections against AI.</p>

          <p>A series of explosions at the U.S. Steel Clairton plant has resulted in at least one death, ten injuries, and one employee initially reported as missing. The incident, which occurred in the "reversing room" of a coke oven battery, prompted a major emergency response and a search and rescue operation. While the plant has since been stabilized, the Allegheny County Health Department advised nearby residents to remain indoors as a precaution. U.S. Steel has stated that its top priority is the safety of its employees and is working with authorities to investigate the cause.</p>

          <p>In a satirical piece from The Atlantic, the White House undergoes a dramatic, Trump-style renovation in a parody of the show "Extreme Home Makeover." The fictional project, led by J.D. Vance, aims to transform the "yucky" and "haunted" residence into a gold-laden palace suitable for a monarch, complete with a Smaug-like hoard and an Au Bon Pain-style patio. The humor targets Trump's aesthetic preferences, his political allies, and his desire to create a permanent family dynasty.

          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that U.S. homeowners' tappable equity has hit a new record of $11.6 trillion, with the average owner having access to $213,000. This surge presents homeowners with several options for borrowing against their property's value. Among the most effective methods are home equity loans, which offer a lump sum at a fixed rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a flexible credit line. For seniors, a reverse mortgage can provide funds without requiring monthly repayments, making it another viable option in the current high-equity environment. (not investment advice)</p>

The president has been dismissive of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's role in the talks, suggesting the next meeting could involve all three leaders but emphasizing his initial one-on-one with Putin.

          <p>A study of a recent major earthquake in Myanmar on a fault similar to the San Andreas suggests that California's next "Big One" may not follow expected patterns. Researchers at Caltech found that the magnitude 7.7 Mandalay earthquake ruptured a much longer section of the fault than anticipated, including segments that had broken relatively recently. This implies that earthquakes do not necessarily repeat in the same way, and long-dormant sections of a fault are not the only areas at risk. The findings challenge predictive models and indicate that a future San Andreas quake could be more complex and widespread than historical events.</p>

          <p>An anti-surveillance advocate argues that mandating facial recognition and ID checks for online services creates a false sense of security and undermines privacy. The author highlights how easily he bypassed the verification on a dating app, Tea, even after it suffered a major data breach. The article criticizes new laws like the UK's Online Safety Act and similar U.S. proposals, which force platforms to implement invasive age verification. These systems are often circumvented and create new risks by centralizing sensitive user data, transforming the open internet into a tracked environment without effectively protecting users.</p>

          <p>A recent research note from Melius Research has prompted a downgrade of Salesforce's stock rating, highlighting the disruptive threat of artificial intelligence to the traditional software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. The analysis argues that as AI makes workers more productive, companies will need fewer costly software "seats," directly impacting the revenue models of firms like Salesforce. While Salesforce is actively developing its own AI solutions, it faces the significant challenge of adapting its core business in a deteriorating market landscape. The stock's struggles in 2025 are attributed to these growing concerns about its future viability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive new study warns that the global transition to clean energy could face significant shortages of up to 12 essential minerals by 2100, even under moderate emission-reduction scenarios. The technologies vital for weaning the world off fossil fuels, such as batteries and solar panels, depend heavily on materials like lithium, cobalt, and tin. However, the article also notes that fears of "peak mineral" may be overstated, as rapid technological innovation is already creating substitutes. For example, new battery chemistries are reducing or eliminating the need for cobalt, suggesting that market forces and ingenuity could mitigate these projected shortfalls.</p>

          <p>A Romanian citizen who overstayed his visa has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for orchestrating a scheme that stole food and cash aid from thousands of low-income Californians. Catalin-Marius Graur used sophisticated skimming devices on ATMs and point-of-sale machines to capture Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card information across Southern California. He then created fraudulent cards to drain funds from programs like CalFresh and CalWORKS. At his arrest, he possessed nearly 1,500 stolen account numbers, part of a broader criminal operation that officials say targeted vulnerable welfare recipients.</p>

          <p>For beginner investors navigating an unusual economic climate, gold can serve as a valuable portfolio diversifier and a hedge against inflation. However, several factors should be considered before buying. Beginners must evaluate their short-term financial goals, as gold is more of a wealth protector than an income generator. They should also be mindful of the metal's price volatility, which is currently near record highs. Finally, determining the appropriate allocation for diversification is key, and consulting a financial advisor can help create a personalized strategy for incorporating gold into a broader investment plan.

The move has already boosted season ticket sales, but experts like former player Jamie Noon warn that a return to a star-studded roster may be slow. Due to the timing of the recruitment cycle and salary cap constraints, the new owners will likely focus on a long-term project rather than immediate, high-profile signings. The acquisition is seen as a major vote of confidence for the league, which hopes to attract more corporate investors.</p>

          <p>This article provides a guide for individuals whose bank accounts have been frozen by a debt collector, a common but jarring collection tactic. The first step is to contact the bank to confirm the freeze and gather information about the court order. It is essential to review the judgment for errors and determine if any funds, such as Social Security benefits, are legally exempt from seizure. Other proactive steps include negotiating directly with the debt collector for a settlement or payment plan, and in severe cases, considering professional debt relief or bankruptcy to regain financial control.</p>
