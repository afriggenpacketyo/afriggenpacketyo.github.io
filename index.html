            <p>The Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have approved Capital One Financial's $35.3 billion all-stock acquisition of Discover Financial Services. Regulators evaluated the application based on financial and managerial resources, community needs, and competitive and financial stability impacts. Capital One anticipates closing the deal on May 18, with Capital One shareholders holding 60% and Discover shareholders owning 40% of the combined company.

            <p>The White House released a split-screen image contrasting President Trump comforting the mother of a murder victim killed by an illegal immigrant with Senator Van Hollen meeting with a deported illegal alien in El Salvador. The deported individual, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was deported by the Trump administration, which claims he is an MS-13 gang member. Van Hollen has criticized the deportation as unjust and advocated for Garcia's release, leading to a sharp rebuke from the White House. This visual juxtaposition underscores the starkly different approaches and priorities of Republicans and Democrats regarding immigration enforcement and immigrant rights.</p>

            <p>A 3-year-old girl in Mexico died from respiratory complications after contracting the H5N1 bird flu virus, specifically the D1.1 strain, according to the World Health Organization. This strain has been circulating in wild birds across North America and has been detected in dairy herds in the U.S. Health officials are investigating the source of the child's infection, and while contacts have tested negative, the case highlights the ongoing risk of H5N1 transmission from animals to humans. Health officials maintain that the risk to the general public remains low, but the virus continues to circulate in various animal populations.</p>

            <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reportedly considering plans to end most of its routine food safety inspections, potentially outsourcing this oversight to state and local authorities. This shift could free up FDA resources to focus on higher-priority and foreign inspections, with some FDA employees having worked on this transition for years. While the FDA denies suspending routine inspections, the agency already contracts with many states for some inspections. Concerns remain about the consistency and funding of food safety oversight across different states if this plan is implemented.</p>

            <p>The US is prepared to cease its efforts to broker a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine if clear signs of a settlement are not evident soon, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump is still interested in a deal, but has other priorities. Bloomberg reports that a US proposal would freeze the war along existing frontlines, allowing Russia to retain occupied territory while preventing Ukraine from joining NATO. Ukraine's first deputy prime minister indicated that a memorandum had been finalized, paving the way for an investment fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine.</p>

            <p>Art Spiegelman, known for his novel Maus, highlights the unique heritage of comix, a blend of art and writing rooted in 1960s counterculture and alternative press. Influential figures like Jules Feiffer and R. Crumb paved the way for this genre, with Crumb delving into the depths of his subconscious to tap into the American psyche. Diane DiMassa's Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist, drawn in the 1990s, offers a world of unrestrained havoc from a different perspective. The Atlantic explores the dark weirdness and cultural impact of these underground comics.</p>

            <p>Experts fear that the Trump administration's tariff war with China poses a threat to America's long-term geopolitical relationships and global authority. While Trump argues that tariffs will bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., economists worry that his policies will upend the balance of world power and weaken the U.S. position. A global trade war could undermine international consensus on non-economic issues and threaten world peace. Some historians stress that historic alliances are unlikely to be reversed quickly, but the potential for fragmentation and multi-polarity is a concern.</p>

            <p>President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve and his implementation of sweeping global tariffs are raising concerns about potential economic disaster. Trump has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell and threatened to remove him, potentially manipulating the Fed to increase growth. The tariffs, equivalent to a 28% sales tax on foreign goods, are hurting farmers, small businesses, and consumers. Experts warn that these policies could lead to a recession, financial crisis, and a permanently lower growth trajectory for the country (not investment advice).</p>

Abrego Garcia's lawyers deny any gang affiliation, while his wife has been fighting for his return, saying the photo released by Van Hollen was the first time she had seen him since his deportation.</p>

            <p>New tariffs, including those on vehicles and parts, are expected to push auto insurance rates even higher. The tariffs are increasing the cost of maintenance and repairs, which in turn affects insurance premiums. Even drivers with liability-only coverage will likely see their rates increase as the cost to repair other vehicles rises. While insurance rates had started to stabilize after the pandemic, the introduction of tariffs has created uncertainty and is expected to reverse that trend. (not investment advice)</p>
