          <p>Reports indicate that over twenty Palestinians were killed near a Gaza aid distribution site, with witnesses claiming Israeli forces fired upon them as they awaited food; Hamas reported a higher death toll and accused naval warships, tanks, and drones of firing from all directions. The incident occurred amidst a monthslong Israeli blockade that has caused severe food shortages, sparking international outrage. Controversy surrounds the Israeli government's aid efforts, with the UN reporting minimal deliveries that failed to reach those in need, while the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation claims successful distribution without incident, dismissing reports of deaths and injuries as false. Local health officials have previously reported deaths and injuries at GHF distribution sites due to live fire. Optimism regarding the situation in Gaza remains low due to ongoing conflict and aid delivery challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, an associate of Elon Musk, to lead NASA after a "thorough review" of Isaacman's "prior associations;" the White House did not immediately respond to requests for clarification. Isaacman, the CEO and founder of Shift4, a credit card processing company, has collaborated closely with Musk, buying chartered flights on SpaceX and conducting the first private spacewalk. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved Isaacman's nomination in late April, but a full Senate vote was pending. Musk expressed disappointment over Trump's decision, praising Isaacman's competence and good-heartedness, while Trump plans to announce a new nominee aligned with his space agenda.</p>

          <p>Two individuals have died and hundreds have been arrested across France following Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) fans' celebrations of the club's Champions League final victory. A 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death in Dax, while a 23-year-old man died in Paris after being hit by a vehicle; flares were set off, bus shelters smashed, and cars torched amid the celebrations. The French interior ministry reported 192 injuries and 559 arrests, including 491 in Paris, where clashes occurred near the Champs-Élysées avenue and PSG's stadium. While most fans celebrated peacefully, approximately 5,400 police were deployed across Paris in anticipation of the raucous celebrations, with riot police using water cannons and tear gas to control crowds.</p>

          <p>China maintained a low profile at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's largest security summit, with the absence of its defense minister and the cancellation of a plenary session on China's security; the rebuttal to American messaging was led by the country’s military academic institutions. The absence of Defence Minister Dong Jun meant there were no bilateral talks between China and other countries, including the US, at a time when Beijing faces concerns about its military strength. Other countries also sought to hold talks on the sidelines of the forum but were told that the Chinese delegation was not conducting bilateral engagements during the dialogue. This departure from customary engagement has prompted speculation about China's strategic intentions.</p>

          <p>Russian officials are investigating the overnight collapses of two bridges in regions bordering Ukraine as "acts of terrorism," attributing them to explosions. In the Bryansk region, a blast caused a road bridge to collapse onto a railway line, derailing a passenger train and resulting in seven deaths and over 70 injuries. A separate rail bridge in the Kursk region was blown up hours later, derailing a freight train and injuring the driver; authorities have not identified the perpetrators. Senior ruling party lawmaker Andrey Klishas blamed Ukraine, though Ukraine has not yet commented, and Russia has faced numerous sabotage attacks since the start of its military actions in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Iranian Foreign Minister spoke with the director of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency after a report indicated Iran is increasing its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. The Iranian Foreign Minister emphasized Iran's "continuous cooperation" with the IAEA, while the IAEA reported that Iran's cooperation has been "less than satisfactory" regarding uranium traces at undeclared sites. Iran's deputy foreign minister rejected many of the report's findings, stating that all of Iran's nuclear activities are under IAEA monitoring and that Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons. As of May 17, Iran has amassed 408.6 kilograms of uranium enriched up to 60%, marking a significant increase since February.</p>

          <p>ASEAN is at a critical juncture, caught between the US-China trade war, but has an opportunity to assert itself as a linchpin in global trade and geopolitics. With China and ASEAN finalizing negotiations to upgrade their free-trade agreement, aiming to deepen economic integration, Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is pressing for an ASEAN-US meeting to discuss tariffs. Asean's unique position of being geographically central, economically vibrant and diplomatically neutral allows it to shape trade rules rather than merely adapt to them. This opportunity hinges on Asean’s ability to exploit the US-China rivalry, fostering a neutral, inclusive trade ecosystem that prioritizes regional resilience and strategic autonomy.</p>

Critics, including parents, conservative activists, and President Trump, have called for Hernandez to be barred from competing, while a plane flew over the stadium with a banner reading "No boys in girls' sports".

Sociologists Marita Jacob and Ansgar Hudde's research, based on data from the European Social Survey, reveals that parents generally feel more fulfilled but are often more dissatisfied with their lives. The study highlights that life satisfaction levels depend significantly on both living situations and family policies, with Scandinavian countries showing less disparity between parents and childfree individuals. Greater gender equality and comprehensive family support systems in Scandinavia contribute to higher parental satisfaction compared to central and eastern Europe.</p>
