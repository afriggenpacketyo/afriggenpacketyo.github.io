          <p>Tensions between China and the Philippines have heightened following a confrontation near Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands. The Chinese coastguard deployed water cannon against two Philippine vessels, claiming they had illegally entered waters near Subi Reef and Sandy Cay. China asserts that the Philippine vessels landed personnel on Sandy Cay and approached a Chinese ship dangerously, leading to a collision. The Philippines has been urged to cease its infringing actions, as China vows to continue its law enforcement activities in the disputed waters. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year. This translates to an annual bill decrease of Â£129 for a typical household, bringing the average bill down to Â£1,720. The decrease reflects a fall in international wholesale gas prices, but charities warn that many people are still struggling with energy costs and debt. While this offers some relief, prices remain higher than previous years, and customer debt to suppliers remains a significant concern. </p>

The taunt feeds into the fear that someone has a job that could have been yours, undermining confidence and promoting doubt.
