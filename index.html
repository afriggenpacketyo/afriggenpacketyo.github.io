          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S.-led ceasefire proposal for Gaza, aiming for a permanent ceasefire and complete Israeli military withdrawal. The group seeks the "unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid" into Gaza, and the release of 10 living Israeli hostages and the remains of 18 hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. A senior Hamas official noted that there are "some notes and amendments to some points, especially on the U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces." The United Nations has reported severe food shortages in Gaza, with desperate civilians intercepting aid trucks due to the ongoing blockade and humanitarian crisis.

          <p>The European Union has criticized President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%, warning that it undermines efforts to reach a negotiated solution in the ongoing trade war. An EU spokesperson stated that they are prepared to impose countermeasures in response to the tariff increase. The United Steelworkers union also criticized Trump's announcement, calling it a direct attack on Canadian industries and workers. Trump's announcement came after signaling his approval of a controversial deal between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, with assurances of no layoffs or outsourcing. The optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>Former First Lady Michelle Obama is facing backlash for stating that creating life is "the least" of what a woman's reproductive system does, during a podcast episode with OB/GYN Dr. Sharon Malone. She argued that women's reproductive health is about their life and the complex reproductive system, emphasizing that it functions healthily when streamlined. Critics, including pro-life activists, have condemned her remarks, with some calling motherhood a beautiful and powerful gift.

          <p>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is exploiting traditional Christian culture and values to appeal to voters, particularly by stoking fears about Islam and social change. Although not particularly religious themselves, AfD leaders like Alice Weidel engage with right-wing media figures who promote Christian viewpoints. Experts suggest this is a strategic move to align with mainstream values and capitalize on anxieties about cultural identity.

          <p>Donald Trump's recent pardons of rapper NBA YoungBoy and gangster Larry Hoover have been criticized as a cynical ploy to garner support from the Black community. The article argues that these pardons are not magnanimous but rather an attempt to appeal to Black voters. Trump has previously suggested that Black people support him because they, like him, have been mistreated by the criminal justice system. The author contends that Trump's actions are insulting and a means to an end where he always benefits. The optimism score is 30.</p>
