          <p>Donald Trump defended his administration's plan to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 as a gift from Qatar to replace Air Force One, calling it a transparent transaction. Critics from both parties have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and violations of gift rules for US presidents, citing the US constitution's prohibition on government officials accepting gifts from foreign states. Trump stated the plane would be a temporary gift to the Defense Department, while Qatar has disputed the reports, calling them inaccurate. The current Air Force One planes have been in service since the 1990s, and Trump has sought to replace them since his first term.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish group PKK has announced that it is laying down its arms and disbanding after a 40-year insurgency against Turkey. This move follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who urged the organization to dissolve itself. Ocalan, who has been imprisoned since 1999, stated that there is no alternative to democracy in the pursuit of a political system. The decision is seen as a potential step towards a terror-free Turkey, though the specifics of what Ocalan and his supporters will receive in return remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Royal experts suggest Kate Middleton's success as a modern royal stems from adhering to royal protocols and avoiding the rebellious path taken by Princess Diana. Unlike Diana, who married Prince Charles at a young age, Kate was more mature when she married Prince William, allowing her to better navigate the pressures of royal life. While Diana modernized the monarchy by making it more personal, her struggles with press scrutiny and marital problems played out publicly. Kate, on the other hand, has maintained a focus on duty and receives strong support from both the palace and her family.</p>

          <p>This article explores the addictive nature of sugar and its detrimental effects on health. Sugar consumption can alter brain pathways, leading to cravings and overconsumption, similar to substance use disorders. While it's debated whether sugar is truly addictive, overconsumption is linked to health problems such as diabetes, obesity, and neurological disorders. Strategies to reduce sugar addiction include cognitive-behavioral therapy and gradual reduction of added sugars. The article suggests that government intervention, such as sugar taxes and reduced publicity for ultra-processed foods, is crucial in addressing the issue.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut at least $880 billion, largely from Medicaid, to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The legislation, touching off a major political fight, aims to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, while Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage. A preliminary estimate suggests the proposals would reduce the number of people with healthcare by 8.6 million over the decade.

          <p>A catastrophic power outage affecting much of Spain, Portugal, and the south of France has ignited a debate about the role of renewable energy sources in maintaining energy security. The blackout, which lasted several hours, disrupted daily life for millions.
