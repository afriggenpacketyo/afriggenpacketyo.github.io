          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 13 confirmed fatalities, with officials expecting the number to rise. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, leading to a "catastrophic level" of flooding that impacted communities and a local all-girls summer camp. Search and recovery efforts are ongoing as state and local emergency services conduct water rescues along the swollen river. The event has been described as reaching the second-highest height on record, surpassing the infamous 1987 flood.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health advocates and policy experts are raising concerns that the wide variety of names for Medicaid programs across different states could lead to significant confusion. This branding diversity means that many individuals may not realize they are enrolled in Medicaid. As a result, when states conduct eligibility reviews, people could unknowingly lose their health coverage without understanding the notices they receive. The issue highlights a critical communication gap that could leave vulnerable populations uninsured.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows New Tax Bill Does Not Eliminate Social Security Taxes, but Offers a Deduction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 16:35:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, the new tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, but instead introduces a new temporary deduction. The legislation provides a "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals over 65 with incomes below $75,000, which can be applied to all income, not just Social Security. Policy experts note this is misleading, as the underlying taxation rules for Social Security remain unchanged and the biggest beneficiaries will be higher-income seniors. The measure, which expires in 2028, could also increase financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While President Trump has indicated a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas could be imminent, Israeli military operations in Gaza have intensified. Hamas has issued a "positive" response to the proposal but is reportedly seeking guarantees for a permanent end to the war and an Israeli withdrawal. Meanwhile, recent Israeli strikes have killed at least 138 Palestinians, with hospitals overwhelmed by the injured. The contrast between diplomatic progress and ongoing violence underscores the fragile and desperate situation on the ground.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed project with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge. The decision follows reports and opposition from biologists and environmental groups who warned that the project would harm the 14 species of tropical seabirds that nest on the atoll. The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth in 90 minutes. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the tests.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly threatened to impose 17% tariffs on all food and agricultural exports from the European Union during recent trade negotiations in Washington. This move would impact a wide range of popular European products, from Irish butter to Italian olive oil. The threat is part of an aggressive U.S. negotiating stance as a deadline approaches for dozens of countries to reach new tariff deals. While the EU remains hopeful for a negotiated solution, it is also preparing retaliatory measures in case of a potential trade war.</p>

          <p>The LGBTQ+ community in Turkey is enduring a period of intensified government repression, with Pride events banned and activists facing arrest. Officials have used hostile rhetoric, describing the community as a threat to family values, which advocates say fuels a dangerous atmosphere and normalizes discrimination. Despite the crackdown, which includes blocking LGBTQ+ news sites, activists are continuing their fight for rights and visibility under the slogan "Insisting on life." The situation highlights a severe decline in human rights and freedoms within the country.</p>

In response, President Bukele posted photos and videos on social media, questioning why Abrego Garcia looked "so well" if he had been starved and tortured, dismissing the claims amidst widespread reports of human rights abuses in the country's prison system.</p>

          <p>A multi-story residential building has collapsed in Lyari, a densely populated neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan, killing at least seven people and injuring several others. Rescue operations are underway, but efforts are being hampered by narrow streets that prevent heavy machinery from accessing the site. Authorities believe more people may still be trapped in the rubble of the building, which housed as many as 100 residents. Such incidents are tragically common in Pakistan, where lax construction laws and poor oversight often lead to structural failures.</p>

          <p>Cars manufactured in China are experiencing a significant surge in the UK market, accounting for one in every ten new cars sold in June. This growth, driven by brands like BYD and MG, marks a sharp increase from previous years and contrasts with other G7 nations that have imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese auto imports. The UK's lack of similar tariffs has created a major opportunity for these brands, particularly in the electric vehicle sector. The trend is reshaping the UK's automotive landscape, raising questions about the future competitiveness of the domestic industry.</p>

          <p>The prospect of a new political party to the left of Labour is gaining traction in the UK, following MP Zarah Sultana's departure from Labour and vow to launch a new movement with Jeremy Corbyn. While Corbyn has not confirmed a timeline, discussions are ongoing to build an alternative for voters who feel alienated by the current Labour leadership. Polls suggest such a party could capture up to 10% of the vote, potentially drawing support from both Labour and the Green Party. The development reflects the volatile state of UK politics and the erosion of traditional party loyalties.</p>

Major financial players are now building on Ethereum, using it as the infrastructure for tokenized assets, with Robinhood recently launching on-chain tokenized stocks for European users. This shift from speculative hype to practical utility is driving a new wave of institutional adoption, as firms like Deutsche Bank and BlackRock leverage the network for its stability and security. The trend suggests Ethereum is becoming the foundational plumbing for the future of Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>
