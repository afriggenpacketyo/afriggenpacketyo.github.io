          <p>Serbia held a large military parade in Belgrade, showcasing both old and newly acquired weaponry, including advanced rocket systems from Israel. The event, intended to mark a national holiday, is viewed by analysts as a display of strength aimed at both domestic political opponents and regional neighbors. While officials frame the parade as a celebration, critics suggest its primary purpose is to intimidate citizens protesting corruption and to project power in the Balkans, sending a dual message of cooperation to major powers through arms deals while creating nervousness in the region.</p>

          <p>An Eritrean man has been removed from the UK to France under the new "one in, one out" agreement after the government won a last-minute court case. This marks the first successful, legally-challenged removal under the pilot scheme, which aims to deter small boat crossings by exchanging migrants between the two countries. The court ruled that France is a safe country and that the individual could continue his claim as a victim of slavery from there, strengthening the government's legal position for future removals. The policy allows the UK to return a migrant in exchange for accepting another with a strong asylum case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's borrowing in August reached £18 billion, the highest for that month in five years, exceeding analysts' expectations. This increase is attributed to higher spending on public services, benefits, and debt interest, which outpaced rising tax receipts. The figures intensify pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the upcoming Budget, as she may need to raise taxes or cut spending to adhere to her strict fiscal rules. Economists suggest the deteriorating public finances will necessitate tough choices to manage the deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

The session was significantly interrupted by a 20-minute red flag caused by a loose kerb at the final corner, which required immediate repairs. This delay inadvertently benefited Piastri, as it gave his team time to fix a power-unit issue on his car without losing significant track time. Lewis Hamilton also had an incident, clipping a wall and damaging his front wing, which left him 12th fastest.</p>

          <p>The global launch of the iPhone 17 series has seen long queues in major cities like Beijing and London, indicating strong initial demand. This release is critical for Apple as it faces intensified competition in key markets, particularly China, where it has lost market share to local brands like Huawei. Early preorder data from Chinese e-commerce platforms suggests a positive reception, with many customers drawn to new designs and features.

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for almost eight months. The couple, who have lived in the country for two decades, were freed through mediation by Qatar and will be flown there for medical checks before returning to the UK. Their release follows extensive lobbying by their family and public concern over their deteriorating health in prison. A recently freed American woman who was held with them had warned that the couple was in a dire state and that time was running out.</p>

          <p>Grocery prices in the United States have increased by 29% since February 2020, causing significant financial anxiety for a majority of Americans. Factors driving the surge include pandemic-related supply chain issues, the war in Ukraine, and more recently, President Trump's tariffs on imported goods like coffee and bananas. Many consumers are altering their shopping habits by seeking sales, using coupons, and even skipping meals to cope with the rising costs. Despite political promises to lower prices, economists note that tariffs and immigration policies could continue to exert upward pressure on food costs.</p>

Resale platforms promise to reduce waste and carbon emissions by extending the life of garments, addressing the fashion industry's significant environmental impact. However, the article explores the complexities of this trend, noting that the declining quality of used clothes and the adoption of overconsumption tactics by large online retailers may undermine its green credentials. Ultimately, research suggests that wearing clothes for longer, whether new or used, is the most effective way to reduce fashion's environmental footprint.</p>

          <p>Getafe manager José Bordalás has cultivated a reputation for a pragmatic and intense style of football that is often criticized by purists as "anti-football." Despite complaints about time-wasting and tactical cynicism from high-profile opponents like Xavi, Bordalás's methods have consistently delivered results. He has guided Getafe to European competition on a small budget by demanding high pressure, compact defense, and extreme physical effort from his players. While he acknowledges he would prefer a more possession-based game, he adapts his strategy to the players available, making his teams notoriously difficult to play against and consistently overachieve.</p>

The legislation argues that modern government architecture, particularly from the 1960s onward, has produced ugly and uninspiring structures, departing from the classical tradition established by the nation's founders. The bill proposes a preference for styles like neoclassical and art deco, asserting that such buildings better reflect American values and command public respect.

          <p>The recent fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on Charlotte's light-rail system has drawn national attention, including from President Trump, to the issue of crime on public transit. While overall crime rates on systems like the NYC subway remain low, data indicates a shift in the nature of offenses, with a notable increase in assaults since the pandemic. Criminologists suggest this trend is linked to broader societal issues such as homelessness and inadequate mental health services, which transit systems are ill-equipped to solve on their own. In response to the attack, Charlotte officials have announced increased police presence on their transit lines.</p>

The research links climate models with public health data, showing that as climate change creates hotter and drier conditions, smoke exposure could double or triple by mid-century. This would lead to a significant increase in deaths from smoke-related health complications, such as heart attacks and chronic respiratory diseases. The findings suggest that even with aggressive climate action, a smokier future is likely, highlighting the urgent need for public health adaptation strategies.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Israel's unilateral withdrawal of settlers and troops from the Gaza Strip, Israelis are divided over the decision's consequences. Many, including former settlers, argue the 2005 disengagement created a power vacuum that enabled Hamas to seize control and ultimately led to the October 7th attack. Conversely, key architects of the withdrawal maintain that remaining in Gaza would have been unsustainable and exposed settlers to even greater danger. Amidst the ongoing war, the debate has intensified, with some right-wing government ministers advocating for the re-establishment of Israeli settlements in Gaza, a move that remains highly controversial.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that TV networks critical of him should potentially have their broadcast licenses revoked. His comments followed the suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel by ABC after pressure from the administration over remarks Kimmel made about the murder of a conservative influencer. The move has sparked concerns about censorship and freedom of speech, with other hosts and commentators defending Kimmel. The FCC chair, a Trump appointee, has supported holding broadcasters accountable, raising questions about the use of regulatory power to influence media content.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has decided to keep its policy rate unchanged at 0.5%, a move that was widely expected by economists. The decision coincides with the release of new data showing that Japan's core inflation rate fell to 2.7% in August, its lowest level since November 2024. While inflation remains above the bank's 2% target for over three years, the central bank is maintaining a cautious stance amidst slowing price growth and global economic uncertainty. This approach prioritizes stability, contrasting with central banks in the U.S. and Europe that are cutting rates. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks a 45% decrease from its peak in 2013, reflecting Beijing's ongoing concerns about the weaponization of the U.S. dollar and the sustainability of American debt amid geopolitical tensions. Analysts suggest that China's central bank is diversifying its investments, potentially shifting towards European assets and gold as more reliable alternatives.

          <p>For the first time since 2011, the total number of refugees living in Germany has decreased, falling by approximately 50,000 in the first half of 2025. The decline is attributed to a combination of increased deportations, voluntary departures, and a rise in naturalizations, with many Syrian refugees becoming German citizens. Despite this overall drop, Germany still hosts around 3.5 million refugees, including 1.27 million from Ukraine. The Left Party, which released the figures, noted that the decline may also reflect stricter EU border policies making it harder for those in need of protection to arrive.</p>

Comedians and free speech advocates worldwide have noted that as democracy diminishes, the space for criticism and humor often shrinks, with satirists becoming targets for repressive regimes.

The move is the latest in a series of severe restrictions imposed on women and girls, who are already barred from education beyond the sixth grade.
