Despite these positive figures, renewed trade tensions with the United States continue to cast uncertainty over China's economic outlook, requiring significant effort for stable growth in the fourth quarter.

          <p>A new Chinese study conducted on mice suggests that fathers can genetically pass on the benefits of exercise to their offspring. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, found that the progeny of exercised fathers exhibited improved muscle mass, lower body fat, and stronger bones, unlike those from inactive fathers. This discovery indicates that paternal exercise offers a cost-effective route to enhancing offspring health, with implications for understanding inherited traits.</p>

          <p>A significant class-action lawsuit is commencing in the UK High Court against Mercedes, Ford, Peugeot/Citroën, Renault, and Nissan, accusing them of using "defeat devices" to cheat emissions tests. This trial, involving 1.6 million car owners, is the latest development in the "dieselgate" scandal, previously seen with Volkswagen. Motorists allege deception about environmental friendliness and dangerous pollution levels. The carmakers deny the accusations, asserting technical and legal compliance, with a judgment expected in summer 2026.</p>

          <h2>IFS Urges UK Chancellor to Avoid "Half-Baked" Tax Fixes in Upcoming Budget</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has advised UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid "directionless tinkering" and "half-baked fixes" when seeking to boost tax revenue in the next Budget. With pressure to raise tens of billions to meet fiscal rules, the IFS warns against economically harmful tax rises and instead advocates for broader tax system reform. They suggest focusing on property tax and capital gains tax, while cautioning against wealth taxes or restricting pension contributions, to achieve fairer and more growth-friendly outcomes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute states that coral reefs are the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate "tipping point," signifying an "unprecedented crisis." Scientists determined that reef death begins around 1.2 degrees Celsius of global warming, with 70-90% dying at 1.5 degrees. This global mass bleaching event, the most extensive ever recorded, highlights the irreversible damage already occurring and underscores the urgent need for rapid decarbonization to prevent further tipping points in other critical ecosystems.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a strong "warning" to American colleges, accusing much of higher education of being "corrupting our Youth and Society with WOKE, SOCIALIST, and ANTI-AMERICAN Ideology." He announced a "Great Reform Agenda" to prioritize merit and hard work, threatening forceful enforcement of federal law against institutions that "illegally discriminate based on Race or Sex." Colleges seeking a "Golden Age of Academic Excellence" are invited to agree to follow federal law, protect civil rights, and end racist admission policies.</p>

          <p>Vice-President JD Vance has warned that the ongoing government shutdown will lead to deeper, "painful" job cuts beyond the thousands already implemented if a resolution is not reached. Democrats blame Republicans for refusing to include health insurance subsidies in the spending bill, while Republicans point fingers back. As hundreds of thousands of federal employees remain on unpaid leave, the impasse continues, with some CDC layoff notices even sent in error before being partially reinstated.</p>

          <p>Weather radar detected a massive swarm of invasive spotted lanternflies spreading across the U.S. East Coast, resembling a weather front. These insects, native to Asia, pose a significant threat to crops and native plants by feeding on various species and excreting a sugary fluid. Found in 19 states and Washington D.C., their presence causes considerable economic and ecological damage. Officials urge non-chemical control methods like circle traps to mitigate their destructive impact.</p>

          <p>Dow futures jumped nearly 400 points as markets reacted to President Trump's conciliatory remarks on Truth Social, where he stated, "Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!" This followed his earlier threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. Analysts interpret Trump's rhetoric as an "escalate to de-escalate" strategy, leading investors to anticipate a "TACO trade" scenario where maximalist threats are eventually walked back. This suggests a potential buying opportunity despite ongoing trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>
