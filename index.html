          <p>The Trump administration has launched investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following allegations that the prestigious journal selected articles based on authors' race rather than merit, potentially violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This action follows a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard over concerns about antisemitism and other issues. Harvard is challenging the legality of the freeze, while a Harvard Law School spokesman emphasized the Law Review's legal independence from the school, noting a similar claim was previously dismissed in court. The investigations will examine Harvard's relationship with the Law Review, including financial ties and selection policies.</p>

          <p>As the US-China trade war intensifies, China is leveraging Trump's tariffs as an opportunity to reduce its dependence on the US market and cultivate a robust domestic consumer base. Beijing is implementing countercyclical policies, including a 10 trillion yuan debt swap plan for local governments, aimed at boosting domestic demand and transparent debt management. These measures are designed to insulate China's economy from the impact of US tariffs and promote sustainable growth through increased internal consumption. The move aims to establish China as a major consumer market, less vulnerable to external economic pressures.</p>

          <p>President Trump is providing relief to automakers from tariffs, allowing importers of foreign auto parts to receive reimbursement for tariffs over the next two years. This decision aims to support domestic manufacturers while giving other companies time to invest in domestic plants. The move follows the implementation of 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, and imported cars and car parts, which have drawn complaints from automakers but praise from the United Auto Workers, who believe the tariffs will create more manufacturing jobs in the United States.</p>

          <p>Saltwater intrusion in the Mississippi River is posing a significant threat to communities south of New Orleans, impacting drinking water infrastructure, decimating the seafood industry, and raising concerns about the future of New Orleans' water supply.

Addressing the problem requires an estimated $200 million for infrastructure upgrades, and while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has built underwater barriers, a more permanent solution is needed to protect the region's water and economy.</p>

          <p>Two California federal judges are suing the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), alleging the utility failed to adequately prepare for and respond to a fire in Pacific Palisades that destroyed their homes.

The suit also alleges that LADWP's power lines remained energized, causing additional ignitions.

          <p>Robert Castillo, a 61-year-old man, has been charged with the murder of Barbara Lee and two separate sexual assault cases from the early 2000s, with authorities suggesting he could be responsible for additional crimes. DNA evidence linked Castillo to Lee's death and the other sexual assaults, leading to his arrest. Castillo's DNA was found in the CODIS database, revealing his prior convictions for property crimes. Investigators are seeking information about Castillo from the public as they continue to investigate potential connections to other unsolved cases.</p>

          <p>The government is considering extending the sugar tax to milkshakes and other milk-based drinks, aiming to tackle obesity by reducing sugar content in these products. The proposal involves ending the exemption for dairy-based and non-dairy substitute drinks from the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL) and reducing the maximum sugar allowance from 5g to 4g per 100ml. While some industry bodies welcome the consultation, others express concerns about the impact on lower-income families and inflationary pressures. The government estimates that the majority of soft drinks are not subject to the tax due to reformulation by manufacturers.</p>
