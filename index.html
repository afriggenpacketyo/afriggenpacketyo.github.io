          <p>Following the shootings of Minnesota lawmakers, House and Senate members are receiving security briefings to address concerns about their safety and that of their families. One proposal involves granting Member offices more flexibility in using allocated funds for additional security measures, including hiring full-time protective details. Some lawmakers expressed the need for proactive, rather than reactive, security measures, such as scrubbing personal information from the web and approving anti-doxxing legislation. There is disagreement among members regarding the best approach to congressional security, and concerns about the U.S. Capitol Police's ability to ensure the safety of family members in various districts.

          <p>Chelsea's Club World Cup match saw a disappointing turnout, raising questions about fan interest in the revamped tournament and potential implications for the upcoming 2026 World Cup.

Concerns are being raised about whether this apathy will persist into the World Cup. FIFA may need to rethink its approach to ticket pricing and marketing to ensure better attendance at future events.</p>

          <p>A temporary restraining order on President Trump's ban prohibiting foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S. has been extended by a federal judge. Harvard's lawyers argued that the ban violates its First Amendment rights and is outside the authority of the executive branch, claiming it is retaliation against the institution. The government argued that it does not "trust" Harvard to vet, host, monitor, or discipline foreigners, raising concerns about Harvard's "foreign entanglements" with the Chinese government. The judge questioned the government's arguments, noting that the concerns raised do not apply solely to Harvard.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his intention to expand deportations in America's largest cities, particularly those run by Democrats. He stated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should focus on cities like New York and Chicago, in addition to Los Angeles, due to their "sanctuary city" status. Trump accused Democrats of using illegal immigration to influence elections and grow the welfare state, despite the fact that noncitizens cannot vote in federal or state elections. This announcement follows protests against his administration's immigration policies.</p>
