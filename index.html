          <p>"Jimmy Kimmel Live!" made its return to television, attracting a significant 6.26 million viewers despite facing preemptions in a substantial portion of U.S. TV households. Host Jimmy Kimmel used his monologue to address his prior suspension, clarifying remarks he had made that were critical of reactions to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Disney, the parent company, highlighted the show's success, reporting its highest rating among adults aged 18-49 in over a decade and noting that Kimmel's monologue alone garnered more than 26 million views across various digital platforms. Kimmel light-heartedly suggested that efforts to "cancel" him inadvertently led to increased viewership for the program.</p>

          <p>Parents report that their son with autism, Mason, began speaking just days after starting treatment with leucovorin, an inexpensive off-label drug typically used to ease chemotherapy side effects. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, is studying leucovorin for autism, theorizing it bypasses a folic acid transport blockage in the brain, which may contribute to neurological problems. While preliminary phase 2B studies have shown positive effects on speech, larger phase 3 trials are still needed for full FDA approval, a process the FDA has begun despite the limited data. The article notes that a significant challenge for broader adoption is the drug's generic nature, which makes it less attractive for pharmaceutical investment, even with its potential to substantially impact a percentage of autistic children.</p>

          <p>The UK government is actively exploring various options to provide financial support to companies within Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain, which have been severely impacted by a cyber attack that forced a halt in JLR's car production since late August. With JLR factories remaining suspended for an extended period, there are growing fears that smaller suppliers, particularly those exclusively dependent on JLR, could face bankruptcy without intervention. Among the ideas being considered are the government directly purchasing component parts to keep these businesses afloat or offering government-backed loans, though suppliers have shown reluctance towards the latter. While a Covid-style furlough scheme was deemed too costly, the situation underscores the significant logistical and financial challenges involved in protecting this vital industry and its tens of thousands of workers.</p>

          <h2>Seasonal Retail Hiring Projected to Fall to Lowest Level Since 2009</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 18:05:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retailers across the U.S. are expected to significantly reduce seasonal hiring for the holidays, with projections indicating the lowest levels since 2009, a period when the economy was recovering from a global financial crisis. This anticipated decline is attributed to several factors, including the increased costs from U.S. tariffs on foreign goods, persistent inflationary pressures, and a growing reliance by companies on automation and permanent staff. The analysis suggests that while a late hiring surge could occur if holiday sales exceed expectations, the current cautious pace of announcements indicates retailers are not banking on a major seasonal boost. This shift reflects a broader economic uncertainty impacting both businesses and consumer spending habits as the year concludes. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend is driven by employment uncertainty, stagnant wage growth, investment downturns, and deflationary risks, leading many to dip into savings rather than spend. The forthcoming plan is expected to outline initiatives aimed at boosting domestic consumption, recognizing the critical need to revive economic confidence and spending among households.</p>

          <p>Kathryn Nester, a highly experienced former federal public defender with over three decades of legal practice, has been appointed as the lead defense attorney for Tyler Robinson. Robinson, a 22-year-old electrician apprentice, stands accused of the fatal shooting of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk during a campus speech earlier this month. Kirk, a 31-year-old father of two, was reportedly struck by a sniper's bullet in the neck. Court documents suggest Robinson had recently developed stronger political views, aligning with "pro-gay and trans rights," and allegedly confessed to the crime in a text, citing Kirk's "hatred" as his motive. Given that Robinson faces aggravated murder charges, which could lead to the death penalty in Utah, his defense team must be qualified for such high-stakes cases.</p>

          <p>A tragic shooting incident at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas resulted in the death of one detainee and left two others in critical condition. The assailant, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, reportedly died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after opening fire indiscriminately from the rooftop of a nearby building. FBI Special Agent Joe Rothrock confirmed that shell casings recovered at the scene bore "anti-ICE messages," prompting the FBI to investigate the event as a targeted act of violence. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the attack, attributing it to "hatred for ICE" and warning against the consequences of anti-ICE rhetoric, especially in light of a prior bomb threat at the same facility a month earlier.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Bears NFL franchise has achieved a record-setting valuation of $8.9 billion, following the recent sale of a 2.35% minority stake to existing team owners, a deal approved by the NFL's finance committee. This valuation significantly surpasses previous NFL minority stake records, including the San Francisco 49ers at $8.6 billion and the Philadelphia Eagles at $8.3 billion. The sold stake, originating from the estate of Andrew McKenna, was predominantly acquired by the McCaskey family, increasing their ownership to approximately 77%. The article highlights the team's substantial increase in value, having been $6.4 billion just a year prior, and notes the team's ongoing exploration of building a new fixed-roof domed stadium in Arlington Heights, which is expected to provide opportunities for year-round events and increased revenue.

          <p>Donald Trump's recently appointed U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, is reportedly moving forward with plans to ask a grand jury to indict former FBI Director James Comey. The potential charges stem from allegations that Comey lied to Congress, a decision Halligan is pursuing despite prosecutors and investigators having determined there was insufficient evidence to establish probable cause for a crime. Halligan, whose professional background is primarily as an insurance lawyer with no prior criminal prosecution experience, is proceeding against the recommendations of her own deputies. This development closely follows President Trump's public demands for Comey's prosecution, raising significant concerns about the potential for political influence to impact the integrity and independence of the Justice Department's legal processes.</p>

It identifies three critical deficits within existing global governance mechanisms: a severe underrepresentation of the Global South, an erosion of authoritativeness due to the disregard for the UN Charter and the imposition of unilateral sanctions, and an urgent need for enhanced effectiveness in areas like the UN 2030 Agenda and new domains such as artificial intelligence and cyberspace.

This experimental treatment, which delivers genetic instructions to turn off harmful proteins in the brain, offers hope for the 100,000 Americans affected by the neurodegenerative disorder. While the results are promising and patients tolerated the complex brain surgery well, experts caution that larger studies are needed, and FDA approval could still be years away.

Humberto represents one of two systems currently active in the western Atlantic that could potentially bring subsequent impacts to portions of the Southeast U.S. coast, stretching from Florida up to North Carolina. Forecasters anticipate a period of steady strengthening for the storm due to favorable environmental factors, including warm sea surface temperatures and adequate mid-level relative humidity, although no coastal watches or warnings are presently in effect.</p>

          <p>A deadly shooting at a Dallas U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, which killed one detainee and injured two others, has sparked sharply divided political reactions. Republicans, including President Trump and his allies, swiftly blamed "Radical Left Terrorists" and anti-ICE rhetoric for the violence, framing it as an attack on law enforcement. In contrast, Democrats and others focused on the victims, who were detainees, and called for gun control measures while rejecting anti-immigrant sentiment. The FBI is investigating the incident as targeted violence, with "anti-ICE messaging" found on shell casings, but officials have not confirmed the shooter's motive or ideological background, highlighting the intense politicization of the event.</p>

U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes acknowledged the IGs' exceptional service and the injustice of their removals, but stated that she could not grant their request for reinstatement. This decision was based on the fact that Trump could legally remove them again after a 30-day notice period, provided he offered a rationale, as stipulated by the Inspector General Act. The IGs, tasked with investigating wrongdoing and fraud across federal agencies, were part of a mass firing, with their dismissals communicated via email citing "changing priorities," which failed to meet the legal requirements for such actions.</p>

          <p>Lawyers representing the family of Kevin Rodriguez Zavala, a 32-year-old man who tragically died after riding a roller coaster at Universal Orlando Resort, emphatically assert that his spinal disability played no role in his death. The legal team believes Zavala sustained fatal blunt force trauma from hitting his head on a restraint during the ride's forceful downward thrusts, leading to his unconsciousness for most of the experience. The medical examiner for the Orlando area corroborated this, ruling the cause of death as multiple blunt impact injuries and classifying the manner of death as an accident. The family's attorneys criticized Universal's swift statement that the ride functioned normally, arguing that a lack of malfunction does not preclude underlying safety issues. The roller coaster remains closed as Universal conducts a comprehensive review with its manufacturer.</p>

          <p>President Trump is anticipated to sign a deal brokered by his administration to permit TikTok's continued operation in the U.S., according to White House officials. This agreement aims to satisfy a congressional law requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest or face a ban. Under the proposed terms, TikTok's content recommendation algorithm will be copied and retrained to operate solely on U.S. user data, with Oracle providing comprehensive security by hosting data and reviewing code. A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will hold a stake in TikTok. While the administration asserts the deal complies with all laws, some lawmakers express concern that it may not go far enough to sever ties with ByteDance's algorithm and prevent potential Chinese influence.

Under the agreement, U.S. investors, including Oracle and reportedly Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, would take over TikTok's U.S. operations, licensing its algorithm and managing security. The article highlights the potential for the Murdochs, owners of Fox Corporation, and Larry and David Ellison of Oracle/Skydance Media (which acquired Paramount and is eyeing Warner Bros Discovery) to exert vast influence across traditional and social media.

          <p>Canada's Supreme Court has issued a temporary halt to the planned culling of nearly 400 ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farms in British Columbia. The cull was initially ordered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) due to an avian flu outbreak on the farm. This Supreme Court decision allows the farm owners, Katie Pastiney and Karen Espersen, who were recently arrested for obstructing food inspection agents, to proceed with their appeal against the CFIA's order, which they have vehemently opposed for months. The controversial case has garnered international attention, notably from US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy, who suggested studying the birds rather than culling them. The CFIA maintains that the cull is crucial to prevent the virus from persisting, reassorting, or mutating, thereby increasing potential human health risks.</p>

The Thacker Pass project is anticipated to become one of North America's largest sources of lithium, a critical material for electric vehicle batteries. The administration's proposal for a "very small stake" is intended to establish a cash buffer and mitigate risk for taxpayers, particularly given that portions of the loan repayment are being deferred to later years. This initiative represents the White House's latest strategic effort to acquire direct ownership in the supply chain of minerals deemed critical to U.S. interests, following a similar stake acquisition in rare earth miner MP Materials.

          <p>As the fall respiratory season approaches, confusion surrounds recommendations for children's flu and COVID-19 vaccinations due to shifting guidance. The CDC's advisory committee recently voted to change COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, now suggesting parents of healthy children aged 6 months to 17 years "may receive" it, rather than a strong recommendation. This contrasts with the American Academy of Pediatrics, which "strongly recommends" COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years old. For flu shots, however, guidance remains consistent: children 6 months and older are generally advised to get vaccinated, as flu infections can lead to severe outcomes. The varying advice underscores a growing divide in public health messaging.</p>

          <p>YouTube, a platform owned by Alphabet, has announced its intention to reinstate accounts of creators who were previously banned for violating its now-retired policies concerning COVID-19 and election misinformation. This decision, communicated in a letter submitted to the House Judiciary Committee, underscores the company's stated commitment to free expression and acknowledges the significant pressure it has faced from conservative voices who argued their viewpoints were unfairly suppressed. YouTube had already phased out its policies against claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election in 2023, and its standalone COVID-19 content restrictions in 2024. This move is indicative of a broader trend among tech companies to roll back content moderation policies, influenced by political pressure and efforts to foster closer relationships with the Trump administration, even as many of the original misinformation claims have been debunked.</p>
