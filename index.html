          <p>A 31-year-old man, Daniel Braga Figueiredo, died tragically while attempting to rescue a 12-year-old girl in Utah's Silver Lake Flat Reservoir. After borrowing a paddleboard to reach the girl who had drifted from shore, both fell into the water. Witnesses reported that Figueiredo successfully lifted the girl onto an inflatable device before he submerged and did not resurface. His body was later recovered by rescue teams, and authorities expressed their condolences to the family for his heroic but fatal effort.</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, surpassing analysts' forecasts and keeping it on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. However, this was accompanied by signs of underlying weakness, including slowing retail sales and a deepening slump in the real estate sector. Despite the better-than-expected GDP, persistent deflationary pressures and fragile consumer spending are fueling calls for increased government stimulus and deeper structural reforms to ensure sustainable growth.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose by 0.3% in June, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This increase was in line with economists' expectations and showed mixed impacts from trade tariffs, with apparel and household furnishing prices rising while vehicle prices fell. Despite the monthly increase, real average hourly earnings decreased slightly, and the Federal Reserve is still anticipated to consider an interest rate cut later in the year.

          <p>SiriusXM has launched its first ad-supported subscription plan for in-car listening, aiming to convert more free-trial users into paying customers with a cheaper option. The new tier, called SiriusXM Play, is part of a broader strategy to drive revenue and compete with other audio streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. While core premium content like Howard Stern and live sports will remain ad-free, the company hopes this move will bolster its subscriber base, which saw a recent decline.</p>

          <p>A recent tax-and-spending bill signed by President Trump is projected to increase federal deficits by $3.4 trillion over the next decade, as reported by the Congressional Budget Office. This adds to a national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion, pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio to its highest sustained level since World War II. Economists warn this could lead to higher interest rates for consumers on mortgages and credit cards, though markets have remained relatively calm for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has officially declared a drought in the East and West Midlands regions of England, following the country's driest start to the year since 1976. This announcement follows similar declarations in the North West and Yorkshire, where hosepipe bans are already in effect for millions. The prolonged period of hot, dry weather has left many rivers at critically low levels, impacting the environment and agriculture. While natural weather patterns are the primary driver, officials note that climate change is increasing the risk of future water shortages.</p>

          <p>China's top leadership has declared a need to transform the nation's urban development model, shifting away from large-scale expansion towards optimizing existing city resources. At a high-level meeting attended by President Xi Jinping, officials stated that with 67% of the population now urbanized, the focus must move to enhancing human well-being and governance efficiency. This new approach includes creating a new development model for the property sector and prioritizing projects like the renovation of urban villages and dilapidated housing.</p>

          <p>Researchers from China have utilized publicly available satellite data from NASA to identify promising locations for deep-sea mineral mining in the Indian Ocean. After NASA's GRACE satellites detected a gravity anomaly along the Ninety East Ridge, Chinese scientists used the free data to guide a research expedition. Their on-site measurements confirmed the presence of a thickened oceanic crust, an indicator of potential rich deposits of valuable minerals like copper, cobalt, and rare earths. This use of open-access data has potentially saved the research team years of exploration and significant financial resources.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars. The program, funded with £650 million over three years, applies to new electric cars costing up to £37,000, with manufacturers applying for the funds and passing the savings directly to consumers. This initiative is part of the government's strategy to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, though critics argue more focus is needed on expanding the public charging infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has received approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips, used for artificial intelligence development, to customers in China. This decision reverses a previous policy that had restricted such sales, a move CEO Jensen Huang announced during a visit to Beijing. The reversal is seen as a significant boost for Nvidia, allowing it to compete more effectively with rivals like Huawei in the critical Chinese market. The news follows intensive lobbying by tech leaders who argued the restrictions hindered U.S. competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Spanish football star Lamine Yamal is being investigated by the country's prosecutor's office following allegations that he hired entertainers with dwarfism for his 18th birthday party.

The association claims such performances perpetuate harmful stereotypes and violate laws protecting the dignity of people with disabilities. An individual claiming to be one of the performers defended the event, stating they were not disrespected and were working legally as entertainers.</p>

The UK's largest water company, which has been criticized for sewage spills and leaks, saw its debt increase to £16.8 billion. The significant loss was compounded by a major fine from the regulator Ofwat and the recent collapse of a £4 billion rescue deal. The company's uncertain future continues to raise concerns about its potential collapse and the impact on its customers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent series of tariff threats against over 50 countries, including a 100% tariff on nations trading with Russia, has created significant economic uncertainty for U.S. businesses and consumers. Economists note that with an August 1 deadline looming, the unpredictable nature of the tariff policy leaves companies in a 'dense fog,' unable to plan effectively. While the White House defends the tariffs as tools for fair trade and national security, experts argue the mixed messages and lack of comprehensive deals with major partners are fueling instability.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting the Trump administration to resume its plan to dismantle the Department of Education. This decision allows for massive cuts to proceed, which are expected to eliminate the jobs of approximately 1,400 department employees. Opponents had sued to block the move, arguing that the president could not shut down a department created by Congress without a change in the law. While the case continues in lower courts, the ruling raises concerns that the damage to the department could become irreversible.</p>
