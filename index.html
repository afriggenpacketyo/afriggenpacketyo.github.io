            <p>President Trump is reportedly exploring options to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, according to an economic advisor, after Powell warned that Trump's trade war could lead to stagflation and reiterated plans to hold interest rates steady. Trump has publicly criticized Powell's performance and expressed his desire to replace him. While the legality of firing the Fed chair is debated, Trump is reportedly considering Fed governor Kevin Warsh as a potential replacement. However, even if Powell were removed, the Federal Open Market Committee ultimately makes decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>With the Canadian election campaign intensifying, the BBC interviewed seven voters to gauge their reactions to the recent debates featuring Liberal leader Mark Carney, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, NDP's Jagmeet Singh, and Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet. Voters expressed varied opinions, with some praising Carney's business-like approach and others favoring Poilievre's critique of the Liberal government. Concerns about the environment, cost of living, and Canada's sovereignty were recurring themes. Overall, the debate was perceived as civil and useful, reflecting the strength of Canada's multi-party democracy.</p>

            <p>The White House has redirected the COVID.gov website to a new page asserting the theory that COVID-19 originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, China, citing evidence from a Republican-led subcommittee report. The new page replaces resources for testing, treatment, and vaccination, and it alleges that government officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, manipulated research to support the natural origin theory. This move reignites the debate over the pandemic's origins, with the White House also criticizing social distancing, masking, and lockdown measures.

He also criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, accusing him of supporting a gang member. Abrego Garcia's attorneys and family deny his MS-13 affiliation, and the gang allegations are being disputed in court.</p>

Jones, herself an MBE recipient, highlights the need to acknowledge the charity and community work of people with disabilities, often overlooked or taken for granted. While the Cabinet Office reports an increase in disabled award winners over the past decade, representation still falls below the proportion of disabled people in the population. Efforts are underway to improve diversity and outreach within the honours process, ensuring awards reflect those who have overcome adversity to make a significant impact.</p>

Alternative locations like Vietnam and India are being explored, but China remains a critical component.

            <p>Christian leaders are urging President Trump to intervene and stop the deportation of Afghan Christians, who face persecution under the Taliban. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it would terminate humanitarian parole for Afghan nationals, affecting about 9,000 Afghans, including hundreds of Christians who converted after the 2021 U.S. withdrawal. Advocates are requesting a 90-day pause on deportations to allow time for legal pathways or protections. They also suggest a vetted list of Christians most at risk to help DHS reinstate humanitarian protections or expedite asylum or SIV review.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ordered the transfer of a Turkish Tufts University student, Rumeysa Ozturk, from Louisiana to Vermont for a hearing on her detention by immigration authorities. Ozturk's lawyers argue her detention is retaliation for an op-ed she co-wrote in the student newspaper criticizing the university's response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide”, disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel. Ozturk's lawyers contend that her detention violates her constitutional rights, including free speech and due process.</p>

            <p>Ukraine recently agreed to a mineral deal framework with Washington, hoping to secure US investment in its recovery in exchange for future profits from its natural resources. However, both US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatened to pull out of brokering a ceasefire if progress isn't made quickly. This threat of the US withdrawing from peace efforts benefits Moscow more than Kyiv, especially as the collective weight of Ukraine and its European allies is insufficient to counter Russian aggression in the long term.</p>

While containing Jokic is a priority, the Clippers have been playing well as a team, entering the postseason with a long winning streak.

            <p>Vox examines the Trump administration's escalating conflict with the judicial branch over the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Despite a Supreme Court ruling to "facilitate" his return, the administration has not complied, arguing that the courts cannot compel the president to act. An appeals court has rejected this argument, warning of the peril of defying court orders. The administration now faces two options: do more to bring Abrego Garcia back or continue to defy court orders, with the White House indicating that Abrego Garcia will "never" return.</p>

            <p>The Australian government's decision to shoot koalas from helicopters in Budj Bim National Park has drawn criticism and debate. The government claims the action is necessary to end the suffering of koalas injured in a recent bushfire and facing starvation. However, animal welfare advocates argue that logging and development have destroyed much of the koalas' habitat, exacerbating the problem. Some experts question the aerial culling method, suggesting rescue should be the primary option. Climate change is also a factor, increasing the frequency and severity of bushfires and threatening koala habitats.</p>

Saman Abbas was killed for refusing an arranged marriage. The court determined the entire family participated in the murder, upholding sentences for the parents and two cousins previously cleared by a lower court. The case has become a symbol of the brutal mistreatment of immigrant women who defy traditional family rules. Honor killings are common in Pakistan, where family members sometimes kill women who don’t follow local traditions.</p>
