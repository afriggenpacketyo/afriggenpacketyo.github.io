        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global postal services, including Royal Mail and DHL, are temporarily halting certain deliveries to the United States as they adapt to new import taxes on low-value parcels. President Trump's executive order, effective August 29, eliminates a previous $800 duty-free exemption, requiring all non-gift packages to face tariffs based on their country of origin. This change aims to combat deceptive shipping practices and duty circumvention, with companies scrambling to implement systems for compliance. Online marketplaces like Etsy are also advising sellers about the evolving tariff landscape, impacting international e-commerce. The new rule does not affect personal items under $200 or gifts under $100.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's immigration crackdown includes controversial third-country deportations, sending undocumented migrants from the US to African nations like Uganda, South Sudan, Eswatini, and Rwanda. These agreements are part of a broader strategy to expel individuals deemed 'uniquely barbaric' by the Department of Homeland Security, though details often remain private. Uganda, already hosting Africa's largest refugee population, has accepted a deal, while Eswatini faces public anger and a court challenge over its acceptance of five deported individuals. Critics highlight human rights concerns in some receiving countries and question the transparency and ethics of these arrangements, with Nigeria explicitly rejecting similar proposals.</p>

          <p>The FBI conducted court-authorized searches at former National Security Adviser John Bolton's Maryland home and Washington D.C. office, reportedly in connection with a classified documents investigation. President Trump, who claimed he learned of the search via TV, called Bolton "not very smart" and "unpatriotic." The investigation recalls a prior criminal inquiry during Trump's first term regarding Bolton's book, "The Room Where It Happened," which the administration tried to block over alleged classified information disclosures. The Biden administration had previously closed that investigation and dropped a related lawsuit. Bolton's Secret Service protection, granted by the Biden administration, was removed within 24 hours of Trump's second inauguration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity at record highs, Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are popular for home improvements or debt consolidation, but experts warn against maxing them out due to significant risks. HELOCs feature variable interest rates, meaning payments can become unaffordable if rates rise, straining household budgets and potentially leading to foreclosure. Maxing out a HELOC also negatively impacts credit scores and debt-to-income ratios, complicating future loan applications. Financial advisors recommend a repayment plan, monitoring interest rate changes, and considering alternatives like home equity loans or cash-out refinances to manage debt and mitigate risks.

Tesla's board recently granted an "interim" pay package of 96 million shares, worth about $29 billion, which vests if Musk continues as CEO and if the company loses its appeal in Delaware. An investment group has called for Nasdaq to investigate, arguing the new package required shareholder approval. Tesla plans to put a long-term compensation strategy to a shareholder vote in November.</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez appeared before California's parole board, seeking release a day after his brother Erik was denied parole. Both brothers were convicted in 1995 for the 1989 murders of their parents and were initially sentenced to life without parole, but a recent sentence reduction made them eligible. The Menendez brothers maintain they acted in self-defense due to years of alleged parental abuse, a claim disputed by the Los Angeles County District Attorney. The DA argues they haven't taken full responsibility and that their self-defense narrative is false. The parole board's decision for Erik cited his behavior in prison rather than the initial crime.</p>

Recovered funds totaled $97.4 million, with significant busts including the dismantling of 25 cryptocurrency mining centers in Angola and a transnational inheritance scam in Ivory Coast. This initiative highlights the growing threat of cybercrime in West and East Africa, where it now accounts for more than 30% of reported crimes.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that economic conditions "may warrant" interest rate cuts, acknowledging a "challenging situation" with sweeping changes in tax, trade, and immigration policies. Speaking at Jackson Hole, Powell noted the labor market's resilience but cited rising downside dangers and the risk of tariff-driven inflation. Despite these concerns, he stated that the Fed's current restrictive policy allows for careful consideration of adjustments. His remarks led to a significant rally in stock markets and a drop in Treasury yields, with Wall Street widely anticipating a rate cut at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Powell also reaffirmed the Fed's commitment to its 2% inflation target and independence from political pressure.</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are navigating President Trump's tariff increases by employing strategic price adjustments and diversifying their sourcing. While some tariff costs have been absorbed, others have been passed on to consumers, though not as severely as initially feared. Companies are importing goods earlier, stocking up, and shifting supply chains to mitigate impacts. Consumer spending remains steady, with some trading down to private-label items, particularly among lower-income households. Strong brand loyalty and new revenue streams, such as advertising and third-party marketplaces, are helping some businesses weather the economic uncertainty, while others, like Crocs, face a more concerning outlook.</p>

Cook, a Biden appointee, has rebuffed the pressure, asserting she has "no intention of being bullied to step down." If Trump successfully removes Cook, it would allow him to appoint a replacement, potentially shifting the central bank's governing board to align with his monetary policy views.

          <p>Amid elevated living costs and stock market volatility, experts suggest five ways for retirees to maximize their income and protect savings. Strategies include delaying Social Security benefits until age 70 to significantly increase monthly payments, downsizing or relocating to areas with lower living costs to reduce housing expenses, and utilizing annuities or reverse mortgages for guaranteed income streams. Additionally, making catch-up contributions to retirement accounts for those 50 and older, or taking on part-time work, can boost savings and income. Finally, reviewing tax-efficient withdrawal strategies, such as Roth conversions in lower tax brackets, can optimize long-term financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The West Bank is reportedly sliding towards a severe crisis, marked by escalating settler violence and a lack of accountability, as the Gaza war continues without clear resolution. A recent incident involved the killing of a Palestinian activist by a Jewish settler, with minimal legal consequences. Critics argue that Israeli officials, particularly under Prime Minister Netanyahu, are failing to de-escalate tensions, with some suggesting the ongoing conflict serves political interests. The situation is exacerbated by a surge in violence against Palestinians, the expansion of illegal outposts, and financial pressures on the Palestinian Authority, raising fears of a broader conflict closer to Israeli population centers. International scrutiny remains focused on Gaza, leaving the West Bank increasingly vulnerable.</p>

          <p>The UK government's Home Office is seeking to appeal a High Court ruling that granted a temporary injunction to Epping Forest District Council, preventing asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the government is committed to closing all asylum hotels but needs a managed, national approach to avoid creating problems elsewhere. The ruling followed protests after an asylum seeker living there was charged with sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl. The Home Office argues the judiciary should not dictate placement, while the hotel owner also plans an appeal. Several other councils are considering similar legal action.</p>

This approach has drawn significant ire from Fox News commentators and Trump supporters, who criticize Newsom's "juvenile" behavior. The article suggests Newsom's parodies act as a mirror, forcing observers to confront how Trump's antics appear to others, and highlight a double standard in public discourse that often excuses the President's controversial statements. While the strategy is divisive, it has successfully exposed the hypersensitivity of some MAGA partisans to criticisms of Trump.</p>

          <p>A federal judge disqualified Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump, from her role as acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, ruling her appointment was not legally valid. The judge concluded that Habba had exercised her duties without lawful authority since July 1, 2025, and her actions could be declared void. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced an immediate appeal, defending Habba's position. The challenge arose from defendants in criminal cases who questioned the lawfulness of her appointment, which involved a complex process after federal judges in New Jersey previously rejected her for the job. The ruling, while not dismissing existing indictments, mandates her disqualification from ongoing cases.</p>

Menendez maintained the murders were self-defense against parental abuse, stating he viewed his parents "as one person" after learning his mother knew of the abuse. Despite support from over a dozen relatives, including an aunt who tearfully forgave him, the board found him unsuitable for parole, emphasizing that love and forgiveness do not negate the need for accountability.</p>

From the war's outset, Israeli officials expressed intent to restrict aid, with subsequent actions systematically limiting food production and humanitarian operations. Human rights experts highlight that starvation as a weapon of war is illegal under international law, and Israel's actions are well-documented. The article emphasizes the unique rigor and sustained nature of Israel's blockade, alongside its coordination with a controversial private aid distribution group, making the crisis entirely man-made and preventable.

Nuno publicly acknowledged the changed relationship, stating, "where there's smoke, there's fire," and expressed concern over the squad's transfer situation. There are suggestions Nuno has not been fully involved in recruitment this summer, contributing to the deterioration. This follows a previous pitch confrontation between Marinakis and Nuno, which the club attributed to frustration over a player's injury. Nuno signed a new three-year contract in June, but the current discord casts doubt on his long-term tenure.</p>

          <p>A peculiar reversal in wage growth trends sees "job stayers" now earning faster annual increases than "job switchers" for the past six months, a phenomenon last observed around the Great Recession. Typically, workers switch jobs for higher salaries, but a souring job market has led to "job hugging." This sustained reversal, though by small margins, signals an underlying weakness in the labor market, as job openings decline and hiring slows. Economists suggest workers have lost bargaining power, leading to a depressed quits rate. This makes it harder for individuals to find better-paying roles externally, especially for the increasing number of long-term unemployed.</p>

TI's new fabs in Utah and Texas, including its Sherman facility set for full production by late 2025, will significantly boost its capacity for analog and embedded chips, which are essential components across various technologies. Despite initial stock market dips due to weak guidance and tariff concerns, analysts see TI as a potential "tariff winner" due to its U.S. foundry advantage.
