          <p>President Trump issued a stern warning to Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stating that he is an "easy target" and demanding Iran's unconditional surrender amid escalating tensions with Israel. Trump's comments followed reported Israeli strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, which the U.S. claims to not be directly involved in. The U.S. president also asserted "total control" over Iranian airspace and cautioned against missile attacks on civilians or American soldiers. The geopolitical tensions caused U.S. stocks to slide and crude oil prices to jump, with the Pentagon deploying additional warships to the Middle East. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>R. Kelly was hospitalized for an overdose after allegedly being given an excessive amount of medication by prison staff, according to his lawyer, who also claims Kelly was forcibly removed from the hospital against medical advice. The lawyer alleges that the Federal Bureau of Prisons is attempting to kill Kelly to cover up crimes committed during the investigation of his case. Kelly was reportedly moved to solitary confinement earlier in June and had shown his anxiety and sleep medication to prison staff. Doctors at the hospital found blood clots in his legs and lungs, but Kelly was allegedly removed from the hospital before surgery could be performed.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a move aimed at uniting progressive voters and blocking former Governor Andrew Cuomo from winning the Democratic nomination. Mamdani, a New York state assembly member, has also received the backing of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, solidifying his position as a leading figure on the left. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots campaign, which focuses on affordable housing, rent control, free public transportation, and increased taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers. The endorsement seeks to consolidate support among progressive voters and prevent a repeat of the 2021 primary, where divided progressive support led to a moderate Democrat's victory.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that the company's corporate workforce is expected to shrink in the coming years due to the increasing adoption of generative artificial intelligence tools and agents. Jassy stated that fewer employees will be needed for some existing roles, while new roles will emerge. This directive comes after Amazon has already laid off over 27,000 employees since 2022, with additional cuts made this year. As of March, Amazon had 1.56 million full-time and part-time employees globally, along with temporary workers and contractors.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales voted to decriminalize abortion, removing the threat of prosecution for women who end their pregnancies. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, led by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, addresses the small percentage of abortions that occur after 24 weeks, arguing that these women need compassion, not criminalization. While the new clause does not alter existing laws regarding abortion services, such as time limits or the requirement for two doctors' approval, it signifies a significant shift in the legal landscape. The vote reflects a growing recognition that vulnerable women and girls require care and support rather than punishment.</p>

The company states the phone will be "built in the United States," but analysts suggest the device was likely designed and will be manufactured by a Chinese firm. Experts point to the lack of readily available smartphone manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and the near impossibility of designing a phone from scratch domestically.

The Trump administration seeks assurances about Tata Steel's operations, particularly concerning the import of raw materials, until a new electric arc furnace is operational in 2027.

          <h2>NBA Parity Creates Finals Matchup Between Oklahoma City and Indiana</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NBA's plan to bring more parity to the league is working, as evidenced by the Finals matchup between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers. Recent changes to the collective bargaining agreement make it more difficult for teams to load up on multiple superstars, giving smaller market teams a better chance at competing for a championship. The "second apron," a spending limit that triggers severe punishment for teams that exceed it, discourages teams from maintaining expensive, star-studded rosters. The rise of international talent has also contributed to increased parity, with more teams than ever having world-class players on their rosters.</p>

The jury asked what would happen if they found Read not guilty on two charges but couldn't agree on the third charge. The judge stated that she could not answer theoretical questions and that the jury should not be concerned with the consequences of their verdict. Read is accused of striking John O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die in a blizzard, while her defense claims he was beaten and left outside in a police conspiracy.</p>

Democrats argue that the pardons undermine the American system of justice and harm victims who have not been made whole.
