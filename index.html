            <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at the Pharr International Bridge in South Texas seized over $14 million worth of methamphetamine hidden within a shipment of vegetables entering from Mexico. The drugs, totaling 1,635 pounds, were discovered on April 11 concealed in bell peppers and cucumbers inside a tractor-trailer. The seizure underscores ongoing efforts to combat drug trafficking at the border, with investigations now led by Homeland Security Investigations, and reflects a broader trend of increased drug seizures, including fentanyl, cocaine, and methamphetamine, compared to previous months. This operation highlights the effectiveness of CBP's strategies in preventing narcotics from reaching American streets.</p>

            <p>A recent CDC study indicates that autism rates have risen to 3% among children in the U.S., with 1 in 31 children identified as autistic. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited the study as evidence of a growing autism 'epidemic,' a claim experts criticize as stigmatizing. The CDC report suggests the increase may reflect improved screening and access to services, noting higher prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children. Federal spending on autism research has surged, focusing on biological factors, while debates continue over environmental causes and the CDC has delayed releasing the report and barred agency experts from media appearances.</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status after freezing over $2 billion in federal funds, demanding changes to address alleged antisemitism on campus. Trump accuses Harvard of tolerating antisemitism and insists the university apologize to Jewish students, while the White House demands Harvard to make changes to hiring, admissions and teaching practices which it says will help fight antisemitism on campus. Harvard President Alan Garber rejected the demands, citing academic freedom and First Amendment rights, leading to the funding freeze. The situation highlights ongoing tensions between the administration and elite universities regarding campus policies and free speech.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly targeting former officials who have criticized the president, initiating investigations into Chris Krebs, former head of cybersecurity, and Miles Taylor, a former Homeland Security official. These actions follow purges within federal agencies and appear to be driven by revenge, with Trump using government resources to punish dissent. The probes are raising concerns about the politicization of government and the suppression of free speech, as the administration also rewards loyal allies and pressures law firms involved in cases against Trump. The president's actions are seen as blurring the lines between personal interests and governmental power.</p>

            <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in an antitrust trial, defending Meta's acquisition of Instagram against FTC allegations that the company illegally monopolized the social media market. Zuckerberg sparred with an FTC attorney over the interpretation of emails discussing the purchase, arguing that the acquisition was driven by a desire to improve the product, not to eliminate a competitive threat. The FTC contends that Meta's purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp were anti-competitive moves to squash competition. The trial is a significant test of the FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech and could potentially force Meta to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order targeting Susman Godfrey, a law firm that represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation case against Fox News. The judge called Trump's order a 'shocking abuse of power' and noted that it 'chills the firm's speech and advocacy'. The order sought to block the firm's access to government buildings and cancel government contracts, which the judge deemed a personal vendetta. The ruling is a win for firms fighting back against Trump's actions, while others have agreed to provide legal services to causes supported by the president.</p>

Concerns include potential exfiltration and alteration of data, including corporate secrets and union activities, by DOGE staff. The request for investigation is prompted by the fact that Elon Musk's companies like SpaceX, Tesla and X have cases pending before the NLRB and the Department of Labor.</p>

While some sellers plan to maintain prices, the added costs could threaten their viability if tariffs persist.

            <p>The Supreme Court is hearing Trump v. Wilcox, a case concerning the 'unitary executive' theory, which could significantly expand presidential power over federal agencies. The case questions whether agencies meant to be independent can be controlled by the president, potentially impacting bodies like the Federal Reserve. Legal experts fear the court's Republican majority may use this case to dismantle agency independence, potentially leading to politically motivated decisions and undermining civil service protections. The outcome could grant Trump unprecedented control over the executive branch, raising concerns about the future of independent regulatory bodies.</p>

            <p>The Kennedy Center faces an uncertain future after a Trump administration takeover, marked by the firing of its president and concerns over programming. The new administration aims to prioritize profit and traditional values, leading to cancellations of diverse performances. Despite the changes, Mark Morris' new ballet, 'Moon,' premiered as planned, showcasing the center's potential to still foster creativity. The situation raises questions about the Kennedy Center's role in a changing political landscape and the importance of supporting the arts.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's order forbidding the government from doing business with law firms that have sued the president. This is the fourth time a judge has found that Trump's targeting of law firms is likely unconstitutional. The order was seen as retaliation against the firm Susman Godfrey for representing Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation case against Fox News. The judge found the order likely violates the First and Fifth Amendments, stating that the government cannot hold lawyers hostage to force them to agree with it.</p>

            <p>A civil case brought against Andrew Tate by four women, who accuse him of rape, assault, and coercive control, is believed to be a legal first. The barrister for the accusers argues that the case marks the first time coercive control is being argued as 'intentional infliction of harm,' potentially leading to additional damages. Tate denies the claims, and the trial could be held in early 2027. The case raises serious legal challenges concerning the definition and consequences of coercive control.</p>

His move toward the ideological center is clear in The War of the End of the World, published in 1981—my favorite Vargas Llosa book.</p>

            <p>Swimmer Adam Peaty says he is motivated to continue to LA 2028 by the message it sends his son. Adam Peaty had to settle for silver by an agonising 0.02 seconds, having contracted Covid-19 earlier in the week.
