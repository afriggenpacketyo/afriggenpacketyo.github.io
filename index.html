          <p>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the former immunizations chief at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has publicly voiced grave concerns following his resignation. He argues that under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the essential firewall between science and political ideology has collapsed, potentially leading to harmful public health outcomes. Daskalakis specifically criticized recent changes to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and the ideological direction of advisory committees, suggesting that the progress in vaccination is at risk. His departure has prompted fears from other experts about the nation's readiness for future health emergencies.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore is defending his state's progress on crime reduction amid a public feud with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Baltimore. Moore stated he has no interest in fighting the president but is committed to advocating for his communities, calling Baltimore a great American turnaround story. The governor criticized Trump's threats to send the National Guard as "performative" and argued for more federal funding for local law enforcement instead. The dispute has also seen Trump resurface a controversy over Moore's military record, to which the governor has responded by defending his service and criticizing the president's own history.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the Trump administration's reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential action an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his administration has not been contacted about the plans and argued that such a deployment would be an illegal use of U.S. troops for domestic law enforcement. He suggested President Trump's motives extend beyond crime-fighting, possibly aiming to disrupt future elections. The governor emphasized that while he would welcome more federal law enforcement agents like the FBI or ATF to assist local police, using the military would only inflame tensions and attack American rights.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty has released a new album featuring re-recordings of his iconic Creedence Clearwater Revival hits, a project undertaken after he finally regained the rights to his own songs. For decades, Fogerty had lost control over his compositions following the band's breakup, a painful experience that led him to stop performing his own music for a time. Encouraged by his wife, Julie, he bought back his catalog and recorded the new album with his sons, who are part of his touring band. The project represents a personal and professional victory for the 80-year-old artist, allowing him to reclaim his musical legacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has secured its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support approximately 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed.

The agreement marks a major success for the British defense industry, which was chosen over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>An international aid flotilla, which includes prominent figures like actress Susan Sarandon and activist Greta Thunberg, has set sail from Barcelona with the goal of reaching the Gaza Strip. The convoy, named the Global Sumud Flotilla, aims to break the Israeli blockade and deliver essential humanitarian supplies such as food, water, and medicine to the Palestinian territory. Organizers state that the mission involves around 20 boats with delegations from 44 countries, with more ships expected to join en route. The effort highlights the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where food experts have warned of famine amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>During a college football game between the New Mexico Lobos and the Michigan Wolverines, a minor on-field altercation took an unusual turn. After a play in the third quarter, some pushing and shoving occurred between players from both teams. When Michigan linebacker Ernest Hausmann appeared to confront New Mexico guard Richard Pearce, Pearce chose to de-escalate the situation by quickly running away from the developing fracas. The moment was captured on replay as officials worked to separate the other players. Michigan ultimately won the game 34-17, but the lineman's evasive maneuver provided a memorable highlight.</p>

          <p>In a humorous commentary, comedian Jim Gaffigan reflects on the perils of amateur gardening, specifically the overwhelming surplus of cucumbers he faces every August. He humorously details his annual cycle of optimism in May, followed by the dramatic consequences of his attempt at "succession planting" to ensure a steady harvest. This strategy resulted in an unmanageable deluge of cucumbers that overwhelmed his family's capacity to eat them fresh, in salads, or even as pickles. Gaffigan concludes by comically admitting his lack of gardening skill and desperation to give away the excess produce, a relatable problem for many home gardeners.</p>

This act is one of many similar protests staged by the group, which has previously targeted famous artworks and property to draw attention to the climate crisis.

While data shows that nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave had found employment by 2022, challenges with integration and social cohesion persist.

          <p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," delves into the complex nature of chronic pain, highlighting recent research that identifies the brain as a primary source. The article discusses how the brain can memorize and amplify pain signals, sometimes creating sensations even without a physical injury, similar to phantom limb pain. It features the story of musician Ed Mowery, who suffered from a rare condition until a revolutionary clinical trial used deep brain stimulation to predict and interrupt his pain signals before he could consciously feel them. This breakthrough suggests a future where pain can be managed by targeting its neural circuitry directly.</p>

The plan aims to "maximise extraction" of fossil fuels, a move Badenoch argues is necessary to tap into vital resources and boost the economy. This policy reverses the UK's legally binding commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and contrasts sharply with the Labour government's plan to ban new exploration licenses.

President Prabowo stated that some allowances would be curtailed and a moratorium on overseas trips would be imposed.

However, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's reexamination of the case found major inconsistencies, including evidence suggesting Pauline was shot outside the car and that Pusser's own wound was likely self-inflicted.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in the latest drawing. This marks the fifth-largest prize in the history of the game, which has not had a grand prize winner since May 31st. Players will have another chance to win in the upcoming Monday night drawing. The winner can choose to receive the full amount in payments spread over 30 years or opt for a lump sum payment of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. Despite the astronomical odds of winning, at 1 in 292.2 million, the massive prize continues to attract widespread participation.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the world is entering a new and dangerous multipolar arms race, significantly increasing the threat posed by advanced ballistic missile capabilities. Unlike the bipolar Cold War era, today's strategic environment involves multiple adversaries who can hold each other's populations hostage under the threat of nuclear conflict. The author warns that while the fundamental logic of war remains, its nature has been radically altered by technology, making large-scale suffering more achievable than ever. The piece suggests that the likelihood of conflict, even if accidental, is rising, and that this trajectory toward perpetual conflict must be actively reversed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to exert control over the Federal Reserve, including the attempted removal of Governor Lisa Cook, represent a significant challenge to the central bank's long-standing political independence. Experts warn that politicizing the Fed's decisions on monetary policy could undermine the credibility of the U.S. financial system. If successful, a president could influence not only interest rates but also bank regulation and the stability of the dollar. While the administration frames its actions as necessary reform, critics argue it could lead to the kind of hyperinflation seen in countries where dictators control monetary policy.

          <p>Ten years ago, the declining industrial town of Altena, Germany, volunteered to accept more migrants than required, hoping to revitalize its shrinking population and economy. While the initiative brought some new life, with many newcomers finding homes and work, it was not a panacea for the town's deep-seated problems. Some migrants eventually moved to larger cities for better opportunities, while others faced challenges with integration, contributing to welfare costs. The town now reflects a broader national trend of rising frustration and growing support for the anti-immigration AfD party, illustrating the complex realities of long-term integration.</p>

          <p>The recent release of interview transcripts with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has drawn criticism for what was not asked, particularly regarding Jeffrey Epstein's connections to powerful figures. During the interview with a deputy U.S. attorney, Maxwell hinted that some of Epstein's associates were serving in President Trump's cabinet, but the interviewer did not press her for names. Critics and attorneys for Epstein's survivors argue that the interview seemed to be more for show than a genuine pursuit of truth. They also point out that victims themselves have not been approached by the Justice Department for their accounts.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, is shedding light on the origins of surfing in the mainland United States, which began in 1885. Three teenage Hawaiian princes, sent to a military school nearby, brought their royal sport to the local beaches, riding waves on massive boards fashioned from local redwood trees. Their aquatic feats were documented in a local newspaper at the time and left a lasting impression, with locals adopting the practice years later. This act of "surf diplomacy" by the princes was a crucial precursor to the sport's later popularization by surfing legend Duke Kahanamoku in the 20th century.</p>

U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated he expects joint efforts on weapons manufacturing following his visit to Taiwan.

Rhode Island's new levy, nicknamed the "Taylor Swift Tax," imposes a surcharge on non-primary residences valued over $1 million. Proponents see these taxes as a way to address budget shortfalls and populist anger over housing affordability.

These single-use plastic containers, an iconic staple in many Asian restaurants, are being targeted because their small size makes them difficult to recycle properly. The ban builds on previous legislation that outlawed items like plastic straws and carrier bags. Officials state the policy is designed to reduce waste, cut carbon emissions, and protect marine life, noting that without action, the flow of plastic into the ocean is projected to triple by 2040.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the common modern dilemma of feeling guilty for personal happiness while the world is experiencing numerous humanitarian and political crises.

However, these same traditions also advocate for feeling the joys of others, a concept known as "sympathetic joy." The article argues that to be fully connected humans, we must allow ourselves to experience both the world's pain and its delights, and that feeling good is a form of resistance against forces that seek to create misery.</p>

The VICP was created in the 1980s to shield vaccine manufacturers from litigation, ensuring a stable supply. Critics fear that Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine activist, could dismantle these protections, potentially causing manufacturers to exit the market.
