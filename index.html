          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that his country has secured deals for three Patriot air defense systems, with funding confirmed from Germany and Norway. Ukraine is actively working to secure funding for seven additional systems to bolster its defenses against aerial attacks. This development comes as the U.S. administration under President Trump has shifted policy to allow NATO allies to purchase American weaponry for transfer to Kyiv. Meanwhile, peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators have shown slow progress, with discussions about a potential meeting between the two nations' leaders.</p>

          <p>Mhairi Black, the former deputy leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) at Westminster, has officially left the party. Her departure is reportedly due to significant disagreements with the party's direction, particularly its stances on transgender rights and the conflict in Palestine. Black, who gained fame as the youngest MP elected since 1832, stated that she still supports Scottish independence but feels the SNP needs to adopt more left-wing positions. She had previously stepped down as an MP before the last election, citing safety concerns and online abuse.</p>

          <p>American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has completed a worldwide licensing deal with Chinese biotech company 3SBio for a new cancer drug, SSGJ-707. Under the agreement, Pfizer will pay up to $150 million for 3SBio to exclusively develop and commercialize the drug within mainland China, while Pfizer gains the rights for the rest of the world. As part of the transaction, Pfizer also acquired a 1.3% equity stake in 3SBio. The deal underscores a growing trend of major global pharmaceutical firms licensing intellectual property from innovative Chinese biotech companies.</p>

          <p>This article critiques California's fiscal management, using the troubled high-speed rail project as a central example of severe cost overruns and delays. It argues that despite having the world's fourth-largest economy, the state faces significant issues like the nation's highest poverty rate and a projected multi-billion dollar budget deficit. The author contends that these problems, along with failures in providing essential services, stem from state policies that are causing residents and businesses to leave California for other states.

          <p>A panel of doctors and women's health experts has formally requested that the FDA remove its "black box" warning, its strongest safety label, from low-dose vaginal estrogen treatments for menopause. They argue the current labels overstate the risks of cancer and dementia for these localized therapies, which discourages women from using medications that can effectively treat symptoms like vaginal dryness and urinary tract infections.

          <p>Pediatricians across the U.S. are reporting increased concern from parents about the future availability and insurance coverage of routine childhood immunizations. This anxiety is largely attributed to the appointment of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS Secretary and the subsequent overhaul of the CDC's key vaccine advisory committee. Fears are mounting that changes to the official vaccine schedule could lead to a loss of insurance coverage, forcing families to either pay hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket or forgo essential immunizations for their children.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" has drawn sharp criticism from the professional gambling community for altering how losses are deducted for tax purposes. The new law makes losses only 90% deductible, meaning that a player who breaks even or loses money over a year could still face a significant tax liability. Prominent poker players and tax experts argue this change is illogical and fundamentally unfair, potentially threatening the livelihoods of professional gamblers and prompting calls for a legislative reversal.

          <p>The article reports that complex tax fraud schemes known as Cum-Ex and Cum-Cum continue to cost Germany and other European nations billions, with global losses estimated at over €140 billion. According to former senior prosecutor Anne Brorhilker, these schemes, which exploit legal loopholes to claim multiple refunds on capital gains tax, are still ongoing. The persistence of the fraud is blamed on a lack of specialized investigators, slow international cooperation, and intense lobbying by the financial industry that has blocked effective legal reforms.

          <p>Taiwan is holding an unprecedented mass recall vote that primarily targets 24 lawmakers from the main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT). The recall effort, organized by pro-ruling party civic groups, accuses the KMT legislators of being too close to Beijing and "selling out Taiwan" to China. Analysts view the vote as a critical test of the "resist China, protect Taiwan" political campaign and believe its outcome could significantly shape the island's trajectory and political landscape ahead of future local and national elections.</p>

          <p>U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has conducted a multi-day interview with Ghislaine Maxwell in a Florida prison, a meeting her lawyer described as "very productive" and a positive step. The questioning comes amid growing public and political pressure on the Trump administration to release files related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, reportedly answered all questions without declining, though the substance of the discussion has not yet been disclosed by the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>The article examines several key narratives surrounding the WNBA in 2025, particularly in the wake of Caitlin Clark's arrival and a surge in public interest. It questions whether the league has become overly dependent on Clark, noting that while she drives ratings, veterans like A’ja Wilson and rising stars like Paige Bueckers are also crucial to its success. The piece also tackles ongoing debates over the quality of play and refereeing, concluding that while the league faces valid challenges, its growth is built on a strong foundation of multiple star players.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed tactical preview of the Euro 2025 women's final between England and Spain. It suggests England's best strategy may be to exploit Spain's high defensive line and focus on disrupting their key pivot midfielder, Patri Guijarro, to limit service to their star attackers. The analysis also notes that while Spain is expected to dominate possession, England is well-suited to playing a counter-attacking, transitional game. The piece draws parallels to Arsenal's past Champions League victory over Barcelona, whose players form the core of the Spanish squad.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts is providing the UK government with an opportunity to resolve outstanding issues in its recent trade agreement with the U.S. While a baseline deal is in place, key elements like the removal of U.S. tariffs on British steel and aluminum remain unsettled. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to meet with Trump to "refine" the pact, with discussions likely to involve a trade-off between the metal tariffs and the UK's digital services tax, which affects U.S. tech companies.</p>

          <p>With an August 1 deadline looming for a trade deal before U.S. tariffs are set to increase, India appears unfazed by the pressure, according to analysts. India's strategic importance to the U.S. as a geopolitical counterbalance to China in the Indo-Pacific and within the BRICS bloc gives it significant leverage in negotiations. Analysts suggest that Washington has a strong interest in securing a deal to further its own strategic goals, which may explain New Delhi's confidence despite unresolved issues like market access for American agricultural products.</p>

Despite being eligible for parole since 1999, his release was repeatedly denied, allegedly due to political pressure from the U.S. and Israel. Upon his release, he was immediately expelled from France and put on a flight to Beirut.</p>
