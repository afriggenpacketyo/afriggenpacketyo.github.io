          <h2>UK and EU Nearing Agreement to Reset Relations Amid Global Uncertainty</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and EU are reportedly close to finalizing a deal to reset relations after Britain's exit from the EU in 2020, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a summit in London. Talks have intensified, focusing on issues like youth mobility and fishing rights, with a potential agreement expected soon. This reset is seen as crucial given the unpredictable global landscape and a shift towards U.S. isolationism, though the UK remains cautious due to rising support for Reform UK. The agreement aims to pave the way for UK participation in EU security and defense policy, reduce trade friction, and enhance cooperation on energy and carbon taxes. </p>

The new CPUs will connect to Nvidia's GPUs, essential for training AI models, and are based on Arm designs acquired from Nuvia in 2021. This move is part of Qualcomm's strategy to diversify beyond smartphones into chips for cars and PCs, competing with Intel and AMD in the data center CPU market.

          <p>Satellite imagery indicates that Russian forces are expanding military infrastructure near the Finnish border, a move seen as a potential long-term strategy following the Ukraine war. The buildup includes new tents, warehouses, and renovations to fighter jet shelters, though NATO officials say it is not comparable to the pre-invasion buildup on the Ukraine border. Finland, a recent NATO member, shares a long border with Russia, making it a potential hotspot, especially in the Arctic Circle. Finnish defense officials anticipate Russia will redeploy thousands of troops to the border once the high-intensity phase of the Ukraine war concludes, tripling the number of troops currently stationed there. </p>

The study also indicated that female players reported higher depression scores than their male counterparts, and that team sports may have a preventive effect on mental health disorders. Since addressing his struggles, Haliburton has improved his performance, demonstrating the importance of opening up about mental health. </p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered widespread sexual assault of children within South Africa's illegal mining industry, where children are recruited for cheap labor or trafficked for sexual exploitation. Miners report witnessing adult miners sexually assaulting underage boys in exchange for gold or protection, leading to trauma and trust issues among the children. Activists say criminal gangs specifically target children, often abducting them from neighboring countries with false promises of employment. The South African government estimates the illegal mining industry costs the economy billions annually, but efforts to curb the practice have been largely ineffective. </p>

China is projected to account for nearly half of global manufacturing by 2030 and is making strides in AI, drug discovery, and semiconductor manufacturing.

          <p>Russia launched a significant drone attack on Ukraine, primarily targeting Kyiv, just before President Trump was expected to speak with President Putin. The attack, involving an estimated 273 drones, resulted in one death and several injuries, prompting Ukrainian officials to argue that it demonstrates Russia's lack of interest in peace. President Zelensky met with Vice President JD Vance in Rome to discuss cease-fire negotiations, following a meeting with Pope Leo XIV, who offered the Vatican as a venue for peace talks. Despite diplomatic efforts, the pace of Russian assaults across the eastern front has been increasing, setting the stage for large-scale offensive operations this summer. </p>

Co-founder Gilberto Loureiro, who experienced the inefficiencies of textile factories firsthand, claims Smartex has prevented 1 million kilograms of fabric from going to waste in the past three years. The company's defect-spotting technology means 0.37% more garments can be produced per kilogram of finished fabric, which adds up, if you consider that fashion giant Inditex (owner of Zara) used 678,596 tonnes of raw materials in its products in 2024. Smartex is one of the climate tech startups that Amazon is backing via its AWS Compute for Climate Fellowship. </p>

Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, education and subsidies for clean energy would offset part of the price of the bill, though they would not cover the entire cost of $3.8 trillion over 10 years.
