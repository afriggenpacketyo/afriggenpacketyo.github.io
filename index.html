          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, students at Utah Valley University are expressing a renewed commitment to fostering open debate on campus. Many students, including those who opposed Kirk's views, told reporters they feel a responsibility to ensure that political discourse continues without fear of violence. The tragic event has appeared to galvanize a new level of political engagement among some students, who are determined to prevent the silencing of voices and instead amplify the culture of debate that Kirk championed.</p>

          <p>U.S. health authorities are growing concerned as Chagas disease, transmitted by the 'kissing bug,' is being detected more frequently across the country, with cases now reported in at least eight states. The CDC is considering classifying the infection as endemic, meaning it would be recognized as a permanent health risk rather than an imported tropical disease. The article explains that the disease is caused by a parasite in the bug's feces and can lead to severe, life-threatening heart and digestive problems if left untreated.</p>

          <p>Despite a stellar outing from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the Los Angeles Dodgers' offense struggled in a 5-1 walk-off loss to the San Francisco Giants. Yamamoto pitched seven dominant innings, allowing only one run and striking out ten batters. However, the Dodgers' lineup failed to provide support, managing only one run on a solo homer by Michael Conforto. The game ended dramatically in the 10th inning when Giants catcher Patrick Bailey hit a grand slam, securing a crucial win for San Francisco.</p>

          <p>The Prime Video series 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' has captured a massive audience, sparking intense online debates over its central teenage love triangle involving two brothers.

Despite its romantic focus, the series also addresses serious themes like grief in a digestible way, resonating with a multi-generational audience and fostering a strong online fan community.</p>

          <p>In the hours following Charlie Kirk's killing, artificial intelligence tools significantly amplified the spread of misinformation across social media. A CBS News analysis found that X's chatbot, Grok, repeatedly misidentified the suspect, generated altered images of the person of interest, and provided contradictory information about the event. Other AI platforms also produced false claims, such as labeling the shooting a "hypothetical scenario," highlighting the growing challenge of ensuring accuracy from generative AI during rapidly unfolding news events.</p>

          <p>An analysis of voting patterns reveals the significant role Charlie Kirk and his organization, Turning Point USA, played in helping Donald Trump improve his performance with younger voters in the 2024 election. By engaging youth on platforms like TikTok and through campus events, Kirk helped narrow the Democratic party's traditional advantage with the under-30 demographic. This shift was particularly crucial in key swing states, where Trump's increased support among young men contributed to his victory, underscoring Kirk's influence in shaping the modern conservative coalition.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from Policy in Practice suggests that seven million households in Great Britain are failing to claim a collective £24 billion in available financial support. This unclaimed aid includes government benefits like Universal Credit and Pension Credit, as well as social tariffs from utility providers.

          <p>At least 193 people have died in two separate boat accidents this week in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Equateur province. On Thursday, a vessel carrying nearly 500 people capsized on the Congo River after catching fire, leaving 146 missing. A day earlier, another boat, reportedly overloaded with students, sank in the same province, killing at least 86 people. Such tragedies are frequent in the region, where river transport on poorly maintained and overloaded vessels is common due to limited infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk, is described by neighbors as a quiet individual from a close-knit Mormon community in southern Utah. He was a third-year electrical apprentice who had previously attended Utah State University for one semester. According to his family, Robinson had become more political in recent years and expressed a strong dislike for Kirk, whom he reportedly called a purveyor of hate.
