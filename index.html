          <p>The upcoming EU-China summit in Beijing is poised to proceed with minimal expectations for significant breakthroughs, as trade friction and China's support for Russia create a tense atmosphere. In a sign of the strained relations, the summit was shortened from two days to one, with the only expected deliverable being a joint statement on climate issues. European officials have set a low bar for success, indicating that a substantive and direct conversation on all aspects of the complex relationship would be considered a constructive outcome.</p>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate held steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, coming in below economists' expectations and signaling potential for a monetary policy shift. The soft inflation figures, along with unchanged core inflation, provide the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with latitude to ease its policies to bolster economic growth amid global trade uncertainties. The MAS has noted that inflation has been below expectations and anticipates subdued domestic growth for the second half of the year, despite strong GDP figures earlier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's top administrative court has finalized a ruling that allows the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party to be classified as a suspected right-wing extremist group. This decision permits the domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, to monitor the party, which could include the use of undercover informants. The court upheld a previous justification based on evidence of anti-democratic tendencies within the party, particularly regarding the legal status of German citizens with migration backgrounds. The AfD remains the strongest opposition party in the German parliament.</p>

          <p>The UK government has detailed its plans for a 40% cut in foreign aid, with programs for children's education and women's health in Africa facing the most significant reductions. The move, intended to free up funds to increase defense spending, has drawn sharp criticism from aid organizations. They warn that the world's most marginalized communities, particularly women and children, will bear the highest cost, facing increased risks of disease and death. While some multilateral aid to bodies like the World Bank is protected, direct bilateral support to several nations will decrease significantly.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 10-7 defeat to the Minnesota Twins, marked by a catastrophic collapse of their bullpen in the later innings. After a solid start from Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the relief pitchers struggled severely with command, issuing numerous walks that led to six runs for the Twins in the sixth and seventh innings. The sloppy performance, which included a costly fielding error on a throw to first, highlights the team's ongoing bullpen issues, which have been exacerbated by injuries. The loss contributes to a difficult July for the slumping team.</p>

          <p>For the first time, three major UK security agencies—Counter Terrorism Policing, MI5, and the National Crime Agency—have issued a joint statement warning parents about the risk of children being radicalized online during the summer holidays. The agencies report an increasing number of children being exposed to extreme content, including terrorist material and graphic violence, leading to desensitization. They are urging parents to discuss online safety with their children and utilize parental controls, noting a deeply concerning trend of younger individuals being investigated for terrorism-related offenses.</p>

          <p>In a recent podcast appearance, Emmy-winning actor Jeff Daniels issued a pointed message to supporters of President Donald Trump, criticizing the economic impact of his administration's policies. Daniels specifically referenced the financial strain caused by tariffs, stating to those who supported Trump, "I hope you’re losing tons of money." He argued that rising costs for everyday goods and cars would ultimately be the factor that turns public opinion. The White House responded by calling Daniels an "out-of-touch left-wing Hollywood clown" and touted the administration's economic achievements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists believe that a 'terror bird,' a formidable top predator from 13 million years ago, was killed and eaten by an even larger predator. The conclusion is based on distinct teeth marks found on the fossilized leg bone of the bird, which was unearthed in Colombia's Tatacoa Desert. Using 3D digital scans, paleontologists matched the bite marks to an extinct caiman species that could grow up to five meters long. This rare discovery provides direct evidence of an interaction between two of the region's ancient apex predators, revealing new insights into the prehistoric ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A significant clash has occurred between the judiciary and the executive branch over the leadership of the U.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey. Federal judges in the state took the rare step of sidelining interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a Trump appointee and his former personal lawyer, and installed her top assistant in the role. Hours later, the Trump administration's Justice Department responded by removing the newly appointed prosecutor, Desiree Leigh Grace. The move has been condemned by Democratic senators as an attempt to undermine judicial independence.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies are being encouraged to more deeply integrate their operations within the economies of Southeast Asian nations to navigate U.S. crackdowns on transshipments. The advice comes after the U.S. announced steep tariffs on goods suspected of being diverted through countries like Vietnam to circumvent duties on Chinese products. An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office suggested that by becoming more ingrained locally, Chinese firms can create more resilient supply chains. This strategy would also help protect them from unpredictable tariff policies targeting Chinese exports. (not investment advice)</p>

While a state prosecutor found no criminal misconduct by the officers, the sheriff's office has initiated an internal review and stripped the officer of his duties pending its outcome.

The loss of Scott, who signed a large contract in the offseason, is a significant blow to a bullpen already dealing with multiple injuries. The situation further highlights the team's pressing need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the trade deadline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has updated its policy to comply with a presidential executive order, effectively barring transgender women from competing in women's sports.
