          <p>Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has expressed concerns regarding the enforceability of the BBC's license fee, suggesting that "no options are off the table" as the government reviews the corporation's funding model. Nandy highlighted the decreasing number of people paying the £174.50 fee and raised concerns about enforcement actions disproportionately affecting vulnerable women. While ruling out general taxation, she left open the possibility of a subscription model, signaling a potential shift in how the BBC is funded in the future. The BBC has responded, stating they are open to a different system and are engaging with the government to secure the long-term future of the BBC.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney, after building a career overseas, is now leading Canada’s Liberal Party into a federal election.

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has suspended online orders and is issuing refunds after experiencing a cyber attack. Customers reported issues with contactless payments, Click & Collect, and gift card usage, leading to the complete pause of online and app shopping. The retailer is working to resolve the issue and has apologized for the inconvenience, while its physical stores remain open. The online grocer Ocado, which sells M&S food, is unaffected by the problems.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States have commenced extensive negotiations in Oman regarding Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, with the central point of discussion likely being Iran's uranium enrichment activities. These talks aim to establish limitations on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the removal of certain economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. President Trump has repeatedly threatened military action if a deal is not reached, while Iranian officials have cautioned about potentially pursuing nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who also alleged she was sexually trafficked to Prince Andrew, has died at the age of 41. Her family confirmed that she took her own life at her farm in Western Australia, citing the lifelong toll of abuse. Giuffre was a vocal advocate against sexual abuse and sex trafficking, and her allegations led to a settlement with Prince Andrew in 2022. Her death underscores the lasting impact of sexual exploitation and the need for continued efforts to combat trafficking.</p>
