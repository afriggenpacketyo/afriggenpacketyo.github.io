          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged over 2% to a record high on Friday, contributing to broader gains across Asian stock markets. This positive momentum was fueled by the announcement that U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are scheduled to hold trade talks next week. Japan's Nikkei 225 also climbed, with the country's core inflation rate accelerating to 2.9% in September. South Korea's finance ministry indicated readiness to intervene in the foreign exchange market if needed, as the won experienced volatility against the dollar.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Plaid Cymru achieved a significant political upset by winning the Caerphilly by-election, marking the first time Labour has lost the constituency in over 100 years. Lindsay Whittle's victory suggests a potential shift in voter sentiment, positioning Plaid Cymru as a viable alternative ahead of next May's Welsh Parliament election. This result has prompted internal discussions within the Labour party about their future strategy and the need for a compelling new political offer to voters. The by-election's high turnout of 50.43% indicates strong public engagement in this historic contest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK retail sales volumes rose for the fourth consecutive month in September 2025, exceeding expectations with a 0.5% increase. This growth was primarily fueled by strong online demand for gold and new technology gadgets, including Nintendo's Switch 2 and Apple's iPhone 17. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures indicate a boost in consumer confidence, despite ongoing concerns about a slowing British economy and high household budget pressures. However, some economists caution that this strength might not be sustainable given weak employment and looming tax rises.</p>

The 27-year-old England international, whose United contract runs until 2028, believes he has no future at Old Trafford under head coach Ruben Amorim. Rashford has revitalized his career in Spain, scoring five goals in 12 games for Barcelona, including a Champions League double. He cited the need for a change of scenery after spending 23 years with Manchester United, finding enjoyment in his new footballing environment.</p>

          <p>Millions of Russian private investors are unable to reclaim their frozen securities held in European depositories, even though many are not on Western sanctions lists. This situation arose after Euroclear and Clearstream cut ties with Russia's National Settlement Depository following the Ukraine war. While the EU debates using frozen Russian central bank funds for Ukraine's reparations, the fate of these private assets remains uncertain. Obtaining a license to release funds is complex and costly, with a high rejection rate, leaving many investors in legal and financial limbo.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the termination of all trade negotiations with Canada, citing an advertisement aired by the Ontario provincial government. The ad featured edited remarks from former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs, which Trump labeled as "FAKE" and "egregious behavior." Trump accused Canada of attempting to influence a pending U.S. Supreme Court case regarding his tariffs. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation also stated the ad misrepresented Reagan's 1987 address and was used without permission, leading them to review legal options.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown poses an imminent threat to food assistance for nearly 42 million Americans, with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits at risk of disappearing by November 1. The Department of Agriculture has warned states that payments are on hold, potentially leading to mass hunger not seen since the Great Depression. Additionally, a separate nutrition program for 7 million pregnant women and new parents (WIC) is also facing funding depletion. States and food banks are scrambling to prepare for a surge in demand, as advocates urge the USDA to utilize contingency reserves to prevent a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>
