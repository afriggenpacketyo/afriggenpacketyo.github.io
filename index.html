          <h2>Stocks Decline Amid Trump's Criticism of Fed and Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 11:44:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The stock market experienced a downturn as a response to President Trump's tariff policies and ongoing criticisms of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump insisted that Powell should lower interest rates immediately, escalating tensions between the executive branch and the central bank. A recent poll indicated that the majority of American adults disapprove of Trump's tariff policy and handling of inflation, adding to the market's unease. The uncertainty surrounding these economic policies continues to impact investor sentiment and market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts a sluggish U.S. economic growth in 2025, primarily due to an escalating trade war and high policy uncertainty. The IMF projects a growth rate of 1.8% for the U.S. this year, a decrease from previous forecasts, and has raised the odds of a recession. The trade war with China has led to weaker forecasts for both countries, with China's economy expected to expand at a slower pace. The IMF warns that further escalation of trade tensions could hinder both near- and long-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp met with Trump to discuss the U.S. aerospace sector's trade surplus.

          <p>The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan has agreed to step aside, allowing President Trump to install his nominee, Jay Clayton, as interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. This marks another shake-up for the prominent federal prosecutor's office, following previous resignations and appointments. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer intends to block Clayton's nomination, expressing concerns about Trump's intentions for the Justice Department. Clayton's interim appointment could bypass the confirmation process, raising questions about the independence of the office.</p>

          <p>The reaction to the Supreme Court ruling defining a woman as a biological female has been unedifying from both sides, highlighting the ongoing tensions in the trans rights debate. While the ruling was necessary to safeguard vulnerable women and ensure fairness in sports, it has caused hurt and disappointment within the trans community. The author argues for a more humane and reasonable approach, urging both sides to engage in civil conversation and work towards co-existence. The piece calls for empathy and understanding for all individuals involved.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced a proposed reorganization of the US State Department, aiming to reform it amid criticism over the execution of US diplomacy. The reorganization will close overseas missions, reduce staff, and minimize offices promoting liberal values, subsuming them into regional bureaus. Rubio stated that the current bureaucracy is more beholden to radical political ideology than advancing America's national interests. The goal is to empower the Department from the ground up, consolidating functions and removing redundant offices.</p>

Despite these remarks, Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities persisted, resulting in casualties and damage. Zelensky reiterated his proposal for a 30-day ceasefire on strikes using long-range drones and missiles on civilian infrastructure.</p>
