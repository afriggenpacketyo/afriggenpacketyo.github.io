          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced second-quarter profits that rose nearly 61% year-over-year, significantly surpassing market expectations. This record performance is attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company projects a 38% year-over-year revenue increase for the third quarter, signaling continued confidence despite potential headwinds from U.S. trade policies and a strengthening Taiwan dollar. Advanced chips smaller than 7-nanometers constituted 74% of wafer revenue, highlighting the industry's shift towards more powerful processors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sweden's Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely, is altering its U.S. product lineup in response to significant trade tariffs, which have impacted its profitability. The company reported a substantial drop in second-quarter operating profit and plans to shift production of its popular XC60 SUV to its South Carolina plant to mitigate tariff effects. This strategic move aims to better utilize its U.S. factory while the company phases out some sedans and wagons that are less popular in the American market. The CEO affirmed the company's commitment to the U.S. despite the challenging economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is weakening, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. The unemployment rate increased to 4.7% in the three months to May, while annual pay growth decelerated to 5%. Furthermore, job vacancies have continued their downward trend, reaching their lowest point in a decade, excluding the pandemic period. These indicators of a cooling labor market are increasing speculation that the Bank of England may consider cutting interest rates next month to stimulate economic activity, although concerns about inflation persist.

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has urged for stricter price regulation, particularly in the competitive electric vehicle sector, to address the intense price wars contributing to deflationary pressures in the economy. At a high-level meeting, he called for major automakers to practice self-discipline and focus on innovation rather than destructive competition, which has eroded industrial profits. The government is also trying to boost sluggish domestic consumption by removing spending restrictions. However, economists express skepticism, suggesting that without significant production cuts, these measures may only be a temporary campaign rather than a substantial reform.

          <p>The U.S. Senate approved a $9 billion spending rescission package requested by President Trump, which primarily targets foreign aid programs and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The measure passed with a 51-48 vote, with Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joining Democrats in opposition due to concerns over the lack of detail and the impact of the cuts. The Senate's version slightly modified the House-approved bill by restoring $400 million for an AIDS prevention program.

For the first time since 1896, no Welsh players were named in the matchday 23 for a major tour match, a stark contrast to previous tours where Welsh players were central to the team's success. This development comes as Wales recently ended an 18-match losing streak and faces uncertainty in its professional tiers. Commentators and former players have described the situation as a "sad indictment" of the state of the sport in Wales.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it is cutting $4 billion in federal funds allocated for California's high-speed rail project, with President Trump labeling the initiative an "unnecessary project" and a "total waste." This move revives a conflict from Trump's first term, when a similar funding cancellation was halted by a legal challenge from California. Governor Gavin Newsom has denounced the action as illegal and vowed to fight it, stating that all options are on the table. The project, which aims to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles, has been plagued by significant delays and budget overruns since its launch.</p>

          <p>Recent layoffs of over 1,300 domestic State Department employees have created significant confusion and operational disruption, according to multiple sources. The cuts, part of a Trump administration plan to streamline the agency, were reportedly executed chaotically, with some managers not immediately informed of which staff were let go. Key offices, such as the one assisting families of employees who die overseas, were unexpectedly gutted, raising concerns among current and former officials about risks to U.S. national security and diplomatic readiness. Some laid-off staff were even on official travel abroad when they lost access to their government accounts.</p>

          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills moved forward in the U.S. House of Representatives after a record-setting, 10-hour vote that exposed deep divisions within the Republican party. The legislation was initially stalled by opposition from both conservative hardliners and moderate Republicans who objected to last-minute changes. The eventual passage of the debate rules, following intervention from President Trump, has nonetheless fueled doubts about the ability of the Republican conference to pass a final version of a crypto framework. The struggle represents a significant setback for the crypto industry, which had heavily lobbied for the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

A volunteer instructor described the earth exploding and seeing multiple people on the ground. The deceased was identified as 61-year-old Robert Montgomery, a club member who was volunteering at the event.

          <p>Shares of Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings plummeted over 7% after Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion takeover offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the talks. In response, the 7-Eleven operator expressed disappointment and disagreed with what it called "inaccurate statements" from the Canadian firm. Analysts suggest that Japanese protectionism and the classification of Seven & i as a company core to national security made the foreign acquisition highly unlikely from the start.

          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second straight month in June, contracting by 0.5% year-over-year and fueling fears of a potential recession. The decline was driven by sharp drops in shipments to key trading partners, with exports to the U.S. falling 11.4% and to China by 4.7%. The data reflects the impact of U.S. tariffs, particularly on the crucial automobile sector, with carmakers appearing to absorb the costs to maintain market share. With no breakthrough in U.S.-Japan trade talks and new "reciprocal tariffs" set to take effect, the export-dependent Japanese economy faces significant pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data reveals a disparity between the administration's rhetoric about deporting the "worst of the worst" and the actual criminal records of those removed. Of the approximately 70,583 convicted criminals deported in the first half of the year, less than one percent (0.58%) had homicide convictions. The data, obtained by CBS News, shows that many documented infractions were for non-violent offenses like traffic or immigration violations. While the administration highlights the removal of violent offenders, the figures suggest its deportation push has broadly targeted undocumented immigrants with less severe or no criminal records.</p>

Experts believe such a move would be a "dreadful idea" that undermines the central bank's independence, a cornerstone of economic stability. Any attempt to remove Powell would likely result in a legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court to resolve the constitutional questions involved. (not investment advice)</p>

The friction stems from a perception that Slater may be pursuing her own policy agenda rather than the president's, and that it has required significant internal pushback to settle cases.

However, the threat was later downgraded and then canceled, with officials noting that the shallow depth of the earthquake meant large, widespread waves were not expected.
