          <p>Sinclair Broadcast Group announced it will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC affiliate stations following a nearly week-long suspension by the network. The decision comes after Disney temporarily took the show off the air due to controversial comments made by Kimmel. Sinclair, which had extended the preemption, cited feedback from viewers and advertisers, as well as a desire for responsible broadcasting and respectful dialogue, in its decision to bring the program back to its roughly 40 affiliate stations.</p>

          <p>The New York City medical examiner has confirmed that Shane Tamura, who killed four people and himself in a Midtown Manhattan shooting, had low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes referencing the brain disease and asked for his brain to be studied, believing the NFL had concealed its dangers. While experts note that CTE is found in some student-athletes and can cause behavioral changes, they also caution that the diagnosis alone does not explain such a complex and violent act.</p>

          <p>Howard Rubin, a 70-year-old former bond trader, and his ex-assistant were arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking and transporting women for commercial sex acts over a decade. The indictment alleges Rubin brutalized women in a specially outfitted Manhattan penthouse, causing injuries and fear, and used non-disclosure agreements to threaten them into silence. Prosecutors claim over $1 million was spent operating the trafficking network and are seeking to have Rubin held without bail due to being a flight risk and a danger to the community.</p>

          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he stabbed in the neck while she slept in 2021. Immediately after the incident, Elliott called 911, claiming he thought he was dreaming and later stated he was sleepwalking. His defense is supported by a family history of sleepwalking and a sleep disorder expert who concluded that Elliott could have unintentionally killed his sister during a slow-wave sleep episode. Prosecutors remain skeptical, questioning his account and pointing to the nature of the wounds as they proceed with the murder trial.</p>

          <p>Federal law enforcement officers deployed tear gas and pepper balls during a confrontation with protesters outside an ICE processing center in Broadview, Illinois. The demonstration, which saw protesters attempting to block vehicles, is part of ongoing opposition to the transfer of ICE detainees to other states. This tense standoff follows a recent shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas and violent clashes at the same Illinois location last week, prompting Homeland Security to condemn what it calls hateful anti-ICE rhetoric from sanctuary politicians.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly payments for home equity loans have decreased, making them a more affordable option for homeowners. A new $150,000 home equity loan with a 10-year term now costs approximately $1,847 per month, a modest saving compared to costs earlier in the year. While the reduction is not dramatic, the cumulative savings over the life of the loan can be significant, and further rate cuts are anticipated later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Costco's latest quarterly earnings report beat revenue and profit estimates but failed to fully impress investors due to a miss on same-store sales growth and a slight dip in membership renewal rates. Despite these concerns, which caused a minor drop in the company's stock, many analysts remain optimistic, highlighting strong membership fee growth and Costco's consistent execution. Wall Street largely maintained buy ratings, viewing the retailer as a defensive stock with a strong value proposition, though some adjusted their price targets downward. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision follows a recommendation from a Dutch committee which concluded the fossils were likely removed against the will of the local population.

          <p>A retirement strategy known as the 'rule of thirds' is gaining popularity as an alternative to traditional withdrawal methods like the 4% rule. This approach involves converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending, aiming to balance financial security with liquidity. This strategy may help reduce stress from market volatility, but retirees must consider the trade-offs of locking up a significant portion of their savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moldova's Central Electoral Commission has barred the pro-Russia party 'Heart of Moldova' from participating in this weekend's parliamentary elections. The decision follows a court ruling that limited the party's activities amid an investigation into illegal financing and vote-buying operations, which officials allege are part of a broader Russian effort to sway the election's outcome. The party has denied the accusations, calling the ban a politically motivated move by the current pro-European government. The election is considered a critical test for Moldova's bid to join the European Union.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's Discounted $1 Million 'Gold Card' Visa Sees High Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 12:47:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's new 'Gold Card' visa, which grants residency for a $1 million 'unrestricted gift' to the government, has reportedly generated a surge in demand from the global wealthy. Immigration attorneys say the price, reduced from an initial $5 million, makes it one of the most competitive 'golden visa' programs in the world. Despite the interest, the program faces legal hurdles as it was created via executive order, and no formal application process is yet available, which may cause some potential applicants to wait until its legitimacy is confirmed.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech at the UN General Assembly, condemning recent moves by Western nations to recognize a Palestinian state as a 'mark of shame.' His address prompted a walkout by dozens of diplomats, leaving large portions of the hall empty. Netanyahu reiterated Israel's refusal to allow a Palestinian state and refuted UN findings of genocide and aid restriction in Gaza. In a move criticized by his political opponents, he also arranged for his speech to be broadcast via loudspeakers into the Gaza Strip.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent focus on immigration, highlighted by his proposal for a mandatory digital ID to work in the UK, is being interpreted as a direct political maneuver to challenge Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. With Reform leading in some polls, Starmer is shifting his government's priorities to address border control, an issue he previously downplayed, framing the debate as a choice between 'patriotic national renewal' and the 'politics of predatory grievance.' This strategic pivot signals that immigration will be a central battleground in the lead-up to the next election.</p>

Senator Chris Murphy described the situation as a 'constitutional crisis,' while others pointed to the recent replacement of a U.S. Attorney as a move to ensure charges were filed. They argue the indictment for perjury is a 'disgraceful attack on the rule of law' intended to target a political adversary, while most Republicans have taken a more reserved stance, awaiting further details from the legal process.</p>
