          <p>Jurors are entering their third day of deliberations in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs. They have reached a partial verdict on four counts, including sex trafficking and prostitution-related charges, but remain deadlocked on the most severe charge of racketeering conspiracy. The judge has instructed the jury to continue deliberating on the unresolved count before any verdicts can be announced. Combs faces a potential life sentence if convicted on the racketeering charge, making the outcome of the jury's final decision highly consequential.</p>

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing accusations of cultural appropriation from Indian fashion critics and officials over a sandal design resembling traditional Kolhapuri chappals. Following a social media outcry, a Prada executive acknowledged the design's Indian roots and stated the product may not reach the market. This incident has prompted the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce to pursue a patent for the traditional footwear to protect it from future copyright infringement. The controversy also highlights the economic and cultural significance of the sandals, which are historically crafted by marginalized Dalit artisans.</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama has announced that the tradition of his reincarnation will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that he might be the final one. In a statement, the 90-year-old spiritual leader asserted that the process of finding his successor must follow Buddhist traditions and be managed by his Gaden Phodrang Trust. He implicitly warned China against meddling in the succession, a process Beijing claims it has the sole authority to approve. This decision is politically significant for Tibetans seeking to preserve their cultural and religious identity under Chinese rule.</p>

          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced a Â£2.65 billion deal to acquire its rival TSB, a move that could see the TSB brand vanish from UK high streets. If the deal is approved, Santander intends to integrate TSB into its UK group, which would create Britain's third-largest bank by personal current accounts. While the integration promises efficiency savings, it also raises concerns about potential job losses and branch closures, particularly in back-office roles and areas where both banks currently operate. The deal is expected to be finalized in early 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Department of Homeland Security initiative has revealed extensive abuse and exploitation of unaccompanied migrant children who were placed with improperly vetted sponsors during the previous administration. According to DHS, the program has found sponsors involved in child sexual abuse, forced labor, and neglect, as well as sponsors with serious criminal histories. Officials state the initiative is designed to locate at-risk children and ensure their safety, holding accountable those who exploited systemic failures. The findings highlight critical gaps in the sponsor-vetting process and the severe dangers faced by vulnerable children after crossing the border.</p>

          <p>A landmark inquiry in the Australian state of Victoria has concluded that British colonists committed genocide against the region's Indigenous population. The Yoorrook Justice Commission's report found that mass killings, disease, and cultural erasure led to a 75% reduction in the Aboriginal population within two decades of colonization in the 1830s. The report issues 100 recommendations for redress, including a government apology and overhauls of the education and health systems to combat systemic racism. The finding has been called "indisputable" by Indigenous leaders, though three of the five commissioners did not approve its inclusion in the final report.</p>

The failure at the North Hyde substation resulted in thousands of cancelled flights and affected numerous homes and essential services.

          <p>A severe heat wave is intensifying across Europe, prompting red alerts in parts of Germany and France, while Spain and Portugal have recently reported record June temperatures. The extreme weather has led to school and tourist attraction closures, and French authorities have reported at least two heat-related deaths. In Germany, temperatures are forecast to approach 40Â°C (104Â°F), and Italy has experienced power outages due to the strain on its energy grid. The UN's climate agency has warned that such heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change.</p>

          <p>In a surprising start to NBA free agency, center Myles Turner is leaving the Indiana Pacers to sign a four-year, $107 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. To facilitate the move, the Bucks have waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and will now become a free agent. Lillard is expected to miss most or all of the upcoming season. The move marks a significant roster shakeup for both the Bucks and the Pacers, who are also dealing with a long-term injury to their star guard, Tyrese Haliburton.</p>
