        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration announced a freeze on approximately $18 billion in federal funding for two major New York City infrastructure projects, the Hudson Tunnel and Second Avenue Subway. This action, targeting the home state of Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, was declared on the first day of a government shutdown. The White House justified the halt by citing a review for "unconstitutional DEI principles," a claim strongly disputed by Democratic leaders who emphasized the projects' importance for jobs, commutes, and the national economy. The Transportation Department confirmed that project reimbursements are on hold until this administrative review, now delayed by furloughs, is finished, underscoring the political implications of the shutdown.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order designating any armed attack against Qatar as a "threat to the peace and security of the United States," promising "all lawful and appropriate measures" to defend U.S. and Qatari interests.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal government initiated a shutdown at midnight after lawmakers failed to agree on extending funding, primarily due to a stalemate over health care tax credits. Democrats pushed for these credits, while Republicans insisted on negotiating them outside the context of the funding bill. This article explains the annual budget process, the history of stopgap measures, and the specific disagreements that led to the current lapse, including the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers face furloughs or unpaid work, with potential economic costs estimated in billions. The article provides essential context for understanding the current political gridlock and its immediate, widespread consequences for federal operations and employees.</p>

          <p>Huntington Beach, California, has declared itself a "non-sanctuary" city, directly challenging California's state-level sanctuary policies that restrict local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Mayor Pat Burns, a vocal supporter of President Trump, championed the initiative, expressing concerns about the unknown impact of undocumented immigrants on the city. While California law limits local police assistance to ICE, Burns views the non-sanctuary status as a strong statement of intent. The Trump administration has previously threatened to withhold federal grants from sanctuary jurisdictions, though these attempts have been legally challenged.

The clients, including a Christian convert who entered the country with his pregnant wife, reportedly "disappeared" from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainee locator system before their removal. Their asylum claims were denied, and they were sent back to Iran. This follows an Iranian official's announcement that about 120 Iranian nationals would be returned from the U.S. The attorney called the deportations "unconscionable," arguing these individuals are vulnerable and stand against the Iranian regime, contradicting U.S. foreign policy goals.</p>

Another incident involved police pulling over a Waymo in San Francisco for an illegal U-turn, with no human driver to issue a citation. While Waymo, owned by Alphabet, claims its safety data shows fewer serious injury crashes compared to human drivers, experts argue these vehicles need to be held to a higher standard as they expand into more cities.

          <p>Cool Patch Pumpkins in northern California, home to a corn maze once crowned the world's largest, invites visitors to rediscover the joy of getting lost. Owner Taylor Cooley emphasizes the excitement of disorientation in a world dominated by GPS. Spread over 40 acres, the maze typically takes at least 45 minutes to complete and features elaborate, overhead-visible designs, this year celebrating farmers. Visitors from Hawaii and other areas shared their lighthearted experiences of navigating the confusing pathways. Beyond the maze, the patch also offers a corn bath for toddlers, providing unique fall entertainment. This article highlights a fun, seasonal recreational activity.</p>

          <p>Nadine Fallone was awarded nearly £65,000 by an employment tribunal for unfair treatment and dismissal, but over a year later, she has not received any of the money. Her former employer, Peckham Levels Ltd, went into administration shortly after the judgment, leaving her without recourse. This article highlights a systemic flaw: a government scheme designed to tackle non-payments has seen only 109 out of 4,800 issued penalties paid, and not a single employer named despite nearly 4,000 requests. This investigation, a joint project with The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, exposes the "completely broken" system, leaving many claimants like Fallone in financial distress despite winning their cases.</p>

Arteta has granted the 26-year-old midfielder "total freedom" to explore, take risks, and generate spaces, believing creativity is intrinsic to his nature.

This follows similar settlements by Meta and X, totaling $59.5 million from the three tech giants. The article frames these settlements as "profound obsequiousness and corporate cowardice," suggesting tech companies are effectively admitting their content moderation decisions were wrong.

          <p>The White House announced that mass layoffs of U.S. federal workers are "imminent" if the government shutdown persists, with Vice-President JD Vance accusing Democrats of political games. The shutdown began after Congress failed to agree on a spending plan, primarily over healthcare funding, which Democrats want to secure. Vance and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that "sometimes you have to do things that you don't want to do," blaming Democrats for the situation. While essential workers may work unpaid, the Trump administration has threatened permanent layoffs, potentially impacting 750,000 federal employees.
