          <h2>Treasury Secretary Defends Trump's Trade Strategy Amid China Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 11:03:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended President Trump's approach to trade negotiations, describing it as 'strategic uncertainty' where the outcome isn't revealed beforehand to maximize leverage. Bessent acknowledged uncertainty regarding direct communications between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, but emphasized the strong relationship between the two leaders. He suggested a trade deal with China could take months, contingent on 'good behavior' from trading partners to avoid escalating tariffs. Bessent dismissed concerns about investor confidence in the U.S. economy, attributing recent market fluctuations to short-term noise rather than a fundamental loss of faith.

          <p>Requests for church asylum in Germany have significantly increased, with some regions reporting a quadrupling of requests, as refugees seek protection from threatened deportation. The Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) reports that they are struggling to meet the high demand, leaving many asylum seekers unprotected. This rise coincides with the incoming government's plans to increase deportations. Churches in Germany have a long tradition of providing temporary shelter to refugees, allowing their asylum cases to be reevaluated, particularly in Dublin cases where asylum was first sought in another EU country.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not reduce tariffs on China unless they offer something 'substantial' in return, indicating a firm stance in ongoing trade negotiations. He specified that he wants China to be more open to U.S. businesses and products, referencing a previous deal that China allegedly backed out of. Trump's comments suggest that easing trade tensions hinges on China's willingness to further open its markets to American commerce, though he expressed uncertainty about whether China desires such openness.</p>

          <p>Fifty years ago, President Gerald Ford made the controversial decision to welcome 130,000 South Vietnamese refugees and asylum-seekers into the United States after the fall of Saigon. Despite public opposition and economic concerns, Ford argued that the U.S. had a 'profound moral obligation' to those who supported the alliance with the United States. These refugees, initially reliant on public assistance, eventually became contributors to American society, including federal judges and artists. Ford's decision underscores the strength derived from diversity in a nation of immigrants, reflecting compassion, political courage, and moral clarity.</p>

Steelers owner Art Rooney II and head coach Mike Tomlin have publicly expressed interest in bringing in the four-time MVP, but the decision ultimately rests with Rodgers, with retirement still a possibility.

          <p>Despite headwinds from the Trump administration's policies and supply chain issues, the U.S. wind energy industry is seeing growth through 'repowering,' which involves upgrading or replacing aging turbines.

Repowering offers economic benefits by increasing electricity output and extending the lifecycle of existing wind farms, though public opposition and permitting challenges remain hurdles.

This has left Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre struggling to adjust. Carney's focus on the economy and his emphasis on the threat posed by Trump's tariffs resonate with voters, particularly older Canadians.

          <p>The war in Gaza has resulted in over 52,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, as Israel continues its offensive after ending a ceasefire with Hamas. Israeli forces have expanded a buffer zone and encircled the city of Rafah, controlling around 50% of the territory. The territory's 2 million Palestinians face severe shortages of food and medicine, with aid groups warning of imminent supply depletion. Hamas has stated it will only release remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire, and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p>

          <p>A therapist with extensive experience working with couples has identified five common habits that can damage relationships. These include assuming your partner can read your mind, keeping score, passive-aggressive behavior, backseat driving their life, and listening for the sake of responding. These behaviors can lead to resentment, dissatisfaction, and a breakdown in communication. The therapist emphasizes the importance of open communication, giving without expecting anything in return, and actively listening to understand your partner's perspective.</p>
