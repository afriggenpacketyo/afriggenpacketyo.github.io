        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball is reportedly nearing finalization on new three-year media rights agreements with major broadcasters ESPN, NBC Sports, and streaming giant Netflix, slated to commence in 2026. ESPN, having previously opted out of its $550 million-per-year Sunday Night Baseball deal, is set to receive a new package worth the same amount, encompassing in-market games for five local teams and a mid-week national game series. Under the proposed terms, NBC would secure the rights to all Sunday games and Wild Card playoff matches for an estimated $200 million annually, while Netflix is poised to acquire the exclusive rights for the popular Home Run Derby for about $50 million a year. These significant agreements, which are expected to reshape MLB's broadcast landscape, are scheduled to conclude after the 2028 season, though finalization is still pending.</p>

          <p>A tour bus tragically rolled over in a "serious mass casualty" accident on the New York State Thruway near Pembroke, located northeast of Buffalo, following a collision with a semi-truck. The incident necessitated the closure of all eastbound lanes and triggered a substantial emergency response, including air medical transport. As of early reports, seven patients were admitted to the Erie County Medical Center, a level 1 trauma center, with at least four individuals transported by air. New York Governor Kathy Hochul acknowledged the tragic event, confirming her team's close coordination with state police and local officials to provide rescue and aid to all affected.</p>

          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a leading hunger watchdog, has officially confirmed that a famine is occurring in parts of Gaza, with conditions expected to worsen. This grim declaration, based on criteria like extreme food lack, acute child malnutrition, and daily deaths from starvation, led UN Secretary-General António Guterres to label it a "man-made disaster" and a "failure of humanity." Despite previous warnings and ample aid waiting at borders, delivery is severely hampered by Israeli restrictions and logistical challenges, underscoring a critical lack of political will to address the crisis. Israel, however, disputes the report, calling it an "outright lie."</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Chicago would likely be the next target for a federal anti-crime initiative, following ongoing operations in Washington, D.C., with New York City slated thereafter. He indicated a willingness to deploy "regular military" in D.C. if necessary, a significant escalation of federal military involvement on U.S. soil. Trump criticized Chicago's mayor as "grossly incompetent" and claimed residents were "screaming" for federal intervention. The plan's implementation outside D.C., where federal authority is unique, remains unclear, as state National Guard units are under gubernatorial control and local leaders in these Democratic-led states would likely resist.</p>

This year has already witnessed the highest number of fires in a decade, with ongoing heat exacerbating public health threats and drying out landscapes across several Western states.</p>

          <p>A U.S. court has ordered the release of Kilmar Ábrego García from criminal custody in Tennessee, marking a significant development after his wrongful deportation to El Salvador earlier this year. The Maryland father of two was initially deported in March based on unproven claims of MS-13 gang affiliation by the Trump administration, and subsequently reported physical and psychological torture during his detention in El Salvador. Despite being returned to the U.S. following a Supreme Court order, he was then charged with human smuggling, which his lawyers dismiss as "preposterous." Ábrego plans to return to Maryland, with his criminal trial scheduled for January.</p>

          <p>Intel shares surged approximately 6% following reports that the Trump administration is preparing to announce the U.S. government will take an equity stake in the struggling chipmaker. President Trump indicated the government should acquire about 10% of the company, though White House officials noted ongoing discussions and that Intel's CEO has not explicitly agreed to a deal. This move aligns with a shift in U.S. industrial policy, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick previously stating the government sought an equity stake in exchange for CHIPS Act funds, which would be nonvoting. Intel is investing billions in Ohio factories to produce advanced chips, but slowed construction in July. (not investment advice)</p>

Credit card forbearance offers a temporary reprieve, allowing borrowers to pause or reduce payments and potentially waive fees or freeze interest, though interest may still accrue. Eligibility typically requires proof of genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or unexpected expenses, along with a history of on-time payments. For those who don't qualify, alternatives like debt management plans, consolidation loans, balance transfers, or even bankruptcy can provide pathways to regain financial control.

          <p>Many American retirees rely on Social Security, yet several factors can unexpectedly reduce their benefits. Working while receiving benefits before full retirement age can trigger an earnings test, leading to temporary deductions. Additionally, Medicare Part B premiums are often automatically deducted, and high-income earners may face higher Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA), significantly impacting their net payment. Finally, Social Security benefits can be subject to federal income tax if combined income exceeds certain thresholds, potentially taxing up to 85% of benefits. Understanding these pitfalls is crucial for retirement planning and maintaining financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are navigating the impact of President Trump's increased tariffs, largely absorbing costs or diversifying sourcing to avoid widespread consumer price hikes. While some prices have risen, efforts to keep costs low and expand discounts have mitigated the impact, with consumer spending remaining steady overall. However, lower-income shoppers are more sensitive to price changes, and some categories struggle. Companies like Sharkninja have carefully adjusted prices and reduced discounting, while others, such as Home Depot, are increasing domestic sourcing. The ongoing trade uncertainty, particularly with China, continues to influence retailers' strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has called for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign, threatening to fire her, following allegations of mortgage fraud made by his appointee, Bill Pulte, director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency. Pulte claims Cook falsified bank and property records by designating two homes as primary residences to secure more favorable loan terms. Cook has vehemently denied the allegations and stated her intention not to be "bullied" into stepping down, vowing to provide accurate information. This demand comes amidst Trump's ongoing pressure on the Fed for interest rate cuts and his criticism of Chair Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The parents of 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro have been arrested on suspicion of murder in Cabazon, California, over a week after the infant was reported missing. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s officials confirmed the arrests, but the search for baby Emmanuel is still active. Initially, the mother claimed she was assaulted in a Yucaipa parking lot before her child was abducted. However, investigators later found inconsistencies in her statements, prompting her to cease cooperation with interviews and leading to the consideration that the parents might have harmed him. This tragic development marks a grim turn in the case as authorities continue their efforts to locate the missing baby.</p>

While some reports predict millions of new AI-created jobs, others note over 10,000 job cuts linked to AI adoption in 2025.

This action, framed as a "national security investigation" into classified leaks, follows President Trump's long-standing demands for Bolton's prosecution. Top DOJ and FBI officials unusually posted about the search on social media, signaling a shift towards public displays of retribution. Critics argue this reflects a new willingness within the DOJ, now staffed with loyalists, to pursue investigations against Trump's perceived enemies, a departure from his first term.</p>

Global gold ETFs saw significant inflows in July, on track for their second-strongest year, driven by both U.S. and Asian investors. Experts note that while investors remain "risk on," there's a growing appreciation for gold's role in portfolio diversification. Despite earlier concerns about potential tariffs on gold, the Trump administration dispelled these rumors, further bolstering bullish sentiment. This trend suggests considerable room for continued growth in gold and gold ETF allocations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Novelist Lauren Groff embarked on a pilgrimage to Kyoto, Japan, seeking insights into Lady Murasaki, the enigmatic author of "The Tale of Genji," often considered the world's first novel. Navigating the city's "age of overtourism," Groff visited sites associated with Murasaki but found her deepest connections through sensory experiences and spiritual encounters, rather than physical relics. She describes achieving a feeling of "living outside time" and gaining epiphanies about Murasaki's writing and her own understanding of self through moments like a hot bath or a tea-and-meditation ceremony. This journey explores the intersection of historical literary quest and personal spiritual discovery.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain a secure option for savers, offering guaranteed returns and principal protection, especially with current rates around 4%. A $10,000 deposit can yield noticeable interest, with a 3-month CD earning about $107.50, a 6-month around $222.50, and a 1-year CD approximately $430. Longer terms, like a 5-year CD at 4.20%, could accrue roughly $2,100 in interest. CDs provide predictability and FDIC insurance, making them popular. Choosing the right term depends on liquidity needs, as locking in funds longer generally yields higher returns, and acting soon may secure rates that could decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

Notable finds include limestone structures, royal figures, sphinxes, a merchant ship, and stone anchors.
