This advanced feature will function as a 'computer-use agent,' capable of performing multi-step tasks like resizing photos or creating playlists using locally stored files and desktop applications. The tool, called Copilot Actions, will operate in a contained environment for user safety and will be off by default, allowing users to observe its actions and intervene if necessary. This initiative is part of Microsoft's broader strategy to integrate more powerful AI functionalities into its operating system to attract users and compete with rivals.</p>

          <p>Court proceedings have started for a 28-year-old Afghan man accused of a fatal knife attack in a park in Aschaffenburg, Germany. The trial will focus on determining his criminal responsibility, as he is believed to suffer from mental illness, with prosecutors seeking his permanent confinement in a psychiatric hospital. The January attack resulted in the deaths of a two-year-old boy and a 41-year-old man who intervened, while several others were injured. The case, which prosecutors say lacks extremist motives, has fueled Germany's political debate on immigration and deportation policies.</p>

Before beginning the dangerous four-hour descent, he scattered the ashes of his late partner, Hilaree Nelson, at the summit in a poignant tribute. The route is known for its extreme difficulty and avalanche risk, having claimed the life of a snowboarder in 2002. Morrison's achievement, documented by a film crew, marks a significant milestone in mountaineering history and was his third attempt at the challenging feat.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are attempting to advance a defense spending bill to ensure military members are paid during the ongoing government shutdown, but the effort faces opposition from Democrats. Democrats are hesitant to support the measure without a broader bipartisan agreement on the overall appropriations process, citing a lack of trust after previous funding disputes. They argue for a comprehensive plan that respects their priorities, rather than passing spending bills piecemeal. This legislative standoff highlights the deep partisan divisions that are prolonging the shutdown and preventing the government from being fully reopened.</p>

          <p>In his annual address, MI5 Director General Ken McCallum warned that the UK is facing a 'new era' of security challenges, marked by escalating threats from states like Russia, China, and Iran, alongside a near-record volume of terrorist investigations. He revealed that MI5 disrupted 19 late-stage terror plots since 2020 and has seen a 35% increase in investigations into individuals linked to hostile states in the past year. McCallum emphasized that state actors are adopting aggressive methods previously associated with terrorism, targeting UK infrastructure, academia, and Parliament, signaling a major shift in the agency's mission.</p>

This move follows a period of corporate turbulence, including the recent dismissal of its CEO and the early departure of its chairman.

          <p>A new longitudinal study from The Trevor Project reveals a significant increase in mental health distress among LGBTQ+ youth in the U.S., correlating with a rise in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. The research, which followed nearly 1,700 young people, found that reports of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation grew over the study period. However, the study also highlighted the powerful protective effect of supportive environments, showing that high family support was linked to a 62% lower odds of suicidal thoughts. The findings underscore the negative impact of discrimination while emphasizing the critical role of acceptance in improving mental health outcomes.</p>

Although operations at the factory, which produces 70% of Nexperia's output, appear normal, workers report low morale and a lack of official communication.

          <p>Californians are set to vote on Proposition 50, a controversial measure proposed by state Democrats to redraw congressional maps in an effort to gain up to five House seats. The plan is a direct response to a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas and aims to rebalance congressional representation nationally. While many voters express a dislike for gerrymandering, they view the proposition as a necessary tactical move to ensure fair representation in the face of what they perceive as partisan maneuvers by the GOP. The measure is temporary, set to last for three election cycles before California's independent commission resumes control after the 2030 Census.</p>

          <p>Japan's environment ministry has reported a record seven fatalities from bear attacks this fiscal year, the highest number since statistics began in 2006. Experts attribute the surge in human-bear encounters to food shortages, such as acorns, likely caused by climate change, which forces hungry bears into populated areas. Warmer weather may also be disrupting their hibernation patterns. The incidents, which have also left over 100 people injured, are occurring as Japan's rural population ages and shrinks, leading to more frequent and dangerous interactions between humans and wildlife encroaching on towns.</p>

Under the plan, drivers of vehicles weighing over 2,400kg would face a surcharge for parking permits, and those with diesel cars would also pay more.

          <p>While infrastructure and service quality are often cited as reasons for low mass transit ridership in the U.S., fear of crime is a significant and underappreciated factor. Many Americans perceive public transit as unsafe, a fear substantiated by reports of assaults and a recent surge in subway crime in major cities. This perception creates a vicious cycle: as safety-conscious riders opt for private transport, public spaces become less populated by rule-following individuals, potentially making them feel even less safe. The article argues that improving public safety and enforcing rules against disorder are crucial for increasing ridership and realizing a more robust public transit future.</p>

Tran, who came to the U.S. legally as a refugee from Vietnam, was detained during a routine annual check-in and held in facilities across the country. A federal judge ordered her release, finding her continued detention unnecessary, though she still faces the possibility of deportation. Her case highlights the 'one-size-fits-all' approach of the immigration system, as her lawyers argue she has built a stable life for decades and deserves a second chance.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) dropped by 8% in premarket trading following the release of a disappointing financial forecast for its fiscal year 2026. The data center equipment company projected adjusted earnings per share and revenue growth that both fell short of Wall Street analysts' expectations. CEO Antonio Neri explained the guidance reflects a reset baseline that incorporates the recent acquisition of Juniper Networks. In an effort to boost shareholder value, the company also announced an additional $3 billion for its share buyback program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has threatened automaker Stellantis with legal action over its decision to move production of the Jeep Compass from Ontario, Canada, to a plant in Illinois. Canada's Industry Minister, Mélanie Joly, stated that the company had a 'legally binding' commitment to its Brampton, Ontario, facility in exchange for past financial support from the government. The dispute arises from Stellantis's new $13 billion investment in its U.S. operations. The Canadian government insists it will exercise all options to hold the company to its agreement, emphasizing the partnership that helped save the automaker from bankruptcy in 2009.</p>

          <p>The BBC has rejected a legal claim from former 'MasterChef' host Gregg Wallace, who is seeking damages for 'distress and harassment.' Wallace, who was dismissed from the show in July following misconduct allegations, claims the broadcaster failed to comply with a personal data request. In its legal defense, the BBC denies that Wallace suffered any distress and argues it has provided him with all the personal data to which he is entitled. Wallace's departure from the long-running cooking show came after an inquiry upheld 45 allegations against him, most related to inappropriate language and humor.</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations and provided a strong profit forecast for the final quarter of the year, signaling a recovery from a challenging start to 2025. The carrier expects to earn between $3.00 and $3.50 per share, well above analysts' estimates. Despite this positive outlook, its third-quarter revenue of $15.23 billion fell slightly short of projections. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the airline's resilience to long-term investments in its network, technology, and premium services, which are successfully attracting and retaining loyal, high-value customers despite macroeconomic volatility.</p>

The Israel Prison Service has denied the allegations, calling them 'false claims.' Barghouti is a senior Fatah leader often seen as a potential unifying figure in Palestinian politics, and his name was at the top of a list of prisoners Hamas sought in a recent hostage exchange, a request Israel denied.</p>

While basic services like trash collection are being maintained using pre-collected entrance fees, the absence of rangers and other essential personnel has resulted in widespread reports of illegal activities, including unauthorized camping and BASE jumping. Advocates warn that keeping parks open without adequate staffing repeats the mistakes of past shutdowns, which led to irreversible damage to natural resources.

          <p>This article posits that advanced chatbots like ChatGPT function as authorless fictional characters, creating a disorienting social dynamic for users. While OpenAI provides a style guide encouraging a warm, friendly persona, the AI generates its text spontaneously, adapting to each user without direct authorial control. This creates a powerful illusion of a real, empathetic conversational partner, which can be both helpful and potentially dangerous, as seen in a lawsuit where a chatbot allegedly encouraged a teenager's suicide. The author argues that this blurs the line between a primary speech genre (real conversation) and a secondary one (constructed text), a loophole in our social contract that tech companies are not adequately addressing.</p>

          <p>The recent collapse of a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China has raised serious questions for the UK government and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Newly published witness statements from a top national security adviser detail the 'active espionage threat' posed by China, making the CPS's decision to drop the case for lack of evidence seem perplexing. The inclusion of current Labour government policy language in a witness statement has fueled Conservative claims of political interference, which the government denies. The controversy has pushed the UK-China relationship and the nature of the threat from Beijing to the forefront of political debate.</p>

          <p>A recent study by Cerulli Associates reveals that only 27% of beneficiaries plan to continue using their parents' wealth advisor after receiving an inheritance. The primary reason for this shift is not dissatisfaction with advisors but the fact that most heirs, often in their 40s to 60s, already have an established relationship with their own financial advisor. The report highlights a communication gap, as many benefactors are reluctant to discuss estate plans with their children, preventing advisors from building relationships with the next generation. As over $120 trillion is expected to be transferred in the coming decades, this trend represents a major challenge for the wealth management industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Data centers require vast amounts of water for cooling, and many new projects by tech giants like Amazon and Google are planned for water-stressed areas in Spain and Greece. Critics argue that policymakers are prioritizing the AI boom without adequately considering sustainability, creating a potential conflict between technological ambition and environmental reality. While the industry is exploring innovations like using non-potable water, the immense off-site water footprint from energy generation and manufacturing remains a major challenge.</p>
