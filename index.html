          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new fare structures for its premium cabins, similar to how it segmented its main cabin with options like basic economy. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, noted that premium seat revenue has grown significantly, prompting a focus on offering more tailored choices to high-end customers. While specific changes have not been announced, possibilities could include different levels of service and amenities within business or first class. Delta is currently surveying travelers to gauge interest and ensure new offerings provide clear value before any official rollout.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has voided the plea agreements for three men accused of planning the 9/11 attacks, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, prolonging the legal proceedings at Guantánamo Bay. The deals, which would have resulted in life sentences instead of the death penalty, were rescinded by the Secretary of Defense shortly after being announced. This ruling reverses lower court decisions that had upheld the agreements, deepening the frustration for some 9/11 families who seek closure. The case remains mired in pre-trial hearings, with defense lawyers now considering an appeal to a higher court.</p>

          <p>President Trump toured the flood-ravaged areas of central Texas, where at least 121 people have died and over 170 remain missing. Accompanied by Texas officials, he met with first responders and families of victims, emphasizing his strong relationship with Republican Governor Greg Abbott. The visit highlighted a contrast in Trump's response compared to other disasters where he has criticized local, often Democratic, leadership. His approach in Texas has been one of support and solidarity, avoiding scrutiny of the local response to the catastrophic flooding in a politically supportive region.</p>

          <p>In an ongoing legal battle, lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have asked a federal judge to require the government to provide 72 hours' notice before any attempt to deport him. Abrego Garcia, who was previously deported to El Salvador despite a court order and later returned to the U.S. to face charges, is at the center of a highly irregular immigration case. The judge has expressed significant frustration with the government's lack of clarity regarding its plans for him if he is released on bond. This request aims to provide his legal team with a window to seek court intervention to prevent another potentially unlawful removal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a rare occurrence largely attributed to a significant increase in tariff collections. Customs duties for the month were 301% higher than the previous year, contributing to a 13% overall rise in government receipts compared to June 2024. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains substantial at $1.34 trillion. The report also highlighted the ongoing financial pressure from high interest payments on the national debt, which totaled $84 billion for the month. (not investment advice)</p>

This article outlines three potential strategies for homeowners and those with savings to bolster their finances during retirement. Options discussed include reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners aged 62 or older to receive payments from their home equity. Another method is purchasing an annuity, which provides guaranteed lifetime payments in exchange for a lump-sum investment. A third, though less favorable, option is a personal loan for more immediate financial needs. (not investment advice)</p>

A Labour source countered that she had already quit the union, calling the move a "silly stunt."

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tax experts are highlighting a provision in President Trump's new tax legislation that could create a surprisingly high effective tax rate for some high-income individuals. The bill temporarily raises the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000, but it phases out for those with a modified adjusted gross income between $500,000 and $600,000. This rapid phaseout means that for every extra dollar earned in that range, a portion of the deduction is lost, potentially creating an effective federal tax rate as high as 45.5% on that specific slice of income.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widely adopted fitness goal of walking 10,000 steps per day originated not from scientific research but from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer. While the number is somewhat arbitrary, health experts note that it coincidentally aligns with general physical activity guidelines and can be a useful motivator. Studies show health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at far lower step counts, around 2,500 to 3,000 steps a day. Experts emphasize that consistency and intensity matter more than a specific number, encouraging people to simply move more than they currently do.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the concept of American exceptionalism, questioning whether the U.S. is unique or if it is subject to the same political and social forces as any other nation. It draws upon two recent books reviewed in The Atlantic: one detailing the recovery of children stolen during Argentina's Dirty War, and another on the shared democratic history of the Western Hemisphere. The author suggests these works offer lessons for the U.S., showing that authoritarianism can happen anywhere, but also that democratic principles have been pioneered and strengthened in other nations, offering models for Americans to learn from.</p>

          <p>Missouri's governor has signed a bill repealing a paid sick leave law that was approved by the state's voters just eight months prior. The law, which had allowed workers to accrue paid sick time, was a key target for the state's largest business groups, who argued it was a burdensome mandate. Workers' rights advocates, who had campaigned extensively for the measure, called the repeal a betrayal of Missouri families. The repeal will take effect in late August, and supporters of the original law are already considering a new ballot initiative to reinstate the benefits.</p>

Publications like The Guardian and The Telegraph described the album as having moments of brilliance but ultimately being an "uncomfortable" and "unfiltered cry for help" rather than a triumphant return. The album features a more alternative R&B sound and includes spoken-word interludes addressing his mental health and confrontations with paparazzi.
