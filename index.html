            <p>Singapore has eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time after its Q1 GDP growth fell short of expectations, posting 3.8% instead of the anticipated 4.3%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reduced the rate of appreciation of its policy band, the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER), indicating a cautious approach to currency management. The Ministry of Trade and Industry also downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2% due to declining manufacturing and services sectors, influenced by U.S. tariffs and the U.S.-China trade war. Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledged the significant impact on Singapore's growth, with potential recession risks. (not investment advice)</p>

Senator Chuck Schumer had called for the company to pause flights pending the NTSB investigation, accusing helicopter tour companies of cutting corners. Concerns about the safety of sightseeing excursions in New York City have resurfaced, with critics calling for limits or a ban on nonessential helicopter flights.</p>

            <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals mixed reactions to President Trump's trade and tariff policies, with most Americans anticipating price increases. While Republicans show patience and believe the tariffs will lead to more U.S. manufacturing jobs, a majority of Americans think the tariffs will worsen the economy in the short term. Views on Trump's handling of inflation and the economy have become more negative. Despite these concerns, a majority consider the current economic conditions to be primarily influenced by Trump's policies. (not investment advice)</p>

The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) offers a similar approach, providing monthly income through 2035 with investments in treasuries.

            <h2>Geologist Warns Greenland Mineral Bonanza is a Mirage</h2>

            <p>Geologist Minik Rosing warns that the prospect of a mineral bonanza in Greenland is a mirage, challenging claims that acquiring the territory would provide the U.S. with easy access to wealth. Rosing argues that rare earth elements are not particularly concentrated in Greenland and are easier to obtain elsewhere. He emphasizes that the key issue is not access to minerals but developing facilities for processing raw materials and fostering a competitive market. The geologist expresses skepticism about the strategy to acquire Greenland and the mineral deal in Ukraine.</p>

            <p>President Trump's focus on acquiring Greenland has ignited a sense of defiance on the isolated Arctic island, with residents asserting they are "not for sale" but "open for business." The U.S.'s interest in Greenland dates back centuries, but Trump's overtures have upset many Greenlanders. Despite the U.S. citing national security and mineral resources as reasons for acquisition, many question the need for it. Greenlanders are reassessing their relationship with Denmark and asserting their independence in the face of Trump's persistent pursuit.</p>

            <p>Pete Marocco, the Trump administration official who oversaw the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), has departed from the State Department. The Trump administration has sought to fire nearly all USAID staff, citing wasteful spending and fraud. While sources suggest Marocco may have been pushed out, the State Department lauded his efforts in reviewing foreign assistance spending. Trump has claimed without evidence that USAID was rife with fraud and run by "radical left lunatics."</p>

            <p>A landmark antitrust trial against Meta has commenced, potentially forcing Mark Zuckerberg to sell Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC alleges that Meta acquired these companies to eliminate competition and create a monopoly. Zuckerberg has reportedly lobbied President Trump to drop the case. The trial is expected to run for several weeks, with Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg expected to testify. President Trump's recent firing of two FTC commissioners has raised concerns about political interference in the case.</p>

            <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) responded to a motion for relief by attorneys for Kilmer Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to El Salvador, stating that federal courts lack the authority to direct the executive branch in foreign relations. The DOJ argued that the requests by Abrego Garcia's attorneys would involve interactions with a foreign sovereign and potential violations of that sovereignty. The DOJ emphasized the constitutional limits on the court's authority in matters involving foreign relations.</p>

The report acknowledges the "bravery and professionalism" of officers but notes that forces were unable to act proactively, leaving them exposed. The report found no evidence to support claims of "two-tier policing". Misinformation regarding the identity of the suspect spread quickly online, contributing to the spread of disorder.</p>
