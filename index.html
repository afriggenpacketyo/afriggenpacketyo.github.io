        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Republicans are struggling to secure enough votes for a major tax and spending bill central to President Trump's agenda. The legislation, which extends Trump-era tax cuts and introduces new ones, faces opposition from within the party over its proposed cuts to welfare programs and other provisions. With a slim majority, leadership can only afford three defections, and several senators have already expressed opposition or remain undecided, placing the bill's passage in jeopardy. The latest version includes amendments to appease moderates, such as increased funding for rural hospitals and adjustments to state and local tax deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tropical depression has formed in the western Gulf of Mexico and is projected to intensify into a tropical storm before making landfall in Mexico. The system, designated Tropical Depression 2, was located east-northeast of Veracruz, Mexico, with sustained winds of 30 mph. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect it to strengthen and be named Tropical Storm Barry, making it the second named storm of the Atlantic season.

          <p>The U.S. Senate narrowly voted to begin debate on President Trump's major tax and spending bill after a prolonged and tense session. The procedural motion passed after Senator Ron Johnson switched his vote to yes, avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. Following the vote, Democrats initiated a "read-a-thon," requiring the Senate clerk to read the nearly 1,000-page bill aloud, a process that could take over 15 hours. Despite clearing this hurdle, the bill's final passage remains uncertain as several Republican senators who voted to proceed have not committed to supporting the final version.

The venue, which has been a cultural cornerstone and launching pad for bands like Pulp and Arctic Monkeys, is being taken over by the Electric Group, which owns the building. While the new owners plan to continue operating it as a music venue, the original management is gone, and many artists and fans have expressed their sorrow and stated they will not return under new leadership.

          <p>A jury has convicted Samuel Woodward of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old gay and Jewish college student. The verdict concludes a six-year legal process for Bernstein's family, who described the wait as "slow justice." Prosecutors argued Woodward, a former high school classmate with ties to a neo-Nazi group, was motivated by hate, while the defense claimed the killing was a reaction to an unwanted sexual advance. The conviction means Woodward faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, bringing a measure of closure to a case that highlighted the dangers of extremist ideologies.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with food retailers and manufacturers in England to encourage healthier eating habits and combat rising obesity rates. Under the voluntary plan, businesses will be asked to find ways to make healthy options more appealing, such as through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or product reformulation. The initiative, which is part of a broader 10-year NHS plan, will require major retailers to report on healthy food sales to increase accountability. Critics note that the success of past voluntary schemes has been mixed and stress that the higher cost of healthy food remains a significant barrier for many families.</p>

Without naming specific politicians, he alluded to past instances where he felt compelled to condemn remarks from both Democrats and Republicans.

President Vucic has dismissed the protests as a foreign plot and refused calls for a snap election, while his opponents accuse the government of corruption and ties to organized crime.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave impacts the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island effect," a phenomenon that causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The effect is primarily caused by dark surfaces like asphalt and buildings, which absorb and retain the sun's heat, releasing it slowly and elevating temperatures, especially overnight. This process is compounded by waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning, and a lack of cooling vegetation and water sources found in the countryside. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and intense, this effect puts growing urban populations at greater risk from extreme heat and related health issues.</p>

Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, addressed the crowd, framing the successful march as a victory for freedom over a "hateful power." The event celebrated LGBTQ+ rights while also serving as a broader protest for human rights and solidarity in Hungary's restrictive political climate.</p>

Both men were standing outside their vehicles when they were struck and killed by an oncoming car. The LAPD chief praised Sgt. Deng as a hero who was caring for others, while Garcia's family remembered him as a kind and warm person, setting up a GoFundMe to cover funeral expenses.</p>

Supervisor Hilda Solis is co-sponsoring a motion for the county's attorney to explore all available legal remedies to protect residents' civil rights. The move follows several widely circulated videos showing aggressive arrests by ICE agents in the area, including one in Valinda where a man was bloodied. The motion argues that the federal crackdown has instilled widespread fear, negatively impacting the local economy and residents' access to essential services.</p>

Ambassador Cohen stated that he received a direct invitation from Nagasaki's mayor and that his attendance is intended to show respect for the Japanese people and a mutual understanding of the importance of peace. The decision signifies a mending of relations between Israel and the city's organizers regarding the highly symbolic annual remembrance event.</p>

          <p>Top trade negotiators from Japan and the United States have agreed to continue discussions on tariffs, though significant differences reportedly persist. The talks, held in Washington, aim to forge a mutually beneficial trade deal, but key areas of disagreement include the U.S. treatment of Japan's automotive industry, a critical component of the Japanese economy. Both sides described the discussions as "fruitful" and covered topics such as trade expansion, non-tariff barriers, and broader economic security cooperation. However, a final agreement has not yet been reached as a July deadline looms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters gathered in Bangkok to demand the resignation of Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. The public anger stems from a leaked phone conversation in which she allegedly appeased former Cambodian leader Hun Sen following a recent border clash between the two countries. The controversy has already caused a rift in her ruling coalition, with one party leaving the alliance last week in criticism of her remarks. The large-scale rally increases the political pressure on Prime Minister Paetongtarn, as demonstrators challenge her leadership and handling of the sensitive diplomatic incident with Cambodia.</p>

This crackdown follows a conflict that caused significant casualties and damage in Iran.

Hanya recounts the struggle to find purpose and meaning as her world falls apart, the rationing of emotions to cope with constant loss, and the small acts of resistance and hope she witnesses, like a neighbor tending his garden.

She feels it is the only way to ensure the products are safer and to lower their nicotine levels. The story comes as the UK's ban on disposable vapes, intended to curb youth vaping, takes effect. However, health experts and Trading Standards officials express concern that the ban may have little impact, as some legal, rechargeable vapes are still being marketed toward children and used in a disposable manner, continuing the cycle of addiction.</p>
