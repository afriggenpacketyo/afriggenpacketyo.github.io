          <h2>Meta Reports Decline in Digital Ad Spending from Chinese Retailers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-30 23:30:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta's finance chief, Susan Li, revealed that Chinese online retailers have reduced their ad spending on Facebook and Instagram due to President Trump's trade policies. This reduction is attributed to the impending end of the de minimis trade exemptions, which benefited retailers like Temu and Shein. While some of this spending has been redirected to other markets, the overall expenditure from these advertisers is lower than previous levels. Meta's advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region fell short of Wall Street projections, and the company anticipates headwinds in its advertising business, echoing warnings from Google and Snap. </p>

Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rebuked Apple for thwarting a previous ruling and accused executives of lying.

The judge stated that Apple deliberately interfered with competition and that a top Apple executive lied under oath. The injunction was intended to open the App Store to outside payment options. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney offered an olive branch, suggesting Fortnite's return to the App Store if Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide. </p>

Activists aim to build on the momentum of recent grassroots protests against the administration's actions, including job cuts, immigration raids, and billionaire Elon Musk's involvement in downsizing the government. Organizers say the administration and its allies pose a threat to labor rights, public services, and the safety of immigrants. The protests are expected to be widespread, with events planned in over 1,000 cities. </p>

          <p>President Trump has requested more time to improve the US economy after it experienced its first contraction in three years, raising recession fears. He attributed the downturn to companies stockpiling imports ahead of his tariff implementations. Trump highlighted promises of $8 trillion in inward investment, which he believes will restore American manufacturing. The US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, following a previous quarter growth of 2.4%. </p>

Japan's support for ASEAN countries, including through official security assistance, promotes a free and open Indo-Pacific and peace in the South China Sea.

          <p>The Supreme Court appeared divided over the creation of an online Catholic charter school in Oklahoma, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools. A ruling in favor of the school could upend laws in numerous states and the federal charter school program, which require charter schools to be nonsectarian. Justices Alito and Kavanaugh seemed sympathetic to the school's argument, while liberal justices expressed concern about weakening the separation between church and state. The outcome likely hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts. </p>
