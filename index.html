          <p>The UK government is expected to announce a significant compromise on its proposed changes to benefits. According to multiple sources, the deal with over 100 Labour backbenchers will protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health component of Universal Credit from cuts. This agreement represents a major policy reversal for the government, which was facing a potential defeat in Parliament. The new plan is also expected to accelerate the timeline for support programs designed to help people return to employment.</p>

          <p>Following recent military actions, Iran has firmly stated that no agreement or date has been set for resuming nuclear negotiations with the United States. Iranian officials emphasized that future talks will be more difficult due to the recent violence.

          <p>Federal authorities have made multiple arrests following a riot at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland, Oregon.

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump's upcoming July deadlines for reimposing widespread tariffs on imports are not rigid and could be extended. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the president has the authority to grant extensions or propose reciprocal tariff rates if countries do not reach trade agreements with the U.S. by the specified dates. This signaling of flexibility, also echoed by other administration economic advisors, has been interpreted as a move to allow more time for ongoing negotiations with multiple countries.

          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in the fashion industry for decades, is stepping back from her direct editorial duties at American Vogue after 37 years. While she will no longer be the day-to-day editor, she will retain her influential positions as Vogue's global editorial director and as chief content officer for parent company CondÃ© Nast. The U.S. edition of the magazine will now recruit a new "head of editorial content," a structure already in place at other international Vogue editions.

          <p>After a period of decline earlier in the year, interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently risen, but there are several opportunities for them to fall again this summer. Key dates to watch include the release of the June inflation report on July 15, as a drop in inflation could prompt lenders to lower rates. The Federal Reserve's meetings on July 29 and September 17 are also critical, with the September meeting considered the most likely time for the central bank to announce its first rate cut in months.

The decision by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) contradicts the long-standing consensus from the CDC and FDA that the small amounts of thimerosal used in some multi-dose vials are safe. The vote followed a presentation by an advocate who promoted disproven theories linking the preservative to health issues, drawing sharp criticism from some committee members and medical groups who warned the move could fuel vaccine hesitancy.</p>

The changes, which Apple says it is making reluctantly, introduce new fees, including a "core technology commission" on digital purchases made outside the App Store. Critics, such as Spotify and Epic Games, have accused Apple of "malicious compliance," arguing the new rules are designed to make alternative payment systems commercially unviable, thus violating the spirit of the regulation.

The change is part of a broader effort to streamline the unexpected restart experience for users.

Mamdani, who was born in Uganda and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018, has dismissed the attacks, stating he is proud to be a citizen and uphold the Constitution.</p>

Mamdani's win, centered on a progressive platform of affordability, is seen by some as a path forward for invigorating the party with new, younger leadership. However, his rise has also caused concern among moderate Democrats, who worry that his "extreme" progressive policies could alienate voters in a general election.

Officials deemed the animal a public safety risk and stated that euthanasia was a last resort.

In an apparent effort to regain favor, she has shifted her public statements to align more closely with the administration's narrative, a move that some intelligence community insiders view as a politicization of intelligence.

          <p>For savers considering where to place a significant deposit, this article compares the potential interest earnings of short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. With a $10,000 deposit, a 3-month or 6-month CD currently offers slightly higher returns than a high-yield savings account over the same period. However, for a 9-month term, the high-yield savings account comes out marginally ahead. The choice depends on a saver's outlook on future interest rate changes, as CDs lock in a fixed rate while savings account rates are variable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexico's Supreme Court has delivered a landmark ruling in favor of singer Sasha Sokol, who was in an abusive relationship with a much older producer, Luis de Llano, when she was a 14-year-old pop star. The court upheld a civil conviction against de Llano for moral damages, denying his appeal. Crucially, the decision establishes that the statute of limitations does not apply in civil cases involving the sexual abuse of minors, opening a new path to justice for other victims. Sokol celebrated the ruling, stating that "stabilizing the truth is the beginning of reparation."</p>

          <p>A new study from the Pew Research Center suggests that President Trump would have won the 2024 presidential election even if every eligible citizen had voted. The survey, which polled non-voters on their preferences, found they would have broken for Trump, upending the long-held political belief that higher turnout favors Democrats. The research also highlights a significant shift in Trump's coalition, which became younger and more ethnically diverse compared to 2016. Conversely, the Democratic coalition under Kamala Harris became whiter, and she retained a smaller percentage of 2020 Biden voters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Extreme heat poses a significant threat to transportation infrastructure, according to Arizona State University engineering professor Mikhail Chester. High temperatures can cause materials like asphalt and concrete to expand, leading to buckling roads and runways, while steel in bridges and railway tracks can also expand and warp, creating safety risks. The cumulative effect of sustained heat waves can degrade these materials over time, accelerating the need for costly repairs and maintenance. This requires planners to reconsider design standards to build more resilient infrastructure in a warming climate.</p>

At a Pentagon press conference, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth forcefully argued the attack was "historically successful" and accused the news media of undermining the operation for political reasons. The defense came after a preliminary intelligence assessment suggested the bombings may have only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months.

A paper from Apple researchers titled "The Illusion of Thinking" suggests these models are not developing generalizable problem-solving skills and may just be memorizing patterns.
