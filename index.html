          <p>Irish cyclist Ben Healy achieved his first Tour de France stage win with a remarkable solo breakaway. He attacked from an eight-man group with 42km remaining and finished nearly three minutes ahead of his closest competitors. Meanwhile, Mathieu van der Poel finished far enough ahead of the main peloton to reclaim the overall leader's yellow jersey from Tadej Pogacar by a single second. Healy, who had a strong debut last year, mentioned that he had specifically targeted this hilly stage for a potential victory, crediting his success to immense hard work.</p>

          <p>Police in Belfast have announced they will not help contractors dismantle a large bonfire built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations. The decision came despite concerns that the bonfire's proximity to a major electricity substation could endanger the power supply for two major hospitals. After a multi-agency meeting, police concluded that the risk of letting the bonfire proceed was lower than the risk associated with attempting to dismantle it. The situation highlights ongoing cultural and political tensions in Northern Ireland surrounding traditional unionist events.</p>

This program had provided temporary legal status and work authorization for individuals from Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The affected employees, who were working legally, are now facing unemployment and an uncertain future in the U.S. while navigating complex immigration processes like asylum or spousal visas.

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has granted a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The ruling came in a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of immigrant parents and their infants. The judge determined that the challengers were likely to suffer irreparable harm if the order was enforced. This decision is significant as it utilizes the class-action pathway for relief, a method left open after the Supreme Court recently limited the scope of nationwide injunctions.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK Parliament's intelligence and security committee warns of a rising and unpredictable threat from Iran, encompassing espionage, cyber attacks, and physical threats against dissidents on British soil. The committee documented at least 15 attempted kidnappings or murders since early 2022, urging the government to adopt a better-resourced, long-term strategy. The report criticizes the government's current approach as being focused on crisis management and the nuclear issue, potentially underestimating other persistent dangers posed by the well-resourced Iranian state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis discussed in an NPR interview with New York Times reporter Adam Liptak, recent Supreme Court rulings have significantly altered the balance of power in the U.S. government. The decisions have reportedly expanded the authority of the executive branch while simultaneously limiting the power of lower federal courts to issue broad injunctions. This shift has been facilitated by the court's increasing use of its 'shadow docket' for consequential rulings, raising concerns among legal scholars about the erosion of traditional checks and balances within the constitutional order.</p>

          <p>With credit card interest rates near all-time highs, many consumers are exploring debt forgiveness as a financial solution. This strategy involves negotiating with creditors to settle a debt for a lump-sum payment that is less than the total amount owed. The article suggests this can be a viable option for those whose interest payments are outpacing their principal reduction or who face high penalty APRs. While it can offer substantial savings, consumers should be aware of the potential negative impact on their credit score and any associated fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Netanyahu's Nobel Nomination for Trump Seen as a Cynical Political Maneuver</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian frames Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's nomination of Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize as a calculated political stunt. The author argues the move is an act of flattery designed to distract from international pressure for a ceasefire in Gaza and to prolong the war. By appealing to Trump's well-known desire for the prize, Netanyahu allegedly seeks to maintain his own political power and avoid accountability for his government's actions. The article suggests this maneuver undermines genuine peace efforts in the region.</p>

          <p>An investigative report has highlighted the political activities of Kevin Stein, the CEO of defense contractor TransDigm Group. After his company faced bipartisan congressional scrutiny in 2019 for making what an audit called 'excess profit' from federal contracts, Stein has become a major political donor. Campaign finance records show he has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to candidates from both major parties, including those on committees that have investigated his company. This raises concerns about corporate influence and the effectiveness of government oversight.</p>

          <p>Switzerland has enacted a new law requiring food companies and restaurants to disclose on labels if animal products come from animals that underwent painful procedures without anesthetic. This includes common practices like the castration of pigs, dehorning of cattle, and beak searing of hens. While Swiss farmers must use pain relief for these procedures, the law targets imported products to increase transparency for consumers. The policy aims to pierce the veil of sanitized meat packaging and inform people about the often-hidden suffering involved in global animal agriculture.</p>

          <p>This article explores the rise of 'supermarket fandom,' where grocery chains like Trader Joe’s, Wegmans, and Erewhon cultivate intensely loyal followings. This phenomenon is part of a larger cultural shift where consumption and brand affiliation have become central to expressing personal identity and values. An anthropologist who studies fandom notes that these stores successfully tap into regional, social, and even moral identities, turning the act of grocery shopping into a form of tribal signaling. For many, where they buy their food says something profound about who they are.</p>

          <p>Following catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas, false claims blaming the disaster on cloud seeding have circulated widely online. Meteorologists and weather experts have emphatically stated that a small cloud seeding operation conducted in the region days earlier had no connection to the flooding. They explain that the technique, which aims to enhance rainfall in existing clouds, is not powerful enough to create a storm of such magnitude. The deluge was actually caused by a convergence of storms with the remnants of a tropical storm, a natural weather phenomenon.</p>

It explains that Liberia was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, and as a result, English is the nation's official language and its culture shares many American influences. The capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and the country's flag closely resembles that of the United States. This shared history explains why many Liberians, including their president, speak with a familiar American-style intonation.</p>
