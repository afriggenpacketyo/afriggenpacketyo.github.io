          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to ongoing protests against federal immigration enforcement actions. White House officials claim violent mobs have attacked ICE officers during deportation operations, necessitating federal intervention. The order federalizes a portion of California's National Guard, typically under the governor's command, a move presidents can authorize under specific circumstances. Trump's decision coincides with his attendance at an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in New Jersey, as tensions rise between federal authorities and demonstrators in Los Angeles. Optimism is not high given the clashes.</p>

Following the Noto Peninsula earthquake, overflowing toilets at evacuation centers highlighted the issue. Despite Japan's disaster preparedness reputation, many people lack knowledge on using portable toilets. Education programs are now teaching children how to use them to prevent unhygienic conditions and health complications. Experts recommend stockpiling portable toilets at home and workplaces, assuming they will be the only option for the first 24 hours after a disaster.</p>

They argue that Europe's most successful companies have achieved dominance through sustainable innovation cultures, not overwork. They also emphasize that Gen Z and millennials have less tolerance for toxic hustle cultures, and that startups need more funding and resources, not longer working hours.</p>

          <p>Retiring with a diverse portfolio of assets is crucial, but certain assets can be hidden liabilities that hinder financial security. Brand new cars, timeshares, lottery tickets, life insurance, whole life insurance, and high-interest debt are highlighted as potential money drains. Buying used cars, creating a travel fund instead of investing in timeshares, and avoiding high-interest debt can help secure a more financially stable retirement. Carefully evaluating assets and avoiding these pitfalls can improve retirement prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are working to comply with President Xi Jinping's austerity measures, ensuring their offices are modest and their spending is in order. Inspectors are carrying out checks to enforce the rules, which cover official events, buildings, and travel. The campaign aims to improve the Communist Party's image, stamp out corruption, and cut wasteful spending. Analysts suggest the campaign also serves to ensure resources are used wisely in China's rivalry with the United States and to identify loyal cadres for promotion.</p>
