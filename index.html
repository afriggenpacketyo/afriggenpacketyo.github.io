          <p>A young, 29-foot humpback whale has died after being stranded on a sandbar off Long Beach Island, New Jersey. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center reported that the whale was in a very thin and lethargic condition, with wounds consistent with a previous propeller strike. The animal struggled for at least two nights before passing away, despite efforts by rescue teams to monitor it and administer sedatives for comfort. The center expressed deep sadness over the death of the young whale, which never had a chance to contribute to its species.</p>

          <p>President Trump recently hosted a White House dinner for media mogul Rupert Murdoch, despite an active $10 billion defamation lawsuit Trump filed against Murdoch's Wall Street Journal. The lawsuit stems from a report about a risqué letter allegedly sent by Trump to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday. The dinner, attended by key figures from Murdoch's media empire, highlights the complex and often cozy relationship between Trump and conservative media outlets, even in the face of significant legal disputes between them.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is expected to bring heavy rainfall to Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. The National Hurricane Center reported that the slow-moving storm could strengthen into a hurricane by Friday, but its long-term track is uncertain. While significant flash flooding and landslides are possible on the islands, current forecast models suggest that Melissa is unlikely to have a major impact on the mainland United States.</p>

          <p>The construction of President Trump's new White House ballroom is reportedly being funded by private donors and major corporations, with taxpayers assured they will not cover the costs. A significant portion of the estimated $250 million project includes a $22 million contribution from Alphabet, Google's parent company, as part of a legal settlement with Trump. Other corporate donors reportedly include Lockheed Martin, R.J. Reynolds, and Palantir, though the full list of contributors and their donation amounts remains largely undisclosed, raising ethical questions.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that support for California's Proposition 50, a state redistricting measure, is largely driven by national political sentiments, particularly opposition to President Trump. Voters supporting the measure overwhelmingly cite their desire to oppose the Trump administration, which many feel treats California unfairly. Conversely, opponents view it as a state issue, fearing it will shift power from rural areas to cities. This national focus in a heavily Democratic state appears to be giving the "yes" campaign a lead.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that U.S. cattle ranchers "don't understand" his tariff policies after they criticized his proposal to import beef from Argentina to lower consumer prices. He argued that his tariffs are the only reason ranchers are performing well and insisted they need to lower their prices for the American consumer. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association rebuked the president's plan, saying it undercuts family farmers and interferes with market functions. The proposal comes amid broader scrutiny of the administration's financial support for Argentina's economy.</p>

Locking a rate now provides certainty for budgeting and protection against unexpected market spikes, but risks missing out on lower rates if the Fed acts as anticipated. However, delaying is also risky, as lenders may have already priced in the cuts, and unlocking a rate can incur a "float down" fee.

          <p>The European Parliament has awarded the 2025 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Andrzej Poczobut, a Belarusian journalist imprisoned for his outspoken criticism of leader Alexander Lukashenko. Poczobut, a correspondent for a Polish newspaper, was sentenced to eight years in a penal colony on charges including harming national security. He has consistently refused offers of freedom that would require him to beg for mercy and leave Belarus. The award honors his courageous and principled stance against an authoritarian regime, though it is uncertain if it will improve his harsh conditions.</p>

The bank has set aside $30 million for potential losses on a loan to the Cantor Group, whom it is suing for fraud. CEO Kenneth Vecchione reassured analysts that the bank has since re-verified collateral on all large loans in its note finance portfolio and found no other irregularities. The bank's third-quarter earnings report did not reveal any new major credit issues, helping to calm market fears for now. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For married retirees considering a reverse mortgage to supplement their income, the process involves specific rules that differ from individual applications. Both spouses must typically be at least 62 years old and be listed as co-borrowers to ensure both can remain in the home for life. The loan amount is calculated based on the age of the younger spouse, which may result in access to less equity compared to an older single borrower. Couples must carefully weigh the benefits of eliminating mortgage payments against long-term implications, such as what happens if one spouse passes away. (not investment advice)</p>

Key Trump constituencies, such as farmers, are being hurt by the halt in agricultural aid, and federal employees in Trump-friendly states like West Virginia are going without pay. While the administration has taken steps to shield some groups like the military, the widening impact is making it increasingly difficult to contain the damage along partisan lines, creating pressure on the president and his allies.</p>

This move adds to the pressure for greater transparency in royal finances, particularly concerning the independent Crown Estate's duty to maximize public income from its properties.</p>
