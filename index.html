          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its shares surge after reinstating its 2025 profit forecast, signaling a stronger summer travel season than analysts had predicted. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while booking patterns have shifted, with customers booking closer to their travel dates, overall demand has stabilized after a dip earlier in the year. The airline now projects adjusted full-year earnings of $5.25 to $6.25 a share, a downward revision from its initial, more optimistic forecast but still a sign of confidence. This positive outlook has lifted not only Delta's stock but also shares across the airline industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Varda, a startup focused on manufacturing pharmaceuticals in orbit, has successfully raised $187 million in a Series C funding round. The company's mission is to leverage the microgravity environment of space, which allows for different crystallization of medicines that are difficult to produce on Earth. This new capital injection, bringing its total funding to $329 million, will help Varda increase its flight cadence and expand its capacity to work on more complex molecules. The company has already completed three space launches and recently received FAA approval for its first capsule to return from orbit.</p>

          <p>CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla is expanding its robotaxi service area in Austin, Texas, and plans to integrate the xAI chatbot, Grok, into its vehicles within the next week. This move comes as xAI launches its Grok 4 update, despite recent controversy over antisemitic content generated by a previous version. Musk also mentioned that a robotaxi launch in the Bay Area is awaiting regulatory approval. These developments occur during a challenging period for Musk, who has been in public disputes with the Trump administration, impacting investor confidence and Tesla's stock value.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike killed at least 15 Palestinians, among them eight children and two women, who were waiting for nutritional supplements outside a health clinic in Deir al-Balah, Gaza. The clinic, run by the U.S.-based aid group Project Hope, condemned the attack as a violation of international law. The Israeli military stated it targeted a Hamas operative and expressed regret for any harm to civilians, adding that the incident is under review. This attack occurred amid ongoing, difficult negotiations for a ceasefire, with significant gaps remaining between Israeli and Hamas positions.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has argued that it is too easy to claim benefits in the UK and has proposed significant restrictions on welfare payments. Her plans include barring most foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits and preventing people with less severe conditions like anxiety from being signed off work. Badenoch stated the system is being exploited and needs a crackdown, accusing the Labour Party of turning a blind eye to rising costs. Labour responded by criticizing the Conservatives for leaving behind a broken system after 14 years in government.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State John Kerry stated that his fellow Democrats made a mistake by allowing the U.S.-Mexico border to be "under siege" during the Biden presidency, giving a political advantage to Republicans. In a BBC interview, Kerry said that protecting the border is a fundamental duty of any government and that he wished President Biden had been more vocal about enforcing the law. His comments highlight a significant internal debate within the Democratic party over immigration policy, particularly as the Trump administration pursues aggressive nationwide deportation efforts that have sparked protests and legal challenges.</p>

The messages relate to the mistaken deportation of a man to El Salvador, with one text suggesting Bove's instruction was to communicate a profane dismissal of the court's order to return him. These allegations, which Bove denies, have been shared with the Senate Judiciary Committee ahead of a vote on his nomination.

A 20-year-old woman and three teenage males were apprehended on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, and organized crime offenses. The hacks, which involved data theft and ransomware, caused significant operational chaos, leaving some Co-op shelves empty and costing M&S an estimated £300 million in lost profits.

          <p>Vietnam's government has approved a plan to significantly increase taxes on alcohol, with the rate rising from 65% to 90% by 2031, as part of a broader effort to curb harmful drinking habits. The move comes amid rising alcohol consumption rates and is intended to improve public health and generate revenue for state programs, including a push for universal healthcare. The alcohol industry has opposed the tax hike, warning it could lead to price increases and hurt sales, which have already been declining.

          <p>Nepal is experiencing a rapid shift to electric vehicles, with the number of EVs growing from just 250 in 2020 to over 13,000 in 2024.

The government has set an ambitious target for 90% of new private vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. By leveraging its abundant hydropower for clean energy, Nepal aims to create a sustainable urban mobility model and reduce its reliance on expensive imported fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Loud and Clear," by Brian Anderson, details the history of the Grateful Dead's legendary "Wall of Sound," a massive, innovative sound system from the early 1970s. Conceived by sound engineer Owsley Stanley, the system aimed to provide perfect, uniform audio for the entire audience by placing a behemoth stack of speakers and amps directly behind the band. While utopian in its goal, the wall was a logistical nightmare, weighing as much as a dozen elephants and proving costly and difficult to maintain. The book argues this ambitious but flawed endeavor contributed to the band's eventual burnout and hiatus.</p>
