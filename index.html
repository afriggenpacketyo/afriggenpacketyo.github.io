          <p>Spanish police are now investigating Jonathan Andic for potential homicide in the death of his father, Mango clothing chain founder Isak Andic. The 71-year-old billionaire died in December after a 300-foot fall while hiking with his son, a death initially ruled accidental. Authorities have reportedly changed Jonathan's status from witness to suspect due to inconsistent testimony and are examining his cell phone records. The family has maintained Jonathan's innocence and continues to cooperate with the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, following what he described as a productive phone call. The announcement precedes a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is seeking long-range Tomahawk missiles to strike targets deep within Russia. While Zelenskyy believes the missile request prompted Putin's willingness to talk, Trump has expressed reluctance to deplete U.S. stockpiles, creating a complex diplomatic dynamic.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Urges 'No Kings' Protesters to Maintain Nonviolence to Counter Right-Wing Narratives</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 06:00:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that participants in the upcoming "No Kings" protests must remain strictly nonviolent to disprove the administration's narrative that the demonstrations are a "Hate America" rally. The author suggests that right-wing rhetoric, which labels protesters as "antifa" and treasonous, is a deliberate strategy to provoke a violent response and justify a broader crackdown on dissent. By maintaining disciplined and peaceful resistance, the movement can expose the administration's disinformation campaign and show who the true aggressors are.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following several instances of violence, arrests, and one death at nationwide 'No Kings' demonstrations in June, an organizer from the group Public Citizen is reaffirming the movement's commitment to peaceful protest. Lisa Gilbert, the group's co-president, stated that the demonstrations are intended to defend democracy against executive overreach, not to incite confrontation. Despite incidents in cities like Salt Lake City and Austin, organizers maintain that the violence stems from "militarized crackdowns" and external agitators, not from the protesters themselves.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant increase in vehicle repossessions, reaching the highest level since 2009, as more Americans default on their auto loans. This trend, highlighted by the recent collapse of sub-prime lender Tricolor, is raising concerns about broader economic stress, particularly among lower-income households. High car prices, inflation, and interest rate hikes have pushed average monthly payments over $750, leading to a delinquency rate not seen in over 30 years and signaling that household finances are becoming increasingly strained.

          <p>According to a Chinese state media report, a People's Liberation Army (PLA) J-16 fighter jet successfully tracked and expelled two foreign stealth aircraft last year, with military analysts suggesting they were likely U.S. F-22s. The analysts assert that this was possible not due to the jet's capabilities alone, but because of the PLA's integrated combat system, which combines data from satellites, early warning planes, and anti-stealth radars. This is being presented as a demonstration of China's advanced, networked defense capabilities against sophisticated fifth-generation fighters.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Tim Kaine, is forcing a vote on a resolution to prevent President Trump from taking military action against Venezuela without congressional approval. The move comes in response to recent U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean and the authorization of covert CIA operations in the South American nation. The senators argue that Congress must reassert its constitutional power to declare war and that the American people should have a debate before being drawn into another conflict.</p>

          <h2>Classified SpaceX Starshield Satellites Detected Emitting Unusual Signal That May Violate International Standards</h2>

          <p>A network of classified U.S. government satellites, built by SpaceX under the "Starshield" program, has been found to be transmitting a mysterious signal on radio frequencies typically reserved for commands sent from Earth. An amateur satellite tracker discovered the "downlink" transmissions in a band that, according to International Telecommunication Union standards, should be quiet from space-based signals. Experts warn this could potentially interfere with the operations of other scientific and commercial satellites, which might not properly receive commands from their ground stations.</p>

          <p>Many Gen Z and millennial voters in small towns and rural communities across the U.S. feel that their financial struggles are being ignored by political leaders. Confronted with inflated prices and stagnant wages, they express a growing disillusionment with both major parties, feeling that the American dream is increasingly unattainable. This sentiment of being "left out in the cold" is causing dissatisfaction with the political system, as many young rural Americans struggle to afford basics like healthcare and housing while feeling their unique challenges are not being addressed.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, who served as President Trump's national security adviser, has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Maryland. The charges follow an FBI investigation into the handling of classified information, with the indictment alleging he shared over a thousand pages from his personal diaries containing top-secret information with family members. Bolton has maintained his innocence, claiming the charges are a form of political retribution from the Trump administration and that he is the latest target in the weaponization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted another airstrike in the Caribbean targeting a vessel the administration alleges was involved in drug smuggling. For the first time in this series of at least six such strikes, a U.S. official has confirmed that there were survivors. The Trump administration maintains these actions are a legitimate part of its anti-cartel strategy, while Venezuela's U.N. ambassador has condemned them as extrajudicial killings of civilians and called for an investigation.

          <p>Goaltender Carter Hart, one of five players acquitted of sexual assault charges from a 2018 incident involving Canada's World Junior team, is returning to the NHL on a tryout contract with the Vegas Golden Knights. His return, following the lifting of his league suspension, has reignited discussions about hockey's "code of silence" and its pattern of quickly reintegrating players involved in major scandals. This article argues that while Hart was legally cleared, his swift return highlights a culture that often prioritizes on-ice talent over addressing systemic issues of misconduct.</p>

          <p>South Korea's benchmark stock index, the Kospi, achieved a new record high for the third day in a row, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. The index's positive performance stood in contrast to broader downturns across other major Asian markets, which were impacted by renewed fears in the U.S. banking sector. While the Kospi reached an intraday high of 3,794.87, it closed with a marginal gain, demonstrating resilience amid regional market weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

The injection, administered every other month, offers an alternative to daily PrEP pills and is intended for individuals at high risk of contracting HIV for whom daily oral medication is not practical. Health experts hope this new option will help achieve the UK's goal of eliminating new HIV cases by 2030 by increasing access and adherence to preventative therapy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the political climate under President Trump is fostering an "anti-fact ideology," which is being amplified by major tech companies like Google and Meta abandoning professional fact-checking in favor of "community notes." The author argues that this shift, exemplified by Google pulling funding from the UK's Full Fact charity, represents a dangerous move away from objective, verifiable truth toward a consensus-based reality. This trend is described as a fundamental attack on Enlightenment principles, threatening the very foundation of informed public debate.</p>
