            <h2>Diabetes Can Alter Brain Function Similar to Alzheimer's, Study Suggests</h2>

            <p>A recent study from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas indicates that type 2 diabetes can 'rewire' the brain in ways akin to early-onset Alzheimer's disease, impacting memory and cognitive functions. Researchers observed that high blood sugar levels may affect the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a brain region crucial for motivation, decision-making, and emotional regulation. This alteration could explain why individuals with diabetes find it challenging to adhere to diets and exercise, as their brains may not respond to rewarding events effectively. The study, while conducted on rodents, suggests potential avenues for improved diagnostic and treatment strategies for both diabetes and Alzheimer's. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>A federal judge ruled in favor of the Associated Press in its dispute with the White House, ordering the restoration of the news outlet's access to the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other spaces open to the press.

Judge McFadden emphasized that the government cannot selectively exclude journalists based on their viewpoints when granting access to government spaces, upholding the First Amendment.</p>

While Cambodian factories face an existential crisis, companies are hesitant to make long-term supply chain investments amid the uncertainty.

            <p>Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, issued a statement denying that the investor endorsed President Trump's tariff policies, clarifying that reports circulating on social media were false. Buffett has previously stated that tariffs tend to contribute to rising prices and could lead to a trade war. He has also noted that tariffs have driven up costs at some of his constituent businesses and could hurt consumer budgets. Buffett considers tariffs 'an act of war, to some degree.'

            <p>The Trump administration is instructing some migrants who entered the U.S. using the CBP One mobile app to depart immediately. The move is part of a broader effort to revoke temporary legal status for migrants who entered during the Biden administration under humanitarian parole. DHS is now encouraging migrants to report their departure via the CBP Home app, a rebrand of CBP One. Migrants whose parole has been terminated will lose work authorization and could face criminal prosecution and removal, though exceptions exist for those with a lawful basis to remain.</p>

            <p>President Trump's escalating trade tensions could jeopardize Hollywood's ambitions in China. The prospect of losing access to China's film market comes as U.S. studios struggle to recover from financial challenges. China's film industry has become adept at producing high-quality local movies, leaving less room for English-language features. Film executives are no longer factoring in possible Chinese revenue when drawing up production budgets. Economists warn that the tariffs could produce lasting disruptive consequences, including prolonged inflation and a possible recession.</p>

The debt is growing at a rate of over $114,000 per day. The appeals court has yet to rule on the case, and the debt continues to increase.</p>

Maria Cantwell and Chuck Grassley, aimed at reasserting Congress' role over trade policy. The Trade Review Act of 2025 would require the president to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The president would have to include an explanation and analysis of the potential impact, while lawmakers would have the ability to cancel the tariff with a joint resolution.</p>

However, conflicting messages from federal officials and proposed funding cuts are hindering efforts to control the outbreak. The CDC has maintained that the vaccine is safe and effective, and local officials are doing their best to get the word out.</p>
