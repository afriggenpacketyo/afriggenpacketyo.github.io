          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts released a statement criticizing President Trump's calls for the impeachment of federal judges who ruled against the administration.  Roberts asserted that impeachment is not an appropriate response to judicial decisions; the established appellate review process is the proper mechanism for addressing disagreements.  This statement follows Trump's attacks on Judge James Boasberg, who temporarily blocked the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

          <p>President Trump pledged to significantly increase the production of coal in the United States, citing economic competition with China.  This announcement comes amid the administration's efforts to roll back environmental regulations and reduce the influence of environmental agencies.
