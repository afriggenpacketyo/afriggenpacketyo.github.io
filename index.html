          <p>Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano located on the Italian island of Sicily, erupted, releasing hot ash and lava. The nation's volcano monitoring body reported increasing intensity of explosions from the Southeast Crater, leading to a lava fountain and pyroclastic flow. While the local population is accustomed to Etna's frequent eruptions, there were no immediate reports of risks to residents or air travel. This eruption follows a significant event just over a year ago, continuing Etna's pattern of at least one eruption per year, sometimes dusting nearby towns without major disruption.</p>

          <p>An attack on a peaceful rally in Boulder, Colorado, organized by Run for Their Lives to raise awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza, injured eight people. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted act of terrorism after a suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly threw an incendiary device and used a makeshift flamethrower, yelling "Free Palestine" during the attack. The victims, aged between 52 and 88, sustained burns and other injuries, with one being a Holocaust survivor. Soliman, an Egyptian national who was in the U.S. illegally, faces multiple charges including attempted murder and use of an explosive device.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway surged by 213% in May compared to the previous year, contrasting with a decline in sales across Europe. This increase is primarily attributed to the popularity of the revamped Model Y compact SUV, which meets Norwegian preferences for large luggage space, high ground clearance, all-wheel drive, and a tow hitch. Despite this success, a recent survey indicates that political reasons, particularly CEO Elon Musk's activities and rhetoric, may deter some consumers from purchasing Teslas. Norway's robust EV incentives and well-developed charging infrastructure contribute to its leading position in electric vehicle adoption.</p>

          <p>Aviation safety writer Darryl Campbell discusses systemic issues in American air travel, using Newark Liberty International Airport as a prime example. Newark is experiencing radar and radio communication failures, coupled with understaffing and mandatory overtime for air traffic controllers, leading to burnout and safety concerns. Campbell argues that these problems, exacerbated by insufficient cost-of-living increases for government employees and a significant maintenance backlog, are not unique to Newark and will likely affect other airports in the next decade. Proposed solutions include increased government funding, fees for fliers, and reducing the number of flights, but these face political and economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Representative Maxine Waters' 2020 campaign committee, Citizens for Waters, has agreed to pay a $68,000 fine for violating multiple campaign finance laws. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) found the committee failed to accurately report receipts and disbursements, knowingly accepted excessive contributions, and made prohibited cash disbursements. As part of the agreement, the committee will also send its treasurer to a Commission-sponsored training program for political committees.

His trial has brought back difficult memories for his RFE/RL colleague, Alsu Kurmasheva, who spent nine months in a Russian prison on similar charges. The charges against Mehralizada are typical of those leveled against journalists, NGO workers, and other civil society actors in Azerbaijan's ongoing government crackdown against dissenting voices.</p>

The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes, many of which were established around 70 years ago, with an initial focus on the airspace around London. While changes are not expected for several years, ministers say the plans could enable quicker takeoffs and smoother descents.

          <p>A first-of-its-kind international study has found that colon cancer patients experienced improved survival rates after participating in a three-year exercise program. The research, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting, demonstrated that the benefits of exercise rivaled those of some drugs in keeping the disease at bay. Patients in the structured exercise program had 28% fewer cancers and 37% fewer deaths from any cause after eight years. Experts suggest that cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a new standard of care for colon cancer survivors.</p>
