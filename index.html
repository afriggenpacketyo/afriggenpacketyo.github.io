        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration will impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports starting August 1, a substantial increase from the previous rate. The stated reasons for this action include retaliation for the ongoing prosecution of Brazil's former president, Jair Bolsonaro, and what President Trump has termed an "unfair trade relationship." This move, which caused Brazil's currency to fall against the dollar, marks a significant use of economic policy to influence the internal political affairs of another sovereign nation. The U.S. is also launching an investigation into Brazil's alleged unfair digital trade practices.</p>

          <p>China's portable power bank industry is facing a severe crisis following multiple incidents of devices catching fire, leading to an emergency ban by the country's aviation regulator. Several manufacturers have recalled over a million units after discovering they were prone to overheating. The issue has been traced to a supplier that illegally substituted materials to reduce expenses amid fierce market competition. This race to the bottom has dangerously compromised product quality and consumer safety, highlighting systemic problems within the rapidly growing industry.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service has suspended six of its personnel without pay following the assassination attempt on former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. The disciplinary actions, ranging from 10 to 42 days, come after a bipartisan House report identified the security lapses as "tragic and preventable," citing issues in leadership and training. A Secret Service deputy director stated the agency is focused on fixing the root causes of the operational failure rather than firing staff. New measures, including military-grade drones and improved communication systems, are being implemented to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who served as former President Joe Biden's physician, has refused to testify before a Republican-led House committee investigating Biden's cognitive health. Citing physician-patient privilege and his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, O'Connor declined to answer questions during a scheduled deposition. The House Oversight Committee chairman criticized the decision, vowing to continue the investigation by interviewing other former White House aides. O'Connor's attorneys argued that cooperating would violate his professional oath and risk his medical license.</p>

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative MP and party chairman, has announced his defection to the Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage. He is the fourth former Tory MP to switch to Reform in the past two weeks, signaling growing momentum for the party. In his announcement, Sir Jake criticized both the Conservative and Labour parties, stating that "Britain is broken" due to a system that punishes hard work and lacks control over immigration. This move underscores a significant political realignment in the UK, as Labour increasingly focuses its attention on Reform as a key challenger.</p>

This uncertainty is seen as more damaging than the temporary lack of any single shipment, as it hampers Ukraine's ability to defend its territory and respond to escalating Russian attacks.

The author suggests that, like Perot's Reform Party, Musk's effort appears driven by personal grudges against the incumbent Republican president and focuses on issues like wasteful government spending. While the chances of such a party gaining significant traction are low, the analysis posits that it could disrupt the Republican coalition by appealing to swing voters and the "crackpot vote."

          <p>World number one Jannik Sinner has declared he will be "100%" fit for his Wimbledon semi-final showdown against Novak Djokovic, despite an elbow injury sustained earlier in the tournament. The Italian player received treatment during his fourth-round match and played his quarter-final with strapping and painkillers. Sinner expressed confidence that a day of rest would be sufficient for his recovery. The upcoming match is highly anticipated, as Sinner has won his last four meetings against Djokovic, though he has never defeated the seven-time champion at Wimbledon.</p>

          <p>England manager Sarina Wiegman has been praised for her tactical adjustments that led the Lionesses to a commanding 4-0 victory over the Netherlands, reviving their Euro 2025 campaign. After a disappointing opening loss to France, Wiegman made key positional switches, moving Lauren James to the wing and Jess Carter to central defense, which proved highly effective. The win keeps the defending champions' hopes of reaching the quarter-finals alive and demonstrated the team's ability to perform under pressure.

The price has fallen about 4% from its recent high, but the article suggests this decline is likely to be short-lived, with many analysts predicting a future rise toward the $4,000 per ounce mark. It argues that now could be a smart time to buy, as the next price surge could make entry into the market prohibitive for some investors.

The final bill implements cuts to the health-related element of universal credit for some while increasing the standard allowance for others.

He was first arrested in January but released two months later on technical grounds.

To qualify for the full credit, parents must meet income thresholds of $200,000 or less for single filers and $400,000 for joint filers. While the credit amount is higher, eligibility rules are not expanded, meaning the benefit will primarily go to middle- and high-income families. (not investment advice)</p>
