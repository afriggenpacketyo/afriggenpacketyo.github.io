          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding forecasts and keeping it on track for its annual 5% target. However, this growth has slowed from the previous quarter, and concerning indicators like sluggish retail sales and a deepening real estate slump are fueling calls for more government stimulus. While industrial output and exports show resilience, economists warn of underlying fragility, citing disinflationary pressures and the need for deeper structural reforms to sustain long-term growth.

          <p>Satellite radio company SiriusXM is shifting its strategy by launching its first ad-supported subscription plan for in-car listening, named SiriusXM Play. This cheaper option aims to convert more free-trial users into long-term customers, mirroring a trend seen with streaming services like Netflix. While core content like Howard Stern and live sports will remain ad-free, the new tier is a significant move for a brand long known for its commercial-free experience, as it seeks to boost revenue amid a competitive audio market.</p>

          <p>A recent Congressional Budget Office forecast indicates that President Trump's major tax-and-spending legislation could add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. This contributes to a national debt that has already surpassed $36 trillion, raising concerns about long-term economic stability and increased interest costs. Economists warn that such persistent deficits could lead to higher inflation and increased interest rates for consumers on mortgages and credit cards, though markets have remained relatively calm for now.

          <h2>Beijing Signals Major Shift in Urban Development Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 08:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At a high-level meeting, China's leadership has declared a fundamental shift in its urban development model, moving away from large-scale expansion towards optimizing existing city resources. With 67% of its population now in urban areas, the focus will turn to improving human well-being, enhancing governance, and creating a new development model for the property sector. Key priorities will include renovating urban villages and upgrading dilapidated housing, reflecting a new phase of "stable development" for China's cities after decades of rapid growth.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists successfully identified promising locations for deep-sea mineral deposits in the Indian Ocean by utilizing publicly available satellite data from NASA. The U.S. space agency's GRACE satellites detected gravity anomalies over the Ninety East Ridge, which indicated areas of thickened oceanic crust. Chinese researchers confirmed these findings with their own equipment, noting that such areas are often rich in valuable minerals like copper, cobalt, and rare earths, potentially saving years of exploratory work.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to reduce the cost of new electric cars by up to £3,750, in an effort to encourage drivers to switch from petrol and diesel vehicles. The discounts will apply to eligible zero-emission models costing up to £37,000 and are part of a broader strategy to meet the 2030 ban on new fossil-fuel car sales. While the move is welcomed by manufacturers, critics and consumers highlight that the high upfront cost of EVs and the insufficient number of public charging points remain significant barriers to widespread adoption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Norwegian author Linn Ullmann's latest book, "Girl, 1983," examines its unique approach to autobiographical fiction. The novel centers on a writer trying to reconstruct a painful memory from her teenage years involving a relationship with an older photographer, grappling with gaps in her recollection. By labeling the deeply personal work a novel, Ullmann challenges the conventions of memoir, using the format to explore how forgotten experiences and absences shape personal history just as much as vivid memories do.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent wave of tariff threats against dozens of countries, including major trading partners like Mexico, Canada, and the European Union, has created significant uncertainty for U.S. businesses. Economists note that companies are operating in a "dense fog," unable to plan effectively as they await an August 1 deadline for many of the new import duties to take effect. While the White House defends the tariffs as a tool for fair trade, experts argue the unpredictable approach has yielded few comprehensive deals and leaves consumers and companies in limbo.
