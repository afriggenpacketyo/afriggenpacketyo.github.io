          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has formed a coalition with over 40 conservative organizations, including the America First Policy Institute and The Heritage Foundation, to develop 'patriotic' civics content. This initiative, named the America 250 Civics Education Coalition, aims to renew patriotism and strengthen civic knowledge ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary. The planned programming includes a 50-state college campus speaking tour, though specific details about the educational materials remain unannounced. The move comes as the administration seeks to reduce federal control over school curricula, a domain legally reserved for states.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record high, driven by gains in technology and real estate sectors, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. The Fed's move, described as a 'risk management cut,' was widely expected and came with indications of further cuts through 2027. While Japanese markets rallied, other Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed results, with Hong Kong and mainland China experiencing slight losses. The Bank of Japan is currently holding its own policy meeting, where it is largely expected to maintain its current interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A state banquet held at Windsor Castle for President Trump featured a guest list heavy on political figures and technology executives, with a notable absence of Hollywood celebrities. Attendees included Apple CEO Tim Cook, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, alongside prominent UK and US politicians. The elaborate event, designed as a display of diplomatic hospitality, saw the President seated between King Charles and the Princess of Wales. The menu and musical selections, including some of President Trump's favorites, were part of the meticulously planned affair in the historic St George's Hall.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to formally designate the loose affiliation of anti-fascist activists known as antifa as a 'major terrorist organization.' In a social media post, he also recommended that individuals and organizations funding antifa be thoroughly investigated. This declaration follows a similar threat made during his first term in 2020 that was never officially enacted. The move comes amid heightened rhetoric from the president and his allies against 'radical left political violence' following the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, though it is unclear what legal mechanisms will be used for the designation.</p>

          <p>Country music star Lee Brice honored the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a recent performance in Florida, dedicating a faith-based song to him. Brice explained that he felt Kirk, who was recently assassinated, conducted himself with respect and a 'Jesus like manner' even during contentious debates. The singer acknowledged the potential for backlash for his tribute but stated he was not concerned about alienating fans, as he wanted to recognize someone he believed 'had a heart of God.'

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock fell approximately 10% in after-hours trading after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and a weaker-than-expected forecast for the upcoming fiscal year. The report follows a tumultuous period where the company faced intense customer backlash for an attempted rebrand that modernized its logo and store design. After criticism from customers and even President Trump, the company reversed the changes, reverting to its classic 'Old Timer' branding. CEO Julie Masino stated the company is now focused on enhancing the guest experience and has suspended all restaurant remodels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ABC has taken 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' off the air indefinitely following controversial comments the host made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. During his monologue, Kimmel criticized what he called the 'MAGA gang' for attempting to score political points from the tragedy. The decision came after major station owner Nexstar Media announced it would no longer air the program, calling Kimmel's remarks 'offensive and insensitive.' The move has drawn praise from President Trump and criticism from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who suggested the network had an obligation to act.</p>

The report directly counters the EPA's move to revoke its 2009 'endangerment finding,' which classifies greenhouse gases as a public health threat and forms the legal basis for their regulation. The National Academies' analysis concludes that the scientific understanding of climate threats has only strengthened since 2009, with new risks identified.

          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume fruit with a low alcohol content from natural fermentation. Scientists measured the alcohol in fruits favored by the primates, such as figs and plums, and calculated that the average chimpanzee consumes the equivalent of nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day. This steady, low-dose exposure does not appear to intoxicate the animals. The findings lend support to the 'drunken monkey' hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the diets of our fruit-eating primate ancestors.</p>

The recommendations come as the government prepares to announce its own reforms to a system that has been criticized as financially unsustainable.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Board of Education has unanimously voted to retain Superintendent Alberto Carvalho for another four years, with contract details still under negotiation. Carvalho, who leads the second-largest school district in the nation, announced he would not seek a salary increase from his current $440,000 per year. Since taking the role in 2022, he has overseen progress in academic achievement and has been a vocal advocate for the district's large population of immigrant families. While praised by many civic groups for providing stability, he faces ongoing challenges, including contentious contract negotiations with employee unions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new report from the California Budget and Policy Center, California, alongside Louisiana, continues to have the highest poverty rate in the United States. In 2024, approximately 17.7% of residents, or 7 million people, were unable to afford basic needs. This rate is a significant increase from a historic low of 11% in 2021, with the surge attributed to the expiration of pandemic-era aid programs like the federal child tax credit. The report notes that child poverty has more than doubled since 2021 and warns that recent federal and state budget cuts could exacerbate the problem.</p>

          <p>Liverpool secured a dramatic 3-2 victory over Atletico Madrid in their Champions League opener, thanks to a 93rd-minute header from Virgil van Dijk. The win continued Liverpool's trend this season of securing victories with late goals, having previously surrendered a 2-0 lead in the match. The game also marked the debut of Liverpool's £125m record signing, Alexander Isak, who showed promising signs before being substituted after 58 minutes. While the result was a celebration for manager Arne Slot on his birthday, the team's pattern of conceding leads remains a point of concern.</p>

This effort is part of a broader right-wing movement to punish Kirk's critics, which has reportedly led to dozens of people losing their jobs in recent days.</p>

The case has evoked painful memories of Mississippi's history of racial violence, prompting calls from Congressman Bennie Thompson for an FBI investigation.

The visit featured extensive British pageantry, which the president appeared to delight in. The trip is seen as an opportunity for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government to secure economic benefits, including billions in tech investments that have already been pledged.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom's office has labeled President Trump's social media claim about new low-income housing in Pacific Palisades as a 'straight up lie.' Trump had posted that the state was in the final stages of approving such projects in the affluent, fire-scarred neighborhood. However, Newsom's office and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass had previously issued orders banning or limiting new duplexes and lot splits in the area following the January firestorm. The state does not issue local housing permits, and the dispute highlights the political tensions surrounding California's housing policies and post-disaster rebuilding efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a 0.25% interest rate cut, a moderate step taken in response to weak jobs reports while still being mindful of inflation. This decision comes amid an unprecedented pressure campaign from President Trump, who has publicly demanded more significant cuts and is attempting to oust a Biden-appointed governor from the Fed board. The administration also recently installed a new governor, Stephen Miran, who remains a White House economic adviser and was the sole dissenting vote, pushing for a larger cut. This article suggests the Fed is currently maintaining its independence, but the president's actions continue to test the institution's long-standing political autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to hold its key interest rate at 4% when it meets on Thursday. This follows a cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to a two-year low. Analysts believe that with UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut at this time. The decision contrasts with the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent choice to lower its rates, highlighting the different economic pressures faced by the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>
