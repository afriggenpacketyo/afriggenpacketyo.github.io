          <p>Washington Commanders' star quarterback Jayden Daniels sustained a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys, forcing his exit in the third quarter. The reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year's right leg appeared twisted during a play, causing him significant pain and leading to Marcus Mariota taking over. Daniels, who had already missed time this season, had accumulated 156 passing yards, a touchdown pass, and a rushing touchdown, underscoring his dual-threat importance to the team. This setback for one of the NFL's most dynamic young talents raises concerns about the Commanders' offensive capabilities, especially given his prior injury history and the impact he has on their game score.</p>

          <p>Erez Reuveni, a former Justice Department lawyer, has become a whistleblower, alleging a systemic disregard for due process and the rule of law within the DOJ. Reuveni claims he was fired after refusing to sign a brief that falsely labeled a deported Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, as a terrorist to prevent his return. The article highlights how senior officials, including the number three at the DOJ, allegedly instructed attorneys to disregard court orders regarding mass deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. This situation, corroborated by a study identifying numerous instances of judges criticizing the Trump administration's Justice Department for false information, raises significant concerns about the integrity of the department and its impact on civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Renowned artist Amy Sherald, known for her portraits of Black Americans, shared insights into her career and her decision to cancel a Smithsonian exhibition. She withdrew her "American Sublime" retrospective due to concerns that museum officials, under pressure from the Trump administration, might censor her painting of a transgender person as the Statue of Liberty. Sherald, whose portrait of Michelle Obama brought her widespread recognition, views her work as patriotic, redefining American identity to include everyone. The article also touches on her personal journey, including a life-saving heart transplant, and her distinctive grayscale technique for skin tones, which aims to encourage viewers to see the humanity in her subjects.</p>

          <p>Florida City Council member Chandler Langevin is facing severe backlash for a series of social media posts insulting Indian people and advocating for their mass deportation. Langevin's derogatory remarks, claiming Indians come to America to "drain our pockets" before returning or staying, have drawn widespread condemnation from national Indian American organizations, members of Congress, and local residents. The Palm Bay council formally censured Langevin, with the mayor highlighting the nation's foundation on immigrants and diverse fabric. Advocacy groups are urging Governor Ron DeSantis to suspend Langevin, warning that a failure to act decisively would legitimize hate speech and normalize hostility towards minority communities, undermining democratic values.</p>

          <p>The Israeli Premier League derby between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Tel Aviv was abruptly canceled by police due to "public disorder and violent riots" before kick-off. Dozens of smoke grenades and pyrotechnic devices were deployed, leading to injuries for twelve civilians and three officers, alongside multiple arrests. This unrest occurs just days after officials in the UK banned Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from an upcoming Europa League match, citing safety concerns, a decision that has drawn widespread criticism and prompted government efforts to overturn it. Hapoel Tel Aviv accused police of preparing for "war, not a sporting event," highlighting how the ongoing conflict in Gaza continues to fuel tensions and affect sporting events.</p>

The 2011-15 plan focused on "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, making China a leader in EVs and renewables. More recently, the 2021-2025 plan emphasizes "high quality development" to challenge American tech dominance.

Court documents state he coordinated armed fighters to cross into Israel after the attack began and later entered the U.S. on a fraudulent visa, falsely denying ties to terror groups or firearm training. He was located in Lafayette, Louisiana, working in a restaurant, and his phone activity reportedly placed him near Kibbutz Kfar Aza during the attack.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new vocational "V-levels" for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify England's "confusing landscape" of post-16 qualifications. These V-levels are set to replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, with ministers also proposing an alternative qualification to reduce GCSE maths and English resits. The initiative aligns with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's focus on vocational training and a target for two-thirds of young people to pursue university or technical qualifications. While the Sixth Form Colleges Association warns of potential gaps, the government expects V-levels to build on practical skills and lead to employment, allowing students to mix and match with A-levels or pursue apprenticeships.</p>

The lawsuit alleges an "anticompetitive scheme" by Apple and OpenAI to maintain monopolies in AI markets, with X accusing Apple of favoring ChatGPT over competitors like xAI's Grok.

          <p>Disgraced former US congressman George Santos described his prison sentence as "disproportionate" but a "large slice of humble pie" in his first interview since President Trump commuted his sentence. Trump's unexpected commutation released Santos less than three months into his seven-year term for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Santos, who pleaded guilty and agreed to pay significant restitution, dismissed criticism of favorable treatment, drawing parallels to President Biden's family pardons. He thanked Trump for believing in "second chances," while his legal obligations regarding restitution remain ambiguous, indicating a continued complex legal and public image.</p>

          <p>A five-day strike impacting hundreds of Kaiser Permanente clinics and hospitals in California and Hawaii has ended, with the union expressing "new momentum" for renewed bargaining this week. The United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Healthcare Professionals (UNAC/UHCP) declared the strike sent a "resounding message that patient care and safe staffing must come first." While Kaiser welcomed back 30,000 employees, stating wages were the primary dispute, the union cited new Joint Commission standards recognizing adequate staffing as a patient safety mandate. Negotiations will now focus on economic issues, as the union seeks competitive wages to address staffing and access challenges.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot faces mounting problems as the team suffered its fourth consecutive loss, a 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at Anfield, marking their worst run since 2014. Mohamed Salah's visible dejection and substitution underscored the team's current struggles with form and confidence. Despite significant investment in new players like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, their contributions have been minimal, and the team exhibits a lack of organization and defensive flaws. The article highlights the pressure on Slot to address these issues and reverse the team's decline, as they now sit fourth in the table, four points behind leaders Arsenal.</p>

          <p>A US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appears to have withstood its initial major test, despite renewed violence that killed two Israeli soldiers and prompted Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Both sides affirmed their commitment to the deal, with the IDF announcing "renewed enforcement" and Hamas denying involvement in the attack. Key architects Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are returning to the region, and Vice President JD Vance is also expected, signaling ongoing US diplomatic engagement to implement the next phase of the agreement. While aid deliveries are set to continue, internal clashes in Gaza and disputes over hostage remains continue to strain the fragile truce.</p>

          <p>Atlanta United has fired coach Ronny Deila after a single disappointing season where the team finished 14th in the Eastern Conference with only one win in its last 18 matches. Despite high expectations, significant transfer fees, and key player re-signings, the team's performance did not meet standards. CEO Garth Lagerwey announced a global search for a replacement, acknowledging the need to provide fans with a better on-field product. Deila's tenure, which brought him back to MLS after winning an MLS Cup with New York City FC, ended following the team's 1-1 draw with DC United, marking a period of underperformance since their 2019 trophy wins.</p>
