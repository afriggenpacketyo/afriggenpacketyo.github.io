          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates to escape from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, was captured in Atlanta following a brief standoff, culminating a multi-agency manhunt involving federal and local authorities. His apprehension brings a significant sense of relief to victims, their families, and the New Orleans community, who had expressed considerable concern over a convicted violent offender evading justice for months. Groves, who was awaiting a life sentence for second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in four killings, now faces additional charges for the jailbreak and is expected to be extradited to Louisiana. This incident critically highlighted severe design flaws and staffing deficiencies at the 2015-built facility, prompting officials to pursue every legal avenue against Groves and anyone who aided his escape.</p>

          <p>SoftBank's shares jumped 13% after the Japanese conglomerate announced a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB, further expanding its footprint in artificial intelligence. This strategic move aligns with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's vision of "Physical AI," aiming to merge Artificial Super Intelligence with robotics to drive groundbreaking evolution. The acquisition means ABB will no longer pursue a spin-off of its robotics business. SoftBank, which already owns chip designer Arm and holds a significant stake in OpenAI, continues to position itself at the forefront of the burgeoning AI industry through key investments and acquisitions.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has announced new export controls on rare earth production technology, effective immediately, aiming to solidify its dominant position in the critical sector amidst escalating trade tensions with the United States. Exporters are now required to strengthen compliance awareness and verify the primary uses of their exports, especially for dual-use items. As the world's leading producer, accounting for about 70% of global rare earth mining and over 90% of processing capacity for heavy rare earth elements, Beijing is leveraging its influence over these essential materials. Rare earths are vital for products ranging from electric vehicles and smartphones to spacecraft, making these controls a significant geopolitical move.</p>

While some Republicans expressed unease and sought clarification on the legal justification, party leaders argued against the resolution, viewing it as a political ploy and thanking Trump for his actions. The debate underscores a significant clash over executive authority and congressional oversight in military engagements.</p>

          <p>An illegal immigrant from El Salvador, Ricardo Leonel Mejia, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for repeatedly sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl in Virginia Beach. Mejia, who pleaded guilty to multiple charges including sexual assault of a child under 13, will serve his sentence in the Virginia Department of Corrections before being transferred to ICE custody for further proceedings. This case has ignited a debate among Virginia's leaders regarding state cooperation with federal immigration authorities, with some advocating for policies that would limit such assistance.

          <p>The Liberal Democrat party in the UK has seen its membership almost halve over the past five years, dropping from nearly 118,000 in 2020 to 60,000, according to BBC analysis. This decline occurred despite the party's most successful general election in terms of seats won last year. A party spokesperson highlighted their electoral gains, including a record number of MPs and more councillors than Labour or Conservatives in recent local elections. The Green Party, in contrast, has seen a significant surge in its membership during the same period, reaching 90,000 members. This trend prompts questions about the dynamics of political party engagement in the UK.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "revenge crusade" is dramatically escalating, with the federal government now taking legal action against his political adversaries, as detailed in this article. Trump recently called for the jailing of the Illinois governor and Chicago mayor, and former FBI Director James Comey was arraigned on charges of making false statements to Congress, days after Trump publicly urged his prosecution. This pattern, following Trump's past calls to incarcerate political opponents, suggests the guardrails of his first term are gone, replaced by a pliant attorney general and a focus on retribution. Critics express alarm over the erosion of barriers between the White House and the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon Press Association reports an impasse in negotiations with the Defense Department over new credential restrictions, which reporters argue convey a "message of intimidation" and threaten press freedom. The proposed rules require journalists to acknowledge they will not disclose classified or "controlled unclassified information" without formal authorization, risking loss of credentials. While the Pentagon dropped a requirement for reporters to agree with the policy, the Association states it still threatens First Amendment rights by discouraging interactions with unapproved sources. Additionally, plans to relocate news organizations' workspaces are feared to further isolate reporters and impede communication with military officials, raising concerns about transparency.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court justices, both conservative and liberal, expressed skepticism during arguments in a case challenging Illinois voting regulations, particularly the rule allowing mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days after Election Day. Republican Rep. Michael Bost, who won his election, claimed harm due to a lowered margin of victory and extended staffing costs. However, justices questioned the basis of his standing, suggesting his arguments amounted to a policy disagreement rather than individual injury. The lively exchange highlighted concerns about opening federal courts to candidates with no real chance of winning, and the potential for federal courts to make prognostications about election outcomes.</p>

          <p>Terri Lesley, a former library director in Campbell County, Wyoming, has won a $700,000 settlement after being fired amidst an uproar over books with sexual content and LGBTQ+ themes. Lesley, who sued the county and its officials, claimed her First Amendment rights were violated, a claim the county denied, asserting her dismissal was performance-related. The settlement concludes her lawsuit against the county, though a separate case against three individuals who contested the books will proceed. Lesley expressed vindication, hoping the outcome sends a message to other library districts about upholding the First Amendment and combating discrimination in public entities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed national military medical center, his second since returning to the White House in January. The White House press secretary stated that Trump would also have a planned meeting and remarks with troops during his visit. This checkup follows an April examination that included cognitive and cardiology tests, with a health report declaring him "fully fit." Recent public appearances have fueled speculation about the president's health, though Trump has dismissed rumors. The president is also reportedly considering a trip to the Middle East after his consultation.</p>

          <p>The war in Gaza has claimed an estimated 20,000 children's lives, nearly a third of all Palestinian casualties, with thousands more maimed, injured, or orphaned, according to UNICEF and Save the Children. This devastating humanitarian crisis unfolds as indirect peace talks between Israel and Hamas resume in Egypt. A CBS News team in Gaza witnessed the profound trauma among children at a makeshift orphan camp, where young survivors grapple with immense loss and the work of adults. UNICEF reports that one in five children in Gaza is acutely malnourished, highlighting the severe physical and psychological toll of the conflict on the youngest population.</p>

          <p>Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," has been officially added to California's list of statewide holidays, effective January 1, 2026, following Governor Gavin Newsom's signing of Assembly Bill 268. This recognition makes California the third state to observe Diwali, which marks the beginning of the new year in the Hindu lunar calendar and is celebrated by Hindu, Sikh, and Jain faiths. The new law allows community colleges and public schools to close, and state employees to take the day off. The move signifies growing cultural acknowledgment and provides an opportunity for broader celebrations across the state, including various festivals in Southern California.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is beginning to inflict tangible pain across the United States, moving beyond political rhetoric to affect critical services and individuals. Air-traffic control systems are buckling, leading to delays and closures, with controllers and military personnel facing missed paychecks next week. The IRS has furloughed thousands, and vital programs like WIC, which supports low-income mothers and babies, are rapidly running out of funds, potentially impacting millions. Despite the White House's attempts to blame Democrats, the economic fallout, including billions in GDP decline, is becoming undeniable, forcing a potential shift in the political stalemate.</p>

          <p>The cause of the devastating Pacific Palisades fire, which destroyed thousands of homes in January, has been determined, but many residents feel it offers little closure. Federal officials charged Uber driver Jonathan Rinderknecht with intentionally setting an earlier fire that later reignited due to winds. This revelation has left some residents seeking answers as to why fire crews initially believed the blaze was extinguished. While the identification of a suspect provides a degree of understanding, the community remains mired in slow recovery and reconstruction efforts, with many expressing that the trauma and logistical challenges of rebuilding overshadow the cause's discovery.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian journalist, Vitaly Shevchenko, discovered satellite images showing a well-used road leading directly to his childhood home in Russian-occupied Verkhnya Krynytsya, suggesting it may now be a Russian military base. The village in Zaporizhzhia, close to the front lines, was occupied early in the 2022 invasion, with Russian soldiers known to move into vacant properties. The satellite evidence, showing periodic use of a path, indicates the property is likely being utilized by military personnel, especially during harsh Ukrainian winters. This personal story highlights the profound and often intimate impact of the war on ordinary lives and private properties in occupied territories.</p>

Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson should be jailed for opposing his efforts to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago. Trump continued to paint a dire picture of Chicago and Portland, where similar deployment attempts have faced legal and political resistance. Both Pritzker and Johnson slammed Trump's remarks as "unhinged" and an authoritarian threat, with Johnson noting this isn't the first time Trump has sought to unjustly arrest a Black man.

Despite being one of the Women's Super League's most consistent defenders, with a record 71 consecutive appearances and leading in clearances and touches this season, Le Tissier has only eight international caps. While England coach Sarina Wiegman prefers her at right-back, injuries to key players like Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze present a strong case for Le Tissier's inclusion in the upcoming squad. Her club coach Marc Skinner praised her as an "incredible footballer" and a "rock" for United.</p>

          <p>Britain's membership in the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) has become a highly contentious political issue, with the Conservative Party pledging to withdraw if they win the next election. This decision, driven by pressure from Reform UK and concerns over immigration, contrasts with Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey's strong opposition and Labour's more nuanced stance on reform. The debate, which gained prominence over a decade ago with cases like the prisoner voting ban, highlights a fundamental clash over national sovereignty versus the expanding reach of the Strasbourg Court. Critics argue ECHR membership compromises UK sovereignty, while proponents warn of potential impacts on human rights safeguards and international agreements like the Belfast Agreement.</p>

While acknowledging AI's long-term potential, he cautioned that much of the current investment in AI could be lost, drawing parallels to the dot-com bust.
