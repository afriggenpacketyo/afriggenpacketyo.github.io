          <p>Comedian and actor Russell Brand appeared in a London court to face multiple charges of sexual assault, including two counts of sexual assault. This was the first step in what are expected to be lengthy criminal proceedings, following charges brought by British prosecutors last month. Brand, wearing an open shirt and sunglasses, was accompanied by bodyguards and did not address reporters. He has denied all charges, stating he has "never engaged in nonconsensual activity" and looks forward to defending himself in court. The hearing was largely administrative, with the case referred to a higher court and Brand asked to confirm his details. The actual trial may not begin for a year due to case backlogs.</p>

          <p>Han Duck-soo, the former prime minister and acting president of South Korea, has announced his candidacy for president in next month's snap election, triggered by Yoon Suk Yeol's ousting. Han, a conservative, resigned as acting president to pursue the position and pledged to do his "utmost" for South Korea. He has previously served as prime minister, trade minister, finance minister, and ambassador to the US. His entry into the race heats up the competition among conservatives as they seek to unite against Democratic Party frontrunner Lee Jae-myung.

          <p>Jonathan Eig, author of "King: A Life," reflects on the enduring relevance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From Birmingham Jail." Eig argues that King's message of love and nonviolent pressure is a guide for those who disapprove of current tactics and prefer mercy for the marginalized. King believed in the power of love to overcome cruelty and reform unjust systems, advocating for peaceful protests and direct action to expose injustice. Eig suggests that King would call on elected leaders to change unjust policies, employ economic boycotts, and lean on clergy to seize the moral high ground, emphasizing that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.</p>

          <p>Community kitchens in Gaza are warning they will run out of food in days due to the ongoing Israeli blockade, which has prevented supplies from entering for two months. Sami Matar, who leads the Anera team, stated that people rely on these meals as they have no other source of income and many foods are unavailable. The blockade, initiated in March, has led to the depletion of food aid stocks, prompting international pressure on Israel to lift it, with warnings of mass starvation and potential war crimes. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians depend on these kitchens for survival, but without a change, they will soon have nothing to distribute.</p>

However, box office sales are falling short of previous years, contrasting with the positive trend in travel demand.

          <p>Roche has entered the competitive obesity drug market by striking a $5.3 billion deal with Zealand Pharma to co-develop petrelintide, a next-generation weight loss candidate. This amylin analog mimics a hormone that increases satiety, differing from current GLP-1 drugs. Early clinical data suggests comparable weight reduction with potentially better tolerability and muscle preservation. The deal involves co-development and co-commercialization of petrelintide as a standalone and combo therapy with Roche's CT-388, with Zealand receiving significant upfront and milestone payments. Both companies emphasize the strong scientific and cultural fit as key reasons for the agreement.</p>

This success is attributed to anti-incumbent sentiment, fueled by economic dissatisfaction and immigration tensions.

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in recent UK elections, winning its first Parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby and securing its first mayoral contest in Greater Lincolnshire. The party is also making inroads in council seats across England, posing a major challenge to the traditional dominance of the Conservative and Labour parties. While the Conservatives have lost numerous seats, Labour's vote share has also fallen, indicating a broader shift in the political landscape. The results suggest a more fragmented political environment, with no single party dominating.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick's transition to coaching at the University of North Carolina has been overshadowed by his relationship with Jordon Hudson, his 24-year-old girlfriend. Hudson has reportedly inserted herself into the football program, influencing public relations and even shutting down a Hard Knocks documentary. This has raised concerns about her influence and potential impact on the team, with some players signaling their intention to transfer. The situation has become a major distraction, contrasting with Belichick's previous control over his team's narrative.</p>

This marks the second time Israel has intervened militarily in Syria on behalf of the Druse. The strike drew no immediate comment from Syria's government.

          <p>China is easing its restrictions on K-pop acts, signaling a potential shift to boost domestic demand amid a trade war with the US. K-pop group Epex is scheduled to perform in Fuzhou, marking the first concert by an all-Korean idol group in mainland China since 2016. The move is part of a broader strategy to revitalize domestic demand by promoting cultural events. K-pop is seen as a tariff-proof sector, with core revenue drivers like streaming and concerts being digital and intangible. The move also has a diplomatic dimension, as China may seek to restore ties with neighboring countries.</p>

The ruling, which is limited to the Southern District of Texas, prohibited the administration from using the wartime law because the president’s claims about a Venezuelan gang do not add up to an “invasion.”</p>
