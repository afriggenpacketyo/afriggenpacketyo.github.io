          <p>Korean Air has finalized a significant deal with Boeing, agreeing to purchase 103 passenger jets, including 787, 777, and 737 models. This strategic acquisition aims to modernize the South Korean flag carrier's fleet and enhance its competitive edge as it progresses with its merger with Asiana Airlines, as stated by Korean Air boss Walter Cho. The announcement came shortly after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with US President Donald Trump, who has been advocating for increased business with American firms and recently imposed 15% tariffs on South Korea in July. This substantial agreement underscores the interplay between international trade policies, corporate expansion plans in the aviation sector, and the current administration's economic agenda.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native previously mistakenly deported and then returned to the U.S. for federal charges, was taken into ICE custody for deportation to Uganda. His attorneys filed a new lawsuit, successfully securing a court order to temporarily halt his removal, challenging his confinement and the unusual destination. The Department of Homeland Security, led by Secretary Kristi Noem, claims Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member and human trafficker, a charge his family denies. This case highlights concerns about the weaponization of the immigration system and due process rights, drawing attention from politicians like Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.</p>

          <h2>Expert Advice on Improving Back Health Through Dynamic Posture and Movement</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken challenges outdated notions of good posture, suggesting that rigid upright sitting can be detrimental. He advocates for three key rules to improve back health: constant movement, building core strength, and adopting a positive mindset. Instead of staying locked in one position, regular stretching and breaks are crucial for dynamic posture. Simple exercises like arm raises and head turns can build strength, while acknowledging the psychological and emotional components of pain, such as stress, is also vital for overall well-being. This article emphasizes that holistic approaches, rather than static positions or gadgets, are essential for long-term back health.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has again scrubbed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to unfavorable weather conditions, following an earlier delay caused by a ground system issue. This mission is critical for testing corrective upgrades after three previous failures and for restoring confidence in the gargantuan rocket's readiness for future lunar missions, including NASA's planned 2027 landing. The flight aimed to test the Super Heavy first stage and send the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory to the Indian Ocean, deploying Starlink simulator satellites and testing engine restarts. Despite skepticism from some experts about the 2027 moon landing timeline, NASA's acting administrator remains optimistic about SpaceX's ability to overcome these significant technical hurdles.</p>

          <p>The UK government has approved plans for approximately 40 students from Gaza to travel to Britain and begin funded university scholarships. This initiative includes nine students under the Chevening scheme and around 30 others with private scholarships. This marks the first group of Gazan students to leave the territory for UK studies since the Hamas-Israel conflict began in 2023. Significant logistical and political challenges remain, including securing Israel's approval for their departure and conducting visa checks in a third country. This decision follows months of advocacy and aims to provide critical educational opportunities amidst the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive, attributed "significant increases" in staples like butter and eggs to high demand, tightening supply, and increased labor costs. Chocolate prices surged due to poor cocoa harvests, affected by climate change and disease.

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI and X Corp. have filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, accusing them of monopolistic collaboration to suppress competition in the artificial intelligence market. The lawsuit, stemming from Musk's earlier threats, alleges Apple unfairly favors ChatGPT in its App Store rankings, disadvantaging rivals like Grok. It portrays Apple as fearing AI as an "existential threat" and OpenAI as prioritizing profits over public safety. OpenAI dismissed the filing as part of Musk's "ongoing pattern of harassment." The core of the complaint centers on Apple's exclusive partnership with ChatGPT for its iPhone AI features, potentially providing OpenAI with invaluable data unavailable to competitors.</p>

He emphasized that significant wealth has been generated by holding these stocks through various market conditions, rather than attempting to trade in and out. Cramer acknowledged current market concerns, particularly regarding Nvidia ahead of its earnings report, but reiterated his belief in the long-term growth of generative artificial intelligence hardware, with Nvidia as a key player. He stressed the difficulty of timing sales and re-entries into these large companies, suggesting that they inevitably return to growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while US President Donald Trump focuses on de-escalating the Ukraine conflict, China is quietly expanding its influence across Eurasia, a region historically considered key to global power. Trump's tariff policies have inadvertently pushed India, a regional rival, to improve ties with China, and Russia has become a major energy exporter to Beijing. These developments suggest a broader strategic realignment in Eurasia that could diminish American influence. The article highlights how economic ties, such as the $136 billion trade between India and China, and Russia's energy exports, are fostering a shift in regional power dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has proposed reverting the Department of Defense to its former name, the Department of War, arguing that the current name is "too defensive." He asserted that the United States needs to be both defensive and offensive, citing the nation's "unbelievable history of victory" under the old moniker. Trump indicated the change could happen soon and believed congressional approval might not be necessary. This suggestion revives a concept he has teased for months, claiming the original name was abandoned due to "political correctness." The Department of War was renamed in 1947 as part of a post-World War II military reorganization aimed at unifying the Army and Navy into a single Cabinet-level agency.</p>

He must wait three years for his next hearing. The parole panel cited his "behavior in prison," including multiple violations since 2013 such as inappropriate conduct with visitors, drug smuggling, and incidents of violence, as the primary reason for denial. While acknowledging the family's support and claims of sexual assault, the commissioner stated that Menendez still poses an "unreasonable risk to public safety."

The annual Han Kuang war games now feature more realistic simulations, focusing on urban warfare and involving a record number of reservists.

Realtor.com reports a 38% increase in delistings since early 2025, reaching 21 delisted homes for every 100 new listings in June. This trend contributes to a deadlock in the housing market, as sellers, often benefiting from favorable mortgage rates, are unwilling to lower prices to meet buyer demand. Despite a surge in housing inventory, high prices and mortgage rates continue to deter homebuyers, leading to stagnant pending home sales. Sellers' expectations, influenced by the pandemic-era housing boom, are slow to adjust to the current cooler market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

This article explores why, arguing that humans will remain central to decision-making and combat operations. While leaders like Xi Jinping advocate for increased drone adoption and strategies like the US's "hellscape" around Taiwan, analysts suggest autonomous weapons primarily reduce casualties and costs, rather than fully replacing human roles. The continued investment in crewed systems highlights a strategic belief that human judgment and direct involvement remain indispensable for complex warfare scenarios, indicating a nuanced approach to military modernization.</p>
