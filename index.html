        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Shimon Sakaguchi, Mary Brunkow, and Fred Ramsdell for their groundbreaking discoveries regarding immune system tolerance. Their research identified regulatory T-cells, which act as 'security guards' to prevent the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. This fundamental work has opened new avenues for developing treatments for autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as new strategies for cancer therapies and organ transplantation. The laureates' discoveries are considered decisive for understanding how our immune system functions properly.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, a self-described unapologetic supporter of Israel, has publicly called for Hamas to accept a peace deal being brokered by the Trump administration. He voiced sharp criticism towards pro-Palestinian protesters, questioning why they are not pressuring Hamas to agree to the terms that could end the conflict. Fetterman's statements emphasize his position that the war, which began after the October 7th attack involving mass murder and sexual assault, must end to ensure peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

          <p>An NHS intensive care nurse, Sophie Fay, had her leg amputated after a rare cancerous tumor was initially dismissed as a simple muscle injury. The 26-year-old sought medical help for persistent pain and swelling in her calf, which was later diagnosed as spindle cell sarcoma, an extremely rare soft-tissue tumor. As the tumor had encased her blood vessels and nerves, amputation was the only viable option. Fay is now sharing her story during Bone Cancer Awareness Week to raise awareness and encourage others to advocate for their health.</p>

          <p>The South African anti-immigration group "Operation Dudula" is escalating its xenophobic campaigns, now targeting migrant children by calling for their exclusion from public schools. Known for vigilante tactics like blocking foreigners from accessing hospitals, the group blames migrants for crime, unemployment, and strained public services. While the group claims to be protecting South Africans, critics argue it scapegoats foreigners for systemic governmental failures and inequalities rooted in the country's post-Apartheid era. Research shows that claims about migrant crime rates are often exaggerated.</p>

          <p>The United States is set to deport another 11 people to Eswatini, a southern African nation with which they have no connection, under a controversial third-country removal agreement. This marks the second such group sent by the Trump administration, a practice that lawyers and human rights NGOs have condemned as a violation of migrants' rights. The deals, which include other nations like Rwanda and Uganda, allow the US to remove migrants without giving them an opportunity to challenge their deportation to an unfamiliar country.</p>

          <p>France has been plunged into a deeper political crisis after Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu resigned less than 24 hours after naming his government and after just 27 days in office. President Emmanuel Macron accepted the resignation, making Lecornu the fourth prime minister to depart in just over a year. The turmoil stems from France's fragmented parliament, where Macron's centrist party lacks a majority, making it nearly impossible to govern. Opposition parties from both the far-right and far-left are now demanding snap elections.</p>

          <p>Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas are set to begin in Egypt, fueling cautious hope for a ceasefire to end the two-year war in Gaza and secure the release of remaining hostages. The talks will focus on a multi-point plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which Hamas has partially accepted. Key elements include the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and handing over Gaza's governance to an international body. While significant obstacles remain, the diplomatic effort marks a potential turning point in the protracted conflict.</p>

According to Stanford psychologist Jamil Zaki, empathy consists of three parts: sharing feelings, understanding others' perspectives, and caring for their well-being. While it can be emotionally taxing, empathy is presented as a learnable skill that offers significant benefits, such as reduced stress and improved health for the empathizer. The article also addresses recent criticisms, clarifying that empathizing with someone does not mean one must condone their actions.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court's New Term Heavily Focused on Presidential Power</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-06 05:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has commenced a new term that will be heavily dominated by cases concerning the scope of presidential power. The justices are set to hear arguments on major challenges to the Trump administration's actions, including the imposition of tariffs and the firing of commissioners from independent agencies. This focus on executive authority comes after the court's conservative majority has already granted an unprecedented number of emergency requests from the administration, effectively allowing many of its policies to proceed while legal challenges were pending.</p>

          <h2>New Study on Mammals Offers Clues to Why Women Tend to Live Longer Than Men</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-06 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study examining 528 species of mammals has found that females live longer than males in the majority of cases, offering insights into the human longevity gap. Researchers suggest this advantage is due to a combination of evolutionary factors, including genetics—females have two X chromosomes, providing a potential 'backup' against harmful mutations. Additionally, behavioral differences, such as males engaging in riskier behaviors to compete for mates, contribute to shorter lifespans, a pattern that has parallels in human society and contributes to women outliving men.</p>

          <p>Former employees from the Department of Homeland Security's civil rights oversight offices are raising alarms about the potential for abuse in ICE detention centers following major staff cuts. The Trump administration terminated hundreds of positions in these congressionally mandated watchdog offices, which were tasked with investigating complaints and ensuring humane conditions. These ex-workers warn that the lack of internal oversight, combined with an expansion of detention facilities, creates a significant risk of civil rights violations and could lead to an increase in detainee deaths.</p>

          <p>A major rescue effort is underway in Tibet after a sudden and severe snowstorm trapped hundreds of hikers on a slope of Mount Everest. The hikers were located at tourist campsites above 16,000 feet when the heavy snow hit, with some reports indicating it was deep enough to collapse tents. Rescue teams are working to clear paths and evacuate those who remain stranded, while approximately 350 people have already been guided to a safe meeting point. The unseasonable weather struck during a busy national holiday week in China.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops from California and Texas to Portland, Oregon. The ruling stated that the administration had not provided evidence that recent protests in the city made the presence of federalized troops necessary. This decision follows a previous one from the same judge that prevented the administration from using Oregon's own National Guard to quell unrest, arguing it risked state sovereignty and could further inflame tensions.</p>

          <p>Postal delivery has come to a standstill across Canada as thousands of postal workers have walked off the job in a nationwide strike. The action is in protest of sweeping reforms authorized by the federal government that would end door-to-door delivery for millions of homes and close some post offices. The union argues these changes represent a 'direct assault' on the public post office and will lead to significant job losses, while Canada Post warns the strike will worsen its already precarious financial situation.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in downtown Montgomery, Alabama, during a busy festival weekend has resulted in the deaths of a 43-year-old woman and a 17-year-old boy, with twelve other people wounded.

Authorities stated the shooters showed a complete disregard for public safety, as seven of the fourteen total victims were under the age of 20. No suspects have been taken into custody yet.</p>
