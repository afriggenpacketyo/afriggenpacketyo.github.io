          <p>Racquel Smith, also known as Kelly Smith, along with her boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn, have been convicted of kidnapping and trafficking her six-year-old daughter Joshlin Smith, who went missing over a year ago. The trial revealed a troubled life for Joshlin, whose mother struggled with substance abuse and allegedly sold her for money to a traditional healer. Despite the convictions, Joshlin's whereabouts remain unknown, causing ongoing pain and bewilderment for her family and community. The case has drawn comparisons to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, highlighting the broader crisis of child trafficking in South Africa. The courtroom was filled with emotion as victim impact statements were read, underscoring the devastation caused by Joshlin's disappearance, though the whereabouts of the missing girl remain unknown to this day.</p>

          <p>China's Type 055 destroyer, Lhasa, has been upgraded with the ability to synchronize with airborne early warning systems, significantly extending its strike range and precision. This advancement allows the destroyer to engage targets beyond visual range without relying solely on its onboard radar. The system mirrors technology used by Pakistan in a previous conflict, enhancing battlefield data fusion and interoperability across domains. The Lhasa recently participated in live-fire exercises, demonstrating its ability to fire missiles guided by airborne targeting cues, showcasing improved coordination between shipborne helicopters and sensors in simultaneous sea-and-air engagements.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea (BOK) has cut its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5%, the lowest level since August 2022, marking its fourth cut in the last six meetings. This decision comes as South Korea faces political uncertainty and economic challenges, including tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The BOK also slashed its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to 0.8%, considerably lower than the previous projection of 1.5%. The central bank attributed the rate cut decision to its expectations that economic growth will "decline considerably" while inflation remains "broadly stable" (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. This move aims to increase scrutiny of future visa applicants from China and Hong Kong, as relations between Beijing and Washington have deteriorated amid trade tensions. The decision has caused anxiety among international students, some of whom regret choosing to study in the U.S. Estimates suggest around 280,000 Chinese students were studying in the U.S. last year, although this number has been declining due to pandemic-era restrictions and worsening relations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>A panel of federal judges at the U.S. Court of International Trade has blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners.

The ruling delivers a setback to Trump's efforts to pressure nations into striking trade deals more beneficial to the United States.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal, arguing that the Constitution places limits on Congress's ability to empower the president to impose tariffs. The U.S. Court of International Trade's decision states that Trump surpassed these limits and reads federal trade laws to constrain his ability to continue his trade war. The court's decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court, but if upheld, Trump may not be able to reimpose the sweeping tariffs. The three-judge panel unanimously agreed that the tariffs are illegal, concluding that the statute cannot be read to give Trump unchecked authority over tariffs because, if Congress had intended to give Trump that power, then the statute would violate the Constitution‚Äôs separation of powers.</p>

          <p>As negotiations to end the war in Ukraine stall, the Trump administration is turning its attention to the Middle East to showcase progress toward landmark deals. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced that a temporary truce in Gaza was within reach, potentially leading to a peaceful resolution. The administration is also optimistic about brokering a nuclear agreement with Iran, although key gaps remain. Trump has taken a harsher approach to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stating it would be inappropriate to strike Iranian nuclear facilities during negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was convicted on federal charges in 1997 and sentenced to six life terms for leading a criminal enterprise from prison. While his federal sentence has been commuted, Hoover still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois for a 1973 murder. Hoover's attorneys expressed their gratitude, while the lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial voiced disappointment.</p>

Experts warn that China's commitment to its manufacturing-led strategy leaves little room for compromise in ongoing trade talks (not investment advice). The "Made in China 2025" plan aims to transform China into a leading high-end manufacturer, but it has faced challenges and fostered unhealthy industrial competition.</p>
