          <p>South Korea is facing a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate, one of the lowest in the world, threatens to undermine decades of economic progress. Projections from the Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Institute warn that the nation's economy could stagnate or even contract by the 2040s due to a shrinking workforce. Despite the government investing billions in incentives to encourage childbirth, these measures have had little impact. Experts remain divided, with some pointing to human adaptability and technological innovation as potential solutions to offset the demographic decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to attract more foreign visitors and stimulate its tourism sector, China has been relaxing its entry requirements for many travelers. The government has expanded its visa-free transit policies, allowing passport holders from 55 nations to stay for up to 10 days in many parts of the mainland when passing through. Beijing has also been adding countries to a list whose citizens can visit for up to 30 days without a visa, with Russia being the latest addition.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro, citing his "reckless and incendiary actions" during a recent visit to New York City. The decision came after Petro, speaking at a pro-Palestinian protest, urged U.S. soldiers to disobey orders from President Trump. This event escalates already tense relations, which had soured following Petro's criticism of U.S. anti-drug operations in the Caribbean and the Trump administration's decertification of Colombia as a drug-war ally. Colombian officials have criticized the move, defending Petro's speech.</p>

          <p>Hungary is experiencing an increasingly acrimonious political climate marked by aggressive public discourse and government pressure on the media. The governing Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has been accused of using taxpayer-funded propaganda to dehumanize opponents and control the public debate. This has prompted large-scale protests in Budapest against hate speech and a decline in press freedom, as noted by organizations like Reporters Without Borders.

          <p>The United Nations is set to reimpose comprehensive economic and military sanctions on Iran after the UK, France, and Germany triggered a dispute mechanism within the 2015 nuclear deal. The European powers accuse Iran of failing to meet its commitments, particularly after it expanded its nuclear activities following the U.S. withdrawal from the accord in 2016. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has condemned the move as illegal, while insisting the country's nuclear program is peaceful. The reimposition of sanctions, which include an arms embargo and a ban on uranium enrichment, further strains an already tense geopolitical situation.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada highlights a significant disparity in funding and professional support within the sport. England, the world's best-funded team with 32 full-time professional players, stands in stark contrast to Canada, whose players earn a fraction of their English counterparts and rely on fundraising to support their campaign. Despite the financial gap, Canada has proven to be a formidable opponent, leveraging players' experience in England's domestic league and creative preparation strategies. A Canadian victory could challenge the narrative that heavy investment is the only path to success in women's rugby.</p>

          <p>Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has actively pursued a campaign of retribution against his perceived political enemies, raising concerns about the expansion of presidential power. He has publicly urged his attorney general to prosecute opponents, suggested revoking TV licenses for critical media, and targeted individuals like former FBI Director James Comey with indictments. Supporters justify these actions as a response to the legal challenges Trump faced during the Biden administration, viewing it as leveling the playing field. However, critics and democracy watchdog groups warn that these moves represent a significant erosion of democratic norms and a shift towards authoritarianism.</p>

NPR alleges the CPB's decision is an unconstitutional act of retaliation, bending to pressure from the Trump administration, which successfully moved to eliminate all federal subsidies for public broadcasting.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to continue its freeze on over $4 billion in foreign aid that was previously approved by Congress. In its emergency order, the court's conservative majority stated that the potential harm to the president's conduct of foreign affairs outweighed the harm to aid recipients. The three liberal justices dissented, arguing the decision conflicts with the constitutional separation of powers, which grants Congress control over federal spending. The ruling is a significant victory for the administration, which has sought to drastically reduce foreign aid, a move humanitarian groups warn will have dire global consequences.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech firms Huawei and AI start-up DeepSeek are spearheading the nation's effort to reduce its reliance on U.S. semiconductor technology, particularly from industry leader Nvidia. DeepSeek recently announced a shift towards supporting domestically produced chips, while Huawei unveiled new hardware from its Ascend chip series designed to deliver world-class computing power. These developments come as Beijing encourages its tech giants to stop purchasing Nvidia chips tailored for the Chinese market. U.S. trade restrictions have inadvertently spurred a wave of domestic innovation, allowing China to make significant gains in its technological rivalry with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that MyPillow founder and Trump ally Mike Lindell defamed the election technology company Smartmatic by falsely claiming its voting machines rigged the 2020 presidential election. The judge identified 51 specific instances where Lindell made false statements about Smartmatic's role in Los Angeles County. However, the court deferred a decision on whether Lindell acted with "actual malice," a standard Smartmatic must still prove to collect damages. Lindell has vowed to continue his fight against voting machines, while Smartmatic's attorneys have stated they will seek nine-figure damages.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is under pressure after a difficult opening day that saw Europe take a commanding 5 ½ to 2 ½ lead. Bradley's decisions are being questioned, particularly his choice to reuse the pairing of Collin Morikawa and Harris English for Saturday's foursomes, despite their heavy 5&4 defeat on Friday. Defending his strategy, Bradley stated the team would not panic and would stick to its plan, emphasizing that the players were eager for a chance at redemption. The American team struggled on the greens at Bethpage, and now faces an uphill battle to retain the trophy.</p>

Stewart was the team's only major acquisition at the trade deadline aimed at strengthening their struggling relief corps.

His absence creates uncertainty in the Dodgers' right-handed relief options heading into the postseason, placing more pressure on pitchers like Blake Treinen and rookies Edgardo Henriquez and Roki Sasaki to perform in high-leverage situations.</p>

          <p>Following the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, President Donald Trump has indicated that he expects more of his political adversaries to face criminal charges. Trump described his opponents as "corrupt radical left Democrats," reinforcing concerns that the Justice Department is being used to enact his campaign of retribution. The indictment against Comey, which alleges he misled Congress, is widely viewed as being based on weak evidence, raising fears that prosecutors may feel emboldened to pursue other politically motivated cases against figures like New York Attorney General Letitia James and Senator Adam Schiff.</p>

          <p>A court transcript reveals that the magistrate judge overseeing the James Comey indictment expressed confusion regarding the prosecutor's handling of the case. During the session, the judge questioned the newly appointed interim U.S. Attorney, a former Trump personal lawyer, about why she was presented with two inconsistent versions of the indictment. The grand jury had voted not to charge Comey on one of the three counts presented, leading to the discrepancy. This procedural confusion adds to the controversy surrounding the politically charged indictment of the former FBI director, which President Trump had publicly encouraged.</p>
