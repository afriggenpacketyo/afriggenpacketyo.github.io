          <p>This opinion article contrasts the national response to past political assassinations, such as those of JFK and MLK Jr., with the current reaction to Charlie Kirk's murder. The author contends that previous tragedies fostered a sense of shared national grief, whereas Kirk's death has been immediately weaponized for political blame by figures like Donald Trump. The writer expresses fear that the event is being used to undermine free speech and justify censorship, rather than prompting a reflection on the dangers of political violence. The piece concludes with a lament for the perceived decline of American democracy.</p>

          <p>A Colorado-based mother and social media influencer is offering advice on how families can save money on skiing and snowboarding. She highlights programs like the Epic SchoolKids Colorado Pack and the Colorado Ski Country USA pass, which provide free or heavily discounted access for elementary school children at numerous resorts. Additional recommendations include booking packages, skiing on weekdays, visiting smaller resorts, and renting equipment for children instead of buying it, as they quickly outgrow it. These strategies aim to make winter sports more accessible for families on a budget.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated he would "never" have appointed Peter Mandelson as his US ambassador had he been aware of the full extent of Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The statement follows Lord Mandelson's dismissal after emails from 2008 surfaced, showing him offering support to Epstein following his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Starmer explained that the messages contradicted his government's stance on violence against women and that Mandelson's answers to official inquiries were unsatisfactory. The controversy has added to recent political pressures on the Prime Minister's leadership.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, has filed a lawsuit alleging her termination was unlawful. The suit claims she was fired without cause or due process, suggesting the decision was politically motivated due to her father's contentious relationship with President Donald Trump. Comey, who worked on high-profile cases involving figures like Jeffrey Epstein, argues that her removal undermines the principle of an independent justice system. She is seeking reinstatement to her position along with back pay.</p>

          <p>Paul Ovenden, a senior political strategy aide to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has resigned after explicit and offensive text messages he sent eight years ago regarding MP Diane Abbott were made public. In the messages, Ovenden recounted a conversation with colleagues involving graphic sexual remarks about Abbott. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister condemned the comments as "appalling and unacceptable," while Ovenden issued an apology for the hurt caused. His resignation adds to a series of recent high-profile departures from Starmer's government, fueling criticism of the Downing Street operation.</p>

          <p>Activists who contest the results of the 2020 presidential election are increasingly being appointed to local election boards in key states like Georgia and Arizona, raising concerns about partisan interference. These appointments, often driven by political party nominations, place individuals linked to "election integrity" movements in positions overseeing voting administration. In places like Fulton County, Georgia, commissioners are resisting these appointments through legal challenges, fearing it could undermine democratic processes. The trend is seen by advocacy groups as part of a broader strategy to disrupt and delegitimize election results.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reportedly reached a framework agreement concerning the ownership of TikTok, potentially transferring the platform to U.S.-controlled ownership. The announcement came from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent following high-level trade talks in Madrid, though commercial terms were not disclosed. This development marks a significant step in resolving long-standing U.S. national security concerns about the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The final details of the deal are expected to be settled between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later in the week.</p>

          <p>An inmate has died while in custody at the Shasta County Jail in Redding, California, after being found unresponsive during a routine welfare check. This marks another death at a facility that has been under scrutiny for its high rate of in-custody fatalities. A recent grand jury report noted 22 inmate deaths between 2019 and 2024, a number significantly higher than in comparable counties. While the report attributed many deaths to the "lifestyles" of inmates, including addiction, the recurring incidents continue to raise concerns about conditions and safety within the jail.

          <p>An analysis of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) indicates that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce, even before accounting for government subsidies. While the upfront capital investment for renewables is high, their operational and maintenance costs are significantly lower than those for fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, which are also subject to volatile fuel prices. However, experts note that LCOE doesn't capture the full picture, as the intermittent nature of wind and solar requires backup power sources.

          <p>One of the largest homes in the United States, the Pritzker estate in Los Angeles, is on the market for $175 million following the divorce of its owners, Hyatt heir Tony Pritzker and his ex-wife, Jeanne. The 50,000-square-foot mansion, which took six years to build, features 16 bedrooms, 27 bathrooms, a bowling alley, and a cliffside pool with panoramic city views. Initially listed for $195 million, a sale at its current price would still set a new record for the most expensive home sold in Los Angeles. The property's ownership structure, involving a series of trusts, was a point of contention during the divorce proceedings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rate this week, prompting financial experts to advise on how consumers can prepare. For those with high-interest debt like credit cards, a small rate cut won't provide significant immediate relief, making strategies like balance transfers or consolidation loans more effective. Savers are encouraged to lock in current high yields on certificates of deposit (CDs) before rates fall. The move could also benefit the housing market by making mortgages more affordable, while improving one's credit score remains the most impactful way to secure better loan terms.

          <p>South Sudan's fragile peace deal is on the verge of breaking down after Vice President Riek Machar was charged with treason by President Salva Kiir's government. The 2018 agreement ended a brutal five-year civil war between forces loyal to Kiir, from the Dinka ethnic group, and Machar, from the rival Nuer group. However, key provisions like integrating armed forces and holding elections were never fully implemented. Machar's party accuses the government of sidelining them and obstructing the peace process, raising fears of a return to widespread civil strife in the economically suffering nation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. banks borrowed $1.5 billion from the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility (SRF), an action that suggests some minor tightness in short-term funding markets. The borrowing occurred on a deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments, which, combined with a large Treasury security settlement, increased the demand for cash. The SRF acts as a backstop to prevent disruptive funding shortages by allowing banks to exchange eligible collateral, like Treasuries, for overnight cash. Analysts view the current liquidity pressure as temporary and not indicative of a broader funding squeeze in the financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump published a letter to NATO allies, urging them to stop buying Russian oil and gas to strengthen the alliance's position against Russia's war in Ukraine. However, analysts in Brussels believe the letter is unlikely to change the European Union's course. The demand puts pressure on Hungary and Slovakia, two member states still reliant on Russian energy and friendly with Trump, but is seen as a way for Trump to shift blame for inaction. Critics argue Trump is setting an impossibly high bar for U.S. sanctions by requiring unanimity from all NATO members, including Turkey.</p>

          <p>A car buyer shared their experience of a dealership adding a $1,000 fee for paying with cash instead of financing, a practice that is becoming more common. Industry insiders explain that dealerships often earn significant profit from arranging loans, receiving kickbacks from lenders and marking up interest rates. As a result, a cash purchase can be less profitable for the dealer than a financed one. While some consumers attempt to game the system by financing and immediately repaying the loan, this can be prevented by prepayment penalties or minimum loan terms in the contract.</p>

Administrators cited the high cost of maintaining stores amid rising rents as a key factor in the retailer's failure. While there has been interest from potential buyers for some of the remaining 85 stores, the administrators stated it was no longer viable to keep all of them trading due to stock shortages and operating costs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is again advocating for U.S. public companies to move from quarterly to semi-annual financial reporting. In a social media post, Trump argued that less frequent reporting would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. Proponents believe the change could encourage more companies to go public, but the proposal faces opposition from investors who rely on regular reports for transparency. The U.S. has required quarterly reports since 1970, and similar efforts by Trump during his first term did not succeed.</p>

Bane, who has never been formally questioned and is the only person of interest, claimed she likely fell overboard.

Swagel also noted that the CBO projects the tariffs will reduce the U.S. budget deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade by increasing government revenue.
