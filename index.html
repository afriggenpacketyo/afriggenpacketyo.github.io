          <p>Amazon's subsidiary, Zoox, has officially launched its robotaxi service in Las Vegas, marking its entry into a market largely dominated by Alphabet's Waymo. The service initially offers free rides from select locations on the Strip, with plans for paid service pending regulatory approval. Zoox's custom-built, toaster-shaped electric vehicles, which lack a steering wheel or pedals, are designed to be fundamentally different from retrofitted cars used by competitors like Waymo and Tesla. Following the Las Vegas launch, Zoox plans to expand to Austin, Miami, and San Francisco, aiming to scale production and eventually achieve profitability in the competitive autonomous vehicle industry.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry was observed entering Clarence House, fueling speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, who was also at the royal residence. This would mark their first face-to-face interaction since February 2024, shortly after the King's cancer diagnosis was made public. While neither Buckingham Palace nor the Duke of Sussex's representatives have confirmed a meeting, Harry has been in the UK for charity events and has previously expressed a desire for reconciliation. The visit comes after a period of strained relations within the royal family, with no meetings planned between Harry and his brother, Prince William.</p>

          <p>Emma Heming Willis addressed the family's decision to provide her husband, Bruce Willis, with a separate nearby home as part of his frontotemporal dementia care. She explained that while the choice drew some criticism, it was made to ensure the safest environment for both Willis and their family, emphasizing that every caregiving journey is unique. In her new book, Heming Willis shares their experiences to support other caregivers, highlighting the immense stress and decision fatigue they face. She advocates for caregivers to prioritize their own health and not hesitate to ask for help, a lesson she learned after being told their mortality rates are significantly higher.</p>

          <p>Three senior FBI officials have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming they were illegally terminated for political reasons at the direction of the White House. The complaint alleges that FBI Director Kash Patel stated his job depended on firing agents involved in past investigations of President Trump, quoting him as saying the president "hasn't forgotten" the FBI's perceived attempts to imprison him. The lawsuit, brought by decorated veterans of the agency, describes a purge aimed at punishing law enforcement for their professional duties. It further claims White House pressure was exerted to create "panic and anxiety" within the FBI workforce to ensure loyalty.</p>

          <p>The 30-day period of direct federal control over Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, initiated by the Trump administration, is set to expire. While Congress has not moved to extend the emergency order, the D.C. National Guard, which is under presidential control, will remain deployed in the city until November 30. The takeover was enacted under the D.C. Home Rule Act, citing public safety concerns amid debates over the police force's size. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb had previously sued the administration over the National Guard's deployment, arguing it violated the principle of separating military from domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Freight trade from China to the United States has slowed dramatically, defying the typical peak season surge ahead of the holidays. Data shows a sustained 27% year-over-year decline in imports from China, with key product segments like furniture, toys, and electronics seeing significant reductions. This slowdown is attributed to the ongoing trade war, which prompted an early front-loading of inventory in late spring to preempt tariffs, followed by a sharp drop in orders. As a result, ocean carriers are announcing blank sailings for October to manage reduced capacity, signaling continued negative impacts on North American trade volumes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores the strategic debate within the Democratic party regarding a potential government shutdown as the September 30 budget deadline approaches. Some progressives advocate using the shutdown as leverage to force Republicans to enact curbs on President Trump's perceived authoritarian actions. However, the author argues this is unlikely to succeed, as the GOP would probably not defy Trump and could even abolish the filibuster to pass a budget. A more viable, though politically complex, strategy might be to force a shutdown over extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, a popular issue that could benefit Democrats electorally in 2026.</p>

They reportedly anticipated the collapse of the German state, an event they termed "day X," after which they intended to establish an independent state based on Nazi ideology.

However, Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the president had not stated a legally permissible cause, as the alleged conduct predated her government service, and that Cook's due process rights were violated.

          <p>The universities of Kent and Greenwich are set to merge, forming what is being called the UK's first "super-university," which will operate under the name London and South East University Group starting in 2026. The combined institution will serve nearly 50,000 students across existing campuses, creating a stronger financial foundation to navigate the economic challenges facing the higher education sector. While university leaders state the move is a collaborative partnership, the University and College Union has described it as a "takeover by Greenwich" due to Kent's financial struggles and warned that redundancies are almost certain. The merger is seen as an innovative model that other UK universities may consider.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a historic surge of over 40% after the company reported an astounding backlog of $455 billion in future cloud contracts, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. This performance, on track to be the stock's best day since 1992, pushed the company's market capitalization close to the $1 trillion mark. The massive demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure, which is essential for running large AI workloads, overshadowed a quarterly earnings report that slightly missed analyst expectations. The unprecedented growth in its order book has solidified Oracle's position as a key player in the competitive AI infrastructure market alongside giants like Microsoft and Amazon.

In a CNBC interview, Scharf distinguished between the president expressing an opinion and actually interfering with the central bank's independent decision-making process. His comments come amid President Trump's repeated public attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his recent attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Scharf noted that political commentary on Fed decisions is not new, but acknowledged that President Trump is particularly outspoken in his criticism.</p>

This follows a similar reported drone strike on another of the flotilla's boats just a day earlier.

Key debates center on the team's biggest weaknesses, including defensive cohesion and the ability to create chances against quality opposition.

This funding is part of a larger $1 billion pledge and will target areas where women are disproportionately affected, such as autoimmune diseases, mental health, and cardiovascular disease. Historically, medical research has treated male bodies as the default, often excluding women from clinical trials, which has led to significant knowledge gaps. This investment aims to accelerate breakthroughs in understanding and treating women's health issues, which advocates argue is not only a moral imperative but also an economic one.</p>

          <p>A new survey from Bankrate.com reveals that the average cost for an out-of-network ATM withdrawal in the U.S. has hit a record high of $4.86. This fee is a combination of what the ATM owner charges and what the consumer's own bank charges for using another institution's machine. The increase is attributed to a lack of regulation on these specific fees, unlike other banking charges like overdrafts, allowing banks to freely raise them. The trend is also influenced by the declining use of cash, as ATM providers and banks seek to make up for lost revenue from lower transaction volumes, with consumers in cities like Atlanta paying over $5 per withdrawal.</p>
