          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries, prompting a search for three suspects. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel detailed the incident, noting that victims, including two juveniles who are expected to survive, were transported to multiple hospitals. Investigators recovered nearly 140 pieces of ballistic evidence, suggesting an automatic weapon was used in what may have been an exchange of gunfire. The event was part of a violent holiday weekend in the city, though officials remain resolute that they will not return to previous highs in homicide rates.</p>

          <p>Two 19-year-old camp counselors from Mexico shared their experience of guiding young campers through the catastrophic floods at Camp Mystic in Texas. Silvana Garza Valdez and María Paula Zárate described the terrifying storm and the moment they realized the severity of the situation. They took measures like writing the girls' names on their skin for identification and keeping them calm with games and songs until they were evacuated by Army trucks. The counselors reflected on the surreal and harrowing event, expressing shock and gratitude for their survival after learning their previous cabins were destroyed.</p>

          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility more than three weeks after being shot. He and his wife, Yvette, were attacked in their home in what authorities describe as part of a series of politically motivated shootings that also killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. The suspect, Vance Boelter, is in custody facing multiple federal and state charges, including murder and attempted murder. Hoffman's release marks a significant step in his recovery from the violent assault.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its nearly two-decade-old policy requiring passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes. According to an internal memo, the change will be rolled out at major airports, with the goal of expanding it nationwide shortly. This move aims to speed up security checkpoints, though passengers who trigger alarms will still need to remove footwear for additional screening. The original policy was implemented in 2006, years after Richard Reid attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his shoes on a transatlantic flight.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the country defend itself amid its ongoing war with Russia. The decision comes just days after the White House confirmed it had paused some weapons shipments as part of a broader review of U.S. military stockpiles. The president emphasized the need for Ukraine to be able to protect itself, stating that "so many people are dying in that mess." The Pentagon confirmed the move, aligning it with the administration's "America First" defense priorities.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing Singapore over the United States for their higher education, shifting a long-standing trend. Students cite difficulties adjusting to cultural differences and increasing parental concerns about safety in the U.S. as key factors in their decision. Singapore is seen as an attractive alternative due to its high-quality universities, cultural familiarity, and perceived openness. While the U.S. has historically been the top destination, industry insiders predict Singapore will see a rise in applications from China amid the changing preferences.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that one in five vehicle accidents in the United States occurs in parking lots, resulting in over 500 deaths and 165 injuries daily. The study identifies cities like San Bernardino, California, where parking lots constitute nearly half the downtown area, as creating concrete danger zones. Major contributing factors include widespread driver distraction, with a high percentage of drivers admitting to using phones or GPS while navigating these spaces. Poor design, including inadequate lighting, faded markings, and a lack of pedestrian walkways, exacerbates the risks.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved toward permanently ending "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the guise of substantial remodels. An amendment was approved to prevent landlords from using renovations as a "just cause" for eviction unless they receive a specific order from a government agency to address code violations. This makes a temporary protection permanent and directs city departments to establish clear rules for tenant rights during legitimate renovations. These rules will cover relocation payments, provision of comparable temporary housing, and limits on rent increases upon return.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has officially concluded that disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019. According to a memo on the findings, the review also found no credible evidence of a so-called "client list" or that Epstein was blackmailing prominent figures. The investigation aimed to address years of conspiracy theories and confirmed that Epstein harmed over 1,000 victims. Officials stated that perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve the goal of achieving justice for those victims.</p>

          <p>Veteran Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been selected for his 11th career All-Star Game as a special "Legend Pick" by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred. The selection, which came as a surprise to Kershaw, recognizes his storied career accomplishments rather than his performance this season, as he has made only nine starts after returning from surgery. Kershaw expressed his gratitude for the "tremendous honor," stating that while it feels weird, he plans to enjoy the experience without taking an opportunity away from a more deserving first-time All-Star.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on purchase of 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, a decision spurred by the demonstrated vulnerability of such aircraft in modern warfare. Citing lessons from the war in Ukraine, officials highlighted the threat posed by advanced air defenses and cheap loitering munitions to low, slow-flying helicopters. The funds will be redirected toward investing in future-focused capabilities like drones and smart weapon systems, reflecting a significant strategic shift in the country's defense procurement priorities away from legacy platforms.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not prosecute participants of the city's recent Pride parade, despite the event being officially banned by the government. The decision comes after a record crowd of over 200,000 people defied the prohibition, which was enacted under Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ agenda. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the march's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, as the reason for not pursuing fines or other legal action against attendees.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose 25% tariffs on goods from Japan and South Korea, effective August 1, and has threatened new duties on a dozen other countries. The move comes as a 90-day pause on such tariffs was set to expire. Letters posted by the president outlined varying tariff rates for nations including Myanmar (40%), Thailand (36%), and Indonesia (32%). This escalation in trade protectionism continues to worry economists, who warn of potential price increases for U.S. consumers and disruptions to global financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from the chief inspector of prisons for England and Wales has issued a stark warning that the overwhelming amount of drugs being smuggled into prisons is destabilizing the entire system. Criminal gangs are reportedly using drones for regular contraband deliveries to bored inmates in overcrowded facilities. The report states that this has led to "uncontrolled levels of criminality" that inexperienced staff cannot contain. The failure to control the drug trade is hindering rehabilitation efforts and, according to the inspector, presents a serious threat to national security.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The ruling blocks a provision in the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that targets health providers offering abortion services. Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit arguing the law was an unconstitutional attack designed to punish the organization, which would have devastating consequences for patients who rely on its non-abortion services like cancer screenings. The order will remain in effect for 14 days pending further hearings.</p>

It also delves into the long-standing failure of Kerr County to install a flood warning siren system due to cost concerns, and raises questions about whether federal budget cuts and staffing shortages at the NWS compromised forecasting and communication.</p>
