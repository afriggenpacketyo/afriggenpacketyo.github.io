        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to return to public ownership under the Labour government's plan to integrate it into Great British Railways (GBR). The government is focusing on improving services and reinvesting profits into infrastructure, while unions are concerned about outsourcing. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander assured passengers they would get "great value for money" but did not promise lower fares. The nationalization is considered a "watershed moment" as SWR becomes the responsibility of the Department for Transport Operator and will be integrated into GBR, which will officially exist after a parliamentary vote in the autumn.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian drone and missile attacks have resulted in at least eight deaths and over 30 injuries across Ukraine, as reported by regional officials. Four deaths were reported in the Khmelnytskyi region, three in the Kyiv region, and one in Mykolaiv, with significant damage to residential buildings and infrastructure. Russia's defense ministry claimed its air defense units intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions, including Moscow, with no reported casualties. These attacks occurred as both countries engaged in prisoner swaps, with hundreds of soldiers and civilians exchanged in the largest exchange since February 2022.</p>

The International Table Tennis Federationâ€™s integrity unit is investigating potential monetary influence on the vote.

Feintzeig recalls how horror movies helped her cope with a miscarriage, providing a sense of perspective by focusing on someone else's problems.

Ohtani is scheduled to face batters for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023, but Roberts indicated that the natural progression of building a starter up to five or six innings makes a pre-All-Star return unlikely. Ohtani has been throwing all his pitches in practice, including a slider, and the Dodgers prioritized his hitting during spring training while slowing down his pitching rehab.</p>

          <p>John Woeltz, a crypto investor, was arrested in New York City for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist. The victim, who arrived from Italy on May 6, was reportedly lured to Woeltz's home in SoHo to retrieve Bitcoin but was instead tied up and tortured for several weeks. According to prosecutors, the victim was shocked with electric wires, cut with a saw, and forced to smoke crack cocaine before managing to escape and alert authorities. Evidence recovered from the scene included weapons, body armor, and disturbing photographs.</p>

Physicians argue that these restrictions lack scientific evidence and are excessive compared to other countries.

          <p>A recent study in Scientific Reports suggests that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass anxiety to their pets. Researchers found that owners with higher job stress and rumination habits had dogs exhibiting more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. The study highlights the phenomenon of "crossover," where stress spills over from one person to others in the home, including pets. Dogs are particularly sensitive to their ownersâ€™ moods, and changes in care routines due to work stress can also contribute to their anxiety.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who was wrongly deported to Mexico, despite facing risks in both countries. The man, identified as O.C.G., was protected from deportation to Guatemala due to fears of persecution, but was instead sent to Mexico. The judge criticized the administration's actions as lacking due process, noting the man's history of violence and rape in Mexico. The ruling underscores ongoing legal challenges against the administration's immigration policies and deportations.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented new restrictions on press access at the Pentagon, limiting journalists' access to various areas without a government escort. The restricted zones include the offices of Hegseth, his top aides, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Pentagon Press Association has expressed deep concern, viewing the restrictions as an attack on freedom of the press. Hegseth cited the need to protect national security, while critics argue that limiting access undermines public trust and transparency.</p>
