          <p>The Israeli army has admitted that its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23, although it maintains that at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas. The IDF initially claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached suspiciously in darkness without headlights, but video footage showed the vehicles were clearly marked with lights on. An IDF official said soldiers fired on the convoy after earlier firing on a car containing Hamas members and mistakenly assuming they were under threat. The Red Crescent and other international organizations are calling for an independent investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has vowed to protect UK businesses from the economic impact of new tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, suggesting potential state intervention to safeguard national interests. While seeking an economic deal with the US to avoid some tariffs, Starmer indicated a willingness to use industrial policy to "shelter British business from the storm". Britain faces a 10% import duty rate, and a 25% tariff on car exports, as well as steel and aluminum products, due to the new tariffs. The government is exploring retaliatory measures and strengthening trade alliances to mitigate the impact.</p>

The action comes amid growing concerns about political instability and potential civil war in South Sudan.

          <p>The Justice Department has placed an attorney on indefinite paid leave after he struggled to defend the government's position in a case involving a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador.  Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that DOJ attorneys are required to zealously advocate for the United States, and any failure to do so will face consequences. The attorney's supervisor was also placed on administrative leave for failure to supervise a subordinate. The government is seeking to appeal the judge's order to facilitate the return of the deported man.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs is a wall designed to keep work and jobs within the US, rather than immigrants out.  Trump's trade policies mark a significant departure from the globalization process championed by the US in recent decades. The rationale behind these tariffs is based on the idea that a trade deficit is a result of "cheating" and deserves a tariff to correct the imbalance. The long-term aim is to reduce the US trade deficit to zero, but this approach is likely to encourage resistance from other countries.</p>

          <p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy has criticized Israeli authorities for denying entry to two Labour MPs, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, describing the move as unacceptable and counterproductive. Israeli authorities claimed the MPs intended to spread hateful rhetoric against Israel, a claim Lammy disputes. Lammy has communicated to the Israeli government that this treatment of British Parliamentarians is unacceptable, and the Foreign Office has offered support to the affected MPs.</p>

          <p>Sarah Boardman, the artist behind a portrait of Donald Trump that was publicly criticized by the president, says her business is now "in danger of not recovering".

          <p>DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has introduced a new method to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as anticipation builds for its next-generation model. The new approach combines generative reward modelling (GRM) and self-principled critique tuning.  The resulting DeepSeek-GRM models have demonstrated competitive performance compared to existing methods.  The announcement comes amid speculation about the release of DeepSeek-R2, the successor to the company's R1 reasoning model.</p>
