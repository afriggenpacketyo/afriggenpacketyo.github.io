        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent, received a 12-year prison sentence for defrauding an elderly woman out of $1 million. Posing as a friend and tax preparer, Cohen-Roth gained access to the victim's financial information and offered fake investment opportunities with promised high returns. The scheme, which began in 2013, involved Cohen-Roth using new investors' money to pay off earlier ones, a classic Ponzi scheme. The victim lost her home and life savings, while Cohen-Roth lived lavishly until the scheme collapsed in 2020 when the victim requested her money back.</p>

          <p>After days of intense fighting, India and Pakistan announced a cease-fire agreement mediated, according to President Trump, by the United States, a claim disputed by India. The conflict, which included missile and drone strikes, was triggered by a terrorist attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people, with India accusing Pakistan of involvement, a claim Pakistan denies. Despite the cease-fire announcement, reports of continued violence emerged, with both sides accusing each other of violating the truce, indicating the fragility of the agreement.

          <p>Despite agreeing to a ceasefire after days of military strikes, India and Pakistan have accused each other of violations. India's Foreign Secretary cited "repeated violations" after explosions were heard in Indian-administered Kashmir, while Pakistan's foreign ministry claimed it remained committed to the ceasefire but accused India of violations. The recent conflict was triggered by India's strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir following a militant attack in Pahalgam, with Pakistan denying any involvement.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies and regulations, except when explicitly required by law. This directive effectively suspends the use of the "social cost of carbon," a metric used to assess the economic damages from global warming, including wildfires, floods, and droughts. Critics argue that this move disregards scientific consensus and allows for policy decisions to be guided by "feelings, not facts," potentially undermining efforts to combat climate change. The American Petroleum Institute has supported limiting the application of the social cost of carbon.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer characterized the recent talks in Kyiv among Ukraine's allies as a "significant moment" in the effort to secure a ceasefire with Russia, while acknowledging it is not the end of the process. Around 30 global leaders, including those from the UK, France, Germany, and Poland, reiterated their demand for Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, threatening further sanctions if Russia does not comply. The leaders warned of "new and massive" sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not agree to the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Negotiations for President Donald Trump's tax agenda are ramping up, with the House Ways and Means Committee releasing a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill. Republican lawmakers aim to pass Trump's package without Democratic support through a process called "reconciliation," which requires adherence to a limited budget framework. Experts anticipate challenges due to competing priorities and a narrow Republican majority in the House, with some lawmakers seeking a more fiscally responsible package. The article highlights that key tax proposals could impact millions of Americans as negotiations continue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to pass crypto legislation are being hampered by concerns over his personal cryptocurrency ventures, which have created conflicts of interest. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a bill to establish federal rules for stablecoins, due to concerns that Trump's meme coin, $TRUMP, enriches him personally and undermines public trust. The value of $TRUMP soared after a promotion offering dinner with the president and a White House tour to top holders, prompting accusations of a "pay-for-play scheme." Several Democrats who initially supported the bill withdrew their support, citing concerns over money laundering and national security.</p>

While Trump pressures the Fed to cut rates, Powell has voiced confidence in the economy and dismissed the idea of pre-emptive cuts.
