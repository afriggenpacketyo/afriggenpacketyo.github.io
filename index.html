          <p>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper has warned that while a few more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are possible, excessive easing could push the economy into a "danger territory." He fears that lowering rates too aggressively risks reigniting inflation and creating potential asset bubbles in the market. Tepper explained that although current high valuations make him uncomfortable, he is not betting against stocks as long as the central bank remains in an easing cycle, describing his position as cautiously constructive.

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of workers, including teachers and pharmacists, participated in nationwide strikes across France to protest proposed government budget cuts. The action, called by major trade unions, caused severe disruptions to public transportation and other essential services. Unions are demanding increased spending on public programs and higher taxes on the wealthy to address the country's spiraling public debt. The new government faces a significant challenge in navigating the widespread public opposition within a hung parliament.</p>

          <p>The Jordan Peele-produced horror film "Him" receives a negative review, described as a disappointing and unrealistic portrayal of American football. The movie centers on a top college quarterback prospect who, after a head injury, undergoes rehabilitation at a veteran player's desert compound that descends into a house of horrors. The critique highlights the film's implausible depiction of the elite football world and a weak central performance, ultimately labeling the movie's attempt to blend sports and horror a "fumble."</p>

          <p>In response to recent Russian drone incursions into the airspace of member states Poland and Romania, NATO has launched a new mission named "Operation Eastern Sentry." The operation aims to strengthen air and ground defenses along the alliance's eastern flank. These incidents have raised concerns about the high cost of using advanced missiles to intercept inexpensive drones, prompting calls for more efficient and cost-effective anti-drone technologies. The mission is intended to send a clear signal of NATO's defensive readiness to Russia.</p>

          <p>The Taliban has implemented a shutdown of fiber-optic internet services in several northern provinces of Afghanistan, officially citing the need to "prevent immorality." However, the move is widely perceived as an effort to stifle dissent and block critical content. This restriction is causing significant disruptions for businesses, banks, and government functions, and is particularly devastating for girls and women who rely on online classes as their sole means of education after being barred from schools and universities.</p>

          <p>Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison has amassed his $365 billion fortune through an unconventional strategy of holding onto his vast 41% stake in the company rather than diversifying.

According to filings, Ellison has pledged over $82 billion worth of his Oracle stock as collateral for personal loans, allowing him to access immense capital without relinquishing his ownership or control.

Bessent's attorney and the White House have both dismissed the report, asserting that no wrongdoing occurred.</p>
