          <p>A cyberattack has targeted a widely used electronic check-in and baggage system, causing significant disruptions at several major European airports, including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The software provider, Collins Aerospace, confirmed the "cyber-related disruption" to its Muse system, forcing airlines to revert to manual check-in processes. This has resulted in long queues, hundreds of flight delays, and considerable passenger frustration, highlighting the vulnerability of modern aviation infrastructure to digital threats. Officials from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre and the European Commission are investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>A right-wing, anti-immigration demonstration in The Hague, Netherlands, descended into violence, with rioters clashing with police, throwing objects, and setting a police car on fire. Police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd, which had blocked a major highway. The unrest, occurring just weeks before a general election, also saw vandals attack the office of a centrist political party. Political leaders from across the spectrum, including caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing lawmaker Geert Wilders, condemned the violence as unacceptable.</p>

          <p>A court in Islamabad, Pakistan, has formally charged a 22-year-old man with the murder of 17-year-old medical student and TikTok creator Sana Yousaf. The accused, Umar Hayat, pleaded not guilty to killing Yousaf in her home after she reportedly rejected his advances. The case has ignited widespread outrage and protests in Pakistan, drawing attention to the pervasive issue of violence against women in the country. Human rights organizations note that such honor killings and patriarchal violence remain a serious, systemic problem despite high-profile cases sparking public condemnation.</p>

          <p>New York State Democratic Committee Chairman Jay Jacobs has announced he will not endorse Zohran Mamdani, the party's own nominee for New York City mayor, citing fundamental disagreements on policy and Mamdani's critical stance on Israel. This decision creates a significant rift within the party, as Governor Kathy Hochul has already endorsed the Democratic socialist candidate. Jacobs stated that while he disagrees with "fearmongering" about Mamdani's campaign, their visions for addressing income disparity are irreconcilable.

          <p>Correctional officers at the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco are appealing to the state to reverse its decision to close the facility by 2026. They argue that the prison could help alleviate the severe overcrowding in county jails, a problem highlighted by a recent lawsuit from Attorney General Rob Bonta against Los Angeles County. The officers contend that the state's reasons for closure, such as infrastructure costs, are overstated and that the prison is cost-effective and has available space. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation maintains the decision is based on declining prison populations and the high cost of updating the older facility.</p>

          <p>Southern Inyo Healthcare District, a critical hospital in a remote area of California's Eastern Sierra, is facing imminent financial collapse with only eight days of cash on hand. Local and state officials have urgently requested a $3 million emergency bailout from Governor Gavin Newsom to prevent its closure, which would create a "medical desert" over a 136-mile stretch. The hospital serves a small community and numerous tourists visiting nearby national parks like Death Valley. Its potential failure highlights a broader crisis facing rural hospitals nationwide, which are struggling with rising costs and declining federal revenue.</p>

The challenging street circuit in Baku punished numerous drivers for mistakes, leading to a mixed-up grid for the race.

          <p>According to social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh, author of "Love by Design," a lack of respect is a major red flag in a romantic relationship that can severely harm a person's self-esteem over time. Disrespect can manifest in subtle ways, like one partner consistently walking ahead of the other, or in more significant actions, such as devaluing a partner's priorities, commitments, or identity. Nasserzadeh explains that people enter relationships to be seen and valued, and a persistent pattern of disrespect undermines this fundamental need. She advises addressing these behaviors directly to see if change is possible before deciding the relationship's future.</p>

These rights grant the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned against the shutdown, U.S. Steel reversed its decision, showcasing the administration's increasing willingness to exert direct influence over private sector operations.

          <p>The future of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show remains unresolved as discussions with ABC and parent company Disney continue following its indefinite suspension. The show was pulled after Kimmel linked the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement, prompting intense pressure from political figures, including the FCC chairman. The suspension has sparked a fierce debate about free speech, corporate responsibility, and political pressure on media, drawing criticism and support from across the political spectrum. Protests have been held in support of Kimmel, while some ABC affiliates have preemptively dropped the show.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses have advanced to their seventh consecutive Women's Rugby World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 win against a resilient French team. The match was closely contested, particularly in the first half, but England pulled away with key tries from Ellie Kildunne, Amy Cokayne, and Abbie Ward. Despite England's errors keeping France in the game, the hosts' superior power and depth, especially from their bench, proved decisive in the second half. They will now face Canada in a highly anticipated final at a sold-out Allianz Stadium.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations on the contentious issues of climate change and abortion took place in several German cities, including Berlin and Cologne. Climate activists, organized by Fridays for Future, protested the government's new energy policy, which includes building new gas-fired plants. Simultaneously, anti-abortion groups held their annual "March for Life," which was met by large pro-choice counter-protests advocating for sexual self-determination. The dual protests highlight significant social and political divisions within the country on key policy matters, drawing thousands of participants to voice their opposing views.</p>

          <p>The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's talk show by ABC is being framed by some analysts as a key event in a wider political crackdown on dissent by the current administration. This perspective, discussed on "Washington Week With The Atlantic," suggests the move is not an isolated incident but part of a pattern of using events like the assassination of Charlie Kirk to silence critical voices. Panelists noted that the pressure from figures like the FCC chairman signals a change in the "rules for engagement" for media. The analysis posits a deliberate effort to control public narrative and delegitimize opposition.</p>

          <p>The release of the new, ultra-thin iPhone Air is emblematic of a broader, uninspired trend toward minimalism in technology, design, and culture, argues a Guardian opinion piece. The author critiques this "spartan and unobtrusive" aesthetic, comparing it to the blandness of modern restaurants and interior design, which contrasts sharply with the bold, colorful designs of the past like the original iMac. This shift towards a cold, controlled minimalism is presented not as a sign of progress, but as a reflection of a world that feels chaotic and out of control. The article suggests this aesthetic robs objects and art of their character and context.</p>

Smith is documenting her experience on social media to show a different side of life in Japan, beyond the bustling image of Tokyo, and to empower others considering a similar move.

          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being leveraged by the Trump administration to escalate a campaign against its political opponents, according to this analysis. Critics warn that the tragedy is being used as a pretext to crack down on dissent, with officials threatening to label groups as domestic terrorists and blaming "leftwing radicals" without evidence. This response is seen by some political scientists as a classic authoritarian tactic: exploiting a violent event to consolidate power and suppress civil liberties. The article argues this creates a dangerous erosion of free speech and democratic norms under the guise of preventing violence.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for wartime or national emergencies, to address the country's asylum application backlog. Home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart stated this would allow for the rapid establishment of temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and a doubling of asylum caseworkers. The goal is to process claims more quickly, reduce the costly use of hotels for housing asylum seekers, and create a more humane system. The proposal is part of the party's focus on law and order at its annual conference.</p>

          <p>Following the killing of Charlie Kirk, elements of the Christian nationalist movement in the U.S. are portraying the right-wing activist as a martyr for their cause. This narrative, amplified by figures like pastor Sean Feucht and Kirk's own widow, casts his death as a pivotal moment in a "spiritual battle" against evil and leftism. The article traces Kirk's own evolution from a secular conservative to an embrace of Christian culture war rhetoric, mirroring the rise of a more aggressive, anti-democratic strain of Christian nationalism during the Trump era. His death is now being used to ignite and embolden this politically potent movement.</p>
