          <p>Tennis legend Serena Williams, through her firm Serena Ventures, has invested in the women's 3-on-3 basketball league, Unrivaled. She joins other prominent athletes like Alex Morgan and Billie Jean King in a Series B funding round that values the two-year-old league at $340 million. The league was established to provide WNBA players with a high-paying domestic option during their offseason, with its second season scheduled for January 2026. This move highlights a growing trend of high-profile investment in professional women's sports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has granted an interim request from the Trump administration, allowing for the removal of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Kelly Slaughter for the time being. This action pauses a lower court's order that had reinstated Slaughter, who argued her firing violated federal law limiting a president's removal power over FTC commissioners. The administration contends that the modern FTC wields significant executive authority, challenging a 1935 Supreme Court precedent. The case is part of a broader legal effort by the administration to assert more direct control over independent agencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the $83.3 million verdict in E. Jean Carroll's defamation lawsuit. The three-judge panel affirmed that the damages awarded were fair and reasonable, and found no grounds to reconsider Trump's claims of presidential immunity. The court ruled that Trump's lawyers were correctly barred from relitigating whether his denials of Carroll's sexual assault allegation were false, as a previous jury had already established that Carroll was truthful. Carroll's attorney celebrated the decision, expressing a desire for the appellate process to conclude so that justice can be served.</p>

          <p>A major immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery manufacturing facility in Georgia led to the arrest of 475 workers, including over 300 South Korean nationals. U.S. authorities stated the operation, part of an investigation into unlawful employment, was the largest single-site enforcement action in Department of Homeland Security history. The South Korean government has expressed concern and is arranging a charter flight to return its detained citizens. The raid highlights the Trump administration's intensified focus on worksite immigration enforcement, creating diplomatic and corporate tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida Republican Representative Randy Fine announced his intention to introduce legislation that would hold judges accountable when violent repeat offenders they release go on to commit new crimes. His proposal was prompted by a case in which a man with a lengthy criminal record, Decarlos Brown Jr., was charged with murder after being released without bail on a prior offense. Fine argued that judges are often disconnected from the public safety risks their decisions create. The idea gained endorsement from Elon Musk, who called the proposed accountability measures "sorely needed."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court for an emergency order to permit the withholding of over $4 billion in foreign aid previously allocated by Congress. A lower court had blocked the move, ruling the administration was obligated to spend the funds, and an appeals court upheld that decision. The administration argues the injunction infringes on the president's authority in foreign affairs and is using a rarely invoked legislative tool to cancel the funds. This legal battle is part of a broader effort by President Trump to reshape U.S. foreign assistance to align with his policy objectives.</p>

The initial injunction barred federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or occupation without reasonable suspicion. The Justice Department argued these restrictions severely hampered law enforcement, while dissenting justices warned the ruling could lead to unconstitutional seizures of anyone appearing to be Latino.

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune has announced that Republicans will move to change Senate rules this week to overcome Democratic obstruction and speed up the confirmation of President Trump's executive branch nominees. Democrats have blocked nearly all of Trump's picks, forcing time-consuming procedural votes for each one and leaving many government positions vacant. The proposed change would likely allow for voting on large groups of non-controversial nominees at once, a move that would bypass the current ability of a single senator to force delays. This action represents the latest escalation in the partisan conflict over presidential appointments.</p>

          <p>At just 22 years old, Carlos Alcaraz captured his sixth Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open, further cementing his status as a dominant force in men's tennis. His victory was notable for its all-surface versatility, having now won two majors on each of the hard, grass, and clay courts—a feat achieved by only a few legends. The article notes that Alcaraz is accumulating major titles at a faster rate than icons like Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic were at the same age. His performance in New York was particularly commanding, showcasing an improved and powerful serve.</p>

          <p>A moose, believed to have traveled from Poland through the Czech Republic, has become a local celebrity in northeastern Austria after weeks of roaming the area. The animal, nicknamed Emil, has garnered a significant online following and even inspired an oil painting. His journey has not been without incident, as he recently wandered onto the main railway tracks in the city of St. Pölten, causing a multi-hour shutdown of a major train line. Authorities and animal protection groups are urging the public to give the moose space and refrain from approaching or feeding him.</p>

          <p>Signs bearing the words "PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP" are appearing at infrastructure projects across the country that are funded by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, a signature achievement of the Biden administration. President Trump had vehemently opposed the legislation, calling it a "disgrace" and a "terrible Democrat Socialist Infrastructure Plan" at the time of its passage. This move to claim credit for the improvements is seen as a political tactic, repurposing a strategy used by the previous administration. Amtrak confirmed the signage is part of a voluntary initiative following the change in presidential administrations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals a significant ideological divide between American political parties, with Democrats now holding a more positive view of socialism than capitalism. According to the survey, 66% of Democrats view socialism favorably, compared to just 42% for capitalism, marking a persistent shift over the past 15 years. While U.S. adults overall still prefer capitalism, its popularity has declined since 2021, particularly among younger Democrats. The findings highlight a growing intra-party debate for Democrats on whether to embrace socialist ideas or maintain a more centrist appeal.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has postponed a pretrial hearing for former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who faces charges of crimes against humanity over his deadly anti-drug crackdown. The 80-year-old's lawyers argued he is not medically fit to stand trial, prompting judges to grant a delay to assess his condition. Duterte, the first former Asian president to be charged by the ICC, is accused of orchestrating a campaign of mass killings that resulted in thousands of deaths. The postponement has disappointed victims' families, who fear it may delay justice indefinitely.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that Chagas disease, a potentially fatal condition spread by the "kissing bug," may no longer be non-endemic in the U.S. The disease-carrying insect has been reported in 32 states, and locally acquired human cases have been confirmed in eight, most notably Texas. While traditionally found in the Americas, growing evidence of the parasite is challenging its classification in the United States. The CDC warns that low awareness and underreporting are significant issues, as the disease can cause severe heart and digestive problems if left untreated.</p>
