          <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar responded to Kamala Harris's loss to Donald Trump by urging the Democratic party to not rule out female candidates in 2028. Klobuchar referenced Angela Merkel as an example of a woman running a country well. The article also mentions Joe Biden's comments on Harris's loss, where he suggested sexism played a role. Klobuchar suggests that the party would have been better served by a primary election, and that the focus should be on helping the American people, not looking backwards.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how President Trump is allegedly attempting to use the IRS for political purposes, similar to Richard Nixon's efforts decades ago. Trump has publicly suggested revoking the tax-exempt status of universities like Harvard, mirroring Nixon's anger at universities for Vietnam War protests. The article highlights laws passed after Watergate to prevent White House interference with the IRS and notes concerns that the Trump administration's actions are testing these protections. It also mentions that the IRS is facing staff cuts, potentially hindering its ability to enforce tax laws effectively.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion article argues that a thriving American Dream relies on strong public services like schools, hospitals, and fire departments, not just tax cuts and tariffs. The article contends that underfunding these institutions undermines the workforce and hinders manufacturing growth. It criticizes proposed federal budget cuts to K-12 education and student mental health services, advocating for reinvestment in public services to build a 21st-century workforce. The author uses their mother's experience as a NICU nurse to illustrate the importance of public servants in building communities and ensuring stability.</p>

The PKK began as a secessionist group but has recently sought greater rights for Kurds inside Turkey.
