          <p>A massive power outage struck Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France, disrupting daily life for millions. The cause remains unclear, but authorities have ruled out a cyberattack. Power has been partially restored, with major cities like Madrid and Barcelona showing improvement, but full restoration is still uncertain. The blackout led to disruptions in public transportation, including suspended subways and rail services, as well as flight delays and cancellations. Optimism is cautious as the investigation continues and full recovery is underway.</p>

          <p>The House passed the "Take It Down Act," a bipartisan bill making it a federal crime to post real and fake sexually explicit imagery online without consent. The legislation, supported by First Lady Melania Trump, requires social media companies to remove such content within 48 hours of a victim's request, including AI-generated deepfakes. While digital rights groups express concerns about potential suppression of lawful speech, the bill aims to provide recourse for victims of cyber abuse and prevent suicides linked to online shame, with major platforms like Meta and TikTok supporting the measure.</p>

          <p>Canada held a significant election influenced by U.S. President Trump's annexation threats and tariffs, alongside domestic issues like affordability and immigration. Voters chose between Liberal Leader Mark Carney and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, with Trump's interventions and their potential impact on Canadian sovereignty and the economy being key concerns. Trump repeated his idea of making Canada the 51st U.S. state, while Poilievre urged him to stay out of Canadian elections, emphasizing Canada's independence. The election outcome will determine the country's approach to dealing with the U.S. under Trump's administration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its efforts to crack down on immigration by targeting sanctuary cities and states. The president plans to sign executive orders to empower law enforcement and publish a list of jurisdictions that obstruct federal immigration laws. This move aims to penalize cities that limit cooperation with immigration agents, though previous attempts to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities have faced legal challenges. The administration's focus on immigration enforcement is a key part of Trump's agenda as he approaches his 100th day in office.</p>

The study focused on tumors with a "mismatch repair defect," a genetic problem that makes cells more responsive to immunotherapy. While promising, the study was conducted at a single hospital and requires further research to determine long-term effectiveness and applicability to broader patient populations.</p>

          <p>Mexico and the United States have reached an agreement regarding water sharing from the Rio Grande basin, following threats of tariffs and sanctions from President Trump. Mexico has committed to immediately transfer more water to Texas farmers and increase the U.S. share of the flow in six of Mexico's Rio Grande tributaries. Both countries affirmed the 1944 treaty regulating water sharing remains beneficial and does not require renegotiation. The agreement aims to address concerns about Mexico's ability to meet its water delivery obligations.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is experiencing a mass exodus of attorneys following a shift in priorities under the Trump administration. Newly confirmed official Harmeet Dhillon stated that the division's focus would move away from voting rights and policing to culture war issues. In response, over 100 attorneys have resigned. The department has recently taken actions such as pursuing legal action against states with transgender athlete policies and withdrawing from a lawsuit against Georgia's voting laws.</p>

Journalist Scott Pelley suggested Paramount is scrutinizing content, including stories about the Trump administration, to protect its standing with the administration amid a proposed merger with Skydance Media. President Trump has previously criticized CBS and is suing CBS and Paramount over a campaign interview with Kamala Harris, raising concerns about editorial independence and freedom of the press.</p>
