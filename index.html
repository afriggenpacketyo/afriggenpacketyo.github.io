          <p>One person was killed and several others wounded during a shooting Saturday night at Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, approximately 45 miles northwest of Boston. Authorities quickly detained a person of interest, though no formal arrest or charges have been filed as the investigation remains active. Initial reports of two armed suspects were revised to a single shooter after reviewing surveillance footage, with police assuring the public there is no further danger. A wedding guest at the club recounted hiding under a table and witnessing someone hit the bleeding suspect with a chair before they fled into the kitchen, highlighting the terrifying experience.</p>

          <p>Lifestyle icon Martha Stewart, at 84, revealed on the "Today" show that her viral "thirst trap" photos have led to a significant influx of flirtatious direct messages from hopeful suitors. Despite receiving numerous propositions, Stewart confirmed she remains single, finding happiness and fulfillment through her wide circle of friends. She embraced her sensual image after a spontaneous poolside selfie went viral in 2020 when she was 78, later making history as the oldest Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model at 81. Stewart prefers focusing on "good living" and enjoying life's experiences rather than dwelling on her age.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data from the Environmental Protection Agency indicates that over 200 U.S. drinking water systems, impacting more than 172 million people, are contaminated with PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals." These pervasive chemicals, found in countless products, do not naturally degrade and accumulate in the human body, linking to severe health risks such as immune system suppression, increased cancer risk, and decreased fertility. While the EPA set limits in 2024, deadlines for some PFAS, including GenX prevalent in North Carolina, have been extended or limits reduced. Utilities are actively exploring costly filtration systems and pursuing lawsuits against PFAS polluters to recover treatment expenses.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Detect Active Lunar Landslides Triggered by Moonquakes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 00:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese research team has made a significant discovery, identifying 41 new landslides on the moon that have formed since 2009, directly attributing their occurrence to moonquakes. Published in the peer-reviewed National Science Review, these findings challenge the long-held conventional geological wisdom that the moon's internal activity had essentially ceased. The analysis, based on comparing 562 pairs of before-and-after images of 74 unstable lunar sites, is critically important for future human endeavors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a series of bills in Los Angeles aimed at significantly curbing federal immigration enforcement operations within the state. The centerpiece, the "No Secret Police Act," bans federal and local law enforcement, including ICE, from wearing face coverings while on duty and mandates clear identification. This legislative package directly responds to concerns about "secret police" and a recent Supreme Court ruling allowing immigration stops based on appearance. Other bills protect children at schools and individuals in non-public hospital areas from enforcement without judicial warrants, though federal officials assert the state lacks jurisdiction over their operations.</p>

Although the Ottawa event proceeded as planned, the decision to cancel the U.S. shows was made out of an abundance of caution for the safety of both the artist and his band.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent decision to lower its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point, to 4.00%-4.25%, unexpectedly led to a rise in long-term bond yields, including those affecting mortgage costs. Bond traders reportedly "sold the news," perceiving the Fed's easing monetary policy as potentially overlooking inflation, which remains above the 2% target. This increase in longer-term yields has implications for various big-ticket purchases and credit card expenses, with mortgage rates climbing after reaching a three-year low.

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandezsantana, has been arrested and charged with multiple felonies following a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 TV station in Sacramento. At least three bullets were fired into the station's lobby window, though fortunately, no one inside the occupied building was injured. The incident occurred just one day after protesters demonstrated outside the station over the indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show by ABC. While police are actively investigating the motive, they have not yet confirmed any direct connection between the shooting and the protest. The station has implemented increased security measures.</p>

          <p>The threat of flash flooding is projected to return and intensify across parts of the Southwest U.S., including southern California, Arizona, and western New Mexico, this weekend due to increased monsoonal moisture. This follows a period of deadly flooding in the region, which tragically claimed the life of a two-year-old swept away in floodwaters in Barstow, California. Concurrently, Tropical Storm Gabrielle in the central Atlantic is expected to strengthen into a hurricane, passing east of Bermuda. While it poses no direct threat to the U.S. mainland, it will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has boldly predicted a future by 2030 where artificial intelligence and robots will largely replace human jobs, leading to a society with "universal high income" and "sustainable abundance." He envisions a world where advanced automation ensures everyone has access to the best medical care, food, housing, and transportation. While Musk dismisses widespread anxieties about job displacement, critics raise significant questions regarding the economic feasibility and political will required to fund such a universal system, especially given current governmental financial challenges.

          <p>Violent clashes erupted in The Hague, Netherlands, on Saturday as police utilized tear gas and water cannons to disperse aggressive anti-immigration protesters. The unrest resulted in 30 arrests and injuries to two police officers, with a police car set ablaze and the office of the centrist D66 political party vandalized. Approximately 1,500 protesters blocked a major highway, advocating for stricter asylum policies ahead of a crucial general election. Caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing leader Geert Wilders both condemned the "shocking and bizarre images of shameless violence" and the attacks on law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A growing number of students across the UK are facing severe financial hardship, with their maintenance loans proving insufficient to cover basic living costs, forcing many into extensive part-time work alongside their studies. Research indicates that these loans fall significantly short of what is needed for a "minimum socially acceptable standard of living," leaving students like Tianna Hunkins working up to 30 hours a week and wearing uniforms to lectures. Others, such as Faith Webb, endure lengthy daily commutes to save on rent. Universities are observing a rise in requests for deadline extensions and are advocating for policy changes, including the reintroduction of maintenance grants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Creatine, a widely popular muscle-boosting supplement, is now being increasingly investigated for its potential cognitive benefits, particularly in alleviating "brain fog." While extensively researched for enhancing athletic performance, new studies are exploring its impact on short-term memory, mood, and focus, especially in women experiencing perimenopausal symptoms. Experts suggest that creatine may increase energy stores in the brain, potentially mitigating cognitive effects similar to sleep deprivation or dietary deficiencies. However, research in this area is still evolving, and dieticians caution about potential side effects and emphasize that it is not a "wonder drug" for all users.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has detailed the United Kingdom's intention to recognize a Palestinian state in September, coinciding with the UN General Assembly, contingent upon Israel meeting specific conditions. This marks a significant shift in British foreign policy, fulfilling a long-standing Labour manifesto promise, and comes amidst mounting pressure from his own MPs and international allies. While critics dismiss the move as "gesture politics" that might not impact the situation on the ground, government sources believe it can galvanize change. The decision, however, places the UK at odds with the US and has drawn strong criticism from Israeli officials.</p>

          <p>Heightened security measures are in place as prominent figures from the American right, including President Donald Trump, gather in Glendale, Arizona, for a memorial service for Charlie Kirk. The event, organized by Turning Point USA, is expected to draw over 100,000 attendees and features "TSA-level screening" following Kirk's shooting death two weeks prior. The memorial has intensified concerns about political violence and exacerbated deep divisions within the U.S., with the Trump administration attributing blame to the "radical left." Authorities are actively investigating the motive behind the shooting, which involved a suspect identified as having a "leftist ideology."</p>
