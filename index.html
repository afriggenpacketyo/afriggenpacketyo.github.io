          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained numerous undocumented immigrants attending scheduled check-in appointments at a federal building in Los Angeles, leading to widespread protests. Immigration lawyers reported that hundreds were detained, with some held overnight in basement rooms with limited access to necessities, causing concern over inhumane treatment, especially for families. ICE defended its actions, stating that those arrested had final removal orders and had not complied, while the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) criticized the previous administration's handling of illegal aliens. The arrests spurred large protests, and ICE recorded a significant increase in arrests compared to previous administrations, leading to accusations of exceeding planned capacity and raising questions about the legality of the makeshift detention center. The optimism score reflects the distress and controversy surrounding the detentions and protests.</p>

          <p>The New York Knicks are considering Jason Kidd as a potential head coach following their decision to part ways with Tom Thibodeau.

Thibodeau led the Knicks to their first Eastern Conference finals berth since 2000, and Kidd has prior coaching experience with the Nets, Bucks, and Lakers.

          <p>Israeli strikes in Gaza have resulted in numerous deaths amid the Eid al-Adha holiday, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation. Humanitarian groups, including UNICEF, report a severe increase in acute malnutrition among young children due to restricted aid access, with warnings of a "man-made nutritional crisis." Aid distribution is further complicated by military contractors and deadly incidents, leading to accusations that aid is being used as bait. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US and Israel-backed network, has halted operations following deadly incidents, raising concerns about civilian safety and the circumvention of established humanitarian systems.</p>

After some initial hesitation, Gizmo soared into the air and landed on a nearby tree, marking a significant milestone in its development. Both eaglets, born in March, have been preparing for this moment by practicing wing flapping and branch hopping, and they are expected to remain in the area for one to three months, returning to the nest periodically.

          <p>President Trump has stated that his relationship with Elon Musk is over after Musk publicly criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, a key domestic policy initiative. This follows weeks of escalating tensions between the two, with Musk expressing concerns that the bill would increase the national deficit and undermine government efficiency efforts. Trump expressed disappointment with Musk's behavior, while Musk accused Trump of being implicated in the Jeffrey Epstein case, leading to a social media feud. Trump threatened to cut Musk's government contracts, and Musk suggested he might support Democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Tanzania's recent crackdown on activists, including the alleged detention and torture of Kenyan and Ugandan activists supporting imprisoned opposition leader Tundu Lissu, is testing East African bonds. Kenyan economist James Shikwati suggests the Tanzanian government's actions stem from a fear of protests amid economic uncertainty and shrinking opportunities. Human rights activists, including Kenya's former justice minister Martha Karua, have been prevented from entering Tanzania, highlighting the country's intolerance of transnational activism. Despite the tensions, analysts do not expect major disruptions at the government level, as leaders are likely to maintain the status quo.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been returned to the U.S. to face federal criminal charges. The charges include conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia after being presented with an arrest warrant, while President Trump distanced himself from the decision. Abrego Garcia's attorney claims that the charges are preposterous and that the government violated due process by deporting him to a foreign prison.</p>

Doomscrolling, especially in the morning or before bed, can increase anxiety, blood pressure, and sedentary behavior, raising the risk of cardiometabolic conditions. It can also lead to neglecting heart-healthy habits like exercise, sleep, and stress regulation.
