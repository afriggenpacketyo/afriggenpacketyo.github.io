          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson, known as Soul Patts, and its affiliate Brickworks have announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger, causing their shares to surge. The new Sydney-listed company will acquire all outstanding shares of both entities, creating a merged entity with approximately $9 billion in value and holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers but criticized for suppressing shareholder value and transparency. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has responded to accusations from the Trump administration that it violated the Geneva trade agreement by claiming the U.S. is undermining the deal's terms. Trade tensions between the two countries have risen after a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart, He Lifeng, which had led to a 90-day suspension of most tariffs. China's commerce department spokesperson stated that U.S. export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals, as well as visa revocations for Chinese students, "seriously undermine" the Geneva agreement. The spokesperson vowed that Beijing would take measures to protect its interests if the U.S. continues actions that damage China's interests.</p>

FIFA will pay MLS teams large amounts (about $9.5m) to participate in the tournament, but the league has allegedly refused to allocate a fair percentage of those funds to the players themselves.

Gálvez advises that citizens should not fear being questioned upon returning from travel, but residents are subject to the discretion of an officer upon entering the country.

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado believes that dictator Nicolás Maduro will respond to U.S. restrictions on Chevron's operations in Venezuela with a new wave of internal repression. Machado, who is in hiding within Venezuela, stated that Maduro's regime is increasingly isolated internationally and faces an unsustainable economic crisis. She noted that Venezuela's economy is projected to contract, and the minimum wage is only $1.50 per month. Machado also claimed that the recent legislative elections were a monumental defeat for Maduro, with only 12% of the electorate voting, while stating that those previously allied with the regime have no ability to financially assist Maduro.</p>

          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, has expressed optimism about the future of AI and biotech, despite geopolitical tensions and the threat of technological decoupling between the U.S. and China. Diamandis emphasized that human biology, math, physics, and chemistry are conserved across the global population, meaning breakthroughs in one country benefit all. He contrasted this view with the current political climate in the U.S., where the Trump administration has sought to curb international student visas and cut scientific funding, raising concerns about the long-term impact on scientific discoveries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, according to a new report. Universities UK found that universities were reluctant to collaborate because of concerns around breaking business laws designed to promote healthy competition between them. Some universities are already delivering courses this way, to the benefit of students, and the Universities UK report said greater collaboration between universities could be a solution for institutions who are struggling to cut costs and become more efficient. A government review of how higher education will be funded in the long term is under way in England, and is expected to be published later this year.</p>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to put in measures to stop children in temporary accommodation going "missing" from schools and GPs after widespread displacement of families across the country. The charity's new report calls for a notification system so that all authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. More than 164,000 homeless children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England, the highest number on record, figures show. The government says it is investing £1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation.</p>

Despite a strong performance from Odyssey Sims, who scored a game-high 32 points, the Sparks were unable to secure the win, which coach Lynne Roberts attributed to the team's inconsistency due to a demanding schedule and lost practice time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is at the center of a political firestorm after he approved a law that gives the state the power to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation for owners. Ramaphosa's government says the law provides for compensation to be paid in the vast majority of cases – and the changes are needed to increase black ownership of land. According to South African law firm Werksmans Attorneys, productive agricultural land could not be expropriated without compensation, but for example, when an owner was not using the land and was holding it for "speculative purposes" EWC could take place. Trump has opposed the law, saying it discriminates against white farmers and their land was being "seized" – a charge the government denies.</p>

          <p>Senior officials at the US Department of Veterans Affairs have ordered VA physicians and scientists not to publish in medical journals or speak with the public without first seeking clearance from political appointees of Donald Trump. Veterans advocates say the decision fits into a pattern of censorship by the Trump administration, and came hours after the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine published a perspective co-authored by two pulmonologists who work for the VA in Texas. The article warned that canceled contracts, layoffs and a planned staff reduction of 80,000 employees in the nation’s largest integrated healthcare system jeopardizes the health of a million veterans who served in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

A BBC Scotland documentary aims to tell some of the less well-known stories about those who died on the flight, and about those they left behind. In the weeks that followed, members of the local community came together to wash, press and package up the belongings of those who had died on the plane. The Lockerbie laundry has become a symbol of the kindness shown by the people of the town.</p>

Williams was offered redundancy under a navy program, and the navy agreed to add time to his service record so that he received a military pension in addition to the state pension.

He suggests that the lack of stability is driving investors to other markets, despite strong performance from U.S. companies. Cramer points to specific examples such as Nvidia, retail stocks, and drug companies, where government actions and policy uncertainty have created downward pressure. He also highlights concerns about the administration's stance on trade, regulation, and energy policy, contributing to a sense of derision of business and uncertainty in the market.

The ruling party has chosen a candidate who repeatedly defended Yoon and his actions, turning the election into more of a referendum on martial law than anything else.
