          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has formed off the coast of South Carolina, prompting storm warnings for coastal regions of both North and South Carolina. The National Hurricane Center forecasts the storm will make landfall early Sunday, bringing heavy rainfall of up to six inches in some areas and the potential for significant flash flooding. While the storm is expected to weaken rapidly after moving inland, authorities have urged residents to prepare for its impact, including gusty winds and high rip currents, through Monday.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Chinese travelers, particularly recent university and high school graduates, are fueling a boom in the cruise ship industry. Analysts note that these travelers see cruises as an ideal social setting, offering a unique environment for groups to bond through shared activities and communal spaces. Entrepreneurs are capitalizing on this trend by organizing group cruise packages, which provide an alternative to traditional post-graduation trips like road trips or hiking, with prices varying based on the luxury level of the vessel.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has announced the launch of a new political party, named the 'America Party,' positioning it as an alternative to the established two-party system. The announcement, made on his social media platform X, follows a recent and public falling out with President Donald Trump. Musk, who is ineligible to run for president himself, stated the party's goal is to restore freedom, though it is currently unclear if it has been formally registered with election authorities or who will lead it.</p>

          <p>Monica Sementilli has been found guilty of murder and conspiracy in the 2017 killing of her husband, celebrity beauty executive Fabio Sementilli, and was sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors successfully argued she and her lover, Robert Baker, plotted the murder to collect on a life insurance policy, staging it as a break-in. Key evidence included thousands of texts, surveillance data, and a secretly recorded conversation, which overcame the defense's claim that Baker acted alone out of obsession and without Monica's involvement.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the catastrophic flash floods that killed at least 43 people, Texas officials are facing intense scrutiny over their preparedness and the timeliness of public warnings. While the National Weather Service issued escalating alerts, including a rare 'flash flood emergency,' some local officials insisted no one anticipated the flood's severity. Questions are being raised about the lack of a siren-based warning system and why summer camps along the river were not evacuated sooner, prompting defensive responses from local and federal leaders.</p>

          <p>The first complete photographs have surfaced of a new, large Chinese wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) vehicle, often called an ekranoplan. The aircraft, spotted on a pier in the Bohai Sea, features a flying-boat-style hull, a large v-tail, and wingtip floats, similar in scale to China's AG600 amphibious plane. WIGs are designed to fly efficiently at high speeds just above the water's surface, making them suitable for littoral logistics, search and rescue, and potentially military applications while staying below radar horizons.</p>

          <p>A hiker in the Peak District is raising awareness about the environmental damage caused by building stone stacks by filming himself kicking them over. The walker, Stuart Cox, argues that people are dismantling historic walls to create the stacks, which destroys the habitats of small creatures and can lead to trail erosion. The Peak District National Park Authority supports his view, stating the stacks are detrimental to the area's historic environment and natural landscape, a problem that has become more prevalent in recent years.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Young people seeking summer employment often face the challenge of needing experience to get experience, a cycle that can be frustrating. Career experts advise applicants to highlight transferable skills gained from volunteering, sports, or even home responsibilities, such as teamwork and communication. They also recommend keeping CVs simple, tailoring cover letters to the specific job, and not being afraid to speculatively drop off resumes at local businesses. Preparing for interviews and showing genuine interest in the company can also help candidates stand out.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that President Donald Trump is employing the 'Madman Theory' in his foreign policy, using his perceived unpredictability as a strategic tool to coerce allies and adversaries. This approach, which centralizes decision-making around his temperament, has yielded results, such as compelling NATO allies to significantly increase defense spending. However, critics question its long-term effectiveness, arguing it could erode trust, make the U.S. an unreliable negotiator, and potentially backfire by provoking adversaries like Iran to pursue nuclear weapons as the ultimate deterrent.</p>

          <p>The Lifetime ISA (LISA), a UK savings vehicle offering a 25% government bonus for first-home purchases or retirement, is a subject of debate among users. While some savers have successfully used it to fund a home deposit, others criticize its strict rules, particularly the £450,000 property price cap which has not been updated since 2017. Savers who exceed this limit or withdraw funds for other reasons face a penalty that erodes their original savings, leading to calls for reform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hundreds of runners participated in a 15-mile 'Run Against ICE' through Los Angeles to protest recent federal immigration raids that have impacted communities across the city. The event, organized by labor unions and advocacy groups, wound through neighborhoods significant to immigrants, including Koreatown, MacArthur Park, and Chinatown. Participants expressed outrage and defiance over the aggressive enforcement actions, which they view as targeting Latinos and creating a climate of fear, calling for an end to the detentions and deportations.</p>

          <p>A timeline of the devastating Texas floods reveals that escalating warnings were issued by the National Weather Service in the hours before the disaster. The Texas Division of Emergency Management activated resources on Wednesday, and alerts progressed from a flood watch on Thursday to a rare 'flash flood emergency' before dawn on Friday. Despite these warnings, the Guadalupe River surged unexpectedly, rising as much as 30 feet, leading to questions about whether local officials and camps could have acted sooner to evacuate the area.</p>

          <p>Recent cuts to scientific research funding by the Trump administration are impacting the future of HIV prevention and treatment in the United States. While a Trump-era initiative to eliminate HIV by 2030 remains, broader funding for vital research, including for an HIV vaccine and cure, has been slashed. Health experts worry that while current treatments will remain available, the reduction in prevention-focused research and activities will halt or even reverse the significant progress made in reducing new HIV infections, jeopardizing the goal of ending the epidemic.</p>
