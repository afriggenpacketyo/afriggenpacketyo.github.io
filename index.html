          <p>A high-ranking Chinese military official criticized the United States for allegedly destabilizing the Asia-Pacific region during the Shangri-La Dialogue, responding to claims made by the U.S. defense secretary. The U.S. defense secretary had accused China of regional aggression, particularly in the South China Sea, and warned of a potential military takeover of Taiwan. The Chinese official refuted these claims as fabricated and aimed at inciting confrontation, asserting that China opposes the use of the region's waters for hegemonic purposes. The exchange highlights the ongoing tensions and differing perspectives between the two nations regarding security and influence in the Asia-Pacific area.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its strategic focus on Latin America, capitalizing on perceived uncertainty in the United States' approach to the region.

Infrastructure development is expected to remain a key area of cooperation, serving as a means to counter U.S. influence. This outreach includes offering substantial credit lines to support development in Latin American and Caribbean nations, positioning China as a reliable partner amidst global trade tensions.

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center successfully removed a tumor from a woman's spine through her eye in a first-of-its-kind surgery. Karla Flores, 20, was initially diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, and a second tumor was discovered on her spine during an MRI. The surgical team, led by Dr. Mohamed Labib, developed a unique plan to access the spinal tumor through the side of Flores' eye, which they called the "third nostril" approach. The procedure took approximately 20 hours, and Flores is now cancer-free, though she is undergoing rehabilitative therapy.</p>

          <p>A Harvard-trained educator argues that children who learn to use AI effectively will become smarter adults, but warns against simply copying and pasting AI-generated answers. Instead, she advises teaching children to ask follow-up questions to understand how AI models arrive at their conclusions. She emphasizes that AI can be a valuable tool for learning if used as a coach rather than a crutch. The educator suggests schools should incorporate AI usage into their curricula to help students develop valuable skills.</p>

          <p>Tariffs imposed on goods imported from China are driving up prices for products in the Black hair industry, affecting both shoppers and stylists. Many essential items, such as synthetic braiding hair, human hair extensions, and styling tools, are imported from China and have become more expensive due to the tariffs. This is exacerbating financial pressures on Black women, who often spend significant amounts on hair care. Stylists are seeing fewer clients as prices rise, and some may have to raise their prices despite slowing business.</p>
