        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic growth slows and spending in China's major cities tightens, a new engine for consumption is emerging from the nation's smaller, lower-tier cities and counties. Residents in these areas are experiencing faster income growth and have lighter economic burdens, leading to increased purchasing power and a greater willingness to spend. This expanding middle class, with access to e-commerce, is driving a new wave of consumption, from electric vehicles to imported goods. Experts believe this untapped potential is crucial for China's shift towards a consumption-driven economic model, away from its traditional reliance on exports and investment.</p>

The company expects adjusted earnings of $2.11 per share on $6.7 billion in revenue, well below analysts' estimates. CEO Gary Dickerson highlighted that uncertainty is particularly affecting their business in China, and the company anticipates this decline to continue for several quarters. This outlook overshadows a third quarter that actually beat estimates, with the company's crucial semiconductor systems division reporting a 10% rise in sales from the previous year.

          <p>A new forensic analysis reveals that Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to the November 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, made multiple calls to his mother in the hours after the killings. According to Heather Barnhart of the digital forensics firm Cellebrite, Kohberger was on the phone with his mother when he drove back to the crime scene around 9 a.m. the next morning. The analysis also showed he had turned off his phone to hide his movements, which undermined his alibi of stargazing on a cloudy night. After failing to have the death penalty removed as a possibility, Kohberger accepted a plea deal and received four consecutive life sentences without parole.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. district judge has invalidated two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at educational institutions by threatening to withdraw federal funding. Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Department of Education violated procedural law with memos that ordered an end to all "race-based decision-making." The ruling sided with plaintiffs like the American Federation of Teachers, who argued the policy created a chilling effect on lawful speech and educational practices. While not ruling on the merits of DEI itself, the judge found the administration's actions initiated a "sea change" in regulation without proper procedure, causing widespread fear and chaos among educators.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama held a virtual meeting with Texas House Democrats who left the state to block a Republican-led effort to pass gerrymandered congressional maps. Obama praised their actions as a crucial part of the broader fight to protect fair elections and commended them for their stand against the GOP plan. He was joined by former Attorney General Eric Holder, who chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. The Texas Democrats stated that the former president's support shows they are not alone in their fight and that they will not be intimidated by what they call threats and surveillance from Texas Republicans.</p>

          <p>As he prepares for a summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Donald Trump stated his belief that the Russian leader is ready to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Trump suggested a high probability of success for the meeting and hinted at a subsequent trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy where they could potentially "divvy things up." The suggestion of land swaps has caused alarm in Kyiv, which is seeking a full ceasefire and security guarantees. European leaders, while relieved by Trump's recent focus on a durable truce, remain wary of his unpredictable diplomatic style ahead of the high-stakes talks.</p>

          <p>A significant force of federal Border Patrol agents conducted an operation outside a Los Angeles museum where Governor Gavin Newsom was announcing a plan to counter Republican redistricting efforts. The agents, led by a sector chief, arrived in tactical gear and detained at least one person in what Mayor Karen Bass later called a "provocative act" and an attempt to intimidate. The incident occurred amid heightened tensions over recent immigration raids in the area, which critics argue violate court orders against racial profiling. A Department of Homeland Security official denied the operation was related to Newsom's event, stating that patrols are conducted daily to make the city safer.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program marks its 90th anniversary, concerns are growing over its long-term financial stability, with its trust funds facing a significant shortfall. Projections indicate that by 2033, the program may only be able to pay about 77% of scheduled retirement benefits unless Congress intervenes. This has spurred several bipartisan proposals aimed at shoring up its finances, including one plan to create a new $1.5 trillion investment fund and another to increase taxes on high earners. A recent poll shows that a vast majority of Americans believe reforming Social Security should be a top priority for lawmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged two men in connection with a massive Ponzi scheme that allegedly defrauded investors, including many military veterans, of over $200 million. Ryan Wear, the operator of Water Station Management, is accused of selling investors water vending machines that often did not exist and using new investor funds to pay returns to earlier ones. A second man, former fund manager Jordan Chirico, is charged with investing client money into the fraudulent company while concealing his personal financial stake in it. Both men face civil charges from the SEC and could receive up to 20 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials and allies are reportedly appalled by what they view as naive and inept diplomacy from the Trump administration ahead of the Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin. They feel let down by the U.S., which they believe is rewarding the Russian leader with a return to the world stage without securing meaningful concessions. Critics, including a former British spy chief, argue that Trump's team lacks expertise and is being easily manipulated by Putin. Ukrainians fear that any deal reached will be on Russia's terms and will ultimately undermine their country's sovereignty and existence as a democratic nation.</p>

          <p>A multinational effort to airdrop food aid into Gaza is underway, but the method is proving to be a costly and chaotic solution to a deepening humanitarian crisis. While soldiers meticulously prepare pallets of aid, the drops are a last resort, far less efficient than overland truck deliveries, which have been severely restricted by Israel's blockade. On the ground, desperate Gazans scramble for the supplies, with many, especially the elderly and weak, getting nothing in the ensuing chaos. Residents and aid groups describe the airdrops as a dangerous performance that fails to address the systematic starvation in the war-torn enclave.</p>

The attacks occurred after Peña lost his 2022 election and were aimed at the homes of four officials, including the state House speaker. Prosecutors argued that Peña showed no remorse and sought to incite political terror because he believed the election was rigged against him. Though no one was injured, the case highlights the alarming rise in threats and violence against public officials in recent years.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed a Mississippi law restricting minors' access to social media to temporarily remain in effect, but a key justice has signaled it may not survive a full legal review. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh stated that the law would likely violate the First Amendment rights of social media companies under existing precedents. He voted to let the law stand for now only because the plaintiffs, an internet trade group, had not sufficiently proven they would be irreparably harmed. This opinion suggests that while this specific challenge was denied on procedural grounds, the Court's conservative majority is not poised to broadly weaken free speech rights online.</p>

          <p>China has made significant early purchases of soybeans from Brazil for September and October, a period traditionally dominated by U.S. exporters. This strategic shift sidelines American farmers during their most lucrative selling season and highlights Beijing's increasing trade reliance on South America amid ongoing tensions with Washington. Traders report that China has already secured roughly half of its projected demand for those two months, with all volumes sourced from South America. The move is expected to keep downward pressure on global soybean prices, which are already near five-year lows.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C.'s police chief has issued a new order expanding the department's ability to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The change allows D.C. police to share information about individuals not in their custody and to transport federal agents and detainees, a shift from previous, more restrictive policies. This move comes as the Trump administration has taken direct federal control of the city's police force and deployed federal agents. The policy change raises new questions about D.C.'s status as a "sanctuary city," as local law still prohibits sharing information about people held in D.C. jails with immigration officials.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has announced plans to build over 3,000 new homes in a controversial settlement project in the occupied West Bank. He stated the construction in the E1 area, which would effectively sever the West Bank from East Jerusalem, is intended to "bury the idea of a Palestinian state." The project has been frozen for decades due to fierce international opposition, and this new push has drawn immediate condemnation from the U.S., UK, EU, and the UN. Critics, including Israeli NGO Peace Now, argue the move deepens the annexation and prevents any possibility of a two-state solution.</p>
