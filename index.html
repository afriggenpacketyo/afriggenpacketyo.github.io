          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, a convicted associate of Jeffrey Epstein, participated in a six-hour meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche at a federal courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. Her lawyer stated that she answered every question asked of her truthfully and honestly, though the substance of the discussion was not disclosed. The meeting occurs amid public and political pressure on the Trump administration to release more information from the Epstein investigation, and as the House Oversight Committee subpoenas Maxwell for a separate deposition.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at making it easier for local governments to remove homeless individuals from public streets and place them in treatment facilities. The order directs the Attorney General to challenge legal precedents that limit civil commitment and prioritizes federal grants for cities that enforce bans on urban camping and loitering. The administration states the goal is to restore public order and provide help for those with serious mental illness or addiction. This action follows previous pledges and executive orders by the president to clear homeless encampments, particularly in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 16:11:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump visited the Federal Reserve headquarters, escalating his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he has repeatedly criticized for not lowering interest rates. The visit was framed around scrutinizing the rising costs of the Fed's building renovation project, which Trump has called disgraceful and suggested could be grounds for firing Powell. The president has been demanding rate cuts to stimulate the economy and reduce federal debt payments, while Powell has maintained a cautious approach due to inflation concerns. This confrontation highlights the ongoing tension over the central bank's independence.</p>

The DOJ's recent conclusion that it found no "client list" has failed to satisfy many, leading some House Republicans to join Democrats in efforts to subpoena the files.

          <p>Chuck Mangione, the celebrated jazz flugelhorn player and composer, has died at the age of 84 at his home in Rochester, New York. Mangione rose to international fame with his 1977 hit "Feels So Good," which became one of the most successful jazz records ever produced. He won two Grammy Awards during his career, one for his album "Bellavia" and another for his work on the film "The Children of Sanchez." Known for his energetic and joyful performances, Mangione also gained a new generation of fans through his recurring role on the animated series "King of the Hill."</p>

          <p>A viral claim that the animated series "The Simpsons" predicted a recent kiss cam incident at a Coldplay concert is false. Social media posts have circulated a side-by-side image showing the real concert footage next to a cartoon scene, but the alleged screenshot from the show is not authentic. AI-detection platforms indicate the image is likely AI-generated or digitally manipulated, and a review of the cited episodes confirms no such scene exists. While the show has been coincidentally accurate about future events in the past, its creators attribute this to the sheer volume of jokes written over decades, not intentional prediction.</p>

          <p>Actress Molly Gordon, known for supporting roles in projects like "The Bear" and "Theater Camp," is stepping into her first film lead in "Oh, Hi!," a movie she also co-wrote and produced. Frustrated by a lack of opportunities for the types of complex roles she wanted to play, Gordon created her own. The film, described as a "rom-com gone wrong," features Gordon as a woman who takes her non-committal boyfriend hostage to convince him of their potential as a couple. This move places her among a cohort of young, multi-talented women who are actively shaping their own careers in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced the formation of a Justice Department "strike force" to investigate allegations that the Obama administration manufactured intelligence to suggest Russian interference in the 2016 election. The move follows the release of declassified documents by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, who claims a "treasonous conspiracy" was carried out against Donald Trump. The investigation is seen by some as a politically motivated effort by the Trump administration to distract from its own scandals and pursue retribution against political rivals. Any potential prosecution of a former president would face significant legal hurdles, including presidential immunity.</p>

          <p>The United States and Israel have withdrawn their negotiating teams from ceasefire talks in Doha, Qatar, with a US envoy accusing Hamas of not acting in good faith. US special envoy Steve Witkoff stated that Hamas's latest response showed a "lack of desire" to reach an agreement, prompting the US to consider alternative options for securing the release of hostages. An Israeli official indicated there was "no collapse" in the negotiations but that a return to talks would require finding a way to reduce the wide gaps that remain. The withdrawal comes amid a worsening hunger crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Shares of Honeywell fell despite the company reporting second-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates for revenue, organic sales, and earnings per share. The industrial conglomerate also raised its full-year guidance for these key metrics.

The company is proceeding with its plan to split into three separate entities, with the advanced materials business spinoff expected in the fourth quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article traces the fluctuating popularity of facial hair in American culture, from a symbol of sophistication in the 19th century to a sign of counter-culture in the 1960s. After Abraham Lincoln became the first bearded president, facial hair was common among leaders until it fell out of fashion for much of the 20th century, associated with a lack of professionalism. The 2010s saw a cringeworthy hipster revival, but today, beards and mustaches have become mainstream again, adopted by politicians seeking a more relatable image and young men as a trendy expression of masculinity. The author reflects on this revival through their own personal grooming cycle.</p>

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who met with King Charles after the signing, called it a blueprint for shared prosperity.

          <p>The new film "Oh, Hi!" is a romantic comedy that twists the genre by having its protagonist, Iris (Molly Gordon), take her non-committal boyfriend, Isaac (Logan Lerman), hostage in a bid to save their relationship. The movie uses its high-concept premise to explore modern dating anxieties and the trope of the emotionally unavailable "softboy." While the plot mechanics can be hard to believe, Gordon's nimble and likable comedic performance shines. The film ultimately serves as a critique of gender tropes and the difficulty of genuine communication, making it a pleasant if perilous date night movie.</p>

          <p>A popular hiking trail in New York's Adirondack Mountains has been closed for weeks due to a large bull moose that is lingering near the summit and refusing to leave. Wildlife officials from the Department of Environmental Conservation find the behavior highly unusual, as moose typically move to lower elevations in the summer. Researchers have monitored the 900-pound animal, which appears thinner than expected but shows no obvious signs of the parasites that can affect moose. While the moose has not been aggressive, the trail remains closed as a precaution while officials continue to observe it.</p>

His tenure was marked by vetoes of conservative priorities and a successful push for redrawn legislative maps that are more favorable to Democrats.

He also sought to rally employees by outlining a reimagined mission for the company in the age of AI, shifting from a "software factory to an intelligence engine." The cuts reflect a broader trend of belt-tightening across the tech sector, even as Microsoft's stock price reaches new highs.</p>

The Supreme Court's pause allows the tribal nations to prepare a full appeal and ensures North Dakota's current legislative map remains in place for now.

          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's past proposal to relocate Gaza's residents and develop the area into a "Riviera" has empowered Israeli far-right maximalists and obstructed a lasting peace deal. While the administration now publicly calls for a ceasefire and hostage release, its earlier rhetoric was taken by some in Israel's governing coalition as a warrant for ethnic cleansing and permanent occupation. The author contends that this contradiction undermines current diplomatic efforts. To achieve a stable resolution, the article concludes, the Trump administration must explicitly disown its previous proposal and make it clear that a two-state framework is the only viable path.</p>
