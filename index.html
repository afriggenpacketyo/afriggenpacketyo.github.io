          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 09:30:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a decade since its launch, Ethereum is experiencing a resurgence in institutional interest despite recent market struggles. Factors like U.S. crypto legislation on stablecoins, Circle's IPO, and a boom in corporate treasury adoption are bolstering its outlook. While it has faced challenges from competitors like Solana and a complex value proposition compared to Bitcoin, experts suggest Ethereum is now on an institutional adoption arc similar to Bitcoin's a few years ago. The network's core strength remains its high level of decentralization, which is crucial for managing large-scale assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the second consecutive year, San Jose, California, ranks as the most expensive metropolitan area in the U.S. to purchase a home, with a median price over $1.6 million. According to a SmartAsset report, California is home to five of the top ten priciest markets, driven by high-paying jobs and desirable lifestyles. Strong demand coupled with limited housing supply, due to factors like zoning restrictions and geographic limitations, continues to push prices higher in these areas. This trend is making homeownership increasingly unaffordable for many, widening the gap between renters and buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pro-Palestinian protest group Palestine Action has won a High Court ruling allowing it to legally challenge its ban by the UK government under terrorism laws. The ban was imposed after the group's direct-action protests, which included causing significant damage to defense firms linked to Israel. Lawyers for the group argue the proscription infringes on free speech, while the government maintains it targets serious criminality. The court found the ban might conflict with free speech rights, and internal documents revealed significant government debate over the decision's potential risks to social cohesion.</p>

Indian officials and experts express concern that China could weaponize water resources, noting Beijing's lack of transboundary water-sharing agreements.

          <p>For individuals struggling with significant debt, options like debt relief programs and bankruptcy offer potential solutions, but each has distinct drawbacks. Debt relief, including consolidation and settlement, can simplify payments and reduce balances but often involves fees and can take years, potentially harming credit. Bankruptcy, such as Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, provides a faster resolution but incurs legal costs and can remain on a credit report for up to a decade. Experts advise a realistic self-assessment of one's financial situation and long-term goals before choosing a path. (not investment advice)</p>

The period reflects the impact of President Trump's tariffs, which had caused a surge in imports in the first quarter.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An annual audit by India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has uncovered 51 safety violations at Air India, including seven of the most critical "Level 1" findings. While unrelated to a recent fatal crash, the report comes amid heightened scrutiny of the airline's safety standards. The audit flagged issues across multiple Indian airlines, but the findings at Air India are notable for a major carrier. The DGCA stated that a higher number of findings can be normal for large airlines but emphasized its commitment to ensuring compliance and enhancing safety across the industry.</p>

          <p>As a key deadline for new U.S. tariffs approaches, major American companies are publicly warning about the significant financial impact. Firms like Stanley Black & Decker, Conagra Brands, and Tesla have projected that the import taxes will increase their costs by hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The warnings span various industries, from tools and food products to automobiles and appliances, with many businesses now having to absorb these costs or pass them on to consumers.

          <p>Adidas saw its shares drop after the sportswear company warned that U.S. tariffs will significantly impact its finances, potentially costing 200 million euros in the second half of the year.

CEO Bjørn Gulden expressed concern about the uncertainty created by the tariffs and their potential to dampen consumer demand if they trigger broader inflation. Despite the challenges, Adidas maintained its full-year guidance but noted it was subject to change based on macroeconomic risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed new documents reinforcing its request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. In the filings, the DOJ stated it has now notified nearly all victims mentioned in the records, addressing a concern previously raised by a federal judge. The department argues that there is significant public interest in its investigation into Epstein and Maxwell's crimes. The move follows public pressure on the Trump administration to release more information about the high-profile cases after initially declining to do so.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming meeting, despite sustained pressure from President Donald Trump to implement cuts. Fed officials have indicated that economic instability, partly fueled by the administration's tariffs and rising inflation, makes a rate change too risky. The Fed aims to balance its dual mandate of low unemployment and stable prices, a task complicated by current conditions. The situation highlights the tension between the central bank's traditional independence and the White House's aggressive public campaign to influence monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Russia's Far East, experts have clarified the science behind the resulting tsunami. Oceanographers explain that the quake occurred on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the movement of tectonic plates can displace the seabed, generating a tsunami. Scientists noted that while powerful, this event was significantly less energetic than the quakes that caused the devastating tsunamis in Japan in 2011 and Indonesia in 2004. They emphasize that tsunamis are more like ocean floods than simple waves, as the entire column of ocean water is lifted, posing a serious risk of coastal flooding.</p>
