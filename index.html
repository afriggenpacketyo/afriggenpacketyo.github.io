          <h2>Russell Brand Appears in Court to Face Sexual Assault Allegations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russell Brand appeared in a London court to face multiple charges of sexual assault, including two counts of sexual assault. This initial hearing was a procedural step in what is expected to be a lengthy legal process. Brand is accused of offenses that allegedly occurred between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. He has denied all charges, stating that his relationships have always been consensual, and has expressed his intention to defend himself in court. The next hearing, where Brand will be expected to enter a plea, is expected in about a month, with the actual trial potentially beginning a year from now due to backlogs in the British judicial system.</p>

          <p>A black woodpecker, a vulnerable species, has been sighted on Japan's main island of Honshu for the first time in four years. The sighting was confirmed from a photograph taken in 2021 on Mt. Moriyoshi in Akita Prefecture. While relatively common on Hokkaido, the black woodpecker is at increasing risk of extinction on Honshu, and the Environment Ministry emphasizes the importance of gathering up-to-date information on sightings. Experts believe there may be a female bird in the area as black woodpeckers raise their chicks together, which could help the species recover in the area.</p>

          <p>Roche has made a significant move into the competitive obesity drug market by partnering with Zealand Pharma in a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a next-generation weight loss candidate. This amylin analog, which mimics a hormone that increases satiety, could potentially offer superior tolerability and lean muscle preservation compared to existing GLP-1 drugs. The deal includes upfront payments to Zealand and milestone payments based on clinical trial success and sales. Both companies emphasized the strong scientific and cultural fit as key reasons for the collaboration, with the aim of providing customizable weight loss therapies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party achieved a notable victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, narrowly defeating the Labour Party. This win, coupled with gains in mayoral and local council elections, suggests a rising influence for Reform in British politics. The victory in Runcorn was particularly significant as it flipped a traditionally safe Labour seat, fueled by voter frustration with the economy and tensions over immigration. While Labour retained mayoralties in North Tyneside, the West of England and Doncaster, Reform performed strongly, securing second place in all three races.</p>

          <p>An activist ship, The Conscience, planning to deliver aid to Gaza, was reportedly struck by drones in international waters off the coast of Malta. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, the NGO operating the ship, accused Israel of being behind the attack, which occurred early Friday morning. The attack allegedly targeted the generator, causing a fire and leaving the ship without power. Maltese authorities confirmed a fire onboard but reported no casualties, with 12 crew and four activists on board, though the NGO stated 30 activists were present.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at cutting public funding for NPR and PBS, accusing the news outlets of presenting a biased portrayal of current events. Both NPR and PBS receive taxpayer funds through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), but rely heavily on private donations. The CPB budget has already been approved by Congress through 2027, raising questions about the scope of Trumpâ€™s order.

          <p>Romania is holding a rerun of its presidential election after the original vote was annulled due to illegal campaign financing. The frontrunner is George Simion, a right-wing extremist with a history of violence and suspected ties to Russian interests. Simion's rise reflects widespread frustration with Romania's simulated democracy, dominated by clientelistic political cliques. His main rival, Crin Antonescu, represents the status quo of post-Communist Romanian politics. The election is critical for Romania, the most populous country in southeast Europe, given its proximity to the war in Ukraine and frequent Russian provocations.</p>

          <p>Thrombosis, the formation of blood clots in blood vessels, poses a silent danger even for top athletes, as highlighted by cases involving basketball star Victor Wembanyama and tennis icon Serena Williams. Sports physician Pascal Bauer emphasizes that athletes are not immune to the condition, which can range from mild shortness of breath to death if a clot detaches and causes a pulmonary embolism. Certain sports involving repetitive arm movements or contact increase the risk, as does frequent long-distance travel. Preventive measures include sports examinations, good training hygiene, adequate hydration, and movement during travel.</p>

While some experts downplay the severity of the issue, citing the prevalence of national systems like Germany's Girocard, others highlight the increasing use of app-based payments led by American tech firms.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has reported that global press freedoms are at an "all-time low," particularly noting a deterioration under US President Donald Trump. The organization's annual ranking report indicates that more than half of the world's population lives in countries with a 'very serious' situation for press freedom. RSF highlighted the US's decline in rankings due to Trump's administration weaponizing institutions and cutting support for independent media. Europe remains the region where journalists enjoy the most freedom, while China, North Korea, and Eritrea are at the bottom of the list.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer is working to manage a cyber attack that has forced the retailer to temporarily shut down its online operations. The company has paused orders on its website and apps since Friday, and is working to restore normal business as quickly as possible. The cyber attack has significantly impacted the retailer, as online transactions account for about a third of its clothing and home sales. Other retailers, including the Co-op and Harrods, have also been targeted by cyber attacks recently.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ended the 'de minimis' tariff loophole, which allowed low-value goods to be shipped into the US without paying import fees. This policy change, effective Friday, will subject parcels worth less than $800 to increased levies, impacting retailers like Shein and Temu. The White House accuses sellers in China of deceptive shipping practices and argues the loophole has allowed illicit drugs to enter the country unchecked. China's government and trade associations say the pain will be felt by American consumers, with increased costs and a degraded shopping experience.</p>

Temu has been actively recruiting US sellers to join the platform. The shift comes amid speculation that Temu may phase out China-based merchants, requiring them to establish operations in the US or stop selling to American shoppers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans it deems criminals. Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. ruled that the White House's use of the statute was illegal, rejecting the attempt to apply the 18th-century wartime law to modern-day immigration policy. The judge found that the act's language, like "invasion" and "predatory incursion," referred to attacks by military forces and did not align with Trump's claims about the activities of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The ruling applies only to Venezuelan immigrants in the Southern District of Texas but could influence other similar cases.</p>
