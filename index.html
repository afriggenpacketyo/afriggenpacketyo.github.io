          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Apple must ease restrictions on its App Store and stop collecting commissions on some app sales, marking a victory for Epic Games in a long-running antitrust case. The judge, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, criticized Apple for thwarting a previous ruling and accused executives of lying, ordering the company to no longer take commissions from sales outside the App Store. Apple intends to appeal the decision, which could significantly impact the app economy by increasing revenue for developers and reducing fees for Apple.

          <p>President Donald Trump has requested more time to address the US economy, which has contracted for the first time in three years, raising concerns about a potential recession.

The US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a significant downturn from the previous quarter's growth of 2.4%.
