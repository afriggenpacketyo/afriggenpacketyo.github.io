          <p>Andy Byron, the CEO of data company Astronomer, has resigned following a viral incident at a Coldplay concert. Byron, who is married, was shown on the venue's "kiss cam" in an intimate moment with the company's head of human resources, leading to a public outcry and an internal investigation. The company's board accepted his resignation and announced a search for a new chief executive, stating that its leaders are expected to meet high standards of conduct. This event occurred just months after Astronomer secured a significant $93 million investment round.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler won his first Open Championship with a commanding four-shot victory at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. The world's top-ranked golfer maintained his 54-hole lead, finishing with a final round of 68 for a total of 17 under par. This marks Scheffler's tenth conversion from a final-round lead and his second major championship win of the year, adding to his PGA Championship title. Harris English finished in second place, while Chris Gotterup secured a remarkable third-place finish after only qualifying for the tournament the previous week. Scheffler's consistent and dominant performance drew comparisons to the peak of Tiger Woods' career.</p>

          <p>Corey Adams, an 18-year-old freshman defensive lineman for the University of Mississippi, was shot and killed in Cordova, Tennessee. The Shelby County Sheriff's Department confirmed he died at the scene of the incident, where four other men also sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Adams was a highly-regarded athlete from Edna Karr High School in New Orleans and had enrolled early at Ole Miss to begin his collegiate career. The university and his former high school expressed profound grief, remembering him as a promising young man whose life was tragically cut short.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has announced she is referring former American officials for prosecution, accusing them of a "treasonist conspiracy" related to the 2016 assessment of Russian election interference. Rep. Jim Himes, ranking member on the Intelligence Committee, called the move a "dangerous lie" with no legal basis, pointing out that multiple bipartisan and special counsel investigations have validated the original findings. Himes distinguished between Russia's well-established influence operations and the separate, unproven claim of hacking voting machines. He challenged the administration to see if the Department of Justice actually brings charges, predicting it will not.</p>

          <p>Following a tragic coach crash in Somerset, four individuals—two children and two adults—remain in the hospital. The incident occurred when a coach carrying pupils from Minehead Middle School went off the road and down a 20-foot slope, resulting in the death of a 10-year-old boy. The school was closed on Friday as the community mourned and left tributes, with the head teacher describing the event as horrific. Local fundraisers have collected over £40,000 to support those affected by the crash, and the school is scheduled to reopen on Monday.</p>

Lutnick expressed confidence that key partners, including the European Union, will reach agreements to open their markets to American goods or face increased tariffs. He noted that a baseline 10% tariff would likely remain on smaller countries, while larger economies would face higher rates if no deal is struck. Lutnick also defended the administration's strategy against concerns of rising consumer prices, arguing it will boost American manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reports that at least 67 people were killed after Israeli forces opened fire on crowds awaiting UN aid trucks in the northern part of the territory. The UN World Food Programme confirmed its convoy encountered large crowds that came under gunfire. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated its troops fired warning shots to disperse an "immediate threat" and disputed the reported death toll. This incident is part of a growing number of deadly events involving civilians seeking food aid amid warnings of extreme hunger and famine-like conditions across Gaza.</p>

          <p>UK Environment Secretary Steve Reed has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges from water companies in half by 2030. This announcement follows new data showing that serious pollution incidents in England rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high, sparking public outrage. Reed stated that people are "furious" with the state of the water sector and that the regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing." The government's plan is part of a broader effort that includes a record £104 billion investment in water infrastructure over five years, which will be funded by increased consumer bills.</p>

          <p>Cheshire Police have initiated an underwater search for a missing 38-year-old woman, Rachel Booth, who disappeared early Saturday morning.

Authorities believe she may have traveled towards Oakmere, near Delamere Forest, and are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare. A nearby outdoor activity center, Wild Shore Delamere, has temporarily closed its lake to assist with the police investigation as search efforts intensify in the area.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance is reportedly planning to spend a family holiday in the United Kingdom, with time in both London and the Cotswolds. The trip comes despite Vance's previous critical remarks about the UK and other European governments, including a claim that London was "not English any more." In a February speech, he also inaccurately criticized the Scottish government's policies on safe access zones around abortion clinics. The visit occurs as tourist travel from the UK to the US has reportedly declined amid the Trump administration's policies and rhetoric.</p>

          <p>While companies often cite restructuring or optimization for recent layoffs, employment experts suspect that artificial intelligence is a larger, unstated factor. Firms like IBM and Klarna have been transparent about replacing roles with AI, but many others may be using vague terminology to avoid public backlash. Experts note that roles in customer service, content, and HR are being eliminated as AI tools become more capable, aligning with large-scale AI adoption. This strategic silence helps manage optics, though some warn that companies may be overestimating AI's current capabilities and will need to quietly rehire or outsource to fill the gaps.</p>

This marks a shift from the traditional Democratic approach, with Newsom's office using terms like "fascist cuck" to describe a White House official and mocking other Republican figures. Advisors state the change was prompted by the federal deployment of troops to Los Angeles for immigration sweeps, signaling that cooperation was no longer possible.

Singh gained international fame after taking up running at age 89, completing nine full marathons and becoming the oldest person to finish one at age 100. His death has put a spotlight on India's notoriously dangerous roads, where over 150,000 people are killed annually. Police have arrested a 26-year-old man for the incident, but experts argue that poor road engineering and a lack of pedestrian infrastructure are major contributing factors to the high death toll.</p>
