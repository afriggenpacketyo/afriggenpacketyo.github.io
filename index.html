          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly called for a comprehensive investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations of sexual abuse. In a BBC interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, asserted that everyone, regardless of their status, must be held accountable under the law. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without admitting liability. The family expressed that the Prince's loss of royal duties was insufficient and urged for a thorough legal process to address the claims.</p>

          <p>Romania has confirmed that a Russian drone violated its airspace, making it the second NATO member, after Poland, to report such an incident. The Romanian defense ministry stated that its F-16 jets were monitoring Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure when they tracked the drone near the border before it disappeared from radar. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the incursion as a deliberate expansion of the conflict by Russia. The event has heightened security concerns along NATO's eastern flank, prompting increased readiness and allied preventative aviation operations in the region.</p>

          <h2>Impact of Social Media on Public Perception of Political Violence Examined After Kirk Assassination</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 08:00:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The immediate and widespread availability of high-definition footage of Charlie Kirk's assassination on social media marks a significant shift in how the public confronts political violence. This article contrasts the instant dissemination of clips from the Utah shooting with the decade-long delay before the public saw the Zapruder film of JFK's assassination. Historian Tevi Troy notes that gatekeepers no longer control what the public sees, leading to concerns about desensitization and the rapid, often partisan, framing of tragic events.

          <h2>Concerns Grow Over Increasing Right-Wing Influence in U.S. Mainstream Media</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent developments in the U.S. media landscape suggest a growing influence of right-wing perspectives, raising concerns about press freedom. CBS News's parent company, Paramount, now controlled by Trump ally Larry Ellison's family, appointed a conservative think tank head as its ombudsman and is reportedly considering acquiring CNN's parent company. This trend is also seen at Fox News, where a family settlement ensures its conservative direction, and at The Washington Post, which has hired an editor to champion free-market views. These moves are seen by critics as a potential capitulation to right-wing political pressure, reshaping major journalistic institutions.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought intense scrutiny to a recent state law permitting concealed firearms on college campuses. The legislation, which expanded on Utah's already permissive gun laws, had previously raised concerns among university staff. While the suspect's legal right to possess the rifle on campus is unclear, the timing of the incident has highlighted the broader debate over gun control. Experts note that while such laws may deter some crimes, they are often inadequate against politically motivated violence, prompting calls for more nuanced safety planning at public events.</p>

          <p>The 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) campaign, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is facing criticism for placing additional burdens on parents, particularly mothers. The movement's strict dietary guidelines, which condemn ingredients like seed oils and ultra-processed foods, create significant labor and financial stress for families striving to comply. Parents report spending more time and money shopping at multiple stores for approved foods, which are often more expensive and spoil faster. Critics argue that while the campaign's goals sound promising, it lacks practical support for families and fails to address systemic issues like food insecurity.</p>

Once a Heisman Trophy favorite, Manning has struggled this season, completing only 55% of his passes through three games. In Saturday's game, he went 11 for 25 for 114 yards, threw an interception, and had a streak of 10 consecutive incompletions. Acknowledging the criticism, Manning stated, "I’ve got to play better," as concerns grow about the team's prospects in the upcoming SEC schedule.</p>

After spending nearly four years in prison, Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were ultimately exonerated by an appeals court in 2011.

          <p>This "48 Hours" report examines the mysterious 2005 disappearance of George Smith from his honeymoon cruise, a case the FBI has since closed without resolution. Suspicion initially fell on his widow, Jennifer Hagel, before shifting to a group of young men last seen with him, who provided questionable alibis and later invoked their Fifth Amendment rights. The investigation uncovered a provocative video made by some of the men after Smith vanished and evidence of a bloodstain on a lifeboat canopy. Despite his family's persistent quest for answers, the case remains officially unsolved, leaving behind a legacy of unanswered questions about whether it was an accident or foul play.</p>

          <p>Amid declining popularity for Keir Starmer's Labour party in the UK, some progressives are looking to Zohran Mamdani's successful New York mayoral primary campaign for lessons.

Analysts suggest Labour could benefit by adopting a similar strategy: championing compelling, costed policies and crafting a clear, overarching narrative that picks a side.

Lord Mandelson was recently dismissed after emails revealed he sent supportive messages to Epstein in 2008.

However, after Trump publicly supported the use of established vaccines for diseases like measles and polio, Florida's health department clarified it would only propose removing mandates for immunizations not required for school entry.

These scams often target older adults with offers for home repair or inspections. To protect oneself, it is advised not to answer the door for strangers, never let them inside, and to research any company thoroughly before agreeing to services.

          <p>Sushila Karki, Nepal's new interim Prime Minister, has vowed to end corruption and restore stability after deadly protests ousted her predecessor. The demonstrations, largely driven by "Gen Z" youth, were sparked by a social media ban and escalated due to economic grievances, resulting in at least 72 deaths. Karki, a former chief justice, was named as the preferred leader by activists and has promised to hold elections within six months. She called for calm and cooperation, acknowledging that her appointment came "from the streets" and that she intends to fulfill the protesters' demands for good governance.</p>

          <h2>Families of Israeli Hostages Accuse Netanyahu of Obstructing Release Deal</h2>

          <p>The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being the primary obstacle to securing the release of hostages held by Hamas. The group claims that every time a potential deal has neared, Netanyahu has sabotaged it, citing last week's strike in Qatar as the latest example. Netanyahu defended the strike, stating that eliminating Hamas leaders is necessary to free the hostages. However, the families argue this is an excuse to prolong the war and maintain his grip on power, a delay they say has already cost the lives of 42 captives.</p>

After the fight, Crawford declared it a "signature win" and confidently stated he knew he would win when the contract was signed. Even in defeat, Álvarez praised Crawford's skill, admitting he "couldn’t figure out the style" and suggesting Crawford is a better fighter than Floyd Mayweather.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues against the deportation of immigrants with criminal records who have demonstrated significant rehabilitation. The author shares the personal story of Kelvin, the birth father of her adopted children, who transformed his life while incarcerated for armed robbery, only to be deported to El Salvador upon his release. Despite his rehabilitation and strong family ties, he was taken into custody by ICE and sent to a country where he now faces torture in a notorious prison. The author contends that such actions undermine the justice system's goal of rehabilitation and inflict needless cruelty on families.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China claim to have developed an artificial intelligence-driven anti-submarine warfare (ASW) system capable of reducing a submarine's chance of escape to just 5%. The system reportedly acts as an intelligent commander, integrating data from various sources like sonar buoys, underwater sensors, radar, and ocean conditions to create a real-time undersea battlefield picture. Instead of relying on traditional search patterns, the AI can dynamically predict a submarine's location and guide an attack. This development could represent a significant leap in naval warfare capabilities.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by university scholars warns that the Colorado River's reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are so depleted that another dry year could trigger a severe crisis. The researchers are calling on the Trump administration to impose immediate and significant water use cutbacks across the seven states that depend on the river. They argue that waiting for states to negotiate new rules for post-2026 shortages is too risky given the grim outlook. The report highlights the urgent need for action to prevent the reservoirs from falling to levels that could jeopardize water delivery and power generation for millions.</p>

Following up on an inmate's letter, Marx uncovered a deeply entrenched culture of violence and corruption under Sheriff Lee Baca, a supposed reformer. The investigation escalated after Baca's department attempted to obstruct justice by hiding an FBI informant and intimidating Marx at her home. The probe ultimately led to the conviction of 22 members of the Sheriff's Department, including Baca himself, exposing the failure of his leadership and the systemic problems within the nation's largest jail system.</p>

          <p>Oscar Eagle, who was sentenced to 25-years-to-life for a gang-related shooting in 1998, has been exonerated after a judge vacated his conviction. Eagle, who was 17 at the time, maintained his innocence, stating he was on crutches from a previous injury and at a hospital when the crime occurred. His case was plagued by ineffective legal counsel and his arrest by detectives from the LAPD's notoriously corrupt C.R.A.S.H. unit, central to the Rampart scandal. The L.A. County District Attorney's conviction review unit joined the motion for his release, marking a significant moment of justice after a quarter-century of wrongful imprisonment.</p>

          <p>A new wave of partisan redistricting is sweeping the nation as Republican-led states, prompted by President Trump, redraw congressional maps to secure their House majority. Missouri recently passed a plan aimed at unseating a Democratic representative, following a similar, more extensive effort in Texas. In response, Democratic states like California are pursuing their own gerrymandered maps to counteract the Republican advantage. This escalating race to redraw district lines outside of the usual decennial census cycle is fueling concerns about increased political polarization and the dilution of minority voting power.</p>

Born into a large, working-class family, she moved to New York in the 1920s, part of a wave of family-based migration that her son's administration has sought to curtail under the term "chain migration." The piece contrasts the poverty she left behind with the "rags to riches" life she built in America.
