          <p>Zhenhao Zou, a Chinese PhD student, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 24 years after being convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting three women in London and seven in China. The judge described Zou as a "very bright young man" who used a manipulative "charming mask" to hide that he was a "sexual predator", and that the victims had been "pieces in an elaborate game" for the defendant, who had "no understanding of the meaning of consent". Police believe there may be additional victims and are urging them to come forward, with 24 women having already contacted them since the trial. The investigation revealed Zou kept a trophy box of women's belongings and filmed nine of the sexual assaults as the victims lost consciousness.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on potential attack plans against Iran's Fordo nuclear site and believes disabling it is necessary due to the risk of weapon production, according to multiple sources. While he approved attack plans, a final decision is pending as he considers whether Tehran will abandon its nuclear program. Trump is aware of diplomatic efforts underway involving the UK, Germany, France, and the EU to negotiate with Iran, and has reviewed intelligence reports on Iran's potential to produce nuclear weapons. Iran has stated it will not negotiate under duress and will respond to any threat, having prepared missiles for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign.

          <p>Vanessa Hern√°ndez, known as Nezza, claims she has received death threats after singing a Spanish rendition of the U.S. national anthem at a Dodgers game. Nezza posted a video on TikTok of a team employee telling her, "We are going to do the song in English today," but she sang the Spanish version anyway in response to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) presence in Los Angeles. She stated that the lyrics were the same as the English version and that she is a proud American who wants better for her country, while also receiving support from celebrities in the Latin community. Nezza also stated she does "not feel welcome back" at Dodger Stadium.</p>

          <p>Strawberry Fanta, known as Fanta nam daeng or ‚ÄúFanta red water,‚Äù is a common offering at spirit houses in Los Angeles' Thai Town, reflecting a blend of animistic, Brahmanistic, and Buddhist beliefs. These small shrines are constructed outside Thai businesses and homes to honor spirits and provide them with a dwelling place, and the red soda has replaced blood offerings of the past. Some believe it's particularly favored by child ghosts like Kuman Thong, while others say any red drink will do, as the brand's longtime presence in Thailand has made it the most perennial offering. The practice underscores the deep spiritual connections found within the aisles of L.A.'s grocery stores.</p>

Bass, a former community organizer, has criticized the administration's characterization of Los Angeles as a war zone and emphasized the importance of immigrants to the city's identity. The raids have caused economic disruption and fear among immigrants, leading to quieter streets and concerns about evictions and budget deficits.

          <p>The Trump administration's renewed focus on workplace immigration enforcement could significantly impact industries and states that rely on undocumented workers, particularly in farming, hospitality, construction, and manufacturing. Industry leaders warn that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations and inflate food prices due to the difficulty of replacing these workers with domestic labor. Undocumented workers make up a significant portion of the workforce in states like California, Texas, Florida, and Nevada, and research suggests that deportation can lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers and a decline in U.S. GDP. While the White House argues that undocumented workers drive down wages, critics contend that enforcing immigration law will harm the workforce and the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Crews are working to clear the debris, but there is no estimated time for reopening, and a permanent fix involving steel rods and concrete is expected to take years.

Climate campaigners argue that new developments will barely reduce the UK's reliance on imported fossil fuels.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for keeping interest rates steady, claiming it is costing the United States billions of dollars.

The study, published in Communications Earth & Environment, analyzes the economic and ecological challenges of afforestation as a means of balancing CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuel reserves. Researchers found that such a project faces insurmountable land use and financial obstacles, costing around $10.8 trillion or roughly 11% of global GDP.

          <p>Donald Trump's immigration policies have left asylum seekers stranded at the US-Mexico border, disrupting their plans and forcing them to navigate dangerous conditions. The cancellation of CBP One appointments has impacted thousands of migrants, many of whom are fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries. Shelters along the border have seen dwindling numbers, and those seeking asylum face uncertainty and limited options. While some have given up on their American dream, others continue to hope for a chance to seek asylum in the US.</p>
