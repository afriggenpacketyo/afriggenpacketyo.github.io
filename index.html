          <p>Following U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, President Trump hinted at the possibility of regime change in Iran, while Israeli officials suggested the military action could spur an uprising against the current leadership. Israel has expanded its targets to include sites linked to the Iranian regime's domestic authority, such as the Evin Prison and the headquarters of the Basij paramilitary forces. In response, Iran launched missiles at Israel, disrupting electricity supply in some areas, and Iranian officials reiterated their right to defend their interests. Amid escalating tensions, Iran's Foreign Minister visited Russia to seek support, while the U.S. issued a travel alert for Americans abroad. </p>

          <p>After U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Russia is carefully considering its response to Iran's request for assistance, balancing its alliance with Iran against its desire to improve relations with the U.S. Russia has been providing Iran with military drones for use in the war in Ukraine. While Iran's Foreign Minister is in Moscow for consultations, Russia's options are limited, as it needs its own resources for its ongoing aggression in Ukraine. Russia has called for Iran and Israel to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the crisis, reflecting its cautious approach.</p>

          <p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi has called for a diplomatic solution and de-escalation of the conflict in Iran following recent Israeli and U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Grossi emphasized the need for IAEA inspectors to access the sites to assess the damage, particularly at the Fordo facility, which is built under a mountain. He noted that the IAEA does not have a full assessment of the underground damage, but expects it to be significant due to the nature of the attack and the sensitivity of centrifuges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump disputed Iranian attempts to downplay the impact of U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, asserting that "obliteration" was an accurate description of the damage. While U.S. military officials reported "severe damage and destruction" to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, they stopped short of claiming Iran's nuclear capabilities were completely obliterated. The U.S. Secretary of Defense noted that precision munitions struck intended targets with the desired effect, but a full assessment of Iran's remaining nuclear capabilities is still pending.</p>

          <p>China has called for de-escalation in the Iran crisis, citing the increasing risk of a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for oil transport.

The U.S. Secretary of State has urged China to dissuade Iran from closing the strait, warning of potential economic consequences.

          <p>Amid growing fears of conflict in the Middle East, shipping groups are increasingly avoiding the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil chokepoint. The number of vessels navigating the strait has declined following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, with some shipowners pausing transits due to the deteriorating security situation. Japan's Nippon Yusen has introduced a standby policy to limit time spent in the Persian Gulf, and insurance costs for ships traveling through the area are expected to rise. The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz could significantly impact global energy prices and supply chains.</p>

          <p>Recent studies suggest that while heavy drinking is undoubtedly harmful, the health effects of moderate alcohol consumption are more nuanced. Experts agree that excessive drinking poses significant risks, with negative consequences increasing exponentially beyond one or two drinks per sitting.

The focus should be on understanding and adhering to what constitutes moderate drinking to avoid dependency and carcinogenic risks.</p>

The proceeds from this Britannia Card would go to people on the lowest incomes, with the card renewable every 10 years at no additional cost. Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves criticized the plan as a tax cut for foreign billionaires, suggesting Reform would need to raise taxes or cut public services to compensate for the revenue loss.

          <p>China is calling on the international community to increase efforts to de-escalate the conflict between Iran and Israel, warning of potential damage to the global economy. The Strait of Hormuz, a critical shipping route, is at risk of being blocked, which could significantly raise oil and natural gas prices. Chinaâ€™s Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun emphasized the strategic importance of the Persian Gulf for global trade and energy. The U.S. Secretary of State has called on China to use its diplomatic leverage to persuade Iran against closing the strait. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers detained Paola Clouatre, the wife of a Marine Corps veteran, during a routine immigration appointment in New Orleans, despite her breastfeeding their 3-month-old daughter. Clouatre, a Mexican national, had been seeking a green card after marrying Adrian Clouatre, but ICE had issued a deportation order against her in 2018. Her husband has expressed frustration and concern, stating that they were trying to do the right thing, and he believes ICE officers should have more discretion over arrests in such cases. The couple has filed a motion to reopen the case, but the Department of Homeland Security maintains that Clouatre is in the country illegally.</p>

          <p>Iran's parliament has approved a measure to close the Strait of Hormuz after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, risking alienation of its neighbors and trade partners. Experts suggest that Iran has the most to lose from such a move, as it relies on the strait for its own oil exports and would antagonize key trading partners like China. The decision now rests with the country's national security council, but it has already raised concerns about higher energy prices and geopolitical tensions. Analysts believe that the possibility of closure remains minimal, as it would harm Iran's own interests and potentially provoke military intervention.</p>
