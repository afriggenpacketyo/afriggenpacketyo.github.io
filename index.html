          <p>A major fire involving 20 tonnes of tires and four factory units has prompted a significant emergency response in the West Midlands. Over 70 firefighters and 17 fire engines were dispatched to the scene on Great Bridge Street, between Tipton and West Bromwich. While no casualties have been reported, a thick plume of smoke is visible for miles, and several nearby homes were evacuated as a precautionary measure. A structural engineer is assessing the buildings due to concerns of partial collapse, and fire crews expect to remain on site for an extended period to manage the blaze.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a potential tariff escalation. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the agreement, the EU has reportedly committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making an additional $600 billion in investments. The announcement, made alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is presented as a significant step toward stabilizing the trade relationship between the two major economies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During discussions about the new EU trade deal, President Trump also addressed the humanitarian situation in Gaza, expressing frustration that a recent $60 million U.S. aid contribution went unacknowledged. He criticized European nations for not contributing and stated that while the U.S. would provide more aid, other countries must participate. The article notes that before the meeting with EU officials, Trump appeared to be in a bad mood, rating the chances of a deal at only 50/50. He also blamed Hamas for stealing food aid intended for civilians in Gaza, complicating the relief efforts.</p>

          <p>England's women's national football team has secured the Euro 2025 championship, defeating Spain in a tense final that was decided by a penalty shootout. After falling behind to a Spanish goal in the first half, England equalized with a header from Alessia Russo in the 57th minute. The match remained deadlocked through the rest of regulation and extra time, leading to penalties. Substitute Chloe Kelly, who also scored the winning goal in the 2022 final, once again proved decisive by converting the winning spot-kick, delivering another major international trophy for the Lionesses.</p>

          <p>The American Medical Association (AMA) has expressed deep concern over reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to overhaul the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This 40-year-old independent panel provides evidence-based recommendations on crucial preventive care, such as cancer and depression screenings, which insurers are then required to cover. The AMA's letter defends the non-partisan role of the task force in improving public health and urges the administration to retain its current members. The move follows criticism from conservative groups and a previous decision by Kennedy to remove all members of a CDC vaccine advisory panel.</p>

The event, called Monmouth Rising, was billed as a 45,000-capacity, hydrogen-powered festival featuring major acts like The Killers and Pulp. However, the article reveals that the entire plan was built on lies, with no bands booked, licenses secured, or legitimate investors involved. Employees and suppliers were duped with false promises and allegedly forged documents, leaving many unpaid. Kenny, described as a "fantasist," has a history of fraud and left a trail of failed ventures and unpaid debts.</p>

Having profited from anti-establishment theories for years, Trump now controls the state apparatus he once accused of cover-ups, yet he cannot produce the smoking-gun revelations his supporters expect. The author suggests that Trump's attempts to deflect by promoting other conspiracies appear desperate and only deepen public suspicion.

The author contends this action was enabled by a shift in U.S. foreign policy under the Trump administration, which has dismantled anti-kleptocracy initiatives and become tolerant of global corruption. By removing pressure for good governance, the U.S. has created a new global paradigm where leaders feel empowered to protect their allies from scrutiny.

In a letter to the Secretary of State, the senators expressed "grave" concerns, citing reports that over a thousand Palestinians have been killed trying to access food, many near GHF's distribution sites. The senators argue the GHF, which uses armed contractors and operates in military zones, blurs the line between aid and security operations. They are calling for the U.S. to resume support for established U.N. aid mechanisms to address the dire humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>A joint investigation by CBS News and The Marshall Project has uncovered alarming issues with routine drug testing of pregnant patients in U.S. hospitals. The report found that commonly used urine drug tests can have false-positive rates as high as 50 percent, leading to devastating consequences for expectant mothers. These errors can trigger child protective services investigations, potentially separating families based on flawed results. The investigation highlights a significant and controversial practice within the U.S. healthcare system that can inflict profound harm on innocent patients and their families.</p>

          <p>Megan Horneman, CIO of Verdence Capital Advisors, has warned that the stock market is overly optimistic and "pricing in perfection" as the August 1 trade deadline approaches. She expressed concern that investors are complacent about potential risks, including the outcome of tariff negotiations, uncertainty around Federal Reserve policy, and technically overbought conditions in growth stocks. Horneman suggests that if expected interest rate cuts do not materialize, the market could face a valuation correction. Despite short-term caution, she remains a long-term bull and views potential pullbacks as buying opportunities, particularly in international stocks. (not investment advice)</p>
