          <p>A 20-year-old Palestinian-American from Tampa, Florida, was reportedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. The family of Saifullah Musallet states he was protecting his family's land from settlers who were attempting to establish an outpost. According to his relatives, the attackers blocked paramedics from reaching him for hours, and he died before arriving at a hospital. The family is now demanding an immediate investigation by the U.S. State Department to hold the perpetrators accountable for the crime.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has publicly pushed back against criticism from the Trump administration regarding a $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters. After the Office of Management and Budget director attacked the project as an "ostentatious overhaul," the central bank published a new FAQ page on its website to address the accusations directly. The Fed's response clarifies details about the renovation, such as denying the construction of new VIP dining rooms and explaining cost increases, in a rare public defense against political pressure.</p>

          <p>According to sources, Attorney General Pam Bondi has terminated at least 20 Justice Department prosecutors and support staff who were involved with former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Donald Trump. The firings have reportedly included not just prosecutors but also support personnel and U.S. marshals identified by a departmental working group. This move follows earlier ousters of officials connected to the probes and has reportedly created a sense of unease among career employees at the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Police across the United Kingdom have arrested 71 people at demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The arrests, primarily for showing support for a banned group, occurred in London, Cardiff, and Manchester. The government banned Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act after its members vandalized aircraft at an RAF base, making support for the group a criminal offense. Critics, however, have argued that the proscription is an abuse of power.</p>

          <p>A satirical article in The Atlantic presents a fictional scenario where Dan Bongino, as the Deputy Director of the FBI, resigns from his post. In the parody, he absurdly claims that he must leave the bureau to get to the bottom of the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy. The piece humorously mocks the logic of conspiracy theorists by having the character suggest that the only way to find the truth is to be as far away from the actual evidence and government institutions as possible.</p>

          <p>The third Test match between England and India at Lord's is finely balanced after three days of play.

Key performances from Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer helped contain India, who were bolstered by a century from KL Rahul. The match is set for a tense conclusion, with the series currently level.</p>

The group has sent a letter to the Education Secretary arguing that the current guidance, which allows headteachers to set their own policies, is unlawful and fails to protect children. They are advocating for a statutory ban on smartphones to prevent issues like cyberbullying and exposure to harmful online content during school hours.</p>

          <p>The preliminary report into the Air India Flight 171 crash that killed 260 people has deepened the mystery surrounding the disaster. Investigators found that just seconds after takeoff, both of the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position, causing a total loss of engine power. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, and the other denying he had done so. This chilling discovery has left investigators trying to determine what led to the catastrophic action.</p>
