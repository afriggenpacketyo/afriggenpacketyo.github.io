          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth addressed the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, warning that China poses an "imminent" threat to Taiwan and is actively preparing for a potential military invasion by 2027. Hegseth urged Asian countries to increase their defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war, emphasizing that the US does not seek conflict but will defend its allies and interests in the region. In response, China accused the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace, citing US military activities in the South China Sea. Hegseth also cautioned against economic ties with China, stating that Beijing would use them as leverage for its "malign influence." The article conveys the tensions in the region and the US's commitment to deterring Chinese aggression. Optimism regarding regional stability seems subdued due to the explicit threat of conflict. </p>

          <p>Hamas has submitted its response to the latest US-brokered ceasefire proposal, reiterating demands for a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and guaranteed continuous humanitarian aid.

          <p>The BBC previews the UK's upcoming strategic defence review, noting the government's increasing focus on addressing a more alarming global picture, including conflict in Ukraine and China's threat to Taiwan. The review is expected to underline the importance of nuclear weapons and the UK's commitment to Nato, with an emphasis on modernizing the forces and greater public participation in protecting the country. However, some suggest the review may be overhyped and not result in major changes in capability. The article examines the challenges and political dilemmas surrounding defence spending in the UK.</p>
