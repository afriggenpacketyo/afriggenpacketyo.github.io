          <p>Starbucks is laying off approximately 900 non-retail employees and closing an undisclosed number of underperforming stores in North America. The move is part of a broader turnaround plan under CEO Brian Niccol, who was brought in to revitalize the brand's financial performance and customer experience. The company expects to end its fiscal year with a net reduction of 124 stores, a rare occurrence for the coffee giant, and will provide severance packages to affected staff.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's pullback on federal regulations, the fight to protect consumers from medical debt has shifted to state legislatures. While some states like Maine have successfully passed bipartisan measures to bar medical debt from credit reports, similar bills have failed in more conservative states due to industry opposition. Advocates are concerned about the growing problem, especially as millions are expected to lose insurance coverage, making state-level action increasingly critical for patient financial security.</p>

The suspect, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound and reportedly had ammunition engraved with anti-ICE messages, leading the FBI to investigate the incident as an act of targeted violence. In response, the acting ICE director has placed all facilities on higher alert amid rising threats and political rhetoric surrounding immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Keeneland September Yearling Sale achieved a record $531.7 million in sales, a surge attributed by breeders to tax incentives from President Trump's recent tax and spending bill. A key provision is the reinstatement of 100% "bonus depreciation," allowing buyers to write off the full purchase price of a racehorse in the first year. This significant tax advantage has made the speculative business of horse racing more attractive to investors, leading to highly competitive auctions and record-high prices for yearlings.

          <p>The taxi driver who transported the Southport attacker testified at a public inquiry that he deeply regrets not calling the police sooner after witnessing the start of the deadly incident. The driver, Gary Poland, explained that he heard loud bangs he believed were gunshots and saw children running in panic but drove away in fear and shock, waiting 50 minutes to contact authorities. Three children were killed in the attack, and the inquiry is examining the sequence of events, including the driver's actions and state of mind immediately following the drop-off.</p>

          <p>A car explosion has been reported in Tel Aviv, causing injuries, amid ongoing tensions in the region. In a related development, Spain announced it will send a naval ship to protect the Global Sumud Flotilla, which is attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza through Israel's naval blockade. This follows Italy's similar pledge after the flotilla reported being targeted by drones, and comes as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is set to address the UN General Assembly, where several Western nations recently recognized Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. harvest season begins, China's Ministry of Commerce has publicly urged Washington to cancel "unreasonable tariffs" to create conditions for resuming normal trade, particularly for soybeans. American farmers are growing concerned as China, historically their top customer, has not made its typical bulk purchases of the crop. The statement emphasizes that removing the tariffs would inject stability into bilateral trade and the global economy, linking the resumption of agricultural imports directly to a change in U.S. trade policy.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring financial support options for suppliers to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after a major cyber-attack forced the carmaker to suspend all production. The shutdown, which began in late August and will last until at least October, threatens the viability of smaller firms in the supply chain that rely heavily on JLR's business. Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans or a scheme to buy and stockpile component parts, an unprecedented move to mitigate the economic fallout of a cyber-attack on a major manufacturer.</p>

The author details how, in the aftermath, Republican politicians and the Trump administration have intensified anti-trans rhetoric and policy, from advancing discriminatory legislation to using the issue as leverage in budget negotiations. The piece argues that despite the shooter not being transgender, the community has been scapegoated, creating a climate of fear and prompting some to consider leaving the country for their safety.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates President Trump's budget would slash funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by 53%, eliminating 61 programs and leading to further layoffs. Public health leaders warn these cuts would devastate disease prevention efforts, fuel chronic illness, and compromise the nation's ability to respond to emergencies and global health threats. Programs targeting cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and emergency preparedness would be ended or severely reduced, which experts say could lead to a decline in U.S. life expectancy.</p>

The $2 trillion fund sold its stake in the U.S. company due to its equipment being used by Israel for the destruction of Palestinian property in Gaza and the West Bank, a move that troubled Washington. Norwegian officials have since clarified to their U.S. counterparts that the decision was made independently by the central bank's ethics watchdog, not the government, which appears to have settled the issue.</p>

While the central bank believes a recession can be avoided, it acknowledged that key sectors like the machinery and watchmaking industries will be heavily impacted by the levies.
