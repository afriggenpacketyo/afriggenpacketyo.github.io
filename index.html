          <p>Rachel Reeves, the UK chancellor, announced that the UK economy is showing signs of recovery, with a 0.7% growth in the first three months of the year, surpassing forecasts. This growth is attributed to increased consumer spending and business investment, marking a significant milestone for the Labour government's economic strategy. However, analysts caution that this growth rate may not be sustainable due to impending US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Despite challenges, Reeves remains optimistic, citing the UK as potentially the fastest-growing economy in the G7 for the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis reveals that fewer middle-class Americans can afford to buy a home due to rising prices and mortgage rates. Only about 1 in 5 listed homes are affordable for households earning $75,000 annually, down from half before the pandemic. The lack of affordable homes is driving up prices, shutting out many middle-income families. The article highlights areas with the worst affordability gaps and potential solutions, such as easing zoning regulations and increasing downpayment assistance programs.</p>
