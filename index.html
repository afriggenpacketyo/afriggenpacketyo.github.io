          <h2>Poll Reveals Widespread Discontent with Government Shutdown Among Americans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals widespread dissatisfaction across party lines concerning the ongoing government shutdown, with few Americans believing the stances of either Democrats or Republicans justify the disruption. President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans all received net-negative approval ratings for their handling of the situation, indicating a lack of confidence in leadership. Public concern is primarily focused on the shutdown's potential economic impact and the administration's perceived overemphasis on tariffs rather than lowering prices. This article underscores a general sentiment of political gridlock overshadowing critical national issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump has urged negotiators to "move fast" on a Gaza peace deal as crucial talks are set to commence in Cairo, two years after the initial Hamas attack. Hopes for a hostage release grew after Prime Minister Netanyahu indicated an announcement could come this week. While Hamas accepted some elements of the U.S.-led plan, key disagreements remain, particularly regarding Hamas disarming and relinquishing power. The article notes the ongoing Israeli bombardments, posing logistical hurdles for a swift resolution and hostage release.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has strengthened in the Pacific Ocean and is projected to continue intensifying next week, though its center is expected to remain offshore of Mexico's southwestern coast. Tropical storm watches are in effect for a significant stretch of the Mexican coastline, from Jalisco to Baja California. Forecasters anticipate heavy rain, potential flash flooding, and life-threatening surf conditions in affected areas.

          <p>The Israeli Foreign Ministry has vehemently denied Greta Thunberg's alleged claims of harsh treatment, including bedbugs and dehydration, during her detention after an aid flotilla interception. Correspondence from the Swedish Foreign Ministry reportedly detailed Thunberg's complaints, but Israeli officials labeled these as "brazen lies," asserting all detainees' legal rights were upheld. Court documents supported the official account, showing Thunberg requested deportation without formal mistreatment complaints. The article highlights the contrasting narratives surrounding the activist's experience and the broader political context of the flotilla.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a record high after the Liberal Democratic Party elected Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative, as its new leader, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. Takaichi is expected to advocate for continued accommodative monetary policy from the Bank of Japan, aligning with the government's "high-pressure economy" strategy. This article highlights investor optimism for economic expansion through public-private partnerships under a Takaichi administration. The yen, however, weakened against the dollar.

          <p>Kroger has voluntarily recalled two types of deli pasta salad bowls, "Basil Pesto Bowtie Salad" and "Smoked Mozzarella Penne Salad," due to potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination. This action follows an earlier FDA recall involving pasta ingredients from Nate's Fine Foods, the manufacturer. The contaminated products were sold across numerous Kroger Family of Stores in several states. The article warns that Listeria can cause serious, sometimes fatal, infections, particularly for vulnerable populations, and urges customers not to consume the recalled items.</p>
