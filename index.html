          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is reportedly planning to step down from his position, according to local media. The decision follows significant political setbacks for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which lost its majority in both houses of parliament. Having taken office less than a year ago, Ishiba's leadership has been challenged by poor results in recent snap elections, prompting calls for a new leadership race within the party. A formal announcement is expected at an upcoming press conference.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine to date, deploying over 820 drones and missiles in a single night. The attack targeted multiple regions, including the capital, Kyiv, where the main government cabinet building sustained damage to its roof and upper floors. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed at least two fatalities and urged the international community for more military assistance. In response to the barrage, NATO fighter jets in neighboring Poland were scrambled as a precautionary measure.</p>

The White House defended the operation as standard procedure, while the incident has raised concerns in Seoul about its potential impact on foreign investment and trade relations.</p>

O'Dell pleaded guilty to charges including arson and damage to religious property, admitting she was angry about churches. Surveillance footage that survived the fire captured her pouring gasoline on the building, which resulted in over $3.2 million in damages and caused an injury to a responding firefighter.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse is set to occur, creating a "Blood Moon" visible to sky-watchers across parts of the United Kingdom, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. The phenomenon happens when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow that gives the lunar surface a distinct reddish hue. In the UK, visibility will be best in eastern regions as the Moon rises, though the most dramatic reddening might be limited. Astronomers encourage the public to watch the event, which showcases the mechanics of the solar system.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, has been canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his technological skills, Acutis created a website to document Eucharistic miracles, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His relatively swift path to sainthood, which requires the Vatican to recognize two miracles attributed to him, is seen as an effort by the Church to connect with younger generations. His tomb in Assisi has become a major pilgrimage site, drawing nearly a million visitors last year.</p>

          <p>Anutin Charnvirakul has officially taken office as the new prime minister of Thailand following a royal endorsement from King Maha Vajiralongkorn. His appointment comes after the ousting of former Prime Minister Paetongtam Shinawatra, ending the Shinawatra dynasty's recent hold on power. Anutin secured the position with backing from the opposition People's Party on the condition that he dissolves parliament and calls for new elections within four months. The 58-year-old conservative politician previously served as health minister and was a key figure in Thailand's cannabis decriminalization.</p>

          <p>The US Open has evolved from a traditional grand slam tennis tournament into a major cultural event, increasingly resembling a festival like Coachella. The article argues the focus has shifted towards a "festival economy," characterized by high-priced themed cocktails, celebrity appearances, influencer marketing, and even a courtside dating show. This transformation, driven by the USTA, aims to capture the attention economy by turning the two-week event into a month-long, endlessly consumable brand. While this strategy has boosted attendance and revenue, it also highlights a growing divide between the luxury experience and the sport itself.</p>

Transport for London has offered a 3.4% pay rise but deemed the reduced work week unaffordable.

The ECB is anticipated to keep interest rates on hold, but President Christine Lagarde will likely face questions regarding market stability.

          <p>This opinion article argues that world leaders who attempt to appease Donald Trump, such as India's Narendra Modi and France's Emmanuel Macron, ultimately fail to gain lasting benefits. The author contends that resistance, not groveling, is a more effective strategy when dealing with the U.S. President, citing leaders like Brazil's Lula da Silva who have stood firm. The piece is highly critical of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's approach ahead of Trump's upcoming state visit, suggesting it positions Britain as a subservient "lackey state" for little tangible return and at a high reputational cost.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers from the U.S. and China has developed a novel propulsion method for millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The technique involves using a laser to rapidly heat light-absorbing material on a wet surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles violently collapse, they release a powerful force capable of launching the tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. By controlling the laser, scientists can direct the launch or even make the small devices "swim" in water.</p>
