          <p>A strike by French air traffic controllers has led to significant travel disruptions, with about 40% of flights canceled at all Paris airports. The strike, called by unions seeking better pay and working conditions amid inflation and staffing shortages, is impacting tens of thousands of passengers at the peak of the summer travel season. Despite some preventative cancellations requested by the national aviation authority, widespread delays are expected across all French airports.</p>

          <p>Zarah Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, has announced her resignation from the Labour Party to establish a new political party, potentially alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sultana, who has been sitting as an independent, cited the current government's positions on Gaza, welfare, and the cost of living as key motivations for her departure. The move underscores ideological divisions, with a Labour spokesperson defending the party's record on improving people's lives.</p>

          <p>A non-profit initiative called Project Chimney is scrambling to salvage and relocate chimneys from historically significant mid-century modern homes destroyed in a recent Pacific Palisades wildfire. The project, led by artist Evan Hall, views the surviving chimneys as powerful symbols of loss and aims to use them to create a community memorial. Facing a tight deadline from the Army Corps of Engineers, the team is working to preserve these architectural remnants before the sites are cleared.</p>

While Europe's factory activity shows some signs of a slow recovery, Brussels remains deeply concerned about its industrial base being undermined by an influx of cheap Chinese imports. Analysts suggest that Europe's strategic goal of rebuilding its manufacturing prowess is a critical and contentious factor in its relationship with Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the passage of the Republican budget bill, despite being widely unpopular and devastating for many Americans, highlights a deep perversity in U.S. politics. The author contends the legislation will make Americans sicker, poorer, and more fearful by cutting social services to fund tax breaks for billionaires and expand immigration enforcement. The article suggests that Republicans' willingness to pass the bill reveals their subservience to Donald Trump over their constituents' well-being.</p>
