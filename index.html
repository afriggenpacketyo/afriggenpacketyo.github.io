        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following two days of high-level discussions in London, the United States and China have reached an agreement on a trade framework, which now awaits approval from both President Trump and President Xi Jinping. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated the framework aims to implement the Geneva consensus, reached during a meeting in Switzerland in mid-May, which included a 90-day suspension of reciprocal tariffs. Jianwei Xu, a senior economist at Natixis, noted that while this framework signals a commitment to de-escalation and continued dialogue, the realization of concrete agreements remains uncertain. If both leaders approve the framework, it will be implemented, marking a potential step towards easing trade tensions between the two nations. Optimism surrounding the potential trade agreement is tempered by the need for both leaders to approve the framework. </p>

          <p>The White House is reportedly pleased with the administration's response to unrest over immigration raids in Los Angeles, viewing it as highlighting their focus on immigration and law and order. The administration's decision to federalize National Guard forces and dispatch Marines has broken with tradition, raising concerns among retired officers about the military's relationship with citizens. The White House believes the situation places Democrats in a difficult position, with one aide stating it's as if the 2024 election never ended. Critics argue the administration's actions risk triggering further violence and damaging the military's standing. </p>

          <p>An appellate court has ruled that President Trump's tariffs can remain in effect until at least the end of July, granting the administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that blocked them. The U.S. Court of International Trade had previously ruled that many of Trump's tariffs are illegal, including those on U.S. trading partners and on Canada, Mexico, and China. The appellate court scheduled oral arguments for July 31, ensuring the tariffs will remain in place unless further court action occurs. The trade war has faced criticism but Trump maintains the tariffs are necessary to address trade imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

Abrego Garcia faces charges of human smuggling, which his family denies, after being held in a Salvadoran supermax prison. Newman accuses the Trump administration of defying court orders and disparaging Abrego Garcia, while highlighting warnings from Salvadorians about the erosion of democratic institutions. </p>
