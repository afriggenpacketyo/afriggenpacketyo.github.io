          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 04:04:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States defense sector heavily relies on China for critical minerals essential to advanced weapon systems, creating a vulnerability as Beijing tightens export restrictions. China dominates the global supply of rare earth elements and other crucial minerals like gallium and germanium. Beijing has previously leveraged this dominance as a negotiating tactic in trade disputes and has imposed export controls on several minerals impacting American military end-users. These restrictions pose a growing risk to the Pentagon's military readiness and supply chain security. Optimism that the U.S. can quickly diversify its supply chain is low given China's entrenched position. </p>

The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, sustained burn injuries, with one in critical condition.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Donald Trump's promise to achieve peace in Ukraine within a day, progress has been slow, with Russia and Ukraine holding firm on territorial disputes. Trump has expressed frustration and hinted at withdrawing U.S. support if progress isn't made, a move that could shift the war's balance of power. While the U.S. has facilitated ceasefires related to infrastructure and Black Sea navigation, a comprehensive peace agreement remains elusive. Both sides have rejected proposals involving territorial concessions and NATO membership, and the conflict continues with significant casualties on both sides.</p>

          <p>Delegations from Russia and Ukraine met in Turkey for a second round of direct peace talks, but expectations for a breakthrough remain low. Recent comments from senior officials indicate that both countries remain far apart on key conditions for stopping the war, with fierce fighting continuing along the front line. A Ukrainian drone attack reportedly destroyed over 40 Russian planes, while Moscow launched missile and drone strikes on Ukraine. Despite the ongoing conflict, the talks represent a continued effort to find a diplomatic solution to the three-year war.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The initiative involves creating the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to redesign routes, many of which were established 70 years ago. The initial focus will be on modernizing the complex airspace around London. However, community groups have raised concerns about potential new flight paths affecting previously unaffected residential areas.</p>

          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's presidential election in a tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by President Trump. Nawrocki's win could complicate Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to advance his agenda, given the president's power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation. Nawrocki has also echoed some of Mr. Trump's language on Ukraine.</p>
