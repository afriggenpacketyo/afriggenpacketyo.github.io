        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced the broad outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first deal since the implementation of new tariffs. The agreement aims to increase market access for American exports and reduce non-tariff barriers. Specifics are still being finalized, but the deal includes keeping a 10% tariff on UK imports, adjusting tariffs on UK autos, creating a $5 billion export opportunity for U.S. farmers, and committing both countries to enhancing industrial and agricultural market access. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer highlighted the deal as an incredible platform for the future, while Trump indicated this could be a template for future trade deals.</p>

          <p>The Senate is scheduled to vote on the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. However, the bill's passage is uncertain after nine Democrats withdrew their support, citing concerns about anti-money laundering, foreign issuers, and national security. Led by Sen. Ruben Gallego, these Democrats called for stronger provisions to address these issues, casting doubt on the bill's ability to secure the 60 votes needed to advance to the Senate floor. The GENIUS Act seeks to regulate digital assets pegged to the value of other assets, like the U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>Constance Marten was cross-examined by her partner Mark Gordon during their retrial for the death of their baby, Victoria. Marten criticized her wealthy family, accusing them of prejudice and hiring private detectives to follow her. She described how "all hell broke loose" with her family when she became pregnant and mentioned an unnamed family member who she felt "doesn't want me alive." Marten denied intending to harm the baby, stating that Victoria was always a priority. Prosecutors allege Victoria died from hypothermia or was smothered while co-sleeping in a tent, while Marten claims the baby died after she fell asleep over her.</p>

          <p>The US and the UK have reached an agreement on tariffs for some goods traded between the two countries, reducing or removing tariffs on UK exports like cars, steel, and aluminum. While President Trump characterized it as a "major trade deal," it is not a free-trade agreement requiring congressional approval, but rather an agreement reversing or cutting some tariffs on specific goods. The deal cuts car tariffs to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, scraps tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and continues negotiations on pharmaceuticals and digital services. The UK government stated that this deal would strip back paperwork for British firms trying to export to the US.</p>

The market's recovery from a recent downturn has brought relief, though skepticism remains about the genuine conviction behind the positive outlooks. Concerns were also raised about the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency and the increasing interest in investing in Europe and other global markets.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is invoking the state secrets privilege in the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, an individual erroneously deported to El Salvador. This move is intended to avoid answering questions about the deportation. Ábrego García has been imprisoned in El Salvador for nearly two months, and the case has highlighted issues with Trump's immigration policies. Despite Trump's claim that he could have Ábrego García returned to the US, the administration has been reluctant to disclose efforts to facilitate his return. His lawyers have been conducting depositions of officials but remain "in the dark" regarding the government's actions.</p>

          <p>A Lords committee heard that home working has led to a greater decline in after-work drinking in city centers outside of London. In London, pub spending data indicates that post-work drinks have shifted from Friday to Thursday, but this trend is not observed in other large British cities, where bar spending is more likely to shift into the weekend. The data suggests that workers are returning to city centers for leisure on weekends rather than for after-work socializing. A decline in city-center spending has not been matched by a similar increase in high streets outside urban centers.</p>

          <p>A Michigan jury deadlocked in the murder trial of Christopher Schurr, a former police officer, who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya during a traffic stop. Judge Christina Mims declared a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict after four days of deliberation. Schurr testified that he feared for his life when he shot Lyoya, who had grabbed his stun gun. The case has heightened racial tensions and sparked protests amid a national debate over police misconduct. The prosecutor has not yet decided whether to retry the case.</p>

          <p>President Trump withdrew the nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., following mounting opposition. Martin, a controversial figure due to his defense of January 6th rioters and conservative political activism, failed to gain support from key Republican senators. Despite Trump's initial support, the lack of Senate backing and Martin's controversial past led to the decision to withdraw the nomination. The move potentially signals a limit to the Senate's willingness to accept Trump's more extreme nominees.</p>
