        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its critique of the Federal Reserve, with the president's budget chief accusing Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement. The accusation specifically targets a costly renovation of the central bank's headquarters, suggesting Powell may have misled Congress about the project's expenses. This public rebuke marks a significant escalation of political pressure on the independent financial institution. The conflict reflects ongoing tensions between the administration's economic agenda and the Fed's monetary policy decisions, raising concerns about the central bank's autonomy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Police in Belfast have decided not to assist in dismantling a large loyalist bonfire, citing that intervention poses a greater risk than letting it proceed as planned. The structure, built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations, has raised safety concerns due to its proximity to an electricity substation and the presence of asbestos. Despite a request from Belfast City Council, the PSNI concluded that the risks of removal, including potential public disorder, were higher. This decision highlights the deep-seated cultural and political tensions surrounding the annual commemoration of the Battle of the Boyne.</p>

          <p>Numerous Amazon warehouse workers, many of whom are Haitian immigrants, have lost their jobs after the Trump administration terminated humanitarian parole programs established under the previous administration. These programs had provided temporary legal status and work authorization to individuals from countries like Haiti, Cuba, and Venezuela. The terminations, occurring just before Amazon's Prime Day event, highlight the direct impact of shifting federal immigration policies on both immigrant families and major corporations that rely on their labor. Affected workers now face an uncertain future and a higher risk of deportation.</p>

          <p>Sweden's Migration Minister, Johan Forssell, has confirmed that his 16-year-old son was involved with far-right extremist groups, but stated he will not resign. Forssell explained he was unaware of his son's online activities until being notified by the security service a few weeks ago and has since handled the matter as a responsible parent. He reported that his son is deeply remorseful and has cut all ties with the groups. The revelation has sparked political debate, with opposition parties calling for a parliamentary hearing and accusing the government of double standards in countering extremism.</p>

          <p>At an annual recovery conference, European leaders have made a strong appeal to private businesses and equity firms to begin investing in the reconstruction of Ukraine immediately, even as the war with Russia continues. The call to action was accompanied by the announcement of a new equity fund and several public-private partnerships. This initiative aims to stimulate Ukraine's economy and infrastructure now, rather than waiting for the conflict to end. The push for private sector involvement comes amid growing uncertainties about the long-term commitment of international partners, particularly the U.S., to Kyiv's defense and recovery efforts.</p>

The capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and the country's flag closely resembles that of the U.S. The piece aims to provide context that may have been missing from the brief diplomatic exchange.</p>

Khalil was arrested and held in an ICE detention center in Louisiana for 104 days, an action his lawyers allege was retaliation for his prominent role in campus protests against the war in Gaza. The legal filing accuses the government of attempting to deport him over his political beliefs, despite his legal permanent resident status. A federal judge ordered his release, finding the government's case likely unconstitutional, though deportation proceedings continue on other grounds.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction, effectively blocking President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The judge certified a class action lawsuit that includes all children who would be affected by the order, which seeks to deny citizenship to babies born in the U.S. to parents who are not legal residents. The ruling challenges the administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause.

In a letter, Trump also cited an "unfair trade relationship," an assertion da Silva refuted by pointing to U.S. data showing a trade surplus with Brazil.

          <p>This article delves into the historical and cultural significance of the terms 'highbrow,' 'lowbrow,' and 'middlebrow,' using Virginia Woolf's unpublished 1932 letter as a focal point. Woolf fiercely defended the 'highbrow' as a pursuit of intellectual ideas, while viewing the 'lowbrow' as an honest reflection of life, saving her sharpest critique for the 'middlebrow'—a consumer of art she deemed dishonest and fashionable. The essay traces the evolution of these concepts from the early 20th century, a time of expanding mass media, to their modern-day applications for anything perceived as pedestrian. It reflects on the enduring debate over taste and cultural value.</p>

This debt relief strategy involves negotiating with creditors to settle a debt for a lump-sum payment that is less than the total amount owed. It may be a viable solution if you are paying more in interest than principal, are eligible for a significant balance reduction, or face a lengthy and costly repayment timeline. While this approach can negatively impact a credit score, it can also result in substantial long-term savings for those overwhelmed by high-interest debt.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' stock surged 11% after the carrier reinstated its 2025 profit outlook and projected a stronger summer travel season than anticipated. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while bookings had previously dropped, they have now stabilized, prompting an updated full-year earnings forecast of $5.25 to $6.25 per share. The positive news from Delta, the first major U.S. airline to report quarterly results, also lifted the shares of other carriers. The airline's performance was bolstered by strong sales of premium seats and its lucrative partnership with American Express, indicating resilience in higher-end travel demand.

          <p>In an unusual move, Bishop Alberto Rojas of San Bernardino, California, has formally excused his 1.5 million parishioners from their weekly obligation to attend Mass. The decision, typically reserved for events like a pandemic, was made due to the intense fear within immigrant communities following recent detentions by immigration officers on two separate parish properties. Bishop Rojas, himself an immigrant, stated he wanted to remove the burden from the faithful who are afraid to venture into public settings. The action underscores the profound impact of federal immigration enforcement tactics on local communities and their religious practices.</p>

          <p>Following a solid June sales report, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised that Costco is a stock to own, particularly as a hedge against inflation and potential tariff impacts. He argues the company's business model, which prioritizes keeping prices low for its members, makes it a resilient choice in a challenging retail environment. While the company's U.S. comparable sales growth was slightly below Wall Street estimates, overall performance remains strong, with factors like gold bar sales creating tough year-over-year comparisons. The analysis suggests Costco's value proposition for consumers will be a key strength moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly a year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, the Secret Service has suspended six agents without pay for their roles in the security failure. The suspensions, ranging from 10 to 42 days, are part of the agency's response to the incident where a gunman was able to fire on the then-presidential candidate, killing a firefighter. An agency official stated they would focus on fixing root deficiencies rather than mass firings. The disciplinary action follows multiple investigations that identified "preventable planning and operational failures" which allowed the attack to occur.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis of the potential earnings from depositing $20,000 into either a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account. While money market accounts offer check-writing features and high rates, those rates are variable. In contrast, CDs offer a fixed rate for a set term, providing guaranteed returns. Calculations show that for 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year terms, a CD currently offers slightly higher, guaranteed interest earnings than a money market account, assuming the latter's rate remains constant. The choice depends on the saver's need for liquidity versus guaranteed returns. (not investment advice)</p>

This includes practices like the castration of piglets, dehorning of cattle, and beak searing of hens. The law also requires labels to explain that foie gras is made by force-feeding birds. While falling short of an import ban sought by animal advocates, the regulation aims to increase transparency for consumers at the point of purchase. It represents a significant experiment in using labeling to inform the public about standard, often cruel, practices in industrial animal agriculture.</p>
