          <p>A Missouri judge has ordered an insurance company to pay Ryan Ferguson over $43 million after he was wrongfully convicted of murder in 2005 and incarcerated for nearly a decade. Ferguson's conviction was vacated in 2013 after a key witness recanted their testimony, leading prosecutors to drop the case. Ferguson then filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in 2014 and was initially awarded $11 million. The recent judgment addresses the insurer's refusal to fully compensate the officers involved, who experienced stress due to the insurer's denial to pay out, with the officers receiving a percentage of the award.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate reached 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, increasing pressure on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to raise interest rates. The figure, excluding fresh food costs, surpassed economists' expectations and exceeded April's 3.5% reading. Rice prices experienced a notable surge, increasing by 101.7% year-on-year, prompting the government to release emergency stockpiles. Despite the BOJ holding rates steady at 0.5% after a recent policy meeting, Governor Kazuo Ueda indicated that further rate hikes would occur once there is more certainty that underlying inflation approaches the 2% target.

          <p>Meta is reportedly hiring Daniel Gross, CEO of Ilya Sutskever's AI startup Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. This move follows Meta's failed attempt to acquire Safe Superintelligence, valued at $32 billion, after Sutskever rejected the offer. Gross and Friedman will be working on products under Alexandr Wang, with Meta acquiring a stake in their venture capital firm, NFDG.

          <p>According to a national security expert, a U.S. attack on Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant might not be effective, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs. The exact depth and protection of the facility, located deep inside a mountain, are not fully known, making it a difficult target. While an attack could cripple Iran's nuclear weapons capability, it would not eliminate it entirely, as Iran possesses the knowledge, experience, and materials to rebuild. The International Atomic Energy Agency recently stated that Iran had breached its non-proliferation agreements by illegally stockpiling enriched uranium.</p>

The states argued that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress.

          <p>New guidelines issued by ICE for members of Congress visiting detention centers are being challenged as illegal. Several Democratic members of Congress have been denied entry to immigrant detention facilities, prompting concerns about congressional oversight. Experts argue that denying access to facilities is a direct assault on the system of checks and balances. ICE's guidelines request a 72-hour notice from lawmakers, while a federal statute states that funds may not be used to prevent a member of Congress from entering a facility for oversight purposes.</p>
