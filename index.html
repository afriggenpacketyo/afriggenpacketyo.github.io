        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour government is encountering significant skepticism from the business community following a recent budget that implemented substantial increases in employers' National Insurance and the National Living Wage. This shift has eroded goodwill, despite earlier assurances from figures like Rachel Reeves that Labour would be the most pro-business government. Business leaders, including former Conservative backers, express shock at the negative impact on sectors employing numerous low-wage workers. While acknowledging the need to shore up public finances, critics argue certain aspects of the budget were unfairly harsh. The article also notes smaller businesses feel overlooked, contrasting with the government's focus on attracting large tech investments.</p>

          <p>Nuno Espirito Santo has been appointed as West Ham's new manager, with analysis suggesting his tactical approach aligns well with the club's current squad. His preference for low-possession, counter-attacking football, previously seen at Wolves and Nottingham Forest, is expected to minimize West Ham's defensive weaknesses and maximize strengths of players like Jarrod Bowen. The article highlights Nuno's adaptability and strong interpersonal skills, which are crucial for improving team morale after reports of player discord with the previous manager. This appointment signals a return to a more pragmatic style, aiming to leverage the team's transition-heavy attacking capabilities.</p>

          <p>China has scheduled a pivotal Politburo meeting to discuss the upcoming 15th five-year plan, which will outline the nation's strategic direction for 2026-2030. President Xi Jinping has previously stressed the importance of a forward-looking approach, considering the dynamic international environment. This high-level gathering, involving over 370 Central Committee members, is set to occur approximately one week before Xi's anticipated meeting with US President Donald Trump at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. The plan's final endorsement in March's legislative session will be instrumental in shaping China's future development and global standing.</p>

Plans include public events, the launch of a new Premiership Women's Rugby season with expanded media coverage, and significant investment in grassroots development through the "Impact 25" program. Despite past failures to capitalize on men's World Cup success, the Rugby Football Union has pre-loaded legacy efforts, leading to a 35% increase in age-grade girl players.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The foreign ministers of China and North Korea, Wang Yi and Choe Son Gui, have agreed to strengthen bilateral ties to resist "all forms of hegemonism," a thinly veiled reference to their joint pushback against the United States. China reaffirmed its "unswerving strategic policy" of developing relations with Pyongyang, while North Korea expressed willingness to cooperate in multilateral affairs to promote a "fairer and more just world order." Both nations view the US as an adversary, with Washington's protectionist trade policies straining ties with Beijing and its nuclear program concerns with Pyongyang. This agreement follows recent high-profile meetings, signaling reinforced unity.</p>

          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy has vocally condemned the "unacceptable and abusive behaviour" displayed by American fans at the recent Ryder Cup in New York, an event where his wife, Erica, was struck by a thrown drink. Despite Europe's eventual 15-13 victory, McIlroy detailed the hostile crowd's persistent abuse throughout the tournament, leading him to retort on occasion. He stressed that golf, as a sport, demands a higher standard of conduct and etiquette from its spectators, contrasting it with the unsportsmanlike actions witnessed. McIlroy has pledged to ensure that similar incidents will not be tolerated at the 2027 Ryder Cup in Ireland.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, has achieved a clear victory and a new parliamentary majority in elections marred by accusations of "massive Russian interference." Despite bomb scares at polling stations and alleged plots for unrest, PAS secured 50% of the vote, signaling Moldova's continued path towards EU integration. Opposition leaders, notably Igor Dodon, prematurely claimed victory and called for protests, which officials blamed on Moscow-backed criminal groups.

          <p>A critical commentary assesses Kamala Harris's new memoir, "107 Days," as unintentionally exposing a "formidable lack of self-awareness" within Harris and the Democratic establishment. The article argues the book portrays a politician focused on the "machinery of politics" and presentation, rather than substance or a distinct agenda, failing to meaningfully diverge from Joe Biden's policies. It suggests the campaign leaned heavily on celebrity and spectacle, disconnected from ordinary voters. The author contends that Harris's self-valorization and exculpation of failures underscore a broader delusion within the party, hindering its ability to mount a meaningful challenge to Trumpism.</p>

While not banning membership, the policy would require disclosure to superiors.

          <p>Goldman Sachs anticipates that China's central bank will likely ease its monetary policy in the fourth quarter, projecting a 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio. This expectation stems from a slowing economic momentum and increasing pressure on policymakers to bolster growth, especially as year-on-year growth approaches 4%. The People's Bank of China recently noted a subtle shift in its economic description, signaling a more cautious outlook. However, analysts caution that action is data-dependent, and no easing may occur if full-year growth meets the "around 5 percent" target. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend is driven by a softening demand for traditional retail and a shift towards service-based businesses that offer unique community experiences.

          <p>The Village of Broadview, Illinois, has initiated a criminal investigation after a CBS News Chicago reporter's truck was struck by a pepper ball fired by an ICE agent. Reporter Asal Rezaei was alone near an ICE detention facility, with no active protest, when the incident occurred, causing chemical agents to engulf her vehicle and leading to her vomiting. Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills condemned the "allegedly unprovoked attack" and expects full cooperation from the Department of Homeland Security. This event raises serious concerns about the safety of journalists and potential abuses of power by federal agents.</p>

Meanwhile, Hurricane Humberto remains a powerful Category 4 storm further east, generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast.

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally this year, fueled by advancements in artificial intelligence, efforts towards chip self-sufficiency, and policies to curb price wars. However, experts like Goldman Sachs and Nomura are questioning whether this momentum, largely driven by retail investors shifting bank deposits into equities, signifies a sustainable boom or is entering "bubble territory." The rally appears disconnected from underlying economic fundamentals, as China's economy showed signs of slowing in August with industrial output and retail sales falling short of expectations. Concerns linger that technology valuations may have "priced in very optimistic expectations." (not investment advice)</p>

Sony cited competing investment demands in entertainment and semiconductors as a key reason for the separation. Meanwhile, broader Japanese markets saw declines, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose, ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy meeting where interest rates are expected to hold steady.

The Trump administration, however, asserts its lawful authority to protect federal property and personnel following "months of violent riots."

          <p>This article offers guidance on identifying and managing "energy vampire" friends—individuals who tend to deplete one's emotional resources through constant complaining, self-focus, or a lack of genuine interest. Psychologist Suzy Reading and journalist Radhika Sanghani explain common signs, such as an excessive need for attention or subtle mood-chipping behaviors. They suggest three strategies: having an honest conversation about feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries if the friend is unwilling to change, and altering shared activities to reduce opportunities for dominance. The goal is to protect one's well-being while potentially maintaining the friendship.</p>
