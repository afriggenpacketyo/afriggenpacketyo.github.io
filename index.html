          <p>While the public rollout of OpenAI's GPT-5 was met with criticism for its user experience, the model is achieving significant traction in the more lucrative enterprise market. Companies like Cursor, Vercel, and Box report that GPT-5 is faster, cheaper, and more effective for complex tasks like coding and logical reasoning, challenging competitor Anthropic's dominance in this area. OpenAI has built a dedicated enterprise sales team to capitalize on this demand, even as it and Anthropic engage in a costly battle for market share, with both companies seeking substantial new funding to sustain their operations. This strategic pivot to business clients underscores where the long-term financial success for advanced AI models may truly lie.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama and former Attorney General Eric Holder held a virtual meeting with Texas House Democrats who left the state to prevent Republicans from passing a gerrymandered congressional map. Obama commended their efforts as part of a larger fight to protect fair elections, a sentiment echoed by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. The Texas Democrats, meeting from an undisclosed location due to what they described as threats, stated that the support from national figures proves the significance of their actions against what they call an extremist Republican agenda. Their potential return to Texas is contingent on the legislative session's adjournment and a counter-redistricting proposal in California.</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell significantly after the company issued a disappointing forecast for the upcoming quarter, citing macroeconomic and policy uncertainties. While third-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed estimates, the guidance for future earnings and revenue fell short of analysts' expectations, with particular concern noted for its business in China. The company's CEO, Gary Dickerson, highlighted that the current environment is creating lower visibility, a sentiment that reflects broader industry anxieties over issues like potential U.S. tariffs on imported chips. The cautious outlook overshadowed the company's otherwise solid quarterly performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former correctional officer, Gregory Rodriguez, has been sentenced to 224 years in prison for the sexual abuse of nine women at California's largest women's prison. The case exposed a systemic crisis of sexual misconduct, as Rodriguez targeted incarcerated women for nearly a decade, coercing them into sexual acts. Survivors testified about the lifelong trauma and the institutional failure to act on earlier reports, with one victim stating she was punished after reporting the abuse. The sentencing is a rare instance of a guard being held criminally accountable for such actions, occurring as the U.S. Department of Justice conducts a civil rights investigation into the facility.</p>

          <p>Four years after the U.S. withdrawal and the subsequent return of the Taliban to power, life for many in Afghanistan has significantly deteriorated, particularly for certain vulnerable groups. This grim anniversary serves as a backdrop to a contentious debate within the U.S. government. The Trump administration has asserted that conditions in the country have improved to a degree that it is now safe to repatriate Afghan nationals. However, this assessment is sharply contradicted by reports from the ground and analysis from international observers who point to a deepening crisis under Taliban rule, raising serious questions about the safety and human rights of those who would be returned.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, the fifth named storm of the Atlantic season, is strengthening in the eastern Atlantic and is forecast to become the season's first hurricane by Friday. The storm formed west of the Cabo Verde islands and is moving westward, with early models projecting it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands this weekend. Tropical storm watches have been issued for the northern Leeward Islands, including Anguilla, St. Martin, and Antigua and Barbuda. While Erin does not pose an immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain, and it has already caused deadly flooding in Cabo Verde.</p>

          <p>A regulatory filing has revealed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway purchased a new stake in the beleaguered health insurer UnitedHealth, acquiring over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. This move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing, as UnitedHealth's stock had fallen nearly 50% this year amid a public backlash over healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation. The disclosure caused UnitedHealth's stock to surge in after-hours trading. The investment could have been made by one of Buffett's lieutenants, but it signals confidence in the insurer, which has also attracted other notable investors like Michael Burry and David Tepper.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a former Republican candidate for the New Mexico legislature, has been sentenced to 80 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of Democratic officials. The attacks occurred after Peña lost his 2022 election bid and were aimed at officials who had certified the results, which he baselessly claimed were rigged. No one was injured in the shootings, but in one instance, bullets entered the bedroom of a state senator's young daughter. Prosecutors argued that Peña showed no remorse and sought to incite political terror, reflecting a nationwide surge in threats against public officials.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock value increased by 7% following a report that the Trump administration is considering taking a direct equity stake in the semiconductor company. The potential investment would aim to bolster domestic chip manufacturing and help fund Intel's new factory construction in Ohio, aligning with the administration's goal of bringing more high-tech production to the U.S. This move would represent another instance of the government becoming directly involved in key industries, following similar actions with companies like Nvidia and U.S. Steel. Intel, which has been working to expand its foundry business, declined to comment on the speculation but affirmed its commitment to advancing U.S. security interests.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts remaining exceptionally low, savers holding significant cash balances are missing out on substantial earnings. A high-yield savings account, however, can offer rates over 900% higher, making a significant difference for large deposits. For a sum of $50,000, an account with a 4.35% APY could generate over $2,100 in interest in one year. While these high rates are variable and likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark rate, savers can still capitalize on the current favorable environment by acting promptly to lock in a high-yield account.

          <p>In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh revealed a potential inconsistency in how the Supreme Court handles emergency requests on its "shadow docket." While allowing a restrictive Mississippi social media law to remain in effect for now, Kavanaugh applied a traditional legal standard requiring proof of "irreparable injury." However, as noted by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in other cases, this standard appears to have been ignored when President Donald Trump has sought emergency relief. This suggests a special set of rules may apply to the former president, allowing him to win shadow docket cases without meeting the same stringent requirements as other litigants.</p>

          <p>China has made significant early purchases of soybeans from Brazil for September and October, a move that sidelines U.S. exporters during what is typically their peak selling season. This shift highlights Beijing's increasing trade dependence on South America amid ongoing tensions with Washington. By locking in approximately 12 million tonnes from South American sources, China has effectively shortened the traditional window for U.S. soybean shipments. This decision, made while global soybean futures are near five-year lows, is expected to keep prices under pressure and underscores the geopolitical dynamics influencing global agricultural trade.

This change comes after the Trump administration placed the MPD under direct federal control and deployed federal agents, including from ICE and Border Patrol, into the city.

Despite a recent report showing higher-than-expected inflation pressures, Zervos advocated for a half-percentage-point cut, a position he has held for several months. He believes that current monetary policy is too restrictive and that easing it could prevent a labor market slowdown and create more jobs. Zervos joins a growing list of potential Fed chair successors and represents a more market-focused perspective, arguing for a proactive approach to monetary policy even amid political pressure.

The E1 project has been frozen for decades due to fierce international opposition, and this announcement has drawn immediate condemnation from the U.S., UK, EU, and UN.

Upcoming releases of unemployment and inflation data in early September, followed by the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on September 17, are seen as critical moments that could influence the direction of mortgage rates.

The Producer Price Index (PPI) showed a significant upside surprise, with a key measure of core inflation rising at its fastest pace since March 2022. This data provides the Federal Reserve with justification to be more cautious, potentially delaying or reducing the number of planned rate cuts. Analysts noted that the market, which had been pricing in multiple cuts this year, was given a "rude awakening," as the probability of a third cut in 2025 has now been pushed well into next year.
