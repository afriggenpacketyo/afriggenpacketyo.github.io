          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, has reportedly accepted a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. Prosecutors informed victims' families that Kohberger would plead guilty to all charges in exchange for four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of appeal. The deal has elicited mixed reactions from the families, with some expressing relief at avoiding a prolonged trial and others fury that the death penalty is off the table. A court hearing is scheduled to formalize the plea, which, if accepted, would conclude a case that has drawn intense national attention.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a significant challenge to his authority after being forced into a U-turn on welfare reform due to a large-scale rebellion from his own party's MPs. The chaotic episode, which saw the government change its position on Personal Independence Payment (Pip) eligibility multiple times, has drawn comparisons to the most fraught periods of recent Conservative governments. The incident has left Starmer's government appearing weakened and not in control, raising questions about his leadership, internal party discipline, and the potential for future tax rises to cover spending commitments.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants ahead of schedule. The judge ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reconsidering the TPS designation. The ruling states that the program will continue until its original expiration date in February, finding that the interests of the Haitian immigrants in remaining in the U.S. outweigh potential harm to the government. This decision is a significant, albeit temporary, victory for Haitian TPS holders amid ongoing instability in their home country.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price fell by 7% ahead of its Q2 delivery report, influenced by a renewed public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The dispute centers on the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk argues will worsen the national debt and harm the renewable energy sector by cutting EV tax credits. Trump retorted that Musk was upset about losing mandates and alluded to the significant government contracts and subsidies his companies receive. This political clash adds uncertainty for Tesla, as the bill could negatively impact its vehicle sales and energy division. (not investment advice)</p>

However, it has drawn sharp criticism, including from former ally Elon Musk, for potentially adding trillions to the national debt and for making deep cuts to social welfare programs like Medicaid.

          <p>Recent and unpredictable immigration raids in Southern California are creating a climate of fear that has led to the cancellation of several traditional Fourth of July celebrations. Organizers of major events, including the Grand Park block party in downtown Los Angeles and festivities in cities like Cudahy and Huntington Park, have postponed or canceled them due to concerns about potential mass detentions and protests. The atmosphere of insecurity is affecting community life and entertainment, as residents, particularly in predominantly Hispanic areas, fear leaving their homes for public gatherings amid the heightened enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing the financial strain of 153 clergy sexual abuse claims. Bishop Joseph V. Brennan stated that bankruptcy is the only way to handle the claims with compassion while allowing the diocese to continue its ministry. However, attorneys for the abuse survivors have condemned the move as a delay tactic designed to evade accountability and force victims into a lengthy, property-focused legal process instead of public trials. The claims stem from a California law that temporarily lifted the statute of limitations for civil sexual assault cases.</p>

The devices, which are not yet officially certified but permitted under martial law, have been distributed to thousands of front-line medics and hospitals.

          <p>Christian rock musician Sean Feucht has become a superstar in the MAGA movement, blending worship rallies with right-wing, Christian nationalist politics. He advocates for the fusion of church and state, holding events at state capitols and building connections with top Republicans, including Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson. Feucht is a key figure in the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement aiming for Christian influence over all spheres of society. Despite his growing influence, he faces allegations of financial malfeasance from former staffers, which he denies, casting them as persecution for his ministry's success.</p>

          <h2>New Legislation to Block Medicaid Funding for Abortion Clinics Represents Major Anti-Abortion Victory</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 18:23:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision within the new GOP spending bill would block abortion clinics like Planned Parenthood from receiving any Medicaid funds, even for non-abortion services such as cancer screenings and STI testing. Experts describe this as one of the most significant national restrictions on abortion access since the Hyde Amendment, predicting it could force many clinics to close or severely limit services across the country. This federal move represents a departure from the "leave it to the states" approach and would impact clinics in both red and blue states, potentially devastating providers who serve a large number of Medicaid patients.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Revoking Citizenship of NYC Mayoral Candidate Zohran Mamdani</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 18:21:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is considering whether to investigate revoking the U.S. citizenship of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for New York City mayor. The move follows a call from a Republican congressman who accused the Ugandan-born Mamdani of concealing support for terrorism during his naturalization process, a claim based on his pro-Palestinian activism. President Trump has also personally threatened to have Mamdani arrested. The situation has ignited a fierce political firestorm, with critics denouncing the threats as a racist and authoritarian attack on a political opponent who won his primary on a progressive platform.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 18:18:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The jury in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs has reached verdicts on four of the five counts against him but remains deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering. The jurors informed the judge they had reached a consensus on charges related to sex trafficking and prostitution involving two women but could not agree on the RICO charge. Deliberations on the racketeering count, which alleges Combs ran his Bad Boy Entertainment as a criminal enterprise, will resume on Wednesday. The trial has featured graphic testimony of abuse, coercion, and sex trafficking over several decades.</p>
