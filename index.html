          <p>Treasury yields experienced a decline as investors reacted to President Trump's renewed threats of trade tariffs against the European Union and Apple. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 2 basis points to 5.041%, while the 10-year Treasury yield fell by 4 basis points to 4.515%. Trump suggested imposing a 50% tariff on the EU and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., which led to market volatility and a flight to safety in bonds. This occurred after concerns arose earlier in the week regarding Trump's budget bill and its potential impact on the U.S. deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old who shot at President Trump during a Pennsylvania rally, was revealed through emails to have been simultaneously planning his academic future and a violent attack. Crooks, who killed an audience member and injured Trump's ear, was actively applying to transfer to a four-year engineering program while also ordering materials to design a bomb. Despite his meticulous planning and high academic performance, Crooks' emails also revealed a skepticism of the government and corporations, hinting at a potential motive for his actions. The FBI accessed encrypted email accounts used by Crooks, who died 11 days before the grand jury confirmed the subpoena related to an active FBI criminal investigation.</p>

          <p>Jemele Hill has dismissed claims that Caitlin Clark is being specifically targeted in the WNBA, asserting that the hard fouls and trash talk are simply part of the competition. Clark, who became a college phenom, has faced physical play and allegations of racism since joining the league, but Hill believes that these are normal aspects of basketball. Hill's comments came after an incident where Clark and Rhyne Howard had to be separated during a game, with Clark appearing to say, "I'm not scared of you." The Indiana Fever won the game against the Atlanta Dream 82-76, with Clark contributing 11 points.</p>

          <p>An article in The Guardian argues that military intervention is necessary to halt the ongoing genocide in Gaza, emphasizing that humanitarian aid is insufficient. The author contends that Israel's actions, including the blockade and military offensives, demonstrate a clear intention to destroy Gaza. The article urges the establishment of a no-fly zone and a humanitarian corridor to protect Palestinians and allow aid dispersal. Citing international law and the responsibility to protect doctrine, the piece asserts that military intervention is not violence, but a means to stop violence and fulfill legal obligations to prevent genocide.</p>

          <p>The United States is imposing new sanctions on Sudan over the military's alleged use of chemical weapons, but experts fear these measures will disproportionately affect civilians. While the sanctions target the economy and humanitarian sector, they are unlikely to significantly impact the military's actions in the ongoing conflict. The Sudanese population is already facing a severe humanitarian crisis with millions displaced and widespread famine. Despite previous sanctions on both warring parties, the conflict has continued, raising doubts about the effectiveness of the new measures in altering the trajectory of the war. Amidst the fighting, the UN diplomat Kamil Idris has been appointed as the new Sudanese Prime Minister, tasked with forming a transitional government.</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified pressure on Apple to shift iPhone production to the United States, threatening tariffs of at least 25% on iPhones made abroad. Since 2016, Apple has resisted moving its manufacturing to the U.S., opting instead to shift some production to India. Experts suggest that making iPhones in the U.S. would be costly and difficult, potentially doubling prices to $2,000 or more. Apple has faced challenges with U.S. production in the past, including difficulties finding skilled labor and reliable suppliers. The company has been increasing iPhone production in India to avoid import taxes and tap into a large engineering pool.</p>

The rise in British citizenship applications from Americans occurred against a backdrop of similar increases from across the world.

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled all of his upcoming concerts, including a large-scale tour scheduled for this year and next, because of a brain disorder known as normal pressure hydrocephalus. This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance. Normal pressure hydrocephalus, or N.P.H., is a rare condition that occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, causing symptoms that include trouble walking and controlling one’s bladder. If N.P.H. is diagnosed early enough, it can be treated successfully through surgery that creates a path for the fluid to flow out of the brain, alleviating symptoms.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is increasing its position in Capital One Financial (COF) by purchasing 50 shares at approximately $185 each. This decision comes as stocks sell off due to President Trump's tariff threats against the European Union and Apple. The purchase violates the low average cost basis on the Capital One position, but the trust has conviction in the benefits of the Discover acquisition, which closed on Sunday. Analysts estimate Capital One has significant excess capital, providing room for share repurchases in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A House Republican tax bill passed on Thursday is projected to disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans while potentially harming low-income households. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bottom 10% of households would see their income fall, while the top 10% would receive an income boost. The bill's tax cuts, particularly those related to business income, state and local taxes, and the estate tax, primarily benefit high earners. Additionally, cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP would negatively impact lower-income individuals and families. The legislation is now headed to the Senate for consideration.</p>

Baude argues that this decision is a straightforward application of the court's most recent precedents and that concerns about the court's actions should be saved for other cases.

The House of Representatives passed a sweeping package of tax cuts that could significantly affect sustainability efforts and domestic climate goals. Some of the biggest environmental impacts will come in the form of cuts to clean energy credits, including repealing or phasing out some of the Biden-era clean energy tax credits sooner.

While many new ETFs will be traditional, some will involve more complex strategies, requiring careful consideration.

Two, is there is also the issue of capacity constraint in illiquid and smaller niches of the market.</p>
