          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of U.S. troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing the use of "full force" to protect federal facilities he claims are under siege by domestic terrorists. This move has been met with strong opposition from state and local Democratic leaders, who argue there is no national security threat and that federal intervention is unnecessary. The action represents an expansion of the administration's use of federal forces in U.S. cities and has raised concerns about escalating tensions between the government and protesters.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's open and defiant approach to actions that might have been career-ending scandals for past presidents has altered public perception. Observers suggest his brazenness is seen by some as authenticity, desensitizing the public and neutralizing the impact of controversies. This strategy is supported by a loyal political base and a rapid news cycle that prevents sustained focus on any single issue, effectively changing the nature of political accountability in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas has left one detainee dead and two others in critical condition, with the FBI investigating it as a targeted attack. The gunman, who authorities say died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reportedly left messages of an anti-ICE nature on shell casings found at the scene. The incident has prompted federal officials to condemn the violence, blaming heated political rhetoric for motivating the attack and ordering increased security at ICE facilities nationwide.</p>

Officials have confirmed the death toll, with more than 50 others injured, prompting an official inquiry and offers of compensation to the victims' families from both state and national leaders.</p>

This behavior, documented in multiple national parks in Africa, suggests that alcohol consumption may have deep evolutionary roots rather than being a purely human cultural phenomenon, providing new insights into primate behavior.</p>

          <p>The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is operating on emergency diesel generators for a fifth consecutive day, raising significant safety concerns after its last external power line was severed. The UN's nuclear watchdog has repeatedly warned of a potential catastrophe if cooling systems fail. Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a $90 billion arms agreement with the U.S. and criticized Hungary for conducting what he called "dangerous" drone surveillance over Ukrainian territory.</p>

          <h2>Economist Warns Artificial Intelligence Boom Poses Significant Labor Market Challenge for Federal Reserve</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Market analyst David Zervos has warned that the rapid growth of artificial intelligence could create a difficult dilemma for the Federal Reserve. He suggests a future scenario where the economy experiences strong GDP growth driven by AI, but the unemployment rate simultaneously rises due to significant job displacement. This would challenge the Fed's dual mandate of maintaining price stability and full employment, as some experts predict AI could eliminate three to five million jobs within the next few years.

Despite the calm response, BYD's stock has fallen this week amid signs of cooling growth, including lowered sales targets and its first quarterly profit decline in over three years.

          <p>Despite concerns over tariffs and a weak jobs market, a resilient stock market is fueling consumer spending and supporting the U.S. economy, potentially preventing a recession. Recent economic data shows surprisingly strong consumer activity, which is increasingly attributed to the "wealth effect" from rising stock portfolios, primarily benefiting the top 10% of earners who own most of the market. However, economists warn that this makes the economy highly vulnerable, as a market downturn could quickly curtail spending. (not investment advice)</p>
