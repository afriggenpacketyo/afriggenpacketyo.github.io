          <p>The British and Irish governments have agreed to a new framework to address legacy cases from the Northern Ireland Troubles. This deal involves reforming the UK's controversial legacy body, which will be renamed the Legacy Commission, and establishing a new legacy unit within the Irish police force. The agreement, which requires new legislation in both countries, aims to ensure full cooperation from Irish state bodies and heal the diplomatic rift caused by the previous UK act. Victims' groups have been briefed on the plan, which is seen as an opportunity to move forward on the sensitive issue of historical justice.</p>

          <p>Italian driver Fabio Barone has set a new world record for the fastest speed achieved by a car on a boat. He drove a Ferrari SF90 supercar across the flight deck of an Italian navy aircraft carrier, reaching a certified speed of 101.9 mph (164 km/h). The attempt, which took place near Rome, was challenging due to a damp flight deck that had to be dried before the run. After successfully braking before the deck's "ski jump" end, the record was confirmed by an official timekeeper, and the results will be submitted to Guinness World Records.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell after initially hitting a record high, following the Bank of Japan's decision to keep its policy rate unchanged at 0.5%. The central bank's move was widely expected and comes as Japan's core inflation rate for August slowed to 2.7%, its lowest level since November 2024. Analysts suggest the BOJ is taking a cautious approach, prioritizing economic stability amid global uncertainty and slowing inflation. The decision signals a continued focus on supporting Japan's economic recovery rather than implementing premature tightening measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Eritrean man has been returned to France from the UK under the new "one in, one out" migrant exchange agreement. This marks the first time the government has successfully overcome a legal challenge to a removal under this scheme, following a court ruling that there was no justification for a delay. The flight occurred shortly after the Home Office tightened rules on modern slavery claims, making it harder for migrants to resist removal. The pilot program with France aims to deter small boat crossings by creating a risk of being sent back, with another migrant with a UK asylum claim to be accepted in return.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from his administration that led to ABC suspending host Jimmy Kimmel, President Donald Trump suggested that television networks with negative coverage of him should potentially have their broadcast licenses revoked. Kimmel's suspension came after he linked the murder of a conservative influencer to a Trump supporter, prompting the FCC chair to warn of regulatory action. The move has ignited a debate over free speech, with critics like Stephen Colbert and former President Obama accusing the administration of censorship and using regulatory threats to silence dissent.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's borrowing reached £18 billion in August, the highest figure for that month since the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago. According to the Office for National Statistics, this was higher than anticipated and driven by increased spending on public services, benefits, and rising debt interest payments, which outpaced tax receipts. The figures put additional pressure on the chancellor ahead of the upcoming Budget, with total borrowing for the financial year now £16.2 billion higher than the same period last year. Analysts suggest the deteriorating public finances may force the government to consider tax increases to meet its fiscal rules. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite headline inflation remaining above the bank's 2% target for over three years, the BOJ is prioritizing stability amid global uncertainty.

At the Gaora Hallagana rock shelter, a team of Chadian archaeologists and geologists discovered fragments of pottery and ancient rock art depicting animals like cattle, hippos, and giraffes. These findings suggest the region, now a desert, was previously home to pastures, forests, and waterways between 10,000 and 3,000 BC. The research aims to build a chronological framework for ancient human settlements and understand how people adapted to the region's dramatic climate change over millennia.</p>

The discussions, said to be mediated by Qatar, are highly controversial due to the Taliban's human rights record and Germany's lack of official diplomatic relations with the regime. The move is part of the new government's plan to end admission programs for at-risk Afghans, which were established after the Taliban's takeover in 2021. Critics, including opposition parties and aid organizations, argue that such negotiations legitimize the Taliban and betray Afghans who previously worked with Germany.</p>

          <p>An analysis reveals that US tariffs on Chinese goods disproportionately impact China's coastal provinces, which are the country's primary export hubs. Six key regions, including Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, accounted for nearly 80% of China's exports to the United States in the first seven months of 2025. This concentration of trade exposure means these areas are the most vulnerable to the ongoing trade war. The report highlights the regional disparities within China's economy and how local governments and companies in these highly exposed areas are being forced to adapt to the economic pressure from the tariffs.</p>

          <p>United Airlines manages its nearly 5,000 daily global flights from a highly coordinated Network Operations Center located near Chicago. This 24/7 command hub houses over 2,000 employees across 26 departments, including flight dispatch, crew scheduling, and a dedicated in-house meteorology team. These specialists work together to monitor and respond to any potential disruptions, from mechanical issues to severe weather, ensuring the airline's vast operations run safely and smoothly. The center's role is to anticipate the unexpected and communicate real-time information across the network, often resolving problems before passengers are even aware of them.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is increasing his involvement with dementia charities, inspired by the positive impact music can have on those with the condition. Ferguson, whose own brother is living with dementia, is now an ambassador for the Playlist for Life charity. He emphasizes how music and singing can help stimulate memory and provide joy for sufferers. Following the passing of his wife, Ferguson has found that dedicating time to this cause, along with other activities like travel and reading, has been beneficial for his own well-being.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that a deal regarding the U.S. operations of TikTok is close and suggested he might extend the current trade truce with China. Speaking ahead of a scheduled phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump stated that any extension would be based on the existing terms, which he described as favorable. He also emphasized that the American version of TikTok would be owned by U.S. investors and that the government would receive a substantial fee for facilitating the deal.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered a large-scale black market for Premier League football tickets, operated by overseas companies that use memberships and software to acquire tickets in bulk. These tickets are then resold illegally online to UK customers at prices two to four times their face value. The practice makes it harder for genuine fans to buy tickets officially and poses a safety risk by undermining fan segregation rules. Despite clubs canceling tens of thousands of suspicious memberships, the problem is described as endemic, with calls for the government and league to address the legal loopholes that allow these foreign-based sites to operate.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the San Francisco Giants 2-1, with their often-unreliable bullpen managing to protect a slim lead. Starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5⅓ scoreless innings but struggled with his command, issuing a career-high six walks. The Dodgers' relief pitchers, who have been inconsistent recently, successfully navigated a tense seventh inning where they allowed a run but ultimately escaped a bases-loaded jam. The victory, secured by a clean ninth inning from closer Alex Vesia, extends the Dodgers' lead in the National League West to three games and provides a much-needed confidence boost for their bullpen.</p>
