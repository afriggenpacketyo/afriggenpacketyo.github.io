          <p>While digging trenches in Lima, Peru, utility workers discovered a well-preserved, 1,000-year-old female mummy with its dark brown hair still intact. Archaeologists believe the remains belong to the pre-Inca Chancay culture, which thrived in the region from 1000 to 1470 A.D. Experts note that such discoveries are common in Lima, which is home to around 400 archaeological sites, as the area's dry desert climate naturally mummifies remains.</p>

          <p>The European Union has put forward a proposal to regulate the global trade of all eel species under the Washington Convention, an international treaty on endangered species. The move, which is strongly opposed by Japan, would require export permits and proof of legal capture for transactions involving eels. If adopted, these new restrictions would take effect in June 2027 and significantly impact the international market for species like the Japanese eel.</p>
