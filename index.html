        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, are pushing back against the Trump administration's efforts to expedite deportations without due process, emphasizing that immigrants have the right to challenge their removals. The Supreme Court recently criticized the administration for providing only a day's notice to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation under an 18th-century wartime law. Legal scholars have praised the courts' commitment to due process, which is a basic constitutional principle. The article highlights cases where courts have intervened to ensure immigrants receive adequate warning and opportunities to contest their deportations, including the case of a Maryland man improperly deported to El Salvador. The courts are actively scrutinizing the administration's deportation practices to ensure they comply with constitutional protections.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's new social studies curriculum, influenced by State School Superintendent Ryan Walters, will require high school students to "identify discrepancies" in the 2020 election results, promoting theories sympathetic to Donald Trump. This revision, part of a broader effort to end "wokeness" in schools, has sparked controversy, with concerns raised about the curriculum's bias and potential misinformation. The revised standards, which also include references to the Bible and national pride, have led to a lawsuit from parents and educators. Despite opposition, pro-Trump conservative groups have pressured lawmakers to support the standards, raising concerns about the influence of far-right organizations in education.</p>

This development comes amid a new Israeli military offensive named "Operation Gideon's Chariots," which has resulted in significant casualties and intensified the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The proposed deal also includes provisions for increased aid and medical evacuations, but Israel has demanded proof of life and detailed information about the remaining hostages.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump endorsed the idea that the Supreme Court placed an “illegal injunction” on him by temporarily blocking his administration’s ability to deport Venezuelans without due process. Trump reposted statements from attorney Mike Davis, who criticized the court’s decision and suggested housing the deportees near the homes of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh. This endorsement marks a reversal from Trump’s previous praise of the court when it ruled in his favor, and it aligns with his broader pattern of attacking judges who rule against him. Critics have expressed concerns that Trump will ignore court orders and overextend his presidential power.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Walmart after the retailer warned that it would need to raise prices due to tariffs. Trump suggested that Walmart and China should "eat the tariffs" rather than pass the costs on to consumers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey had noted that price increases were occurring at an unprecedented magnitude and speed. The retailer, however, affirmed its commitment to keeping prices as low as possible, despite the tariff-related challenges. Other companies, including Microsoft and Mattel, have also announced or warned of price increases due to tariffs.</p>

Gardening and outdoor sales are major contributors, accounting for about 13% of Home Depot's total 2024 sales. However, the company faces headwinds from tariff uncertainty and elevated mortgage rates, impacting housing turnover. Analysts predict a challenging first quarter, but they anticipate stronger outdoor sales and a potential recovery in the latter half of the year, coinciding with expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. The article also notes that the tariff impact is a concern, though de-escalation between the U.S. and China could ease those pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

Russian negotiators reportedly demanded that Ukraine withdraw its troops from its own territory as a condition for a ceasefire, a proposition deemed unacceptable by Ukrainian officials.
