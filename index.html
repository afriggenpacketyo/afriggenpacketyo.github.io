          <p>Following a deadly Israeli airstrike on the Holy Family Church in Gaza City, senior Christian clerics from Jerusalem visited the site to offer support and deliver aid. The delegation, led by Latin Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa, expressed solidarity with the local Christian community sheltering there. The visit occurred amid rare criticism of Israel's military conduct from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who called the approach in Gaza "no longer acceptable" and urged for an immediate ceasefire and increased humanitarian assistance. This represents a notable shift in tone from Germany, a traditionally staunch ally of Israel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of Japan's House of Councilors election, far-right parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. These parties, mirroring rhetoric from Western movements, blame foreigners for social issues, citing unruly tourists and isolated criminal incidents reported by the media. Despite Japan's significant labor shortages due to a declining birthrate, nationalist politicians advocate against relying on foreign workers and call for stricter controls. This political strategy aims to attract voters frustrated with economic pressures by scapegoating the increasing foreign population.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 07:30:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has won a significant arbitration case against Exxon Mobil concerning the rights to Hess Corporation's valuable offshore oil assets in Guyana. The ruling, from the International Chamber of Commerce, dismisses Exxon's claim of first refusal and allows Chevron to proceed with its $53 billion acquisition of Hess. This decision resolves major uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock, which saw a subsequent increase in premarket trading. Exxon stated that while it disagrees with the interpretation, it respects the arbitration process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is threatening to sue The Wall Street Journal over an article detailing a salacious letter he allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday. The president has denied the allegations and directed the Attorney General to seek the release of some files from Epstein's criminal case. In separate news, the White House physician disclosed that Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older adults affecting leg veins, but affirmed he remains in excellent health. The House also passed a bill cutting funds for public broadcasting.</p>

          <p>China's government has announced a five-year plan to stimulate its service sector by reducing restrictive measures and attracting more foreign investment. Commerce Minister Wang Wentao stated the goal is to address a shortage of high-quality services, particularly in healthcare and elderly care, and to enrich the supply available to consumers. This strategic shift emphasizes boosting domestic demand as a more reliable engine for economic growth, especially as the country navigates an uncertain global trade environment and ongoing trade disputes with the United States.

          <p>Recent polling data suggests a significant shift in American public opinion, with attitudes becoming more favorable toward immigration since Donald Trump took office. After years of growing restrictionist sentiment, a record 79% of Americans now view immigration as a good thing for the country, according to Gallup. This reversal appears to be a reaction to the administration's aggressive enforcement policies, such as suspending asylum programs and increasing raids. While support for some measures like a border wall remains, the overall trend indicates that seeing Trump's hardline agenda in practice is making the public more pro-immigrant.</p>

          <p>The family of a former employer has accused Raynor Winn, author of the bestselling memoir 'The Salt Path', of stealing approximately £64,000 from their property business in the early 2000s.

Winn has disputed the claims as misleading, acknowledging past mistakes but stating the matter was settled privately.

While potentially hypocritical and a distraction from policy issues, the move is seen as politically astute for several reasons. It highlights Trump's unflattering and contradictory statements about his relationship with the deceased perpetrator of sexual assault and exploits a rare issue where Trump's base and right-wing influencers are openly criticizing him. By focusing on a topic where a majority of Americans already suspect a cover-up, Democrats are able to drive a wedge within the opposition and frame Trump as betraying his supporters.</p>

This reversal is particularly damaging because the narrative of elite corruption was a core part of his appeal.

          <p>The United Nations human rights chief has stated there are credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions and arbitrary killings, during recent sectarian violence in Suweida, Syria. The alleged perpetrators include security forces, government-affiliated individuals, and local armed groups. Nearly 600 people have reportedly been killed since clashes erupted between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes, prompting the deployment of government forces. A fragile truce is now in place, but the UN is calling for independent investigations and accountability for the reported atrocities, including the deliberate killing of civilians.</p>

          <p>Host Stephen Colbert has announced that "The Late Show" will end its run in May 2026, bringing the long-standing late-night franchise to a close. The timing of the cancellation has sparked political speculation, as it comes just days after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount for a $16 million legal settlement with Donald Trump, which Colbert termed a "big fat bribe." CBS insists the decision was purely financial and unrelated to the show's content or performance. Critics and some politicians have called for transparency, questioning whether the show was canceled for political reasons.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man has been charged with hijacking under a terrorism provision after seizing control of a small Cessna plane and causing a security scare in Vancouver. Authorities state the suspect, who had posted on social media about being a "messenger of Allah" sent to save humanity from climate change, acted with an ideological motive to disrupt airspace. He allegedly threatened a flight instructor to take control of the plane, prompting NORAD to scramble F-15 fighter jets. The plane landed safely in Vancouver, and the suspect was arrested without further incident.</p>

          <p>A moment from a Coldplay concert in Massachusetts has become an internet sensation after the arena's "kiss cam" focused on a man and a woman who reacted with horror instead of affection. As their image appeared on the big screen, the woman buried her face in her hands while the man ducked out of view. Online sleuths quickly identified the pair as the married CEO of a software company and his female head of human resources, fueling widespread speculation of an affair. Singer Chris Martin commented from the stage, "Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy."</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has issued an amber warning for parts of south-east and eastern England due to severe thunderstorms expected on Saturday morning. Forecasters predict torrential rain, with up to 100mm (4 inches) possible in a few hours, which is more than a month's worth of rainfall for some areas. This is expected to cause flash flooding and significant travel disruption. The severe weather comes even as large parts of the UK are under drought conditions and hosepipe bans, as the intense, rapid rainfall is unlikely to replenish groundwater levels effectively.</p>

          <p>An NHS doctor and her husband have each been sentenced to 10 months in jail for stealing and selling hospital-grade Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) on eBay during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Attiya Sheikh and Omer Sheikh made nearly £8,000 by selling stolen gloves, masks, and wipes at a time when the NHS faced critical shortages. An investigation was launched after an NHS supplier noticed its products for sale on the auction site. A search of the couple's home uncovered 121 boxes of stolen gloves, leading to their arrest and eventual guilty pleas.</p>

          <p>Health insurance premiums on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces are projected to increase by an average of 15% next year, a record-setting pace, according to a new analysis. This hike is largely attributed to the expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies, which the recent Republican-passed budget bill allowed to lapse. The end of these subsidies is expected to make coverage unaffordable for millions, causing healthier individuals to drop their plans and leaving a sicker, more expensive pool of patients. This, in turn, forces insurers to raise rates for everyone remaining in the marketplace.</p>

          <p>Shares in the British luxury brand Burberry rose over 8% after the company reported a 4% increase in sales in the Americas for the recent quarter. This growth, which reverses a previous decline, is seen as an early success for the company's turnaround strategy focused on its core British heritage and iconic products like the trench coat. The positive results in the U.S. market provide a glimmer of hope for the brand amid a challenging global luxury sector, which faces headwinds from potential U.S. tariffs and a lagging Chinese market.

The new measures also target Russia's banking and energy sectors and, for the first time, sanction a major Russian-owned oil refinery in India.

          <p>A new savings program included in President Trump's recent tax and spending bill will create "Trump accounts" for children, seeded with a one-time $1,000 federal deposit for newborns. While the premise is to encourage wealth-building, tax experts say the rules are complicated. The accounts function like a traditional IRA, with tax-deferred growth and taxes paid on withdrawal, but funds generally cannot be accessed without penalty before age 59½. This long-term restriction and less favorable tax treatment may make other options, like 529 college savings plans, a better choice for most families.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece suggests that the controversy over the Jeffrey Epstein files is the first issue to cause a significant and lasting crack in Donald Trump's support from his base. Unlike previous scandals, Trump's reversal—from promising to release a client list to calling the matter a hoax—directly contradicts a core narrative that his supporters deeply believe. The author argues that because the passions of many MAGA followers lie in exposing perceived elite corruption, this perceived cover-up feels like a fundamental betrayal, leading to open criticism from influencers and a sense that Trump is a lame duck.</p>

The other camp is the populist left, successors to Bernie Sanders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who believe the party fails when it doesn't deliver on bold, transformative policies.
