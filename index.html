          <p>A shooting in New York City's Times Square resulted in three people being hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. The incident occurred early Saturday morning following a dispute that started inside a restaurant and spilled onto the street. A 17-year-old suspect was taken into custody by the NYPD, and a handgun was recovered from the scene. The shooting took place in one of the city's designated gun-free zones, which were established in 2022 to ban firearms in sensitive locations.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to suspend arms exports to Israel has created significant political division within his own government. Members of his conservative CDU/CSU alliance have fiercely opposed the move, arguing it breaks with Germany's long-standing foreign policy and special responsibility towards Israel. However, the decision has garnered support from his junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats, as well as some foreign policy experts within his own party, reflecting a deep national debate on the issue.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White as the suspected gunman in the fatal shooting outside the CDC headquarters in Atlanta. The attack resulted in the death of DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose and the suspect, who was found deceased in a nearby building. Investigators are exploring a motive linked to the suspect's belief that he was sick from a COVID-19 vaccine. The incident prompted a large-scale law enforcement response and a lockdown at the neighboring Emory University campus.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will hold a press conference to unveil a plan he claims will "essentially, stop violent crime in Washington, D.C." This follows his administration's deployment of federal law enforcement to the city and threats to assume federal control of the local police force. Trump's focus on crime in the capital contrasts with official data showing that violent crime rates have significantly decreased in recent years. The move highlights ongoing tensions between the White House and the city's local governance.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police arrested at least 365 people at a demonstration in London's Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. Protesters held signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to mass arrests for the criminal offense of supporting a banned organization. The event highlights the contentious nature of the government's ban, which the group is challenging in court as a breach of free speech.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it older than Earth itself. A planetary geologist from the University of Georgia examined fragments of the space rock, which is believed to have originated from the breakup of a larger asteroid between Mars and Jupiter. Scientists plan to officially name the rock the "McDonough Meteorite," marking the 27th meteorite recovery in the state's history.</p>

          <h2>Creator of '4% Rule' Offers Updated Retirement Withdrawal Advice</h2>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals three decades ago, has new advice for today's retirees. He argues that due to better portfolio diversification options, many retirees are unnecessarily conservative and can safely withdraw more than 4% annually. In his new book, he suggests a rate closer to 5.25% or 5.5% could be appropriate, allowing retirees to enjoy more of their hard-earned savings without outliving their money.

          <p>This analysis piece argues that the upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin represents a stark departure from the established diplomatic principle of "Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine." By engaging in direct, one-on-one negotiations with Russia, the Trump administration is effectively removing Kyiv from discussions about its own future. This shift places Ukraine in a vulnerable position, as critical decisions about its sovereignty and territory could be made without its consent or participation at the negotiating table.</p>

This plan, intended to establish Israeli security control, has been widely condemned by humanitarian agencies who warn of catastrophic consequences for an already beleaguered and starving population.</p>

          <p>Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki, along with organizations like NOAA, argues that the Bermuda Triangle is not a mysterious paranormal zone but a region where disappearances are statistically predictable. He asserts that the high volume of air and sea traffic, combined with volatile weather and complex navigation, accounts for the incidents. According to this view, the number of lost ships and planes is proportional to the traffic, with human error and natural forces being the true culprits, not supernatural phenomena.</p>
