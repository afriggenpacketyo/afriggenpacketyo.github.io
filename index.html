        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have been resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades. The judge's decision followed testimony from family members who believe the brothers have rehabilitated themselves in prison through education and self-help groups. The brothers claimed they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse, while the prosecution argued they killed their parents for financial gain and haven't taken full responsibility. The California Board of Parole Hearings will conduct separate hearings in June to determine if they should be released, with a final decision resting with Governor Newsom.</p>

Democrats are mounting strong opposition, particularly to proposed cuts to welfare programs like Medicaid and SNAP, leading to heated debates and even protests.

The satellite demonstrated capabilities including precise control in low orbits, real-time target detection, and space environment monitoring. VLEO satellites, orbiting between 150km and 300km, offer advantages like lower signal latency and stronger transmission, but face challenges from atmospheric drag. The Chutian constellation project, a collaboration between China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp and the Hubei provincial government, aims to enhance China's commercial space sector.</p>

Fire victims expressed disappointment with Lara's decision, arguing that it adds insult to injury while State Farm is allegedly mishandling existing claims.

Two new government campuses will open in Manchester and Aberdeen, with roles created in other cities. The government wants 50% of senior civil servants based in regional offices by 2030, with departments submitting relocation plans.

The White House confirmed Trump would meet with Syria’s new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former rebel commander who helped overthrow Bashar al-Assad in 2024. Sharaa's pitch to Trump for sanctions relief included access to Syrian oil, reconstruction contracts, and a Trump Tower in Damascus. This would be the first face-to-face meeting between a US president and a Syrian leader since 2000.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole. The brothers acknowledged the killings but claimed self-defense after years of abuse. Prosecutors argued they planned the murders for financial gain and haven't taken responsibility. The brothers apologized in court, expressing hopes to work with sexual assault victims and incarcerated individuals if released. The brothers' lawyer expressed optimism, while their cousin said the family was elated.</p>

          <p>Three GPs offer differing perspectives on the proposed Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which would allow terminally ill patients in England and Wales the option of an assisted death.

Dr. Susi Caesar supports assisted dying, emphasizing patient choice based on her father's experience. Dr. Gurpreet Khaira expresses conflicted feelings, acknowledging the importance of choice but worrying about vulnerable patients being coerced.

          <p>Traditional British television is facing an existential threat from US streaming giants like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon, leading to discussions about potential mergers and collaborations. With viewing habits shifting and traditional terrestrial TV potentially ending by 2035, UK broadcasters are exploring ways to compete financially and maintain distinctiveness. Some suggest a shared streaming service under BBC iPlayer, while others argue for mergers among ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5. The key question is whether British TV can survive the competition and continue producing uniquely British content.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," details how President Biden's aides suppressed concerns about his age and cognitive decline during his presidency. The book relies heavily on anonymous sources, revealing a reluctance within the Democratic Party to publicly address Biden's waning abilities. It describes instances of Biden forgetting names, appearing frail, and relying on scripted cabinet gatherings. The book highlights the pressure and control exerted by Biden's inner circle, dubbed "the Politburo," to maintain a positive image despite growing concerns.</p>
