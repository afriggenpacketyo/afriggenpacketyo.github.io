          <p>Overnight Russian drone and missile attacks across Ukraine have resulted in at least eight deaths and more than 30 injuries, according to regional officials. The most affected regions include Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, and Mykolaiv. This escalation follows one of the heaviest assaults on Kyiv since the beginning of the Russian invasion. Russia's defense ministry claims its air defense units intercepted numerous Ukrainian drones over Russian regions, including Moscow, leading to temporary flight suspensions at Moscow airports, while Russia continues to control approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea.</p>

          <p>Rachel Feintzeig discusses her fascination with zombie narratives, particularly HBO's "The Last of Us," as a means of escaping the anxieties of contemporary life. She finds that immersing herself in fictional apocalypses provides a temporary reprieve from real-world concerns. Feintzeig also recounts how horror movies helped her cope with personal tragedies, offering a sense of perspective and catharsis. The author acknowledges the escapism is temporary, but admits that she feels a tinge of sadness as the season ends, with the real world being relentless.</p>

The IDF stated its aircraft struck suspects operating from a structure near IDF troops, and the claim of harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.

          <p>Germany is facing an increasing threat from cyberattacks targeting state agencies, hospitals, and critical infrastructure, leading to potential disruptions in essential services. The city of Bremen recently experienced a DDoS attack, and a 2021 cyberattack in Anhalt-Bitterfeld caused significant administrative disruptions for half a year. Experts emphasize the need for greater investment in digital security, particularly for smaller companies and state authorities. The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) reports over 333,000 registered cybercrimes in 2024, with the attackers increasingly using artificial intelligence, and calls for closer cooperation between the state and businesses to enhance cyber resilience.</p>

A Dutch startup, The Offline Club, organizes smartphone-free meetups to encourage real-world interactions. Studies show that many young people feel worse after spending time on social media and desire digital curfews.

          <p>Doctors in Japan are criticizing the continued COVID-19 restrictions at hospitals, citing the impact on patients and families, even for terminally ill individuals. Despite the government downgrading the threat level and placing COVID-19 in the same risk category as seasonal influenza, many hospitals still maintain strict visitation rules. Physicians and social workers argue that these restrictions violate human rights and lack scientific evidence of preventing infection spread. They are urging for the abolishment or curbing of these measures to allow patients to see their loved ones.</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park's Tioga Road will reopen on Memorial Day, providing access to the park's eastern entrance. The road, which has been closed since November due to snow and ice, is a popular scenic route. The reopening is earlier than in previous years, but visitors should expect limited services and bring necessary supplies. Visitors entering between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. will need a reservation, and the park may face staffing shortages this summer due to budget cuts.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that dog owners who dwell on work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety to their pets. Researchers found that dogs of owners with high job stress and work-related rumination exhibited more stress-related behaviors. This connection is attributed to emotional contagion, where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The study suggests that avoiding work-related thoughts at home can benefit both the owner's and the dog's well-being.</p>
