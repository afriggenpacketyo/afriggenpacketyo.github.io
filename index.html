          <p>A driver deliberately rammed a vehicle into a crowd outside a Hollywood nightclub, injuring thirty people, seven of them critically. Police identified the suspect, who allegedly made a U-turn before accelerating into the line of people. Following the crash, bystanders reportedly attacked the driver, who was also found to have been shot by an unknown assailant who fled the scene. The incident is being investigated as an intentional act of assault with a deadly weapon, creating a chaotic and violent scene that drew a massive emergency response.</p>

          <p>Ecuadorian drug lord Adolfo "Fito" Macias has been extradited to the U.S. to face charges of cocaine distribution and conspiracy, marking the first time Ecuador has extradited one of its own citizens. Macias, leader of the powerful 'Los Choneros' gang, was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape that prompted the president to declare a state of "internal armed conflict." His gang is accused of smuggling weapons from the U.S. into Ecuador while trafficking cocaine in the opposite direction, contributing to the nation's role as a major hub in the global drug trade.</p>

          <p>A stark contrast in energy policy is emerging between the U.S. and China, with Beijing significantly increasing its investment in renewable energy to meet rising demand, particularly from technologies like AI. This push is part of China's strategy to achieve a global tech lead. Conversely, the Trump administration is moving to cancel tax credits for wind and solar power, labeling them as unreliable sources that compromise the American electric grid. The divergence highlights a key area of competition as both nations grapple with the need for more energy production.</p>

          <p>Richard Tillman, the brother of late NFL player and U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman, was arrested after allegedly driving a vehicle into a San Jose post office, causing a major fire. The incident, which occurred early Sunday morning, required a second-alarm response from about 50 firefighters to extinguish the blaze. U.S. Postal Inspectors stated the building appears to be a total loss and that it seems the fire may have been set intentionally. Mail service for the affected station has been temporarily relocated to a nearby post office.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to obstruct a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in D.C. unless the team reverts to its former name, the Redskins. In a series of social media posts, Trump claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the name change and that he might impose a restriction on the stadium project to force the issue. The team dropped the controversial name in 2020 after years of criticism that it was racist, and it is unclear how Trump could legally intervene in the stadium plan, which involves land Congress recently gave the city control over.</p>

In response, the government is reviving the Pensions Commission to find solutions and build a national consensus.

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now believing it targets more than just dangerous criminals. This shift comes as most Americans, including Hispanic Americans, feel the administration is being too tough on immigration and should focus more on lowering prices. The poll also found widespread disapproval of the recently passed tax bill, which most believe will primarily help the wealthy. Overall, the findings suggest a growing disconnect between the president's base and the broader public on key policy issues.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's recent major victories have solidified his position as the most dominant force in men's golf since the peak of Tiger Woods. This analysis explores how the 29-year-old has conquered the sport through machine-like consistency, a calm demeanor, and a ruthless ability to close out tournaments. While his swing is unorthodox, a crucial improvement in his putting—switching to a claw grip—has transformed a previous weakness into a strength. His peers now openly compare his run of success to that of Woods, acknowledging him as the undisputed bar for excellence in the game.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is shutting down the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), its primary scientific arm. The closure is part of a plan to cut 23% of the EPA's staff, which the agency says will save money and allow it to better focus on its core mission. Critics, however, condemn the move as a destruction of scientific integrity that will cripple the EPA's ability to create and enforce regulations based on sound science. The ORD analyzes dangers from a wide range of environmental hazards, including toxic chemicals and water pollution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, teaching 'self-connection' is the single most important skill for a child's success. This involves helping children tune into and validate their own emotions, needs, and inner voice, rather than dismissing their feelings. By validating emotions, welcoming their full selves, and modeling self-awareness, parents can build a child's emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. This practice is presented as a powerful buffer against anxiety and self-doubt in adulthood.</p>

Stein suggests that for a more normal trade relationship to resume, both sides will need to move beyond the current tariff-centric discussions and address these deeper-seated commercial challenges.</p>

          <p>The long-delayed 9/11 trials at Guantanamo Bay face even more uncertainty after plea deals for the defendants were canceled. The deals, which would have avoided a death penalty trial in exchange for life sentences, were agreed to by the military court's convening authority but then overruled by a higher official. Legal experts predict this unprecedented move will itself provoke years of new litigation, further stalling a case that has been stuck in pretrial hearings for over two decades. For many victims' families, the development pushes the prospect of closure even further away.</p>

The man was reportedly wearing a heavy, 20-pound metal chain used for weight training when he entered the MRI room. The machine's powerful magnetic field immediately drew him in, causing a fatal medical episode. Patients are strictly warned to remove all metal objects before entering an MRI environment due to the extreme danger posed by the magnetic force, which can turn objects into deadly projectiles.</p>
