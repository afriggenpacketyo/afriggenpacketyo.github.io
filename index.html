            <p>A 5.2 magnitude earthquake struck near San Diego, California, causing noticeable shaking as far north as Los Angeles. The epicenter was located in San Diego County, specifically in the resort town of Julian. While the earthquake prompted emergency alerts and caused some alarm, initial reports indicated no major injuries or significant damage. Aftershocks were reported in the region following the main quake, and authorities are coordinating to assess any potential impacts. The National Weather Service confirmed that a tsunami was not expected as a result of the seismic activity.</p>

            <p>The increasing popularity of zero-day-to-expiration (0DTE) options is contributing to heightened volatility in the stock market, particularly amidst the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies. These options, which expire on the same day they are traded, have seen a surge in trading volume, with investors using them to hedge against sudden market movements or to speculate on short-term price swings. However, analysts warn that the high volume of 0DTE options can exacerbate intraday price fluctuations as market makers adjust their positions. The S&P 500's intraday volatility almost doubled last week, reaching levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A coalition of U.S. businesses has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, seeking to block the tariffs he has imposed on foreign imports. The lawsuit argues that Trump has overstepped his authority by claiming trade deficits constitute a national emergency, thus unlawfully usurping Congress' power to levy tariffs. The businesses contend that trade deficits, which have existed for decades without causing economic harm, do not represent an emergency or an unusual threat. The lawsuit aims to prevent the enforcement of these tariffs, asserting that they violate the principle of no taxation without representation.</p>

            <p>President Trump is considering a temporary pause on auto tariffs to provide car manufacturers with additional time to relocate their production to the United States. Trump stated that automakers "need a little bit of time" to shift production from countries like Canada and Mexico. The current 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars, intended to incentivize domestic manufacturing, could significantly increase car prices for consumers. Experts estimate that car prices could rise by $5,000 to $10,000 due to these tariffs, as U.S. automakers rely heavily on parts sourced from key trade partners.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic policies, including tariffs and cuts to scientific research, are being criticized for potentially moving America down the value chain. Critics argue that these policies prioritize industrial inputs over high-tech industries, potentially harming the tech and biomedical sectors. The administration's actions are seen as an attempt to return to a nostalgic view of the American past, focusing on manufacturing jobs rather than advancing technological innovation. The combination of tariffs and research funding cuts is raising concerns about the long-term economic consequences.</p>

            <p>A Pennsylvania man has been charged with attempted murder and other offenses after setting a fire at the Governor's Residence in Harrisburg, forcing Governor Josh Shapiro and his family to evacuate. Cody Balmer, 38, is accused of intentionally setting the fire while the Shapiro family was home. Officials have stated that the attack was targeted, but Balmer's specific motive is still unknown.

            <p>Free family planning clinics across the US are facing potential financial ruin after the Trump administration froze approximately $66 million in federal funds earmarked for these services. Title X, the country's largest federal family planning program, provides clinics with over $200 million annually for contraception, STI tests, and cancer screenings. The funding freeze, affecting clinics serving about 846,000 people, could lead to significant staff reductions, service cuts, or even clinic closures. The administration has cited concerns about providers potentially engaging in practices that employ race in a negative manner and violating an executive order prohibiting taxpayer subsidization of open borders.</p>

            <p>A Colorado funeral home owner has pleaded guilty to one count of corpse abuse and one count of theft, following accusations of improperly handling bodies and cremated remains. Miles Harford was arrested after the body of a woman was found in the back of a hearse, and cremated remains were discovered stashed throughout his rental property. The guilty plea follows other similar cases in Colorado, prompting lawmakers to pass new regulations for the funeral home industry. Harford's sentencing is scheduled for June 9.</p>

            <p>U.S. Treasury yields are falling as market participants weigh the implications of unexpected tariff exemptions announced by President Trump. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield dropped 11 basis points to 4.38%, while the 2-year Treasury yield also declined. The exemptions, initially presented as a means to allow companies time to relocate production to the U.S., have been cast into doubt by subsequent statements from Trump suggesting they may not be permanent. This uncertainty follows a week of unusual volatility in the bond market, with some traders speculating about potential dumping of Treasury holdings by foreign investors.</p>

            <p>China is minimizing the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on its exports, with an official stating that the "sky won't fall." This comes as stock markets rallied amidst indications of a possible easing of electronics restrictions. Despite ongoing trade tensions and concerns about a potential economic downturn, Chinese officials emphasize the country's diversified trade relationships and vast domestic market. The White House has offered some relief by exempting electronics from the steepest tariffs, but the long-term implications of the trade war remain uncertain.</p>

This proposal has raised concerns among civil rights advocates and legal scholars, who view it as potentially unconstitutional.

            <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller anticipates that the inflationary effects of President Trump's tariffs will be "transitory," comparing his view to the controversial "tush push" football play. Waller outlined two potential scenarios for the tariffs, suggesting that even with larger tariffs, the Fed would still cut interest rates, with the timing being the primary question. He acknowledged the risks associated with using the term "transitory" given the inflation surge in 2021, but maintains that higher inflation from tariffs will be temporary. He also noted that the Fed will need to "remain flexible" in deciding the future path of monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for its handling of a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant deported to El Salvador. Critics argue that the administration is pretending to comply with the order while refusing to do so, deferring to the Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who has also expressed unwillingness to return Abrego Garcia. The administration's actions are seen as a sign of contempt for the Supreme Court and the rule of law, raising concerns about the potential for presidential lawlessness. The administration's actions raise concerns about the rights of citizens and non-citizens alike.</p>
