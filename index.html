          <p>A dump truck driver in Eden, North Carolina, failed to stop at a stop sign and struck a crew of utility workers, resulting in the deaths of four men and injuries to three others. The incident occurred as the workers were addressing power lines, and the dump truck also collided with an occupied bucket truck before ending up in a ditch. The driver of the dump truck has been charged with a stop sign violation and misdemeanor death by motor vehicle, with authorities stating that impairment was not suspected. Duke Energy and Carolina Power and Signalization, the companies employing the workers, expressed their condolences and emphasized safety, and the collision remains under investigation by the North Carolina State Highway Patrol.</p>

          <p>A New York Times/Siena College poll reveals that voters perceive President Trump's use of executive power as overreaching, expressing doubts about key aspects of his agenda. Majorities of voters, including some who approve of his performance, describe the early months of his administration as "chaotic" and "scary." The poll indicates a decline in voter confidence regarding Trump's handling of critical issues like the economy and immigration, with his approval rating at 42%, which is historically low for a president at this stage in their term. This data reflects growing concerns about Trump's leadership and policy directions.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested and charged with obstruction for allegedly interfering with immigration agents attempting to arrest an undocumented immigrant in her courtroom. Federal agents claim Dugan intentionally misdirected them away from a Mexican national facing misdemeanor battery charges, leading to a brief foot chase before the individual was apprehended. The arrest has sparked partisan debate, with Democrats criticizing it as an attack on the judicial system and Republicans defending it as upholding the law. Dugan faces up to six years in prison if convicted on both obstruction and concealment charges.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he would only consider reducing tariffs on China if they provide "something that's, you know, substantial." He specified that he wants China to be more open to U.S. businesses and products, aiming for a deal where the U.S. can freely sell its products in China. Trump emphasized that he is not sure he will even ask for this, as China may not be willing to open up its markets. This statement reflects the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the conditions for potential tariff reductions.</p>

          <p>Gregg Wallace has spoken out to defend himself against allegations of inappropriate behavior, stating that "they're not all true." Wallace, who stepped down from presenting MasterChef following the claims, said he felt "under attack" and contemplated suicide. A BBC News investigation revealed allegations of inappropriate sexual comments by 13 people who had worked with Wallace across a range of shows. Wallace has denied many of the claims, but has admitted that some of the inappropriate jokes were "probably true", and is now diagnosed with autism and accepts he was "very slow to wake up" to a changing work environment.</p>
