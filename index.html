          <p>Prince Harry has made a surprise visit to Kyiv, responding to an invitation from Superhumans, an organization dedicated to supporting Ukrainians with life-changing war injuries. The Duke of Sussex emphasized his commitment to doing "everything possible" for the recovery of injured military personnel and is expected to detail new rehabilitation plans during his trip. This visit underscores the continued efforts of his Invictus Games Foundation and Archewell charitable foundation, which recently donated $500,000 to projects supporting injured children from Ukraine and Gaza, including medical evacuations and prosthetic development. The engagement highlights the ongoing royal family's support for Ukraine amidst the conflict.</p>

          <p>South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix announced its readiness to mass produce next-generation HBM4 high-bandwidth memory chips, solidifying its lead over rivals like Samsung Electronics and Micron Technologies. These chips are vital for artificial intelligence computing, notably expected to power Nvidia's forthcoming Rubin architecture. The company's HBM4 product offers double the bandwidth and a 40% increase in power efficiency compared to its previous generation. This strategic development follows a period of strong demand, which saw SK Hynix achieve record operating profits, and analysts anticipate its market dominance in AI memory will continue into the coming year.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy registered zero growth in July, consistent with economists' forecasts and following a 0.4% expansion in June, indicating an expected slowdown in the latter half of 2025. This stagnation, particularly a contraction in production output, poses a significant challenge for Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the Autumn Budget, where she aims to boost economic growth and manage public debt. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is balancing this soft economic performance with persistent inflation, which rose to 3.8% in July. Analysts predict a rate cut in November, though the central bank's August decision was more cautious, reflecting ongoing fiscal uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 300 South Korean workers, detained in a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, have returned to their home country. This incident has sparked strong reactions from South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Hyundai's chief executive, who warned of the potential negative impact on future US investments. The raid, which also involved 14 non-Koreans, has caused delays in the factory's opening and led to diplomatic negotiations between Seoul and Washington regarding visa options for Korean firms. The event has been described as a "shock" in South Korea, raising concerns about the US-ally relationship and foreign investment climate.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that Gen Z employees are actively driving the adoption of artificial intelligence in workplaces by teaching older colleagues to use AI tools, with nearly two-thirds providing hands-on guidance. This intergenerational knowledge exchange is reshaping office collaboration, with about half of surveyed employees reporting that AI helps bridge generational divides.

This economic stagnation in the UK adds to the Bank of England's considerations for its upcoming monetary policy update. Separately, the European Central Bank maintained its key interest rate in a widely anticipated move. In corporate news, Spanish lender Sabadell's board unanimously recommended rejecting a hostile takeover bid from domestic peer BBVA, while Ryanair's CEO threatened to cut more tickets to Spain due to tax policy disputes.

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper, its low Earth orbit satellite network, has secured its first in-flight WiFi contract with JetBlue, marking a significant step in its competition with SpaceX's dominant Starlink. Despite Starlink's substantial lead in deployed satellites and existing airline partnerships, Kuiper's nascent success injects a fresh challenge into the rapidly expanding satellite-powered internet market. Amazon aims to deploy 1,600 satellites by July 2026, a fraction of Starlink's current constellation, relying on its Blue Origin launches and other commercial providers. The burgeoning market for LEO satellite services is expected to benefit billions lacking internet access and users in remote regions, with global operators planning tens of thousands of launches by 2031.

Critics suggest White's UFC model in boxing could lead to exclusive contracts, limit fighter earnings, and create a monopolistic environment.

While Israel asserts its right to self-defense and adherence to international law, some experts argue that the campaign's intensity, aid blockades, and destruction of infrastructure suggest a breach of these principles. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, and a genocide case against Israel is ongoing at the ICJ.</p>

The article suggests that the US's post-industrial economy struggles to find skilled workers domestically, making such crackdowns detrimental to manufacturing ambitions. It critiques both the Trump and Biden administrations' approaches to industrial policy, highlighting the futility of current strategies.</p>

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, co-founder of Turning Point USA and a close ally of Donald Trump, was fatally shot during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University. The article provides a comprehensive account of the incident, the ongoing manhunt for a "college age" suspect, and the recovery of a high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon.

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned of a US response to what he termed a "witch hunt" against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, following his 27-year prison sentence for plotting a coup. Rubio criticized the conviction, echoing President Donald Trump's earlier imposition of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods in retaliation for Bolsonaro's prosecution. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva denounced the US actions as an infringement on national sovereignty and vowed to retaliate against any unilateral tariff increases, citing US customs data on trade surpluses. This escalating diplomatic and economic tension marks a low point in US-Brazil relations, with analysts predicting a worsening relationship and further US measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison after being convicted by the Supreme Court of plotting a military coup to overturn the 2022 election results. The court found him guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at retaining power, also barring him from public office until 2033. Bolsonaro, who was not present and is under house arrest, has called the trial a "witch hunt." His lawyers plan to appeal the "absurdly excessive" sentence. This conviction marks a historic moment, as Bolsonaro becomes the first former president in Brazil's history to be found guilty of threatening democracy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) serves as a crucial remedy for the current weaknesses in the global multilateral system, which is described as faltering 80 years after World War II. The author argues that the United Nations is increasingly sidelined by unilateral actions and trade wars, with the Global South marginalized in decision-making. The SCO is presented as an alternative governance approach, embodying principles of cooperation among diverse cultures, ideologies, and political systems. It aims to counter fragmentation and the erosion of international law by providing a platform for negotiation and collaboration.</p>
