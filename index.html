          <h2>Texas Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Use of Alien Enemies Act Against Venezuelans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Texas has permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants in the Southern District of Texas, deeming the White House's use of the statute illegal. Judge Rodriguez, a Trump appointee, stated that the act, intended for wartime, was improperly applied to modern immigration policy, particularly concerning the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The ruling, while limited to South Texas, could influence other cases challenging the act's use, and the ACLU praised the decision, emphasizing that the president cannot declare an invasion to invoke wartime authority during peacetime. The Justice Department maintains that judges have no power to intrude on the president’s decisions in matters of foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Harrods, the iconic luxury department store in London, has become the latest British retailer to fall victim to a cyberattack. The store temporarily shut down some systems after detecting unauthorized access attempts, but stated that customer payment data was not compromised. This incident follows similar online breaches targeting Marks & Spencer and Co-op, raising concerns about the vulnerability of high-end businesses to online security breaches. It remains unclear whether the three cyber attacks are connected, however the recent spate of attacks should serve as a "wake-up call" to retailers according to Cody Barrow, former cyber chief at America's National Security Agency, now chief executive of cybersecurity firm EclecticIQ.</p>

          <p>Amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has engaged in diplomatic efforts to ease the situation. Rubio held separate conversations with the Prime Ministers of both countries, reaffirming the U.S.'s commitment to cooperation with India against terrorism while urging both nations to de-escalate tensions. Pakistan claims to have credible intelligence that India is planning an imminent attack, while India hints at a possible military strike against Pakistan, leading to heightened concerns of a potential military confrontation between the nuclear-armed neighbors. The UN Secretary-General has also offered to mediate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that any country or person purchasing oil or petrochemicals from Iran will be subject to secondary sanctions, barring them from doing business with the U.S. This move is part of Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, aimed at completely shutting down the Islamic Republic's oil exports. The announcement, likely directed at China, led to a rise in U.S. crude oil futures and global benchmark Brent. Despite the sanctions, some analysts believe they may not significantly impact Iranian oil flowing to China unless the White House targets Beijing's state-owned enterprises and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Former NBA star Charles Barkley has voiced concerns about Bill Belichick's personal life, specifically his relationship with Jordon Hudson, after a scrutinized television interview. Barkley, a close friend of Belichick, cautioned that the situation is becoming a "slippery slope" and may prompt him to reach out to the former NFL coach. The interview with CBS News raised eyebrows after Hudson appeared to assert control, leading Belichick to claim that interview preconditions were not upheld.

          <p>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz is stepping down from his position to be nominated as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio serving as interim National Security Advisor.

Waltz will face Senate confirmation for the ambassador role. The president thinks sufficient time has passed since the Signal incident that Waltz and Wong's departures could be framed as part of a reorganization.</p>

          <p>The new Syrian government, formed after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, faces significant challenges in unifying the country due to persistent sectarian violence. Recent attacks by Islamist fighters on Druse neighborhoods near Damascus and against the Alawite minority on the Syrian coast have stoked fears among minority groups. Despite promises to integrate rebel factions into a national army, many extremist groups remain outside government control, and various minority groups have formed their own armed militias. These tensions highlight the fragility of the new government's control and the ongoing struggle to establish stability and security for all Syrian communities.</p>

The deal also links World Liberty to Binance, a company under U.S. government oversight for violating money-laundering laws.

A downside surprise could heighten concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on U.S. trading partners.

While Hylton's attorney suggests the friendship ended for reasons beyond the Vado lawsuit, Charlamagne tha God questions the financial viability of Vado's album. Hylton herself stated that the friendship wasn't over because of the Vado album and the lawsuit wasn't brought because they're no longer friends, rather, it was about a simple breach of contract with no communication for a year.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is reversing its approach to innovation by reducing its reliance on automation and increasing its workforce. After introducing the Siren system to streamline orders, the company will halt further deployment and instead expand its "Green Apron service model," hiring new baristas and refining its order management algorithm. CEO Brian Niccol emphasized that the combination of staffing, technology, and customer connection is more effective than relying solely on equipment. While the company is still testing a new sequencing algorithm to reduce wait times, the focus will shift to personal touches and improved in-store experiences.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has ruled that President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and deport Venezuelan immigrants from South Texas was "unlawful." Judge Fernando Rodriguez, Jr., a Trump appointee, stated that Trump's invocation of the act exceeded its scope. The ruling applies to the Southern District of Texas and marks the first time a judge has ruled the act cannot be used against alleged gang members invading the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the decision, stating that the president cannot unilaterally declare an invasion to invoke a wartime authority during peacetime.</p>

          <p>Apple is set to report its second-quarter financial results amidst concerns about President Trump's sweeping tariffs, which could complicate supply chains for consumer electronics. Analysts predict positive results, with an average revenue estimate of $94.56 billion and earnings of $1.62 per share. While Trump initially made an exception for consumer electronics, the long-term impact of the tariffs remains unclear.

          <p>The proposed Dodger Stadium gondola project has encountered a significant obstacle as the California Court of Appeals rejected Metro's approval of the environmental impact report. The project, initially proposed in 2018, requires approvals from multiple agencies, including the Los Angeles City Council and Caltrans. The court's decision mandates that Metro set aside its certification of the EIR and approval of the project until a revised environmental impact report is completed. The California Endowment and the Los Angeles Parks Alliance sued to throw out the report, on the basis Metro had not properly followed state environmental laws in approving it.</p>
