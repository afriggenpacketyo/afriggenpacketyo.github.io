          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Discharges into Waterways by 2030</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:16:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a "water revolution" plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030. Citing the water sector as "broken" and its regulator, Ofwat, as "failing," the government aims to implement tougher measures, including potential prison sentences for non-compliant water company executives. This new target addresses widespread public outrage over river and coastal pollution, though critics note the pledge is political and not legally binding. The plan also includes a UK-wide ban on wet wipes containing plastic.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to hold their first joint army training exercise this month in China's Guangxi region, which shares a border with Vietnam. The Chinese defence ministry stated the drill's theme is "joint border patrol training" and aims to deepen practical cooperation between the two militaries. This move comes as the two nations mark their 75th year of diplomatic relations and follows a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who encouraged cooperation to counter "unilateral bullying." The closer military ties reflect strengthening economic relations, with China being Vietnam's largest trading partner.</p>

          <p>A tourist boat carrying 53 people, mostly Vietnamese families, capsized in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay during a sudden storm, resulting in at least 35 deaths with several people still missing. The vessel, named Wonder Seas, was overwhelmed by severe weather that included hailstones and torrential rain. Rescue efforts, which were hindered by the weather, managed to save 10 people, including a 10-year-old boy who survived in an air pocket. The Vietnamese government has expressed condolences and promised a full investigation into the tragic incident at the popular UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in Italy last year, has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows a protracted legal battle where animal rights groups successfully protested an initial order to euthanize the bear. The incident had sparked a significant debate in Italy over human-wildlife conflict as the region's bear population has grown. The bear, which arrived safely, will now live in a specially constructed, secure enclosure at the German park, where her mother has resided since 2010.</p>

          <p>The official X account of the beloved Sesame Street character Elmo was recently hacked, posting racist and antisemitic content that shocked millions of followers. Sesame Workshop quickly regained control and condemned the posts, but the incident served as a stark reminder of the digital risks faced by even the most trusted global brands. Cybersecurity experts note that hackers often target high-profile accounts to cause chaos and spread division, exploiting vulnerabilities beyond simple password guessing. The event underscores the critical need for robust security measures like multi-factor authentication and regular audits to protect brand reputation.</p>

          <p>A rare pterosaur fossil discovered in northeastern China is challenging long-held beliefs about the diet of these ancient flying reptiles. The fossil of a Sinopterus atavismus, a type of pterodactyloid, contained the first-ever evidence of stomach contents for its kind. Researchers found phytoliths, microscopic mineral deposits from plants, and small quartz crystals, which were likely ingested as gastroliths to help grind tough plant matter. This discovery, published in Science Bulletin, provides the first direct confirmation of herbivory in this group of pterosaurs, shedding new light on the diverse ecosystems of the dinosaur era.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's promises of swift foreign policy victories upon returning to the White House, many of his ambitious goals have not been achieved six months into his term. Pledges to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, force Iran to abandon its nuclear program, and secure numerous trade deals have proven more complex than anticipated. While there have been some achievements, such as increased NATO defense spending, critics argue that his reliance on "force of personality" has been ineffective against entrenched geopolitical realities.

          <p>Six months into a second Trump administration, California has become a primary target for the president's right-wing agenda, leading to a fierce political and legal battle. The administration has deployed troops to Los Angeles, conducted immigration raids, and launched lawsuits against the state over policies on sanctuary cities, transgender athletes, and environmental regulations. In response, California has sued the administration over 30 times on issues like funding cuts and birthright citizenship. This antagonism serves both political bases, allowing Trump to rally his supporters against a liberal bastion while enabling California's Democratic leaders to position themselves as staunch defenders.</p>

The sculpture, installed in 2017 by a leftist city government, was taken down under the orders of a conservative borough president, who cited a lack of legal authorization. Mexico's leftist president, Claudia Sheinbaum, criticized the removal, arguing it erases a significant historical moment that occurred in Mexico, regardless of one's political views on the revolutionaries.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article explores the modern pressures of parenting during the summer, contrasting the author's choice for an unscheduled summer with the necessity for other working parents to use expensive, logistically complex camps. The author argues that recent media trends romanticizing unstructured "'90s summers" often ignore the financial realities and immense mental load placed on parents, particularly mothers. The piece suggests that the debate over summer activities is a symptom of a larger societal failure to support families with affordable childcare and flexible work structures. The desire for a "wild summer" is less about child development and more about parents' desperate need for a reprieve.</p>

Soaring prices, stagnant incomes, and the rise of a right-wing populist party have become major issues for voters, threatening the stability of Ishiba's government. While a poor result won't immediately oust him, it could deepen political uncertainty and increase pressure for him to step down.

The car, now cared for at the National Motor Museum, will be started up ceremonially in front of Campbell's grandson, Don Wales. The event commemorates a pivotal moment in automotive history.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Nearly Half of Hospital Toilet Users Neglect to Wash Hands</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Surrey and a Danish hospital reveals that nearly 44% of people using a hospital toilet do not wash their hands afterward. Researchers used sensors on toilets and sinks over 19 weeks, finding that handwashing rates were particularly low at the beginning and end of the day, as well as during mealtimes. Experts expressed concern over the findings, noting that this poor hygiene behavior can directly impact patient safety by increasing the spread of illnesses. The study calls for more effective behavioral strategies beyond posters to encourage proper handwashing habits.</p>

          <p>The sister of Aamir Siddiqi, a 17-year-old schoolboy murdered in a mistaken-identity killing in 2010, has made a public appeal to the fugitive suspected of ordering the attack. Aamir was stabbed to death in his Cardiff home by two contract killers who went to the wrong address. While the hitmen are serving life sentences, the alleged mastermind, Mohammed Ali Ege, escaped custody in India in 2017 and remains one of Europe's most wanted men. In a new podcast, Aamir's sister, Nishat, urged Ege to hand himself in, stating he is "not truly free" while living a life on the run.</p>

          <p>Typhoon Wipha made landfall in southern China's Guangdong province, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people. The China Meteorological Administration issued an orange alert, its second-highest warning level, as the storm brought winds up to 118 km/h (73 mph) and the threat of extreme downpours. Over 12,000 people were evacuated from sea-based operations, while another 266,000 residents were moved from their homes on land. The typhoon, which has since weakened to a severe tropical storm, also impacted the neighboring provinces of Fujian and Hainan, as well as Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin man, initially the prime suspect in his girlfriend's 2016 murder, was ultimately cleared by data from his Fitbit fitness tracker. Doug Detrie's girlfriend, Nicole Vander Heyden, was found beaten and strangled, and suspicion fell on him after blood was found at their home. However, Detrie's Fitbit data corroborated his story that he was asleep during the time of the murder, showing minimal movement. This high-tech alibi shifted the investigation, and police later used DNA evidence and Google location data to identify and charge another man, George Steven Burch, for the crime.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week in global finance will be dominated by earnings reports from major European banking institutions like Unicredit, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank. Market optimism is high for the financial sector, which is expected to show resilient performance. Simultaneously, all eyes are on the European Central Bank's upcoming policy meeting, where interest rates are expected to remain on hold. However, this decision is shadowed by the looming threat of 30% tariffs on EU imports by the U.S., a move that analysts believe would likely force the ECB to cut rates in response.
