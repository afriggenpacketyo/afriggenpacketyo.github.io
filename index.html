          <p>Pentagon investigators are examining whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth personally composed text messages containing military plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen, or if other staffers were involved. The inquiry, led by the Defense Departmentâ€™s Office of Inspector General, involves interviewing current and former staff members to determine how classified strike details ended up on the Signal messaging app. The information was shared in chat groups that included Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth's wife, who isn't a government employee. Investigators are also probing whether staff members were instructed to delete messages, as the government is legally obligated to retain federal communications as official records. </p>

          <p>A public falling-out between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk has raised concerns among Republicans about potential divisions within the party ahead of the midterm elections. The feud, triggered by Musk's criticisms of Trump's "big, beautiful bill," escalated into personal attacks on social media. Some Republicans worry that Musk's departure from Trump's inner circle could undermine negotiations on key legislative issues. While some downplay the long-term impact, others acknowledge Musk's influence and the potential for his criticism to sway public opinion.</p>

Vance defended the bill, asserting that its primary goal was to extend the 2017 tax cuts, while also dismissing Musk's claims about Epstein as unhelpful and untrue.</p>

          <p>Slate Auto, an EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is developing an affordable, customizable electric pickup truck with a target starting price under $20,000. The company is using a beta production facility in Michigan to build vehicles for testing and certification, with plans to begin deliveries by the end of next year. Slate's vehicle features a modular design with injected-molded composite exteriors and simplified manufacturing to reduce costs. While the company has garnered significant interest with over 100,000 reservations, it faces challenges in scaling up production and navigating the competitive EV market.</p>

          <p>The NHS app in England will become the primary method of communication for millions more patients, with the goal of saving the health service Â£200 million over three years. A Â£50 million investment will enable the app to deliver test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders directly to smartphones. Patients without app access will receive text messages and letters, with NHS phone lines being freed up. The government hopes the changes will enhance patient access and decision-making, with over 11 million people using the app monthly.</p>

          <p>The Russia-backed Wagner Group announced its departure from Mali after more than three and a half years of fighting Islamic extremists, though Russia will continue to have a mercenary presence in the country. The Africa Corps, a state-controlled paramilitary force, stated that Wagner's exit would not bring any changes and the Russian contingent would remain in Mali. The announcement comes as the Malian army and Russian mercenaries have suffered significant losses during attacks by the al-Qaida linked group JNIM in recent weeks. Replacing Wagner with Africa Corps troops would likely shift Russia's focus in Mali from fighting alongside the Malian army to training, said Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation.</p>

          <p>An upcoming Spending Review in the UK is set to reveal a substantial increase in overall government spending, but the specifics of how those funds will be allocated remain unclear. The review, spanning from 2010 to 2030, shows a steep rise in spending under the Labour government, with total real-terms spending projected to exceed Â£650 billion by 2029-30. While the government aims to highlight its commitment to investment, concerns linger over whether the increased spending will adequately address the needs of all departments, with some potentially facing continued financial strain. This article suggests that this is not a spending review designed for long-term growth, but rather short-term electoral success.</p>
