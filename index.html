        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large international study of nearly 300,000 children reveals a two-way link between screen time and emotional well-being. Increased use of devices like TVs, tablets, and gaming consoles is associated with a higher risk of aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Conversely, children with existing social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens. The study emphasizes that while moderate screen time, especially for educational purposes, is not harmful, excessive use can interfere with sleep, physical activity, and social interaction, highlighting the importance of setting limits for children. The findings suggest parents should encourage alternative emotional outlets for their children.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing intense protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, leading to the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines. Demonstrations erupted in response to President Trump's immigration crackdown, with protesters blocking freeways and setting vehicles ablaze. California Governor Gavin Newsom has sued the Trump administration over the deployment of troops, calling it an illegal federalization of the National Guard. The protests have resulted in numerous arrests and property damage, raising tensions between local officials and the federal government, and highlighting the ongoing debate over immigration policy and federal overreach.</p>

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have been deployed to the Los Angeles area to assist National Guard troops in response to protests over federal immigration enforcement. California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the deployment of troops onto city streets, arguing it is an overreach of federal power. The U.S. Northern Command states the Marines will integrate with the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property, with training in de-escalation and crowd control. The legal challenge underscores the conflict between state and federal authorities regarding immigration enforcement and the use of military personnel in civilian law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian Air Force (UAF) has reportedly achieved its first air-to-air kill using a Lockheed Martin F-16, shooting down a Russian Sukhoi Su-35S fighter-bomber. The engagement allegedly occurred near Korenevo in the Kursk region of Russia, with support from a Saab 340 airborne early warning and control plane. The F-16, originally from the Netherlands, arrived in Ukraine in August 2024 as part of efforts to modernize the country's aging Soviet-era fleet. This success validates the theory that F-16s can alter the balance of power in the air, making it more difficult for Russia to strike with impunity.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Vaihingen an der Enz, Germany, have uncovered a grave containing the bodies of a woman and young girl dating back to 400 B.C. The arrangement of the skeletons suggests the bodies were "dumped" rather than respectfully buried. Both decedents wore jewelry from the Celtic period, including bronze arm rings and a necklace with blue glass beads. The discovery was part of a larger excavation yielding over a thousand archaeological finds, including other graves, longhouses, and tools.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asserted that President Trump has the authority to deploy National Guard and active-duty troops anywhere in the country to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. This assertion, if carried out, could lead to a significant clash between the Trump administration and Democratic governors. The testimony comes as troops are being deployed to Los Angeles, prompting criticism from lawmakers and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who view the move as inflammatory and an escalation of tensions.

          <p>The movie Ballerina, a spin-off "From the World of John Wick," follows Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas) on a quest for vengeance after her father is killed. The film expands the John Wick universe rather than deepening its protagonist. One sequence sees Eve dueling an enemy while each wields flamethrowers; in another, she has to dispatch oncoming aggressors using belts of grenades without blowing herself up. Ballerina ultimately succeeds as a piece of junky fun because it attempts to expand the Wick canon rather than deepen its titular protagonist.</p>

Abrego Garcia's lawyers argue that the Maryland court case is not over, as the government must be held accountable for its previous violations of court orders.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta contends that the deployments are not needed and only add to tensions sparked by immigration detentions and arrests.

          <p>Republican US House speaker Mike Johnson advocated for a brutal form of vigilante justice to be performed on the Democratic California governor, Gavin Newsom, on Tuesday, saying he should be “tarred and feathered” for his opposition to immigration agents’ enforcement actions in the state. Newsom replied, noting Johnson's statement was fitting given Republicans want to bring our country back to the 18th century, when what is now the US was ruled by a monarch. Johnson's comment follows days of verbal sparring between Trump, members of his administration and elected officials in California in response to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raids on Los Angeles businesses, the protests that followed and the ordering of national guard troops and marines into the city.</p>
