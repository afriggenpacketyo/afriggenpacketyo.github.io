          <p>During a House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faced questions regarding the cost and resources involved in deploying the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles amidst immigration protests. Rep. Betty McCollum pressed Hegseth on the financial implications and potential diversion of resources, but Hegseth did not directly answer. Hegseth defended the deployment by asserting ICE's right to conduct operations nationwide and drawing parallels to the 2020 George Floyd protests, insisting that the Marines are adequately trained for domestic missions, which McCollum disputed. The article highlights the ongoing debate over the use of military personnel in domestic law enforcement scenarios.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert suggests that couples can reduce conflict and improve their relationship satisfaction by using a "relationship bank account." This involves making regular "deposits" through actions that prioritize the partner's happiness and create a sense of security. A positive balance in this account allows couples to handle disagreements more effectively, while a negative balance can lead to escalating fights. The expert recommends identifying what makes each partner feel loved and appreciated to determine the specific actions that will strengthen the relationship.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is bracing for a fifth day of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, with active-duty Marines potentially joining National Guard troops in the city. Tensions have risen after President Trump's deployment of the National Guard, leading to freeway blockades and incidents of violence. California has sued the Trump administration for deploying the Guard without consulting Governor Newsom, who has also threatened further legal action over the use of Marines. The protests reflect a broader conflict between state and federal authorities over immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>CoreCivic, the largest private prison operator in the U.S., is facing a lawsuit after an inmate was allegedly killed by his cellmate a day before his scheduled release. The lawsuit claims that cost-cutting and understaffing at the South Central Correctional Facility in Tennessee, which is operated by CoreCivic, contributed to the inmate's death. The case highlights concerns about safety and staffing levels in private prisons, especially in light of the Trump administration's renewed use of private prison systems for federal agencies. The article discusses CoreCivic's history of staffing deficiencies and high turnover rates, as well as legislative efforts in Tennessee to address the issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK companies are showing reluctance to hire new staff or replace departing employees, leading to a decrease in job vacancies, according to official figures. The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest in almost four years. This trend is attributed to increased employment costs, including higher National Insurance contributions paid by employers and a rise in the minimum wage. The figures suggest a weakening in the labor market, with businesses potentially reducing headcount to offset rising costs.</p>

Policy experts warn that these new rules could burden eligible filers and potentially delay tax refunds, particularly amid IRS cutbacks.

          <p>A promising HIV vaccine project, nearing clinical trials after nearly 15 years of research, is facing termination due to funding cuts by the Trump administration.

The cuts are part of a broader trend of reduced funding for HIV vaccine research, raising concerns about the future prospects of developing an effective vaccine. The article highlights the challenges of securing sustained funding for long-term scientific research and the potential consequences of these cuts on public health.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended his government's decision to partially reverse cuts to winter fuel payments, attributing the change to an improved economy rather than political pressure. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of Â£35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. The government had previously announced it would remove the payments from more than 10 million pensioners, but faced pressure from charities, unions, and backbench MPs. The move has drawn criticism from opposition parties and think tanks, who question the economic rationale and potential complexity of the policy.</p>
