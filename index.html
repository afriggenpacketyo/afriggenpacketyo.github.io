          <p>Following a meeting with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, former President Donald Trump stated his belief that the central bank is prepared to begin lowering interest rates. Trump described the meeting as positive, interpreting Powell's comments about the country's economic well-being as a signal for forthcoming monetary policy easing. This contrasts with the Fed's public stance of holding rates steady to monitor the effects of tariffs on inflation. The White House has continued to advocate for lower rates to support the economy, particularly the housing market, while also scrutinizing the Fed's operational management and renovation project.

          <p>Volkswagen has reduced its full-year guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, largely due to a €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) hit from U.S. tariffs in the first half of the year. The German automaker now forecasts a 2025 operating return on sales between 4% and 5%, down from its previous estimate, as it navigates challenges from tariffs and robust competition. Despite the financial setbacks, the company saw a 19% rise in vehicle order intake in Western Europe and a 62% increase in all-electric vehicle orders globally, indicating strong product demand.

The court heard that Thorpe, 55, had spiraled into depression after losing his job and had previously asked his wife for help to end his life. Despite this, healthcare professionals did not perceive him to be in a crisis situation, and he had not been seen in person for four months. The coroner noted these failings but stated they did not amount to gross misconduct, leaving it uncertain whether a different outcome was possible.</p>

These strategies include purchasing an immediate or deferred income annuity to create a personal pension, utilizing a reverse mortgage to tap into home equity, or maximizing catch-up contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs in the years leading up to retirement.

          <p>Elon Musk's satellite internet service, Starlink, suffered a significant network outage that lasted approximately 2.5 hours, affecting users globally. At its peak, the tracking site Downdetector recorded over 60,000 reports of service issues. The outage occurred shortly after T-Mobile announced the public availability of its new satellite-powered service, which utilizes the Starlink network to provide connectivity in remote areas. Musk apologized for the disruption on social media, and a SpaceX executive later confirmed that service had been mostly recovered, with a full restoration announced hours later.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, analysts report that the country's situation has deteriorated, not improved. The junta, led by General Abdourahmane Tchiani, cited insecurity and economic hardship as justification for the takeover, but has since cracked down on civil liberties, forced NGOs to shut down, and deepened the country's isolation by withdrawing from the ECOWAS regional bloc. This has led to significant job losses in the non-profit sector and a worsening of human rights, with rights groups accusing the regime of suppressing opposition, media, and civil society.</p>

          <p>Germany's postal services, particularly market leader Deutsche Post/DHL, are experiencing a surge in customer complaints, with nearly 23,000 filed in the first half of the year. Consumers report significant delays, damaged parcels, and mail not being delivered at all, a problem that has worsened since 2022 following job cuts and price increases. Unions blame ongoing restructuring and layoffs for the decline in service quality. While Deutsche Post attributes some issues to recent heatwaves and changes in delivery laws, the volume of complaints suggests a systemic problem with reliability.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's announcement that France will recognize a Palestinian state has increased diplomatic pressure on the United Kingdom to follow suit. The French hope this bold move will generate momentum, but the UK has traditionally been more cautious, preferring to use recognition as a final lever in a long-term peace settlement rather than a starting point. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government now faces a difficult political choice, balancing pressure from its own MPs and allies against the risk of upsetting the U.S. and Israel, who oppose the move.</p>

          <p>A provision in the American Rescue Plan that made student loan forgiveness tax-free at the federal level is set to expire at the end of 2025. Without new legislation, borrowers who have their debt canceled under income-driven repayment (IDR) plans will once again face a significant federal tax bill on the forgiven amount. Experts warn this could be substantial, as the IRS typically treats forgiven debt as income; a borrower with an average IDR balance of $57,000 could owe over $12,000 in taxes. Consumer advocates criticize the policy as counterproductive, replacing one form of debt with another. (not investment advice)</p>
