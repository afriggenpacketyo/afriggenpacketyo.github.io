          <h2>Transportation Department Replaces Lawyers in Congestion Pricing Lawsuit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 18:28:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation replaced its federal lawyers in a lawsuit over New York City's congestion pricing program after accusing them of undermining the department's efforts to end the toll. This move followed the U.S. attorney's office mistakenly filing a confidential memo questioning the department's legal strategy. The memo, dated April 11, warned that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's rationale for ending the tolling plan was weak and likely to fail. The department raised the possibility that the disclosure attempted to sabotage its efforts to halt congestion pricing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk's efforts to cut bureaucratic fat in the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have yielded less savings than promised. While Musk initially pledged to save taxpayers $1 trillion, he now estimates savings of only $150 billion. The Partnership for Public Service estimates that firings, re-hirings, lost productivity, and paid leave will cost upwards of $135 billion this fiscal year. At the Internal Revenue Service, a DOGE-driven exodus of 22,000 employees would cost about $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026 alone.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is giving migrants as few as 12 hours to contest their deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, according to an unsealed ICE document. This document, revealed in a Texas federal court, outlines that migrants are given a minimum of 12 hours to express intent to file a habeas petition and 24 hours to actually file it. The ACLU has criticized this timeframe as insufficient. This comes after the Supreme Court temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelan criminals under the Alien Enemies Act, contested by Justices Alito and Thomas.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the U.S. government to take steps toward mining the ocean floor in international waters, despite an international treaty ratified by most major coastal nations. The executive order instructs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to expedite permits for companies to mine in both international and U.S. territorial waters. This move is likely to provoke international criticism and is seen as another example of the Trump administration's disregard for international institutions. The White House claims it establishes the U.S. as a global leader in seabed mineral exploration.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization is selling "Trump 2028" hats and T-shirts, fueling speculation about President Trump seeking a third term in the White House. The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution prohibits a person from being elected president more than twice. Trump has previously teased the idea of running for a third term, which would require amending the Constitution. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the hat "cool" and predicted it would be highly popular.</p>
