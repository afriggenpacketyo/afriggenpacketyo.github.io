          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury testimony from Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal case, calling the Department of Justice's reasoning "demonstrably false." Judge Paul Engelmayer stated the materials would not reveal significant new information about Jeffrey Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes and suggested the move could be a political "diversion." The judge emphasized that the transcripts do not contain a "client list" or new details about Epstein's death, countering public speculation fueled by right-wing influencers. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is set to hold a news conference detailing plans to address what he terms a crisis of violent crime and uncleanliness in Washington, D.C. He has suggested a potential federal takeover, including deploying the National Guard and removing homeless encampments, to restore order and beautify the capital. This comes despite official police data showing a year-to-date decrease in overall crime. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has contested Trump's claims, highlighting that crime rates have been driven down significantly since a spike in 2023 and are at a 30-year low.</p>

          <p>Enterprise artificial intelligence firm C3 AI saw its stock plummet by over 20% following the announcement of disappointing preliminary first-quarter financial results and a sales organization restructuring. The company projects revenue between $70.2 million and $70.4 million, a significant drop from the previous year's $87.2 million. CEO Thomas Siebel attributed the poor performance to the reorganization's disruptive effects and his own health issues, which have prompted a search for his successor. Despite the setback, Siebel expressed confidence in the company's future ability to accelerate its growth.</p>

          <p>Forecasters have announced the formation of Tropical Storm Erin in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, which has the potential to strengthen into the first hurricane of the current season. This development occurs within a season that the National Weather Service has predicted to be above-normal, with an expected 13 to 18 named storms. A storm is classified as a hurricane when its sustained wind speeds reach at least 74 mph.

          <p>According to business academic and author Suzy Welch, long-term career success is a function of three key elements she calls PIE: Personal relationships, Ideas, and Execution. Rather than forced networking, she advocates for building genuine friendships, which create stronger and more reliable professional support systems. Success also requires a few original, high-impact ideas, which can range from transformative business models to simple process improvements. Finally, Welch highlights execution as the most underrated skill, noting that the ability to reliably complete projects is highly valued by leaders and is a critical driver of career advancement.</p>

In a Financial Times piece, Moritz described Trump's attack as a "vindictive political sideshow" with no modern precedent and urged the Intel board to show "backbone" by standing with their CEO. Moritz, who has known Tan for decades, praised his past success in turning around Cadence Design Systems and asserted he is the best person to lead Intel's transformation. The controversy arose from concerns raised by Trump and Senator Tom Cotton over Tan's ties to Chinese companies.</p>

This move ensures that staff will receive a share of future profits and have a say in the company's operations.

          <p>A new bill introduced by Republican lawmakers in Texas aims to allow private citizens to file lawsuits against anyone involved in the manufacturing, distribution, or prescription of abortion-inducing medication. The proposal, known as the Women and Child Protection Act, would also permit wrongful death lawsuits if the medication harms a fetus or the mother. This legislation seeks to bypass shield laws in other states that protect doctors who prescribe the pills via telemedicine. The bill represents a new legal strategy to further restrict abortion access in Texas, where mailing these drugs is already illegal.</p>

          <p>A new executive order signed by President Donald Trump, titled "Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking," is drawing sharp criticism from the scientific community for potentially politicizing research funding. The order gives political appointees the authority to overrule scientific peer review panels and terminate grants based on political priorities, citing a need to stop funding "far-left initiatives." Scientists, including a Nobel laureate, have condemned the move as a "Soviet-style" attack on scientific freedom that replaces merit with ideological loyalty.

However, some analysts are cautious, noting that most of these female candidates are with smaller parties, suggesting the move may be more strategic than a fundamental shift toward gender inclusion.

Due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs currently provide higher returns than long-term ones.

While analysts see this as a net positive for the companies—as 85% of revenue is better than zero—it sets a strange precedent.

          <p>Everton has reportedly reached an agreement with Manchester City for a season-long loan of winger Jack Grealish. The 29-year-old playmaker, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, has fallen out of favor with manager Pep Guardiola, making only seven league starts last season. After being integral to City's 2022-23 Treble-winning season, his form and playing time have since declined significantly. The move to Everton offers Grealish an opportunity to rejuvenate his career with regular playing time and potentially win back his spot in the England national squad.</p>

          <p>Shares of major lithium producers like Albemarle and Sociedad Química y Minera surged after Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest EV battery maker, suspended operations at its Jianxiawo mine in China. The mine, a crucial part of the Yichun lithium hub, was shuttered after its permit expired, causing lithium prices to spike. The company is seeking to renew its license and will be closed for at least three months, tightening an already constrained global supply. This development highlights lithium's critical role in the growing market for electric vehicles and electronics.</p>

          <p>Shares of AMC Entertainment jumped 8% after the movie theater chain announced better-than-expected second-quarter financial results. The company reported revenue of nearly $1.4 billion and narrowed its net loss to just $4.7 million, or 1 cent per share, a significant improvement from the previous year. CEO Adam Aron credited the performance to a recovering box office, a 26% increase in attendance, and growth in premium offerings. The company also successfully restructured its debt, pushing maturities from 2026 to 2029, which Aron says provides a solid foundation for future growth.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in China fell by 5% in July compared to the previous month, totaling 1.26 million units, marking the first month-on-month decline since May. This dip is attributed to weaker consumer demand as automakers scaled back the significant price cuts they had been offering. The average discount on cars fell in July after the government warned against escalating price wars, fearing they could undermine the industry's stability. Despite the monthly drop, the sales volume still represents a 27.4% increase compared to the same period last year, showing continued annual growth.</p>

          <p>According to author Morgan Housel, a common mistake, especially among highly intelligent investors, is overcomplicating their investment strategy, which often leads to worse results. He, along with experts like Warren Buffett, advocates for a simple, "boring" approach focused on consistency over long periods. The most effective tool for this is periodically investing in low-cost index funds, such as those tracking the S&P 500. This passive strategy aims to match market returns, which historically outperforms the majority of active money managers and harnesses the market's long-term upward trend with less risk.

The incident caused at least 60 million euros in damages and is viewed by Western officials as part of a broader pattern of sabotage linked to Moscow.

          <p>Ten years after China's surprise devaluation of the yuan sent shockwaves through global markets, analysts note that Beijing's approach to managing its currency has significantly matured. The 2015 reform, which triggered capital flight and depleted nearly a trillion dollars in foreign reserves, taught valuable lessons. Today, China employs a more diverse toolkit to manage volatility, reducing its reliance on direct intervention and keeping reserves stable. The key challenge ahead is whether the yuan can achieve greater internationalization and market-based pricing without causing destabilizing swings in the future.</p>
