          <p>Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million Switch 2 units in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking its first sales forecast since announcing the Switch's successor, due in June. The company's fourth-quarter revenue fell 24.7% year-on-year, with profits plunging nearly 50% as consumers await the new console. Nintendo delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in the U.S. due to potential tariffs on Vietnamese-manufactured consoles, which could significantly impact profits if imposed. President Shuntaro Furukawa noted that U.S. tariffs could decrease demand if prices are adjusted, potentially affecting profit by tens of billions of yen.</p>

          <p>Toyota anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit for fiscal year 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, projecting a net profit of 3.1 trillion yen. Operating profit is expected to fall by 20.8% to 3.8 trillion yen, despite estimated record sales of 48.5 trillion yen. The automaker estimates that U.S. trade policies could reduce operating profit by 180 billion yen, factoring in the impact for two months. Toyota President Koji Sato acknowledged the difficulty in forecasting due to the fluid nature of the tariffs and stated that the company will continue to develop products tailored to local customers.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has achieved a significant trade agreement with the U.S., marking the first deal of its kind since President Donald Trump initiated global tariffs. This accomplishment follows a recent free trade agreement between the UK and India, estimated to boost bilateral trade by £25.5 billion and increase UK GDP by £4.8 billion. The agreement provides a political boost for Starmer, who faced pressure after recent local election results, and underscores his warm relationship with President Trump. The deal is expected to reduce tariffs on specific goods, including British steel and cars, while addressing U.S. interests in pharmaceuticals and technology.</p>

          <p>Chinese defense stocks are experiencing a surge following escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly after Pakistan's alleged use of Chinese-made weapons. Pakistan's Foreign Minister claimed that Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets were deployed in a recent clash with India's air force. AVIC, the manufacturer of the J-10C fighter jets, saw its Hong Kong-listed shares rise, while Shenzhen-listed stocks of AVIC Chengdu Aircraft also surged. Yang Zi, associate research fellow at the S.

          <p>An interim report states that the cause of a fire that shut down Heathrow Airport, affecting hundreds of thousands of journeys, "remains unknown." The airport was closed on March 21 after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence of suspicious activity. The National Energy System Operator (Neso) is conducting an investigation, with a final report due by the end of June, to determine the cause and prevent future incidents. Heathrow said it welcomed the interim findings and hoped the final report would provide answers.</p>

          <p>Toyota presented a significantly more somber outlook, projecting that its operating profit would decline by about one-fifth for the fiscal year ending in March. It cited headwinds from a stronger yen and predicted a $1.3 billion hit from President Trump’s tariffs in April and May alone. The murkiness of Toyota’s forecast underscores how the whiplash of Mr. Trump’s tariff agenda is upheaving the auto industry and leaving many global companies unable to estimate future prospects. A 25 percent tariff on vehicle imports into the United States, implemented early last month, was extended to auto parts last week.</p>

Using a "digital prosthetic" created with artificial intelligence and a script based on her writings and archival interviews, a real actor portrays Christie. While her family approved the project with the stipulation that it use her own words, some ethicists raise concerns about the posthumous use of her likeness. The debate centers on whether such representations, even with consent from the estate, constitute a deepfake and potentially misrepresent the author's views.</p>

          <p>A rapid analysis by leading climate scientists reveals that the historic storm that caused death and destruction across the central Mississippi valley in early April was made significantly more likely and more severe by burning fossil fuels. Record quantities of rain were dumped across eight southern and midwestern states, causing widespread catastrophic flooding. The floods were caused by rainfall made about 9% more intense and 40% more likely by human-caused climate change. Uncertainty in models means the role of the climate crisis was probably even higher.</p>

          <p>China's hypersonic weapons can travel at extreme speeds of up to Mach 20, strike global targets within half an hour and even be launched from space, according to a new study. Researchers from the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) summarized the capabilities and vulnerabilities of China’s re-entry glide missiles, revealing they can travel up to 21,000km/h (13,000 miles per hour) in high altitudes within the atmosphere. Certain variants may even be launched from space-based platforms, making them “capable of drastically compressing the adversary’s early-warning system response time and operational scope, thereby enhancing the probability of successful penetration”.</p>

          <p>The deadly storms that struck eight U.S. states in early April were made significantly worse by climate change, according to a new study. Analysis from World Weather Attribution found that human-caused global warming increased the record-breaking downpours by about 9%. The study noted that unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than normal due to climate change, fueled the storm's intensity, making the storms 14 times more likely. Without a rapid shift away from fossil fuels, extreme weather is expected to become even more common and intense.</p>

          <p>Russia's allies in Eastern Europe say Brussels plans to end all Russian gas and energy imports in the coming years are tantamount to "economic suicide" and a threat to the region's energy security and economy. The European Commission announced plans on Tuesday to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2027, saying the move "paves the way to ensure the EU's full energy independence from Russia." Slovakia and Hungary, whose governments have maintained warm ties with Moscow despite the war in Ukraine, described the EU's latest plans as a "serious mistake" that would harm the region.</p>

The government has commissioned an independent sentencing review to explore alternatives to prison in an attempt to ease overcrowding.

          <p>China's steel exports are set to slump in the second quarter, threatening to exacerbate a supply glut at home, analysts and traders said, as the trade war and a wave of protectionism moving in its wake crimps export markets. Second-quarter shipments from the world's largest steel producer and exporter are forecast to fall by up to a fifth from the first quarter, said eight analysts and traders, who also expect exports to worsen further later in the year. Steel exports have been hit by a double blow as Washington's tariffs choke off the transshipment trade, where third countries resell Chinese steel to the U.S., and top customers like South Korea and Vietnam impose their own duties to avoid steel then being rerouted and dumped in their markets.</p>

India had said it offended the global Buddhist community. Sotheby's said the suspension would allow for discussions between the parties. A British official named William Claxton Peppé unearthed the relics in northern India nearly 130 years ago, alongside bone fragments identified as belonging to the Buddha himself.</p>
