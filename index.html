          <p>Reddit has filed a lawsuit against Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company, alleging that Anthropic illegally scraped millions of user comments to train its chatbot, Claude. Reddit claims that Anthropic used automated bots to access its content despite being asked not to do so, and trained on user data without consent. Anthropic disputes these claims and intends to defend itself vigorously. Reddit has licensing agreements with other AI companies like Google and OpenAI, allowing them to train their AI systems on Reddit data, and these agreements enable Reddit to protect user data and prevent spam.</p>

While China aims to promote a multipolar world, analysts caution that divergent world views and competing national interests could undermine this vision.

          <p>President Trump's recent pardons have been criticized as "patronage pardoning," reducing the expected penalty for loyalist misconduct by pardoning political allies. This practice is seen as a way to protect and reward loyalism, even when it involves criminal behavior. Critics argue that this undermines the rule of law by making regime loyalists less responsive to the threat of criminal punishment. This governance model treats law-enforcement institutions as tools of regime compliance, prosecuting enemies and sparing friends.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is developing a plan to limit the amount of time people can receive federal rental subsidies and add work requirements as a condition of funding. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) aims to vastly expand the number of local housing authorities with the power to impose such restrictions. Millions of people could be subject to these new restrictions, although the elderly and disabled would be exempt. Critics argue that time limits and work requirements do not increase employment or help people move off subsidies.</p>

          <p>The parents of a 7-year-old boy who was fatally struck by a car in Gastonia, North Carolina, have been charged with manslaughter and remain in jail on $1.5 million bond.

Police said the children were unsupervised at the time the boy stepped into traffic, leading to the charges against the parents.

The state's three big for-profit electric utilities are now lobbying in Sacramento to reduce credits for Californians who installed their panels before April 15, 2023.
