          <p>The UK economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the previous quarter but significantly better than the 0.1% growth that had been forecasted. This positive performance was primarily driven by the services and construction sectors, with officials noting a strong recovery in June after a weaker April and May. Despite the better-than-expected figures, which led some banks to revise annual growth forecasts upward, economists remain cautious about future growth due to the weak global economy and potential impacts from tax policies.

          <p>Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer Foxconn reported a 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, surpassing analyst expectations. This significant growth is attributed to the surging demand for its artificial intelligence server business, which has become a key partner for Nvidia. For the first time, sales from server products constituted the largest share of the company's revenue at 41%, overtaking its smart consumer electronics division. The company anticipates its AI server business will continue to drive growth, though it remains watchful of evolving global political and economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

For older generations, borrowing is often considered acceptable only for major purchases like a home, a sentiment that persists even among some younger Chinese individuals. This debt-averse mindset presents a significant hurdle for Beijing's efforts to stimulate the economy by encouraging consumer spending through loans. The article suggests that this traditional financial prudence could limit the effectiveness of the government's economic stimulus measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department's decision to designate the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization is seen as a significant boost to Pakistan's counterterrorism efforts. This move by the Trump administration is also expected to have positive side effects for regional stability, particularly for China. Analysts suggest that the designation could alleviate Beijing's concerns over terrorist attacks in the region, which have often targeted Chinese nationals and interests. This shared security concern might create an opportunity for increased counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and China, facilitated through their mutual partner, Pakistan.</p>

Unlike primary sanctions that restrict a country's own citizens, secondary sanctions target third-party entities that do business with a sanctioned country, pressuring them to comply or risk losing access to the U.S. market and financial system. The article notes their use against countries like Iran and Venezuela, and discusses a proposed U.S. bill to apply them to entities trading with Russia.

          <p>Despite its reputation for financial stability, a growing number of workers in Singapore are living paycheck to paycheck, with a 2024 study finding the figure at 60%. Experts attribute this trend to a combination of rising living costs in the expensive city-state and a cultural shift among younger generations who prioritize experiences over long-term savings. Macroeconomic factors, including inflation outpacing wage growth and high housing costs, have shrunk residents' purchasing power. This financial pressure is compounded by aspirational spending and the increased accessibility of "buy now, pay later" services, reflecting a change from the more frugal habits of previous generations.

          <p>As students consider higher education, this article explores the increasing financial burden of attending university in the UK. Annual tuition fees in England and Wales have risen to £9,535, and students also face sharply rising living and accommodation costs, with some estimates suggesting a three-year degree could cost over £60,000 in living expenses alone. The article discusses changes to student loan repayment rules in England, which will likely result in graduates paying back more over a longer period. While most graduates still earn more than non-graduates, the financial return can vary significantly depending on the subject studied and university attended. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that "bleisure" travel, the blending of business and leisure trips, is a widespread practice, with 55% of business travelers admitting to having loved ones join them. The trend is even more common among C-suite executives, with 73% having brought partners, children, or friends along. Travelers cite companionship and the ability to reclaim family time as key motivations. Others point to significant cost savings, as company-covered expenses like hotels and flights can make a personal vacation more affordable. While many companies quietly accept the practice, employees often navigate a policy gray area regarding expenses and insurance.</p>

          <p>Residents of Anchorage, Alaska, are reacting with a mix of curiosity and concern as their city prepares to host a high-stakes summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. While some are excited about the international attention, many express trepidation about the potential outcomes, with some satirically pleading, "Please don’t sell us back." The city has hosted high-profile diplomatic meetings before, but the presence of the two controversial leaders has sparked both anxiety and a wave of local humor. Alaskans, who see Russia as a close and sometimes hostile neighbor, remain wary of Putin and skeptical of Trump's intentions for the meeting.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have dropped out of first place in the NL West for the first time since April after a 6-5 loss to the Los Angeles Angels completed a historic season-series sweep. The loss followed a familiar, frustrating pattern for the Dodgers, who took an early lead but failed to extend it before their struggling bullpen faltered late in the game. A go-ahead, two-run single by the Angels' Logan O’Hoppe in the eighth inning sealed the defeat. The Dodgers now find themselves one game behind the San Diego Padres, whom they are set to face in a critical upcoming series.</p>

          <p>A federal trial concerning President Trump's deployment of the California National Guard to Los Angeles has concluded, with the presiding judge questioning the limits of presidential power. The lawsuit, filed by Governor Gavin Newsom, challenges the deployment under the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally bars domestic use of the military for law enforcement. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer expressed puzzlement at the Justice Department's argument that the act was irrelevant and that there were no clear limits on the president's ability to create a "national police force." The case highlights the constitutional tensions between federal authority and states' rights regarding control of the military.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to deploy a significant number of federalized National Guard troops along the National Mall in Washington, D.C., as part of a stated effort to address crime. According to a source familiar with the plan, the intention is for the public to wake up to a visible military presence in the capital's tourist-heavy center. This extraordinary move follows President Trump's announcement to mobilize 800 troops and take control of the city's police department. While a president can activate the Guard to protect federal property, the purpose of this large-scale deployment in a relatively safe area remains unclear.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit filed by environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe against an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades has concluded its initial hearing, with the judge seeking clarity on who controls the facility. The plaintiffs argue that the center, which they say is a de facto federal operation, was built without the required environmental assessments under federal law. Lawyers for Florida and the Trump administration contend it is a state facility, and therefore not subject to the same federal regulations. The case highlights concerns about the facility's impact on the fragile ecosystem and protected species like the Florida panther.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of American adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline coincides with a growing belief, particularly among young people, that even moderate drinking is unhealthy. Only 50% of adults aged 18-34 reported drinking, and this group is more likely to view moderate consumption as harmful. Experts suggest the trend is driven by increased health awareness, the social acceptability of not drinking, and financial pressures, which may lead younger generations to view alcohol as a luxury.</p>

Lai, a British citizen, faces a potential life sentence on charges of colluding with foreign forces under a controversial law imposed by China in 2020. His case is widely seen by critics as a key indicator of the erosion of political freedoms and the weaponization of the legal system in the former British colony. International leaders and rights groups have called for the 77-year-old's release, while his family fears a long sentence would be a death penalty given his age and health.</p>
