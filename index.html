        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally require states to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement as a condition for receiving certain emergency preparedness grants. The decision sides with 20 states that argued the policy unlawfully held critical disaster funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) hostage to compel compliance with immigration agent requests. U.S. District Judge William Smith deemed the administration's requirement to be "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional." This ruling marks a significant setback for the administration's ongoing efforts to financially penalize cities and states with "sanctuary" policies that limit local law enforcement's collaboration with ICE.</p>

          <p>Oscar Rodriguez, a former sheriff's deputy in Riverside County, was sentenced to one year in jail and ten years of probation for killing his girlfriend's ex-partner while on duty. A jury had convicted him of voluntary manslaughter after a civil lawsuit revealed he had a personal relationship with the victim's ex-girlfriend and had ambushed the man outside his home. The district attorney’s office strongly objected to the sentence, having recommended a 10-year prison term, stating that it minimizes the gravity of the crime. The victim's family settled a civil suit with the county for nearly $7 million, arguing Rodriguez abused his power.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas, killing one detainee and critically injuring two others before taking his own life. The shooter, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, reportedly fired from a nearby rooftop, and the FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted attack. Evidence found near the suspect included ammunition with engraved "anti-ICE" messages, intensifying the national debate over political rhetoric surrounding the agency. This event follows other recent security threats and attacks on ICE facilities in Texas, prompting widespread condemnation from lawmakers across the political spectrum.</p>

The popular online contest allows the public to vote for the bear they believe has best prepared for winter hibernation by gaining the most weight. The event highlights the natural cycle of the bears along the Brooks River, who can gain hundreds of pounds by feasting on salmon. It serves as an accessible way for people worldwide to learn about the park's ecosystem and the importance of a healthy, fat bear for surviving the harsh winter months.</p>

          <h2>Off-Label Use of Chemotherapy Drug Shows Promise in Aiding Speech for Some Children with Autism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 19:50:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying leucovorin, a generic drug derived from folic acid and typically used to mitigate chemotherapy side effects, as a potential treatment for some children with autism. The theory suggests that the drug can bypass a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain, which may contribute to neurological issues, including speech delays. Some parents report remarkable progress, with nonverbal children beginning to speak shortly after starting the off-label treatment.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has transferred eight former federal death row inmates to ADX Florence, a high-security "supermax" prison in Colorado. These inmates were among 37 whose death sentences were commuted to life in prison by the previous presidential administration. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the move is intended to ensure their conditions of confinement are consistent with the severe nature of their crimes, which include murder and kidnapping. This action is part of a broader effort by the current administration to take a tougher stance on violent crime and penalize inmates who received clemency, following criticism that the commutations were granted without proper vetting.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa has struck Hong Kong and southern China with hurricane-force winds and a massive storm surge, causing significant destruction after being linked to 14 deaths in Taiwan.

In Hong Kong, the storm surge flooded coastal areas, trapping residents and causing extensive damage. A weather station recorded a wind gust of approximately 150 mph, highlighting the extreme intensity of the typhoon as it moved through the densely populated region.</p>

Venezuela is situated on a major tectonic plate boundary, making it susceptible to seismic activity.

Lawyers for the family argue that the crash was preventable, citing a history of documented near-misses in the congested airspace around Reagan National Airport.

He defended California's environmental regulations as a key driver of innovation, citing the rise of companies like Tesla as a direct result.

After several years of competing in the more prestigious Champions League, the team's relegation to the second-tier competition reflects recent struggles and a failure to replace key departed players. The performance in Belgrade, while earning a valuable point, highlighted a lack of potency that was only remedied by substitute Kelechi Iheanacho. The article suggests that a scant summer transfer window has left the squad weaker, tempering hopes of advancing far in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The British government is exploring options to provide financial support to companies in the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) supply chain following a major cyber-attack that has halted the automaker's production. With JLR's factories shut down until at least next month, there are growing fears that smaller suppliers who depend heavily on the company could face bankruptcy. Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans or a plan for the government to purchase and stockpile component parts to ensure suppliers remain solvent. The production stoppage is reportedly costing JLR at least £50 million per week, affecting tens of thousands of workers.</p>

          <p>The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has stated in an interview that some Labour MPs have privately encouraged him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the party's leadership. While Burnham, who is not currently a Member of Parliament, said he is not actively plotting a return to Westminster, he did not rule out a future leadership bid. His comments arrive just before the Labour Party's autumn conference and follow a period of pressure on Starmer's leadership. Burnham also criticized the Prime Minister's team for creating a "climate of fear" and argued that the party faces an "existential" threat requiring wholesale change.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance and former Obama aide Jon Favreau engaged in a heated exchange on social media following the deadly shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas. Vance posted that the "obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop," prompting Favreau to criticize him for not clarifying that the victims were detainees, not agents. Vance retorted by pointing out that the gunman used ammunition with anti-ICE messaging carved into it. The dispute highlights the intensely polarized reactions to the violent event and the broader debate over political rhetoric and its potential consequences.</p>

          <p>A senior U.S. State Department official has reaffirmed that the administration continues to view India as a crucial democratic partner and a strategic counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific region. This position holds despite recent sharp bilateral disputes over trade and other issues. The official emphasized that the relationship with New Delhi remains strong and is fundamental to the regional strategy. Plans are reportedly underway for a Quad leaders' summit to be held in New Delhi, which would bring together the leaders of the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia to further solidify the alliance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Barack Obama described Donald Trump's recent claims linking paracetamol (Tylenol) to autism as "violence against the truth" that could endanger public health. Speaking in London, Obama argued that such repeatedly disproven statements undermine science and could cause harm if pregnant women become fearful of using necessary pain relief. He framed the issue as part of a larger ideological struggle between a progressive, democratic vision and a populist desire to return to a more conservative worldview. The comments from Trump had previously been criticized by the UK's health secretary, who urged women to ignore the president's remarks.</p>

          <p>President Trump's continued attacks on ABC and host Jimmy Kimmel have placed him at odds with several prominent conservatives who, while critical of Kimmel, have defended his free speech rights. Figures like Senator Ted Cruz and commentator Ben Shapiro voiced concerns after the FCC chair, a Trump appointee, suggested regulatory action against stations airing Kimmel's show. They warned that using federal power to silence disagreeable speech sets a dangerous precedent that could later be used against right-leaning voices. The situation has ignited a complex debate about the First Amendment, political retribution, and the limits of government influence over media.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent address to the United Nations General Assembly exemplified his "America First" worldview, characterized by a mix of bombast and a disregard for diplomatic norms. The speech, which veered between complaints about the UN building's facilities and broad declarations about global affairs, portrayed a world in chaos from which only America, under his leadership, is immune. The article argues that Trump's foreign policy is highly unpredictable, as shown by his oscillating positions on the war in Ukraine. Ultimately, his approach suggests an abdication of traditional U.S. global leadership, leaving other nations to either follow his lead or fend for themselves.</p>

The stake, previously held by the estate of the late Andrew McKenna, was sold to the team's existing majority owners, the McCaskey and Ryan families. This valuation significantly exceeds previous estimates and reflects the soaring financial worth of NFL teams, driven by lucrative media deals and potential new stadium developments.

Halligan, a former personal attorney for Donald Trump with no prosecutorial experience, was recently appointed to the role.
