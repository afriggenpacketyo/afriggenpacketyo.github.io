          <p>OpenAI and Oracle have activated the first data center for their ambitious 'Stargate' project in Abilene, Texas, a key part of a $500 billion initiative to build the necessary infrastructure for future artificial intelligence. The facility, equipped with Oracle Cloud infrastructure and Nvidia chips, represents a significant step in addressing the global shortage of computing power required for advanced AI models. With plans to expand to a gigawatt of capacity and additional sites across the U.S., the project aims to reshape the American power grid and solidify U.S. influence in the AI sector. The initiative is funded through a combination of partner investments, debt financing, and OpenAI's own cash flow.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season, is maintaining its strength as a major Category 4 hurricane as it moves northeast across the ocean. While not expected to make landfall in the United States, the National Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane watch for the Azores archipelago, which the storm is forecast to cross later this week. The powerful system is generating significant swells that are affecting the coasts of Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward. These swells are expected to create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions for several days.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, President Trump stated he believes Ukraine is capable of winning back all of its territory from Russia, including land annexed in 2014. This marks a reversal from his previous position, which suggested Kyiv might need to concede territory to Moscow to achieve peace. After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump posted on social media that Russia now looks like a 'paper tiger' due to its economic troubles and the prolonged conflict. The statement reflects his growing frustration with Vladimir Putin and aligns with his recent actions, such as sending Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball announced it will introduce an automated ball-strike (ABS) challenge system starting in the 2026 season for all regular and postseason games. The new rule will allow batters, pitchers, and catchers to challenge an umpire's call, with each team receiving two challenges per game. If a challenge is successful, the team retains it. The system, which has been tested extensively in the minor leagues, aims to correct missed calls in critical situations while preserving the human element of umpiring. Player feedback heavily favored this challenge format over a fully automated system for calling every pitch.</p>

          <p>Former MSNBC contributor Keith Olbermann issued an apology to CNN commentator Scott Jennings after deleting a social media post that was widely interpreted as a threat. The original post, which said 'You’re next motherf---er,' was made in the context of political tensions following the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. After Jennings shared the post and tagged the FBI, Olbermann removed it and later apologized, stating his words were meant to refer to Jennings' career, not physical harm. He condemned political violence and expressed regret for leaving an inadvertent impression of a threat, especially during the current climate.</p>

The credits, part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are being phased out under President Trump's new legislation, leading to a record surge in EV sales in August. In response, dealerships are offering significant incentives, with some lease rates dropping to as low as $40 per month, to clear out inventory.

Other large-scale studies, including a major analysis of two million children in Sweden, found that the link disappeared when accounting for genetic and environmental factors.

These payments are slightly lower than they were earlier in the year and in late 2024, reflecting the more favorable interest rate environment.

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, the strongest storm of the year, has caused a mountain lake in eastern Taiwan to burst its banks, resulting in at least two deaths and trapping hundreds of people. The barrier lake, formed by previous landslides, gave way under immense rainfall, sending a surge of water into the nearby township. Now, the storm, equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane, is bearing down on southern China, where authorities have evacuated 370,000 people in Guangdong province. Hong Kong has raised its typhoon warning to the maximum level in anticipation of catastrophic conditions.</p>

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued in Pembroke, Maine, after it fell into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on private property. The landowner discovered the animal with only its antlers visible and alerted the state's wildlife department. A team of wardens and a biologist responded, first sedating the moose and then using straps and an excavator to carefully lift it out of the well. The entire operation took five hours, after which the moose, unharmed, ran off into the woods once the sedation wore off. The family has since capped the previously unknown well.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating after a man was captured on security cameras drawing a swastika on the sidewalk outside an elementary school in Beverly Hills. The incident occurred on Monday, which marked the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah. The school district condemned the antisemitic act, stating that 'hate of any kind is not acceptable' and reaffirming its commitment to student safety. The hateful symbol was promptly removed, and the Los Angeles Police Department has increased patrols around Jewish community centers and places of worship during the High Holy Days.</p>

          <p>Leading health organizations worldwide, including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, are forcefully rejecting President Trump's recent claims that acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy is linked to autism. In statements, officials emphasized that available scientific evidence has not established a causal link and that the drug remains a crucial and safe option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women. They warned that avoiding necessary treatment could pose risks to both the mother and the unborn baby. Health officials also pushed back against Trump's suggestions that vaccines cause autism, calling the idea disproven science.</p>

          <p>England has announced its squad for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia, notable for what is being described as its most hostile group of fast bowlers in decades. The attack, featuring Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Josh Tongue, is designed to counter Australia's pace on its home pitches, a strategic shift from previous tours. With captain Ben Stokes recovering from injury, the team's plan is to fight 'fire with fire' in the opening Tests in Perth and Brisbane. The selection marks the first Ashes tour in over 20 years without James Anderson, signaling a clear transition to a new generation of bowlers.</p>

          <p>A massive $100 billion partnership between OpenAI and Nvidia was finalized through a series of hurried, last-minute negotiations between CEOs Sam Altman and Jensen Huang. The deal, which will see Nvidia invest in OpenAI and supply chips for a new wave of AI supercomputing facilities, was struck just hours before Altman was scheduled to announce a new infrastructure project in Texas. The arrangement deepens the ties between two of the most influential companies in the AI boom. It also repositions OpenAI's relationships with other key partners, including Microsoft, which was reportedly informed only a day before the deal was signed.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that Rex Heuermann, the man accused in the Gilgo Beach serial killings, will be tried for all seven alleged murders in a single trial. The decision denied a motion from Heuermann's defense team to split the cases, who argued that combining them would create a risk of the jury being unable to properly segregate evidence for each distinct incident. Prosecutors contended that the cases were linked by an 'overlapping aspect of the defendant’s modus operandi' and his familiarity with the locations where remains were found. The judge also set a deadline of January 2026 for any additional pretrial motions.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has convicted Ryan Routh on all charges, including the attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, for his actions at Donald Trump's Florida golf course in September 2024. Prosecutors successfully argued that Routh, who was spotted by a Secret Service agent with a rifle in bushes near the course, had the clear intent to kill, even though no shots were fired. After the verdict was read, Routh attempted to harm himself with a pen in the courtroom before being subdued by U.S. Marshals. Routh, who represented himself during the trial, faces a potential life sentence.</p>

          <p>Boeing's stock gained over 1% following reports that the U.S. and China are in the final stages of negotiating a massive order for its jets. The potential deal, which could involve as many as 500 aircraft, is seen as a key component of President Trump's broader trade talks aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Beijing. This development aligns with a pattern of large Boeing orders being included in trade agreements with various countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Qatar. The news reinforces the investment case for the aircraft manufacturer, which has seen its stock rise 22% year to date. (not investment advice)</p>
