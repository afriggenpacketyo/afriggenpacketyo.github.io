          <p>The third round of the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow was temporarily suspended due to thunder in the area. The delay affected scheduled tee times, impacting players such as Max Greyserman, Sam Burns, Rory McIlroy, and Xander Schauffele. The weather interruption occurred during a pivotal stage of the tournament, causing adjustments to the competition's timeline and potentially influencing player strategies as they return to the course after the delay. The PGA officials are monitoring the weather conditions closely to ensure the safety of the players and spectators, and they will announce a revised schedule as soon as it is feasible.</p>

          <p>The Southern Poverty Law Center reports that the white nationalist group Patriot Front is utilizing combat sport clubs, known as Active Clubs, to recruit new members. These clubs, present in at least 34 states, provide training in mixed martial arts and foster white nationalist ideologies. The report highlights how this recruitment method helps Patriot Front maintain a low profile and evade law enforcement. The shift to this strategy coincides with the group facing legal controversies and internal scrutiny, including accusations of being federal agents within the far-right movement.</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings has lowered the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over the increasing government debt and rising interest costs. The agency expressed doubts about the government's ability to reduce annual fiscal deficits and growing interest expenses. This decision aligns Moody's with other rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Fitch, which had previously downgraded the U.S. The downgrade is expected to marginally increase the yield investors demand for U.S. Treasury debt and may negatively affect sentiment toward U.S. assets.

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that over half of female business leaders in Japan are skeptical about reaching the government's target of having women occupy 30% of top corporate positions by 2030. The respondents cited slow shifts in views among male-dominated executives and the need to change company culture as major obstacles. Traditional gendered divisions of labor and work-life balance issues were also identified as contributing factors. Despite the challenges, most respondents expressed a desire to encourage younger generations of women to pursue senior roles.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decrease in drug overdose deaths, with provisional data showing 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, marking the steepest year-on-year decline in 45 years. This improvement is attributed to the increased availability of naloxone, policies implemented during the pandemic like telehealth access to addiction treatment, and opioid-settlement funds. While deaths from synthetic opioids are falling, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution pose a threat to continued progress. The article emphasizes that continued effort can reverse the course of the public health crisis.</p>

The game marked the start of a Subway Series, with both teams holding first place in their respective divisions. The Yankees ultimately won the game 6-2, overpowering the Mets' pitching, though Soto had a decent day with three walks, a stolen base, and a run scored.</p>

          <p>The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) warns that cancelling a series of music festivals at Brockwell Park would be devastating, impacting livelihoods and the local economy. This follows a High Court challenge won by a resident, arguing the council lacked proper planning permission for the events.

The paranoid side of neo-shamanism connects to conspiracy theories, where an otherworld is populated with entities and the shaman possesses power to change the weather and reverse curses.

          <p>While Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine stance is overt, a new group of officials with advanced degrees, the neo-anti-vaxxers, are taking positions within the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, and the NIH. These officials, such as Marty Makary and Vinay Prasad, question the safety and usefulness of some vaccines, advocating for more testing and scrutiny. Though they've acknowledged the life-saving power of immunization, their past actions reveal a tendency to weigh evidence unfairly, potentially undermining America's protections against disease. The shift could lead to unnecessary testing, misleading data, and eroded confidence in public health.</p>

          <p>Hollywood is grappling with an existential panic as many of the biggest American films are no longer being made in America, leading to concerns about job losses and the industry's future. Trump's proposed tariffs on foreign-produced movies ignited a debate about financial support to reinvigorate film production in Hollywood, which has lost opportunities to locations with more tax incentives. Unions and industry figures are divided on the best solutions, ranging from federal tax credits to cultural tests for subsidized projects, underscoring the lack of consensus on how to stimulate the film industry.</p>
