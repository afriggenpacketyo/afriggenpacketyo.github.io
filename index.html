          <p>HSBC, Europe's largest lender, reported first-quarter results that exceeded expectations, driven by strong performance in its wealth business and corporate and institutional banking segments. The bank announced a share buyback of up to $3 billion, expected to be completed before the announcement of its 2025 interim results. While profit before tax declined 25% year-on-year, it surged nearly 317% from the previous quarter, however, the bank warned of macroeconomic uncertainties and the impact of protectionist trade policies on consumer and business sentiment.

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured victory in Canada's federal election, fueled by a backlash against Donald Trump's trade threats and comments about Canada becoming the 51st US state. Carney, who became Prime Minister in March, ran a campaign focused on safeguarding Canada's economy and sovereignty from perceived American threats. The Liberals are projected to win enough seats to form a government, although it's unclear if they'll secure a majority, with Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre set to remain in opposition. Carney plans to begin negotiations on a new economic and security relationship with the US immediately following the election.</p>

          <p>Canadian broadcasters project a win for Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal party in the recent federal election, though it remains unclear if they will secure a majority. The election was heavily influenced by US President Donald Trump's repeated suggestions of Canada becoming the 51st US state, which were widely rejected by Canadian politicians across the political spectrum. Carney's success represents a comeback for the Liberals, who had been struggling in popularity before Justin Trudeau's resignation, and serves as a setback for Trump, who has consistently criticized the party.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party achieved a remarkable victory in the Canadian election, partly due to Donald Trump's constant criticism and suggestions of annexing Canada. Trump's actions, including threats of a trade war, fueled a surge in Canadian patriotism and reversed the Liberals' declining fortunes. The Conservative Party, despite making gains, failed to capitalize on dissatisfaction with the economy and the previous Liberal government. This outcome suggests that Trump's approach may have inadvertently strengthened the Liberals' position and denied him a northern neighbor more aligned with his political priorities.</p>

Automakers will also be reimbursed for some of the cost of tariffs on imported components, phased out over two years. Automakers have welcomed the change, stating that the President's leadership is helping level the playing field.</p>

          <p>A Vietnamese factory, Dony Garment, is preparing for the potential impact of a 46% trade tariff threatened by Donald Trump. The factory is rushing through orders for American clients and diversifying its market to reduce reliance on the US. While the owner remains resilient, other colleagues in the industry who heavily depend on American exports are more vulnerable. The Trump administration claims China is using Vietnam to circumvent tariffs, but Vietnam may need to signal its willingness to crack down on trans-shipments to secure a deal with Washington.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed three executive orders targeting sanctuary cities and increasing immigration enforcement. One order directs the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to publish a list of jurisdictions deemed 'sanctuary cities' and pursue legal action against them. Another order seeks to provide legal resources to police officers and review restraints on law enforcement. These actions have been met with criticism, with some arguing that they undermine local control and violate the rights of immigrants.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, is projected to win the country's federal election for the fourth consecutive time. This victory was sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of annexation and tariffs on Canada, leading to a surge in nationalism that aided the Liberals. The Liberals won 161 seats in Parliament, while the Conservative Party held 150, needing 172 seats to hold the majority. The attacks by Trump frustrated many Canadians, leading them to cancel U.S. vacations and refuse to buy American goods.</p>
