        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Iran, brokered by the US and Qatar, was announced by Donald Trump but quickly faced accusations of violations from both sides, as Israel claimed Iran launched missiles after the truce took effect, which Iran denied. Trump expressed his displeasure with both nations, criticizing Israel for launching a heavy bombing immediately after the agreement and Iran for the alleged missile fire. The conflict began with Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear and military sites, claiming Iran was close to developing nuclear weapons, leading to retaliatory strikes from Iran and escalating tensions in the region. Rescue workers reported casualties and injuries from the exchanges of fire before the ceasefire was supposed to take effect. Optimism remains uncertain amidst ongoing accusations and denials.</p>

          <p>Two European brown bears named Mish and Lucy escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon, a wildlife park near Exeter, leading to an evacuation of the park. The bears headed straight for the honey store, consuming a week's worth of the sweet treat. The park's emergency team, including trained firearms staff, were deployed, and police were notified, but the bears remained calm and did not breach any public areas. An investigation has been launched to determine how the bears escaped, as there were no signs of damage to the enclosure.</p>

          <p>Republican Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are introducing a framework for a bill to regulate digital assets, aiming to define when crypto is a commodity or security. The proposed legislation would allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and reduce SEC regulation. It also includes measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion, building on bipartisan momentum seen with the recent stablecoin bill passage. A Senate Banking Committee subcommittee hearing will discuss the bill, but its future remains uncertain due to differing House priorities.</p>

The bill has undergone scrutiny by the Senate Parliamentarian for potential rule violations, a process known as the Byrd Bath, which is still underway.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the Fed's dedication to preventing ongoing inflation, stating that policymakers will likely maintain their current stance until the impact of tariffs on prices becomes clearer. He described economic growth as robust and the labor market as near full employment, but noted that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's cautious approach comes amid increased criticism from President Donald Trump, who has publicly expressed his frustration with Powell's policies. Powell is scheduled to present his comments and the Fed's monetary policy report to congressional committees this week.</p>

          <p>The decision to grant former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz an office with eight staff members at state expense has drawn criticism from far-left and far-right parties. Critics argue that the allocation is excessive, particularly given Scholz's incomplete term, while supporters emphasize the importance of his expertise, especially concerning the ongoing war in Ukraine. The tradition of providing former leaders with offices has faced scrutiny following controversies involving previous office holders, leading to questions about the necessity and justification of such expenses. A legal precedent has been established that former leaders do not automatically have a legal claim to an office and staff at the state's expense.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid work requirements in the US are raising concerns about healthcare access, as highlighted by Kelly Fountain, who may have to leave Arkansas to secure care for her disabled son. Experts estimate that millions could lose Medicaid coverage due to these requirements, which mandate work, volunteering, or education for at least 80 hours a month. Experiences in Arkansas and Georgia show that such requirements led to increased uninsurance and medical debt without boosting employment. Critics argue that these measures disproportionately affect older adults, people with disabilities, and caregivers, creating significant barriers to maintaining coverage.</p>

          <p>A rare June heatwave is affecting much of the eastern US, with temperatures expected to rise even higher. Extreme heat warnings are in effect from the Carolinas to Maine, with humidity levels exacerbating the heat. Mayors in major cities have declared heat emergencies, opening cooling centers to combat heat-related illnesses. The heatwave is caused by a combination of high humidity and a strong ridge of high pressure, making conditions especially dangerous for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer's government is facing a significant crisis as 123 Labour MPs are rebelling against flagship welfare policies, potentially thwarting plans to save Â£5 billion annually by 2030. The rebellion, fueled by concerns over changes to Personal Independence Payments (Pips) and Universal Credit, threatens to derail a crucial parliamentary vote. The Conservatives may exploit the situation to worsen Labour's political predicament, while the Speaker's role in selecting amendments adds further complexity. Poor handling of the parliamentary Labour Party and a disconnect between the leadership and MPs have contributed to the crisis.</p>

          <p>The case of Adriana Smith, a brain-dead woman kept on life support to carry her baby to term, has raised significant ethical questions about fetal personhood and medical autonomy. Doctors at Emory University Hospital maintained Smith's body for over four months without family consent, citing Georgia's LIFE Act, which grants constitutional rights to unborn children with a detectable heartbeat. This decision has sparked debate about the balance between fetal rights and a deceased patient's autonomy, and the potential for similar cases in states with fetal personhood laws. Critics argue that the decision should have rested with Smith's family, not the hospital.</p>

While arguments for reading often emphasize empathy, fiction can be valuable even when the characters are unsympathetic, as it allows readers to explore diverse experiences and perspectives. The act of reading is subversive, allowing for private thought and a break from the noise of the outside world, reminding readers that they exist along a continuum of human experiences.
