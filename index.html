          <p>Imelda has been downgraded to a post-tropical storm after hitting Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane, bringing powerful winds and heavy rainfall to the island. While a tropical storm warning remains in effect, the most severe conditions have passed, and the system is moving further into the Atlantic. There have been no immediate reports of significant damage from the storm. Forecasters warn that swells from Imelda and the remnants of Hurricane Humberto will continue to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Heritage Foundation warns that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is dangerously outdated and insufficient to deter growing threats from China and Russia. The report suggests the U.S. should increase its number of deployed nuclear weapons from approximately 1,750 to around 4,625 by the year 2050. This expansion is proposed to counter the rapid modernization and expansion of Chinese and Russian nuclear capabilities. The author argues that the current force was designed for a more benign global environment that no longer exists.</p>

          <p>Shares for Fair Isaac Corp., the company behind the FICO credit score, increased by over 20% following the announcement of a new business model. The company will now license its credit scores directly to mortgage lenders, a move that could bypass traditional credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, whose stock prices fell on the news. This change aims to eliminate unnecessary markups and give lenders more choice in pricing, a development praised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency director. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS Miami entertainment reporter Lisa Petrillo has publicly shared her recent battle with breast cancer for the first time. She was diagnosed with Stage One lobular breast cancer after insisting on an examination of a lump she found during a self-check, which led to early detection. Petrillo underwent a lumpectomy and radiation while continuing to work, keeping her diagnosis private for ten months. Now feeling well after successful treatment, she hopes her story will encourage others to be persistent about their health and advocate for themselves.</p>

          <p>The Israeli navy intercepted a large flotilla of activist boats attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza and break the long-standing maritime blockade. Dozens of activists, including several European lawmakers and climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, were detained as their vessels were boarded in international waters. The flotilla organizers aimed to challenge the 18-year blockade, but Israeli authorities labeled the effort a provocation. The interception has drawn condemnation from several countries, including Turkey and Colombia, who called for the immediate release of the activists.</p>

These accounts offer a guaranteed return and FDIC insurance, providing stability without locking up funds for an extended period.

          <p>A free-floating 'rogue planet' has been observed consuming gas and dust at the record-breaking rate of six billion tons per second, blurring the line between planets and stars. The object, named Cha 1107-7626, is located about 620 light years away and has a mass five to ten times that of Jupiter. This accretion event, where the object pulls matter from a surrounding disc, is the strongest ever recorded for a planetary-mass object.

These figures represent a notable decrease from costs seen in previous months when rates were higher.

The increase has prompted Representative Ayanna Pressley to call on the Federal Reserve to analyze the data and develop a plan to address the crisis, highlighting that over 300,000 Black women have left the workforce recently.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia would respond quickly if provoked by Europe, which he accused of whipping up hysteria and militarization. Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Group, he asserted that Russia has no intention of attacking any NATO member, dismissing such ideas as nonsense. However, he cautioned that any attempt to compete with Russia in the military sphere would be met with swift countermeasures. Putin's remarks come amid heightened tensions between Russia and Western nations over various geopolitical issues.</p>

          <p>The emergence of 'Tilly Norwood,' a computer-generated actor, has intensified fears in Hollywood about the use of artificial intelligence to replace human performers. The creator announced that the digital character would soon be signed by a talent agency, prompting a sharp backlash from actors and the SAG-AFTRA union. The guild stated that Norwood's creation relies on the work of countless professional performers without their permission or compensation. This controversy reignites concerns that were central to the 2023 actors' strike, which fought for stronger AI protections.</p>

          <p>Police in Townsend, Massachusetts, have issued a warning to residents after a black bear attacked a goat and attempted to enter a chicken coop. The incident occurred on Thursday morning, and it is unclear if the goat survived the attack.

This sighting follows similar reports in August of a large bear in the area, highlighting an increase in human-bear encounters as the animal's population expands.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year, though production saw a slight decline. The delivery numbers surpassed analyst expectations compiled by FactSet. This report comes as a key federal tax credit for EV buyers in the U.S. expired, which may have spurred a rush of purchases during the quarter. The company's performance was bolstered by U.S. sales, offsetting a slump in Europe attributed to increased competition and consumer backlash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has indicated that a decision is approaching on whether to replace the league's current Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Clubs have criticized the existing regulations, which limit losses to £105 million over three years, for stifling investment. An alternative being considered is a squad cost ratio (SCR) system, similar to UEFA's model, which would limit spending on squad-related costs to a percentage of a club's revenue. A final decision on adopting a new system is expected to be made in November.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, a distinction that many Finns themselves find surprising. Experts suggest the ranking is based more on contentment and life satisfaction rather than daily expressions of joy. Key contributing factors include a strong social safety net funded by high taxes, universal access to public services like advanced libraries, and a deep cultural connection to nature. The widespread practice of using saunas followed by cold plunges is also cited as a contributor to overall well-being.</p>

Longfield described the planning for school closures as chaotic and stated that decisions were made that went against children's best interests, causing significant damage to their education and mental well-being.</p>

          <p>Disney's brand favorability has fallen to multi-year lows among both Republicans and Democrats following the controversy surrounding talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. The company's decision to temporarily pull Kimmel's show after his comments on a slain conservative activist, and then reinstate him, managed to alienate both sides of the political spectrum. According to investment bank Jefferies, sentiment for both the parent company and its Disney+ streaming service has soured significantly. A recent price hike for the streaming platform has also contributed to the decline in public perception.</p>
