          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded China's generative artificial intelligence models, such as those from DeepSeek, Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu, praising them as world-class and significant contributors to global AI development. Speaking at a Beijing supply chain expo, Huang's comments arrived as Nvidia prepares to resume H20 chip shipments to China, a decision following U.S. government assurances after previous export controls had severely impacted the company's revenue. He highlighted China's open-source AI approach as a catalyst for international progress and a key factor for AI safety and cooperation. Huang also pointed to AI's extensive integration into major Chinese consumer technology platforms, showcasing its pervasive influence across the nation.</p>

          <p>Bradley Murdoch, the Australian man convicted of the 2001 murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio and the attempted abduction and assault of his girlfriend Joanne Lees, has died at 67 from throat cancer while serving a life sentence in an Alice Springs prison. Murdoch consistently maintained his innocence and never disclosed the location of Falconio's body, a silence that deeply impacted the victim's family and prevented closure. His death, which occurred on the 24th anniversary of the killing, will be subject to an investigation by the Northern Territory Coroner. Police reiterated their commitment to finding Falconio's remains and noted a significant reward is still available for information.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Burns, who served as the U.S. ambassador to China under former President Joe Biden, indicated that the United States and China are gradually moving towards a trade agreement, driven by mutual economic interests. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Burns unexpectedly supported former President Trump's tariff approach, refuting claims that China had a negotiating advantage. He underscored the interdependent economic ties, pointing to over 10,000 American companies operating in China and the U.S. being China's largest export market. This development occurs during a 90-day trade truce, with a deadline approaching in August for a more lasting resolution.</p>

          <p>South Korea is retrying Kim Jae-gyu, the former spy chief who assassinated President Park Chung-hee in 1979, to determine if his actions constituted treason. Kim, executed for insurrection along with five others, remains a divisive figure, seen by some as a power-hungry killer and by others as a patriot who sought to usher in democracy. His family initiated the retrial, arguing against the traitor label, especially as current impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol faces a similar charge. The trial revisits the historical context of Park's authoritarian rule and Kim's disputed motives, including allegations of torture during his original conviction.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that critical cryptocurrency regulation bills, which had previously failed to clear a procedural hurdle in the House, now have the necessary votes to move forward after a White House meeting with Republican representatives. The proposed legislation includes the GENIUS Act, designed to regulate stablecoins, and the CLARITY Act, which would establish rules for classifying digital assets as securities or commodities. Trump's swift intervention underscores his significant influence within the Republican party and his strategic push to position the U.S. as a global leader in digital assets. This legislative progress is intended to provide regulatory certainty for the crypto industry and prevent the creation of a central bank digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that the departure of many Chinese academics and researchers from the U.S. back to China, amid worsening bilateral relations, represents a "great loss" for the United States. While expressing happiness for their return to their homeland, Huang, a Taiwanese immigrant himself, underscored the immense value lost when bright minds educated in the U.S. choose to leave. Speaking in Beijing, he voiced hope that the U.S. would continue to be a country where individuals can pursue the "American dream," emphasizing the foundational role of such opportunities in his own success and the creation of Nvidia.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to "come forward and explain" her past statements concerning her review of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged "client list," stressing the importance of transparency. Bondi's prior comment that the list was "sitting on my desk" was later clarified as referring to a general "file," following Justice Department and FBI reports finding no evidence of such a list. This explanation has failed to satisfy some Trump supporters, leading to continued calls for clarity. Johnson also expressed support for Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's convicted associate, to testify before Congress, advocating for full public disclosure in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered an ultimatum to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) board, demanding the firing of CEO Don Moul, reportedly in response to a proposed gas plant opposed by a country-music star. The board refused, defending Moul's alignment with Trump's energy vision. This incident has revived speculation about Trump's long-standing goal of privatizing the TVA, the largest public energy provider in the U.S., which serves 10 million Americans. With six open board seats and Trump's ability to make emergency appointments, concerns are rising that he aims to install a loyal CEO to facilitate a sell-off, despite experts warning of negative outcomes like higher electricity prices.

          <p>Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to less volatile assets like the U.S. dollar, could become a mainstream payment method as the House considers the GENIUS Act. This bill, already passed by the Senate, aims to regulate the $250 billion stablecoin market, creating clear legal categories and consumer protections. Part of a broader Republican and Trump-backed initiative to support the cryptocurrency industry, the legislation seeks to facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions. While offering stability compared to other cryptos, stablecoins carry risks like "depegging" from their underlying assets, as seen in past bank failures. Major banks like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are exploring their integration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an investigation into Brazil's "unfair" trading practices, including policies related to digital trade, electronic payment services, preferential tariffs, and anti-corruption interference. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated the probe aims to determine if these practices are "unreasonable or discriminatory" and harm American commerce, workers, and innovators. This follows President Trump's recent threat of a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods, which Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, vowed to match. The investigation underscores escalating trade tensions between the two nations, despite $90 billion in trade last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese local governments are being strongly encouraged to leverage legislation as a "propeller" to drive economic and social development, fostering stable and open systems for various market entities. This emphasis, highlighted in a People's Daily article, stems from a 2015 reform that significantly expanded legislative authority to hundreds of cities and autonomous prefectures across China. The initiative represents a strategic shift from relying on direct administrative directives to employing a rule-of-law framework when addressing economic challenges. The article underscores that creative, locally tailored legislation is crucial for achieving long-term benefits and effectively adapting to evolving economic and social demands.</p>

          <p>A secret scheme that relocated thousands of Afghans to the UK was established after a British official inadvertently leaked personal details of nearly 19,000 individuals applying for resettlement. The data breach, discovered in August 2023 when details appeared on Facebook, led to the creation of the "Afghan Relocation Route," which has brought 4,500 Afghans to the UK so far. A super-injunction had kept the leak and scheme secret until a High Court judge lifted it, citing "serious free speech concerns." The Ministry of Defence apologized for the "serious departmental error," though a review deemed the risk from the leak "highly unlikely" to cause direct targeting.</p>

The burial service saw thousands of mourners, including Nigeria's current President Bola Tinubu, pay their respects. Buhari held leadership twice, first as a military dictator from 1983 to 1985, and later as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023. His complex legacy includes widespread human rights clampdowns, isolationist economic policies, and rising insecurity. President Tinubu declared seven days of national mourning, with a military parade and a 21-gun salute honoring Buhari upon the arrival of his coffin.</p>

ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan views such apps as dangerous, potentially enabling ambushes on agents and impeding law enforcement.
