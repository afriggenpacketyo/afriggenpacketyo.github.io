          <p>Disney announced its plans to build a new theme park and resort in Abu Dhabi, marking its first location in the Middle East and seventh park worldwide. The park, developed in collaboration with Miral, will be located on Yas Island and will feature Disney entertainment, themed accommodations, unique dining and retail experiences, and storytelling that celebrates both Disney's heritage and Abu Dhabi's cultural essence. Disney aims to attract visitors from the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia, though a timeline and cost for completion were not provided. The project also raises concerns about labor practices in the UAE, specifically related to migrant workers' rights.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company is increasing prices on three models produced in Mexico, citing higher U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles as a contributing factor. The price increases, affecting the Maverick, Bronco Sport, and Mach-E, could reach up to $2,000 per model. These adjustments apply to vehicles built after May 2 and expected to arrive at dealerships in late June. Ford anticipates a $1.5 billion hit to its operating profit this year due to tariffs and has withdrawn its full-year financial guidance due to economic uncertainty created by trade policies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert estimates that federal direct undergraduate student loan interest rates could decrease slightly to 6.39% for the 2025-2026 academic year, compared to the current 6.53%. Graduate student loan rates are also expected to drop to 7.94%, and PLUS loans for graduate students and parents may see a decrease to 8.94%. These rates, set annually by the government, are based on the May auction of the 10-year Treasury note. For every $10,000 borrowed at the new undergraduate rate, the monthly payment would be around $113 on a standard 10-year repayment plan.</p>

President Trump remarked on the timing of the ceremony, highlighting Perdue's extensive experience in business and international negotiations. The swearing-in comes as the U.S. has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods, aiming to address the trade deficit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese counterparts in Switzerland to discuss economic matters, seeking fair trade and an end to unsustainable tariffs.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Springfield, Illinois, criticizing the state's sanctuary policies and demanding changes to protect citizens from undocumented immigrants. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker responded by condemning the Trump administration's immigration policies and defending the Illinois Trust Act, which limits cooperation with ICE in civil immigration enforcement. Pritzker called Noem's visit a publicity stunt and accused her of "performing for Fox News" instead of focusing on homeland security. Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias echoed these sentiments, accusing Noem of weaponizing the Real ID deadline to create fear.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated after India conducted strikes across the border, targeting what it claimed were "terrorist infrastructure" sites in response to a deadly attack in Kashmir. Pakistan has condemned the strikes as "an act of war," reporting numerous casualties, including civilians. The United Nations Secretary-General has called for restraint from both countries, fearing a military confrontation. India has indicated that the strikes were focused and non-escalatory, but Pakistan reserves the right to respond.

There has been a consistent decline in the belief that increased attention to racism and racial inequality would lead to changes improving the lives of Black people.

While the deadline for travelers to show Real ID-compliant identification for domestic flights has passed, Homeland Security has largely avoided strict enforcement. The article suggests that the performatively menacing noises in the buildup to this deadline were a threat to those who may not qualify for Real ID because of their immigration status. The focus on immigration enforcement rather than national security undermines the program's original purpose of enhancing passenger screening for U.S. flights.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have approved an amendment that authorizes the sale of thousands of acres of federal public land in Nevada and Utah. The proposed land sales or exchanges are primarily aimed at building affordable housing on U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land. Democrats and environmentalists argue that this amendment is part of a broader push for a wholesale transfer of federal public lands. The amendment still faces a full House vote.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes, homeowners are considering whether to pursue a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Traditionally, a home equity loan was better with rates on hold due to its fixed rate. However, with potential rate cuts on the horizon, a HELOC might be more advantageous due to its variable rate, which could decrease. Currently, HELOC rates are lower than home equity loan rates, making them a potentially cheaper borrowing option, assuming borrowers can manage fluctuating payments.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to hold its benchmark rate steady has sparked questions about the future direction of mortgage rates. While the Fed doesn't directly set mortgage rates, its policy decisions influence the broader interest rate environment. The rate pause could create favorable conditions for mortgage rates to decline, especially if investors interpret it as a sign of future rate cuts. However, mortgage rates are also influenced by inflation trends, economic growth, investor sentiment, and global uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A 90-second equipment failure at a Philadelphia air traffic control facility exposed the strain on the U.S. air traffic control system. The incident, resulting in flight delays, highlighted decades of staffing shortages, underinvestment, and patchwork solutions. The FAA is taking steps to address the issues, including beefing up staffing and upgrading communication lines. The situation is particularly challenging in the busy airspace around New York City, with Newark Liberty International Airport facing significant disruptions.</p>

          <p>Mike Musheinesh, CEO of Detroit Axle, is grappling with the effects of the U.S.-China trade war. He is adjusting his business and hoping for a new trade deal. The company, which imports most of its car parts from China, has been impacted by tariffs. To mitigate these effects, Musheinesh has started selling directly to consumers in Mexico and has entered into a deal with a factory in Turkey. Musheinesh envisions the Trump administration working with Chinese companies to build new factories in the United States.</p>
