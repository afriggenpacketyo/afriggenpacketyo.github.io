The company posted revenue of $61 million against a projected $55.2 million, representing a 49% year-over-year increase, and reported a narrower net loss than the previous year. Omada also raised its full-year revenue forecast, attributing the strong performance to growth in cardiometabolic care and the successful integration of its GLP-1 and AI-driven services.

          <p>President Trump has announced his plan to nominate economic advisor Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, filling a vacancy left by Adriana Kugler. Miran, who has been a past critic of the Fed's stimulus actions and authored a plan to devalue the dollar, would require Senate confirmation. The nomination is seen as part of the administration's push for lower interest rates and could introduce a dissenting voice on the board, potentially challenging current Chair Jerome Powell's policies.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive action requiring colleges and universities receiving federal funds to provide detailed admissions data. The move is intended to ensure compliance with the 2023 Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action, amid administration concerns that institutions are using proxies like personal essays to consider race. The directive orders the Department of Education to overhaul its data collection systems to increase transparency and verify that admissions are merit-based.

          <p>The California Supreme Court has sided with environmental groups, ruling that a lower court was wrong to block their challenge to new rooftop solar rules. The decision revives a lawsuit against the Public Utilities Commission's 2022 move to slash incentives for homeowners who sell excess solar power back to the grid. The court determined that the commission's decisions are not immune from standard judicial review, sending the case back to the appeals court. Environmental groups argue the incentive cuts undermine the state's clean energy goals.</p>

          <p>Actor Jussie Smollett is set to make his return to television on the Fox competition show "Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test." This marks his first TV appearance since he was accused of staging a hate crime against himself in 2019, which led to his departure from the Fox drama "Empire." After a complex legal battle, Smollett's conviction for filing a false police report was ultimately overturned. His participation in the reality series, which subjects celebrities to military-style challenges, signals a step back into the public eye.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Department of Labor to review its guidance on including alternative assets, such as private equity, cryptocurrency, and real estate, in 401(k) plans. The move is a significant step toward opening retirement accounts to investments that have traditionally been limited to institutional and high-net-worth investors due to their higher risk and lack of transparency.

However, legal experts note the president cannot unilaterally overturn the 1973 Home Rule Act, which grants D.C. self-governance; doing so would require an act of Congress.

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has denied all requests for early retirement from transgender service members who have served between 15 and 18 years, according to an internal memo. This decision forces these long-serving individuals to either resign or be discharged without retirement benefits, a reversal of a previous policy memo that suggested they could apply for early retirement. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader policy to bar transgender individuals from the military.

The review finds the movie's main appeal is the reunion of its beloved stars, whose chemistry remains a highlight, rather than its hastily sketched plot. While the film is filled with comedic cameos and energetic montages, it struggles to develop its new characters or offer fresh emotional insight. This article concludes that while it won't replace the original, it serves as a disposable delight for fans.</p>

Another agent involved in cases related to the Trump administration, Walter Giardina, is also being forced out.

This has led the club to explore a potential transfer for Brighton's energetic midfielder Carlos Baleba.
