          <p>Chimney Rock, North Carolina, is striving to rebuild and welcome tourists by midsummer after being devastated by Hurricane Helene in September. Mayor Peter O'Leary stated that the town was unrecognizable and that the rebuilding process is underway with the help of FEMA and a task force of business owners and residents. Contractors are working to restore essential services like water, sewer, and electricity, while the Department of Transportation rebuilds bridges. Over 2,000 volunteers have contributed to the recovery efforts, fueled by donations that allow them to afford necessary materials. Optimism remains despite the long road to recovery.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars announced plans to cut costs by 18 billion Swedish krona ($1.87 billion) after its operating profit fell in the first quarter of the year. The company reported a decrease in operating profit from 4.7 billion krona to 1.9 billion krona, with revenue also declining. The cost-cutting measures include reductions in investments and potential redundancies across its global operations. Volvo Cars is also no longer providing financial guidance for 2025 and 2026, citing market headwinds, price competition, and the impact of tariffs. The company aims to sharpen its U.S. product lineup and optimize its manufacturing footprint to produce cars where they are sold.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is consulting on proposals to extend the sugar tax to milkshakes and pre-packaged lattes, aiming to further reduce sugar consumption and tackle obesity. The proposal also includes reducing the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before the tax applies. While the original exemption for milk-based drinks was due to concerns about calcium intake, the government now believes the health benefits do not outweigh the harms of excess sugar. Opponents argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families, while proponents welcome the move as a necessary step in improving children's health. The consultation will run until July 21.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media is encouraging the public to revisit Mao Zedong’s 1938 essay “On Protracted War” as inspiration amid ongoing economic tensions with the US. The commentary suggests that Mao's insights on perseverance during wartime can encourage confidence in eventual victory in the trade conflict. This call comes after the US imposed tariffs on goods from China, leading to retaliatory measures from Beijing. The state media emphasized that the situation has evolved beyond what the US anticipated, with growing international opposition to bullying tactics.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals have secured an unexpected victory in Canada's federal election, capitalizing on anti-Trump sentiment and concerns over economic sovereignty. Carney, a political newcomer, framed the election as a crisis moment, warning against Trump's threats to Canada's economic independence. While the Conservatives made significant gains, they fell short of securing a majority, highlighting deep divisions within the country. The election results underscore the challenges Carney faces in uniting Canadians and navigating a potential trade war with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, won the federal election in a turnaround largely attributed to President Trump's annexation threats and tariff policies. The American president's repeated threats to annex Canada and his sweeping tariffs influenced voters' choices. Domestic issues including affordability, immigration, jobs and crime remained significant factors. On Monday, Mr. Trump once again injected himself into the election campaign. In a post on Truth Social, he repeated his idea of making Canada the 51st U.S. state and called on Canadian voters to vote for the person who could make that possible — without naming either political party.</p>

          <p>Tomoyuki Sugano pitched five scoreless innings to earn his third win as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the New York Yankees 4-3. Sugano (3-1) struck out eight and scattered five hits, all singles, during his outing at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. He managed to escape a bases-loaded jam in the first inning and effectively used his fastballs and splitters. This was Sugano's first scoreless outing in six Major League Baseball games, with his 3.00 ERA being the best among Orioles starters.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party achieved a remarkable victory in the Canadian election, significantly aided by Donald Trump's actions. The US president's badgering of Canada and threats to make it the 51st state coincided with a reversal in fortune for the center-left party. Carney focused on Trump's threats, warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources. The Canadian economy, heavily dependent on exports to the US, faces considerable risk if a full trade war erupts.</p>

          <p>Four former Hong Kong lawmakers, Claudia Mo, Gary Fan, Jeremy Tam, and Kwok Ka-ki, have been released after serving prison terms related to national security convictions. They were part of the "Hong Kong 47," arrested for participating in an unofficial primary poll in 2020. The poll, organized by the pro-democracy camp, aimed to increase their influence in policymaking. Critics argue that the lawsuit against them was part of Beijing's broader effort to suppress rights and democracy in Hong Kong following the imposition of the national security law in 2020.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen, China's tech hub, experienced slower GDP growth and export decline compared to the national average in the first quarter of the year. The city's GDP grew by 5.2%, while exports decreased by 8.7% in yuan terms, falling short of China's overall gains. Experts attribute this to a high baseline from the previous year and unique pressures from the tariff war and industrial transition. The local government acknowledges challenges faced by enterprises, including high costs, insufficient orders, and pressure on foreign trade.</p>

It was not immediately clear if the Liberals would secure the 172 out of 343 electoral seats needed for a majority. Following his victory, Carney told his supporters that Canada will "win this trade war" with the US. Singh congratulated Carney on his victory as he himself lost his seat in parliament. A lot of the NDP's supporters shifted to the Liberals as US President Donald Trump's tariffs and comments about making Canada a US state weighed on the minds of voters.</p>

The upcoming 2026 rules are designed to attract new manufacturers by retaining 1.6-liter V6 turbo hybrids but simplifying them by removing the MGU-H. Electrical capacity will be increased to approximately 50% of total power output, and cars will run on 100% sustainable fuel. The changes have led to Audi's entry and Ford's partnership with Red Bull, while Honda is staying and General Motors is entering in 2029.</p>
