        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to hold its key interest rates steady, citing persistent economic uncertainty largely driven by the United States' aggressive tariff policies. This decision was widely expected by markets, as the ECB continues to grapple with sluggish growth in the euro zone despite inflation remaining near its 2% target. The central bank emphasized a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach, refusing to pre-commit to a future rate path. All eyes are now on President Christine Lagarde's press conference for further signals on monetary policy and economic forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Online real estate company Opendoor announced that former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian will take over as CEO, with co-founder Keith Rabois being named chairman. The leadership shake-up, which follows the recent resignation of the previous CEO amid investor pressure, was met with strong market approval, causing the company's stock to jump 36%. This move marks a significant turnaround for the firm, which was at risk of being delisted earlier this year before gaining traction as a "meme stock" and seeing its valuation soar.

          <p>Ireland's state broadcaster, RTÉ, has declared it will not participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest if Israel is allowed to compete, calling such a scenario "unconscionable" due to the ongoing loss of life in Gaza. This stance adds to growing pressure on the European Broadcasting Union, with Slovenia's national broadcaster making a similar pledge and Spain's culture minister suggesting a possible withdrawal. RTÉ, which also cited concerns over the killing of journalists in Gaza, will await the EBU's final decision before confirming its withdrawal from the highly popular international music competition.</p>

The government stated the communications, in which Mandelson allegedly suggested Epstein's first conviction was wrongful, made his position untenable. The firing came after days of mounting pressure and a report detailing extensive email exchanges where Mandelson expressed support for Epstein during his legal battles, leading to his immediate withdrawal from the key diplomatic role.</p>

          <p>Former Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry has publicly defended L.A. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer against allegations of circumventing the NBA's salary cap. The controversy stems from a report that a company Ballmer invested in gave Clippers star Kawhi Leonard a $28 million sponsorship deal that was allegedly a covert payment, prompting an NBA investigation.

          <p>A Russian drone incursion into Poland has created a significant test for NATO, marking the first such incident since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Warsaw reported scrambling its own and allied aircraft to shoot down several of the 19 Russian drones that entered its airspace, prompting condemnation from Western allies and calls for new sanctions. Analysts note the event highlights Europe's need for a more cost-effective air defense system, as expensive fighter jets were used to down cheap drones, exposing a strategic vulnerability in sustained conflict scenarios.</p>

          <p>The dismissal of Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein marks another dramatic fall in his four-decade political career. A key architect of the "New Labour" movement that brought Tony Blair to power, Mandelson was known as a masterful political operator nicknamed the "Prince of Darkness." However, his career has been punctuated by scandal, including two previous cabinet resignations before his recent sacking from the diplomatic post.

Farage has denied wrongdoing, claiming his partner, Laure Ferrari, used her own funds from a wealthy family. However, a BBC investigation into French property records has found little evidence of such family wealth, raising questions about the source of the funds. The scrutiny comes after Farage himself criticized another politician for avoiding stamp duty, leading to accusations of hypocrisy.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Donald Trump's economic agenda, describing it as a personalist strategy rather than a coherent ideology like state capitalism. The approach, termed "Trumponomics," is characterized by three components: declaring emergencies to justify intervention, using threats to coerce private actors, and demanding tribute in exchange for relief. Examples cited include using emergency powers for tariffs and pressuring companies like Intel for a government stake. The analysis suggests these actions are designed to achieve personal victories for Trump rather than consistent economic outcomes for the country. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts argue that teens miss out on valuable opportunities to develop responsibility and critical thinking skills.

          <p>This article highlights the challenges faced by serodiscordant couples—where one partner is HIV-positive and the other is negative—in Kenya, who rely on preventative drugs (PrEP) and condoms to maintain their health and relationships. Recent cuts in U.S. foreign aid have disrupted the supply chain for these essential resources, leading to shortages and heightened anxiety for families. The Trump administration's policy changes have left clinics rationing medications, forcing individuals to travel farther and worry about the future availability of the tools that keep them safe from the virus.</p>

          <p>A 41-year-old woman has been charged with two counts of homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle in a crash that killed two Marquette University lacrosse players, Scott Michaud and Noah Snyder. According to the criminal complaint, Amandria Brunner was drunk when she turned her pickup truck into the path of the SUV carrying the students. Police noted she smelled of alcohol, and a blood test later showed her BAC was well over the legal limit; records also revealed she had four previous convictions for operating while intoxicated.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, some of his supporters on social media have started to blame a recent episode of the animated series "South Park." The episode, which aired weeks before the shooting, featured the character Eric Cartman parodying Kirk's campus debate events. Despite Kirk himself having called the parody "hilarious," some online commentators are claiming the show fomented hatred and is partially responsible for his death, a theory that has spread alongside claims blaming leftist political rhetoric for the violence.</p>

Emanuel warned that undermining the nation's primary public health institution and its vaccine programs poses a significant long-term risk to the health of Americans and will lead to preventable disease outbreaks.</p>

          <p>Chelsea FC has been charged by the Football Association with 74 alleged rule breaches related to payments made to agents between 2009 and 2022, a period when the club was owned by Roman Abramovich. The potential breaches were discovered during the due diligence process for the club's sale and were self-reported to regulators by the new ownership group led by Todd Boehly. The charges, which focus on third-party investments and intermediaries, could result in sanctions ranging from a fine to a points deduction, though the club's cooperation will be considered.</p>

          <p>In a landmark environmental and human rights case, a Spanish court has ruled against regional authorities in Galicia for failing to control severe water pollution caused by industrial pig farming. The court found that the unchecked nitrate runoff from livestock waste violated the fundamental rights of local residents, who have suffered from contaminated drinking water and a degraded natural environment for years. The ruling, a first of its kind in Europe, orders compensation for the claimants and could set a powerful precedent for other communities fighting agricultural pollution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. space agency NASA has implemented a new policy that blocks Chinese citizens from accessing its facilities, systems, and networks, citing national security concerns. This move effectively bars Chinese nationals, who previously worked as contractors or research students, from contributing to NASA projects. The restriction comes amid an escalating space race and growing technological competition between the U.S. and China. The decision further deepens the divide in scientific collaboration between the two nations, as Chinese astronauts are already excluded from the International Space Station.</p>

          <p>Ben Proud, a world and European champion, has become the first British athlete to sign up for the Enhanced Games, a controversial event that allows competitors to use performance-enhancing drugs. Proud cited the substantial financial incentives as a primary motivation, noting that the prize money for a single race could equal what it would take 13 years of winning world titles to earn. The decision was condemned by Aquatics GB, and Proud acknowledged he does not expect to return to traditional swimming after retiring from the Olympic program to join the event.</p>

          <p>At least 19 people have been killed and several others are missing after flash floods and landslides struck the Indonesian islands of Bali and Flores. Heavy rainfall inundated seven districts on the tourist island of Bali, while rescue operations using excavators and a thermal drone are underway in the Nagekeo region of Flores. More than 500 people have been evacuated to makeshift shelters as emergency response efforts continue. While Indonesia's monsoon season often brings such disasters, experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity.</p>
