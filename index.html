        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trading for shares of Japanese retailer Seven & i Holdings was suspended after Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion acquisition offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the bid. In response, Seven & i expressed disappointment and disputed the Canadian company's statements. Analysts suggest that strong Japanese protectionism and the classification of Seven & i as a company vital to national security made the foreign takeover highly improbable from the start.</p>

          <p>Recently obtained data on deportations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reveals a discrepancy between the administration's public focus and actual enforcement actions. While the administration emphasized removing the "worst of the worst" criminals, less than 1% of the approximately 100,000 deportees since January had murder convictions. The data shows that many infractions were for non-violent offenses like traffic violations. This article highlights that despite the public messaging targeting violent criminals, the deportation push has broadly affected undocumented immigrants without serious criminal records.</p>

          <h2>Federal Government Cancels Billions in Funding for California's High-Speed Rail Project</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 21:06:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has officially canceled $4 billion in federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, citing mismanagement and significant delays. The Federal Railroad Administration made the decision after the state's rail authority rejected a federal compliance review that found "no viable path" forward for the train. The project, intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, is reportedly decades behind schedule and massively over budget. While the administration celebrated the move as a win for taxpayers, California officials criticized the decision and vowed to continue seeking alternative funding.</p>

          <p>The United States and its European allies have reportedly set an end-of-August deadline for Iran to agree to a comprehensive nuclear deal. According to sources, if Tehran does not accept the terms, the U.S. and its partners will trigger the "snapback" mechanism, which automatically reimposes all prior United Nations sanctions that were lifted under the 2015 agreement. This move follows a period of heightened pressure, including targeted military actions, aimed at compelling Iran to scale back its nuclear program. In response, Iran has warned it would retaliate against the reimposition of sanctions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June, marking the second straight month of contraction and raising concerns that the export-reliant economy could enter a technical recession. The decline was driven by a significant drop in shipments to major partners, including an 11.4% decrease to the U.S. and a 4.7% fall to China. The situation is exacerbated by the U.S. imposing a 25% "reciprocal tariff" on Japanese imports, with a notable 26.7% plunge in automobile exports to the U.S. An economic advisor to Japan's prime minister suggested the country may have taken too hard a line in negotiations.

Many of the plaintiffs were seeking asylum from persecution. The suit argues this practice undermines the legal process and instills fear, preventing people from complying with their legal obligations to appear in court.</p>

Companies like Crusoe and Redwood Materials are creating systems that use these old batteries to store solar energy, providing a reliable and renewable power source. This strategy addresses the growing concern that data centers could consume a significantly larger share of the U.S. electrical grid. The initiative also offers a second life for EV batteries that are no longer optimal for vehicles but still retain significant storage capacity.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has launched a new "everything app" called Base App, aiming to attract a broader consumer audience beyond its core crypto trading business. The app, which replaces Coinbase Wallet, integrates trading, payments, social media, and messaging functions on its proprietary Base blockchain. A key feature is Base Pay, a one-click checkout system for USDC stablecoin payments, developed with Shopify to be used online and eventually in stores. This move represents Coinbase's effort to drive crypto utility in everyday life and create new revenue streams beyond volatile trading fees.</p>

          <p>The investigation into last month's fatal Air India crash, which killed 260 people, is reportedly focusing on the captain's actions. According to a Wall Street Journal report citing officials familiar with the probe, a cockpit recording indicates the captain intentionally moved the fuel switches to the "cutoff" position moments after takeoff. The first officer was reportedly heard questioning this action on the recording. While a preliminary report from Indian authorities noted the switches were moved, it did not assign blame, making this new information a critical development in understanding the tragic event.</p>

          <p>The southern African kingdom of Lesotho has declared a two-year state of disaster after facing threats of what are described as the highest U.S. tariffs in the world. This small, mountainous nation is heavily dependent on its textile industry, which exports primarily to the United States. The imposition of severe tariffs threatens to cripple its economy, which has prompted the government to take the drastic step of declaring a national disaster.

In a social media post, Trump praised the move as "just better," aligning with his administration's health initiatives. While Coca-Cola has not explicitly confirmed the change, a spokesperson acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and said details on new offerings would be shared soon. If implemented, the change would make standard American Coke taste more like the popular cane sugar-sweetened version imported from Mexico.</p>

          <p>The average cost for a child to attend a holiday club for the full six-week summer break in Britain has risen to £1,076, according to new research from the charity Coram. This represents a significant financial burden for working parents, with some regions seeing price hikes of up to 13% compared to last year. The report attributes the rising costs to high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run programs. For many families, especially those who must pay upfront before receiving childcare benefits, the expense is becoming increasingly unmanageable.</p>

          <p>Thousands of flat owners in the UK are planning a class-action lawsuit against major property freeholders, alleging they were charged inflated service fees due to secret insurance commissions. The legal claim asserts that freeholders received undisclosed payments from insurance companies, which were then passed on to leaseholders through higher buildings insurance costs. Lawyers argue these commissions are unlawful and are seeking compensation that could amount to £2,000 per flat owner. The companies named in the legal letters have denied any wrongdoing and stated they operate within regulatory frameworks.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are warning that an attempt by President Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell would create significant market instability and a legal crisis. A research note from Wolfe Research described the potential outcome as a "mess," predicting a stock market selloff and a spike in long-term yields. The move's legality is uncertain and would likely be challenged in court, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. Experts argue that firing the Fed chair would undermine the central bank's independence, which is crucial for economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills has stalled in the House of Representatives for a second day due to opposition from within the Republican party. After an initial group of conservative hardliners blocked the legislation, a new bloc of Republicans from key committees objected to last-minute changes made to appease the original holdouts. The stalemate has cast doubt on whether House Republicans can unify to pass crypto legislation, even with President Trump's intervention to rally support. The ongoing deadlock is a significant setback for the crypto industry, which had hoped for regulatory clarity.</p>

          <p>This political analysis explores the growing schism between President Trump and some of his most ardent supporters over the administration's refusal to release the so-called Epstein files. After years of fueling conspiracy theories about a deep state cover-up, Trump is now dismissing interest in the files as a "hoax," lashing out at his own base. The article argues that this reversal cuts to the core of Trump's political appeal, which was built on a promise to tell voters what other politicians would not. This contradiction threatens to create a lasting rift with a base he primed to distrust official narratives.</p>
