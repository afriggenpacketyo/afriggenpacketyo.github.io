          <h2>ESPN Analyst Explains Shedeur Sanders' NFL Draft Drop</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 14:51:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ESPN's Pete Thamel attributes Shedeur Sanders' unexpected tumble in the 2025 NFL Draft to teams' evaluations of his talent and athleticism. According to Thamel's conversations with several teams, Sanders was not considered a first-round talent due to concerns about his rhythm and overall athleticism. Some teams felt he didn't have enough film that immediately translated to the NFL level. Despite his impressive 2024 season with 4,134 passing yards, Sanders remained available even after the fourth round, marking a significant surprise in the draft. The Browns ultimately selected Sanders with the 144th pick in the fifth round.</p>

          <p>A significant explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port in Bandar Abbas, southern Iran, resulted in multiple fatalities and numerous injuries.

          <p>A letter written aboard the Titanic by first-class passenger Archibald Gracie IV, a survivor of the disaster, fetched nearly $400,000 at auction in the United Kingdom. Penned on April 10, 1912, the day the Titanic set sail, the letter expresses Gracie's initial impressions of the ship. Gracie survived the sinking and later wrote a detailed account of the disaster, but he succumbed to complications from hypothermia months later, becoming the first adult survivor to die.

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, once projected as a top NFL draft pick, experienced a stunning drop before being selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round. Despite entering the draft with significant hype and high expectations, teams repeatedly passed on Sanders, raising questions about his perceived value.

Moffett also suggests that Apple's supply chain remains anchored in China and could face resistance in India. He also believes that backlash against Apple in China over U.S. tariffs will hurt iPhone sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charles Burnett's film "Killer of Sheep" offers a gentle and tender depiction of everyday life in Watts, Los Angeles, in the 1970s. The film presents a mood rather than a conventional narrative, focusing on the struggles and resilience of a working-class Black family. With its understated approach and documentary-like simplicity, "Killer of Sheep" provides a radical strategy to depict ordinary Black life at a time when such images were hardly in abundance. It showcases a part of America, the invisible rendered visible, from sea to shining sea.</p>

          <p>David F. Sandberg's "Until Dawn," based on a PlayStation game, is a meta-horror film that combines familiar tropes with unique twists. The movie follows a group of young adults trapped in a remote cabin, forced to relive the same nightmarish events in a time loop. With influences from "Evil Dead" and "The Cabin in the Woods," "Until Dawn" offers a schlocky, self-aware romp in the woods for horror fans who appreciate both reverence and surprises.</p>
