          <p>Thirteen-year-old Faizan Zaki emerged as the champion of the 100th Scripps National Spelling Bee, triumphing over eight other finalists and securing a prize package exceeding $50,000. Zaki, who was a pre-competition favorite and the previous year's runner-up, clinched the title by correctly spelling "Ã©claircissement" after a dramatic final round where multiple finalists misspelled their words. The competition, marked by late-round tension, highlighted the historical significance of the event, which began a century ago in 1925, although this year's winner is the 110th champion due to past ties. The event featured nine students aged 11 to 14 who advanced from local and regional bees, showcasing the culmination of their spelling prowess on the national stage.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Labour's Sir Keir Starmer and Reform UK's Nigel Farage of promoting "fantasy economics" with their welfare policy proposals. Badenoch's criticism centers on their potential plans to scrap the two-child benefit cap, arguing that taxpayers would be burdened with funding unlimited child support. Farage has stated his intention to remove the cap to ease the burden on lower-paid workers, while Labour has indicated it is considering the policy change despite concerns about the associated costs. Badenoch contends that the Conservative Party is the only one seriously addressing welfare state issues, accusing her rivals of treating economics like "showbiz."</p>

          <p>Nika Melia, a prominent figure in Georgia's leading opposition group, Coalition for Change, has been detained by police, according to his party. This incident is part of a broader trend of the government clamping down on dissent in recent months. Melia is accused of insulting law enforcement officers, marking the second such detention of an opposition leader in recent days, following Zurab Japaridze's pre-trial detention for refusing to attend a parliamentary inquiry. Critics accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of adopting authoritarian tactics similar to those employed by Moscow, steering the country away from its pro-Western stance and aspirations of joining the European Union.</p>

Musk's 130-day appointment as a "special government employee" is concluding, but Trump hinted that Musk will continue to assist the administration. DOGE, created by executive order on Inauguration Day, has reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, though these claims have faced scrutiny.

DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through asset sales, contract cancellations, and workforce reductions, although some figures lack evidence. Musk's presence in the White House raised ethical questions due to potential conflicts of interest with his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla. His work with DOGE led to the elimination of most USAID programs, reflecting an "America First" approach and raising concerns about waning American influence on the global stage, also highlighting the spread of misinformation within the government.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that U.S.-China trade talks have stalled, necessitating direct engagement between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. Despite a breakthrough agreement in Switzerland on May 12, where both countries agreed to roll back recent tariff increases for 90 days, disagreements persist over tech restrictions and rare earth regulations. Bessent believes that the magnitude and complexity of the talks require both leaders to personally address the issues and that China will come to the table once President Trump makes his preferences known. Trump and Xi last spoke in January, and analysts suggest China will only agree to another call if there is certainty of no surprises from the U.S.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily suspend a lower court's order that found many of his global tariffs to be illegal. The decision allows President Trump to continue collecting import taxes while the case is litigated, with the next hearing scheduled for June 5. The Trump administration argued that the lower court's decision improperly second-guessed the president and threatened trade negotiations, asserting that foreign and economic policy are the domain of the political branches, not the courts. The ruling does not affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which were implemented under a different law.</p>

Kenneth Genalo, head of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), is retiring, and Robert Hammer, who leads ICE's Homeland Security Investigations office, has been reassigned. Marcos Charles and Derek Gordon, both career ICE officials, will replace them as the agency aims to increase its operational tempo and align with President Trump's mandate to arrest and deport criminal unauthorized migrants. The White House has been pressuring ICE to increase arrests, with a target of 3,000 arrests per day.</p>

          <p>A shopping center in West Hollywood has installed a motion-activated chirping device to discourage homeless individuals from camping out in the area, sparking controversy among customers. The device, called the BlueChirper, emits a loud, anxious cricket-like sound whenever someone passes by, regardless of their intention. While the property management company claims the device has shown positive results, some shoppers find it annoying and indicative of a poor response to the homeless problem. The city of West Hollywood is investigating whether the device complies with local noise ordinances, as it is not aligned with the city's outreach-based approach to addressing homelessness.</p>

Although he was not knocked down during the bout, Shigeoka began losing consciousness in the ring after the final bell and was stretchered out. Japan Boxing Commission rules prohibit a boxer who has had a craniotomy from holding a professional license, meaning Shigeoka must retire from the sport.</p>

          <p>An investigation into stolen pickup truck tailgates in Houston has uncovered a sophisticated scheme involving the cloning of key fobs to steal vehicles. Victims tracked down suspects through social media posts, leading to the discovery of blank key fobs and a key programming device. Thieves access a vehicle's onboard diagnostics (OBD) port to create new key fobs, enabling them to steal cars in as little as five minutes. Authorities are advising vehicle owners to take precautions, such as locking tailgates, using OBD port protection, and storing key fobs in Faraday bags, to prevent key fob-related car thefts.</p>
