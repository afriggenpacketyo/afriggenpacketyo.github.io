          <h2>Trump Plans Additional National Guard Deployment to Los Angeles Amid Protests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 19:50:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that President Trump intends to deploy an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, criticizing the move as an ego-driven decision rather than one based on public safety needs. This follows the mobilization of 700 Marines to support the existing National Guard troops during protests against federal immigration enforcement actions. Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta are suing Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, arguing that the federalization of the California National Guard is unlawful and violates the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit aims to prevent Trump from deploying the National Guard in any state without the governor's consent, which Newsom sees as a step towards authoritarianism, while federal prosecutors have charged labor leader David Huerta with felony conspiracy to impede an officer. The situation is tense as Newsom views Trump's actions as an unwarranted escalation. </p>

Reflecting on his time with Kevin Garnett on the Timberwolves, McCants described Garnett as a fun and intense individual who emphasized details, similar to Kobe Bryant. McCants also touched on college athletics, discussing the transfer portal's lack of structure and his experiences with Michael Jordan at UNC, and he expressed mixed feelings about Bill Belichick's move to UNC, citing potential controversies. </p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

He claimed the move was necessary to reestablish public confidence, asserting the committee had become a "rubber stamp" for industry agendas. The announcement has drawn criticism from health organizations and experts, including former CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen, who expressed concerns about the move spreading confusion and undermining public health processes, while Senator Cassidy voiced fears the ACIP would be filled with individuals who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion. </p>

          <p>JPMorgan Asset Management suggests that Chinese equities, despite appearing inexpensive, require improved corporate earnings to fuel further market upside. Mark Davids, co-head of Asia-Pacific equities, notes that the nation's economic slowdown has weakened corporate profitability, making careful stock and sector selection crucial for investors. While Chinese stocks trade at 14 times historic earnings, in line with the past decade's average, the return on equity is faltering due to weaker profitability trends. Davids also mentioned that the aggregate annual expected return of Chinese stocks under their coverage is about 10%, which is less compelling than the historic average of around 20% or the returns offered by companies in South Korea (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Families and lawyers are struggling to contact workers arrested during immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles, describing the situation as a "kidnapping" by federal agents. The raids, which occurred in the fashion district and nearby areas, led to the deployment of the National Guard in the city due to the backlash. Lawyers from the Immigrant Defenders Law Center reported that detainees were held in deplorable conditions without adequate food, water, or beds. The Department of Homeland Security stated that 118 immigrants were arrested this week, but lawyers claim that some were deported to Mexico without proper paperwork, raising concerns about violations of due process and racial profiling. The ACLU held a rally in downtown Los Angeles demanding humane treatment and access to lawyers for all detainees. </p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has declared his intention to sue the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, asserting it as an illegal federalization of the state's guard.

He also asserts that the action is unwarranted, stating that there is no invasion or rebellion, and that Trump is manufacturing chaos for political ends. Bonta emphasized that this abuse of presidential authority will not be taken lightly, and that they have a winning case. </p>

However, Money in the Bank received criticism for its ladder matches, with Naomi's victory in the women's match and Seth Rollins' win in the men's match being controversial. The return of R-Truth during the main event pairing Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso against John Cena and Logan Paul was a pleasant surprise for fans, potentially saving the event from further disappointment. </p>

          <p>Dr. Phil's presence alongside President Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, during immigration raids in Los Angeles has sparked criticism, raising questions about his role in shaping or normalizing the administration's policies. McGraw, who is neither a journalist nor an immigration expert, was embedded with ICE officials to conduct an interview with Homan for his MeritTV show. Critics argue that McGraw's involvement is part of a broader effort to create a made-for-TV spectacle, using his platform to promote Trump's MAGA message and divisive immigration policies. This move has been seen as politically perilous, given McGraw's history of controversial treatment of guests and staff, and his lack of expertise in immigration or constitutional law. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles is in recovery mode after a weekend of protests against President Trump's immigration policies and the deployment of the National Guard, with clean-up crews working to remove graffiti from federal buildings. The protests, which were mostly peaceful, were marred by vandalism and violence, including rocks thrown from freeway overpasses and Waymo vehicles set on fire. City officials and union leaders gathered in Grand Park to demand the release of David Huerta, a union leader arrested during an immigration raid. The National Guard, which played a minimal role in policing the protests, was absent from the streets on Monday, with law enforcement largely represented by neighboring police forces. </p>

          <p>The UK government has committed £14.2 billion of investment to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, with the final investment decision due later this summer. The Treasury said that this project will create 10,000 direct jobs, thousands more in firms supplying the plant, and generate enough energy to power six million homes. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a "landmark decision" that would kickstart "economic growth", Alison Downes, director of pressure group Stop Sizewell C, condemned the announcement and believed the government would "come to regret" this move. The government insists that nuclear power provides enormous amounts of low carbon, non-intermittent energy that forms a crucial part of the UK's energy future. </p>

BYD, already the biggest player in China, is expanding aggressively into Europe, posing a challenge to established automotive brands. While consumers may benefit from more affordable EVs, concerns are growing about potential security risks, with some experts suggesting Chinese vehicles could be vulnerable to hacking and spyware. The US government has responded by raising import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, while the EU has imposed extra tariffs, though the UK has not taken similar action, as European manufacturers race to develop their own affordable electric cars. </p>

The columnist argues that rioting is politically unpopular and that Trump is using the unrest to his advantage, as he subscribes to his own theory of the propaganda of the deed. The author expresses concern that the administration is pushing claims that Trump should be granted wartime powers, particularly on trade and immigration, and that this is leading to a contest of competing theories of the propaganda of the deed.

          <p>President Trump's recent actions in California, including deploying the National Guard over Governor Newsom's objections, exemplify a strained relationship between the federal government and the states. The article argues that Trump's approach is to centralize control, expanding the federal government's power over states and citizens, and that this is a marked shift from the traditional conservative defense of states' rights. It notes that Trump's actions are likely illegal and will be challenged in court, and that they demonstrate a mindset of using the federal government as a cudgel. The article also highlights the increasing tensions between Washington and the states, with some Californians even considering secession. </p>

          <p>The Marines and National Guard personnel deployed to Los Angeles amid protests will operate under the same rules of force, primarily focused on protecting federal buildings and personnel. They will not engage crowds unless necessary and their weapons will not be loaded with ammunition, except for self-defense. These rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done. The Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell stated the arrival of federal military forces presents logistical challenges and urged open communication between agencies. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is back in conflict with President Trump over immigration raids in Los Angeles, marking a shift from his previous attempts at reconciliation. Newsom criticized Trump's deployment of the National Guard and accused him of intentionally inflaming tensions, stating that it was his "red line". Trump has responded by suggesting Newsom should be arrested and casting California as out of control. The situation offers both risks and rewards for Newsom, who is considering a 2028 White House run, as it allows him to challenge Trump's policies but also puts him in the spotlight on a contentious issue. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court for the authority to deport immigrants to countries where they may face torture, claiming a loophole in the Convention Against Torture. The administration argues it can bypass standard procedures by waiting until after an immigration judge's decision to announce deportation to a previously unmentioned country, even if the immigrant fears torture there. Critics argue this denies due process to individuals who may be at risk of torture, while Trump's lawyers contend that federal law limits judicial review in such cases. If the Supreme Court agrees with the administration, many immigrants could be deported without any legal recourse. </p>

          <p>The article examines the historical context of President Trump's decision to federalize the California National Guard, drawing parallels to President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1965 action to protect civil rights marchers in Alabama. Johnson's move, taken after Governor George Wallace refused to ensure the activists' safety, is contrasted with Trump's deployment, which occurred against the wishes of Governor Gavin Newsom. The article also references President Eisenhower's 1957 federalization of the Arkansas National Guard to enforce desegregation in Little Rock, highlighting the complex history of presidential use of military powers during times of civil unrest. These past events offer insight into the current debate over federal authority and states' rights. </p>

Trump's actions are seen as a demonstration of his eagerness to divide and conquer, launching an assault on the Constitution and the limits of presidential power. The article suggests that Trump is using the situation to conflate policy with personal grudges and to position himself as the savior of law and order. </p>

          <p>California has sued the U.S. Justice Department over its demand that school districts ban transgender youth from competing in sports, arguing the federal agency had overstepped its authority. The lawsuit was filed in anticipation of legal retaliation against California's school systems for not complying with the agency’s directive by its Monday deadline. The Justice Department warned school districts that they faced potential “legal liability” if they did not ban transgender athletes from competition in their districts. The lawsuit asks a federal court to uphold the constitutionality of California’s antidiscrimination laws protecting transgender athletes, and to bar the Trump administration from withholding funds or taking other retaliatory actions against school districts that refuse to abide by the Trump directive. </p>
