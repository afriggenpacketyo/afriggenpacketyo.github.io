          <p>Pierre Poilievre, Canada's Conservative leader, is projected to win a crucial by-election in Alberta's Battle River-Crowfoot riding, securing his return to the House of Commons after losing his previous seat in the last general election. This significant victory, where he leads with over 80% of the vote, comes four months after his party's broader defeat and positions him for a mandatory leadership review in January. Poilievre thanked former MP Damian Kurek for stepping aside, highlighting the party's strength in this Conservative stronghold. Despite facing a record 214 candidates and accusations of using the riding as a 'means to an end,' Poilievre defended his grassroots campaign, emphasizing his commitment to earning people's trust. This win is vital for his political future and the Conservative party's standing.</p>

          <p>China has launched a new strategic plan to enhance its cultural soft power globally by significantly improving its television and mini-drama productions. The initiative, announced by the NRTA, prioritizes supporting the creation of high-quality documentaries, animations, and “outstanding micro and short series” for TV broadcast, as well as foreign programs. This comprehensive effort also includes strengthening the legal framework and copyright protection for these media. Mini-dramas and Chinese-produced animations have already demonstrated considerable growth and increasing international influence, positioning them as a new key pillar for China's online audio and video industry. This policy aims to further expand China's cultural footprint on the world stage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the back-to-school season approaches, U.S. families are proactively seeking ways to save money amidst rising costs and increased tariffs on essential items. Over half of households earning less than $50,000 annually plan to purchase only essential school items, with many shopping earlier to preempt potential tariff impacts. The U.S. tariff rate on imported goods like clothing and electronics has significantly increased, contributing to record-high prices for school supplies, which are up over 7% this year. Experts recommend comparing prices across retailers, exploring refurbished electronics with warranties, and choosing store-brand products for everyday items. Additionally, empowering teens with gift cards can foster budgeting skills and help manage spending effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Open's revamped mixed doubles event, featuring tennis superstars like Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, has sparked considerable debate within the sport. The United States Tennis Association (USTA) introduced the changes, including large cash prizes, a shorter format, and a new slot before singles, to attract more attention. While proponents argue it elevates the event and draws new fans, critics, including some doubles specialists, believe it devalues a Grand Slam title and unfairly allocates prize money to already wealthy singles players. The lucrative $1 million prize for the winning pair, five times last year's amount, and appearance fees have fueled this controversy, yet the USTA hopes the star power will ultimately please fans.</p>

          <p>The BBC has postponed the documentary "Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home," which chronicles the rock star's final years, out of respect for his family's wishes. Originally scheduled to air on August 18, the film covers Osbourne's return to the UK, his farewell concert, and his death at age 76. The documentary, initially conceived as a series, was adapted into a single hour-long film due to his deteriorating health. The decision to delay its broadcast, less than a month after his passing and weeks after his family's emotional public appearance, aims to accommodate the family during this difficult time. A new transmission date will be confirmed later.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The luxury goods sector, including giants like LVMH (Louis Vuitton, Dior) and Kering (Gucci), is experiencing a significant slowdown in sales after a post-COVID boom. LVMH reported a 4% revenue drop and 15% profit decline in the first half of the year, while Kering also saw substantial decreases. Analysts attribute this to less affluent buyers curbing spending, slowing demand in China, and concerns over rising prices and declining quality. Additionally, uncertainty from U.S. tariffs on European and Swiss goods poses a challenge, as consumers delay purchases. While experts foresee moderate growth ahead, brands must re-engage younger consumers and build deeper emotional connections beyond transactional loyalty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK has reportedly withdrawn its controversial demand for Apple to provide a "back door" to global users' encrypted data, a move confirmed by the US director of national intelligence. This demand, issued under the Investigatory Powers Act, would have compelled Apple to break its own encryption methods, which the company stated it would never do. Apple had responded by withdrawing its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) from the UK market and initiating legal action. Privacy campaigners cautiously welcomed the news, emphasizing that creating such a back door would pose a significant threat to personal and national security. While Apple awaits formal communication, the decision suggests a potential shift in the UK's stance on encrypted data access.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering taking a 10% equity stake in Intel, potentially making the U.S. government the chipmaker's largest shareholder. This move could involve converting some or all of Intel's $10.9 billion in CHIPS and Science Act grants into company equity. The proposal aims to revitalize Intel, a national priority given its struggles against global competitors in advanced chip manufacturing. While Intel has been the largest recipient of CHIPS Act funds, the administration's interest reflects a broader strategy of building government-backed national champions in strategic industries.

          <p>Helsinki, Finland, a city of nearly 690,000 people, has achieved a remarkable milestone by recording zero traffic deaths in the past year, aligning with the EU's "Vision Zero" program for 2050. Key to this success is the widespread reduction of speed limits to 30 kmph on over half of the city's streets, including around schools. The city's Traffic Safety Development Programme focuses on infrastructure improvements for pedestrians and cyclists, increased public transport use, and data-driven accident prevention. Coordination with police for speed enforcement, including 60 fixed speed cameras, has also played a crucial role. This achievement positions Helsinki as a model for other medium-sized cities globally.</p>

The article discusses iconic F1 car designs, highlighting the 1990 Ferrari 641 as a work of art and the current McLaren MCL39 for its exquisite lines. It explains why cars perform differently in qualifying versus race trim, primarily due to tire grip and degradation, with less effective cars damaging tires faster.

This monumental engineering feat, expected to take two days, is necessary due to ground weakening caused by the expansion of the world's largest underground iron ore mine, operated by LKAB. The church, often voted Sweden's most beautiful building, is a symbol of the Arctic town, which is undergoing a decades-long relocation project affecting thousands of homes and people.

The author suggests Trump's "U-turn" on demanding an immediate ceasefire and his reluctance to impose severe sanctions on Russia's oil industry align him with Putin's stance, reducing pressure on Moscow. Concerns are raised that allies seem to be accepting Ukraine's potential territorial concessions, with immense pressure on Zelenskyy to cede land in exchange for vague security guarantees.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that the truck driver involved in a fatal Florida crash, Harjinder Singh, was in the country illegally, reigniting a dispute with California Governor Gavin Newsom's office over immigration policies. Singh is accused of making an illegal U-turn that resulted in three deaths. While Florida authorities stated he entered the U.S. illegally in 2018, Newsom's office claimed he obtained a work permit during the Trump administration, a point disputed by Homeland Security. The incident highlights the ongoing debate about states issuing commercial driver's licenses regardless of immigration status. Singh faces vehicular homicide and immigration charges.</p>

          <p>The private members' club chain Soho House has been acquired for $2.7 billion (£2 billion) by a consortium led by MCR Hotels, with Hollywood actor and investor Ashton Kutcher joining its board. The deal returns Soho House to private ownership after its share value significantly dropped since its 2021 New York Stock Exchange listing, struggling with profitability and perceived loss of exclusivity. Founded in London in 1995, Soho House operates 46 clubs globally and other hospitality businesses, popular among A-list celebrities. The new owners face the challenge of stabilizing the business model and addressing concerns about the brand's dilution due to rapid expansion and membership fees.</p>

          <p>The family of Thomas Callam Phillips, a fugitive father who has been hiding his three children in the New Zealand wilderness for nearly four years, has publicly appealed for his return. Phillips vanished with his children—Ember, Maverick, and Jayda, now aged 9, 10, and 12—in December 2021, and their whereabouts remain unknown despite police searches and a reward offer. The children's mother has had no contact with them, and police are concerned for their well-being, particularly for Ember, who has asthma. Phillips is wanted for alleged crimes, including armed robbery, and authorities believe he is receiving support to remain at large, utilizing his survival skills.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is expected to bring dangerous rip currents and high waves to the U.S. East Coast this week, though it is not forecast to make direct landfall.

          <p>The Panjab Warriors consortium has successfully completed its takeover of Morecambe FC, ending a prolonged period of financial uncertainty that threatened the National League club's existence. The new owners, who "feel blessed" to be custodians, have begun addressing immediate financial issues, including paying overdue staff wages and settling liabilities with HMRC. This crucial acquisition comes just days before a potential expulsion from the National League. Despite the relief, the club faces significant challenges, including a minimal squad of five players and no manager (Derek Adams was sacked), with questions remaining about long-term sustainability and immediate match readiness. The new ownership has promised changes and asked for trust from the fanbase.</p>

          <p>UK newspaper headlines prominently feature the recent White House meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, highlighting the significantly improved mood compared to their previous contentious encounter. Media outlets noted Zelenskyy's decision to wear a suit instead of combat gear and his numerous expressions of gratitude, a contrast to his prior admonishment. While some papers expressed cautious optimism that peace might be within reach, others remained skeptical about breaking the stalemate with Russia, especially given President Vladimir Putin's warnings. Separately, headlines also cover Chancellor Rachel Reeves' consideration of a new property tax on homes valued over £500,000, as a potential radical overhaul of stamp duty, though some sources close to the Treasury deny this plan.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong has summoned the Australian and British envoys to protest their respective governments granting asylum to two prominent pro-democracy activists, Ted Hui and Tony Chung. Chief Secretary Chan Kwok-ki warned against "harbouring offenders," asserting that arrests in Hong Kong are based on evidence, not political stance. Hui fled in 2020 while facing charges related to anti-government protests, and Chung left in 2023 citing police scrutiny, both having been sentenced under the national security law. Critics argue this law is used to suppress dissent. The UK had previously condemned Hong Kong's cash offers for information on activists abroad, highlighting ongoing tensions over the city's autonomy and human rights.</p>

          <p>Researchers have utilized Artificial Intelligence to recreate the probable faces of Welsh convicts transported to Australia in the 19th century, tracing the lives of 60 individuals deported from Anglesey. This project uses detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and even modern descendants' photos to build profiles. Crimes leading to deportation ranged from serious theft to petty offenses like trampling turnips, with sentences often disproportionately harsh. The article highlights that an estimated 162,000 convicts were sent to Australia, including at least 1,000 Welsh, many of whom never returned, forging new lives and families. This initiative sheds light on a significant, once-shamed, but now increasingly embraced part of Australian history.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old woman, Kelly, was sexually assaulted on a Qatar Airways flight from Doha to London Gatwick and has since been denied compensation under the UK's Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (CICS). The perpetrator, Momade Jussab, was jailed for six and a half years after being convicted of sexual assault by penetration and two counts of sexual assault. However, Kelly's application for compensation was refused because the incident occurred on a Qatari-registered aircraft, which is not considered a "relevant place" under current CICS rules, despite the crime being prosecuted in UK courts. Her lawyers are now advocating for an urgent change in the law to close this loophole and ensure victims of such crimes receive compensation.</p>

A mid-meeting phone call between Trump and Putin further underscored this dynamic. The author contends that while the White House provides the platform, the Kremlin seems to be dictating the peace proposal's terms, aiming for a settlement before a ceasefire to maintain leverage.</p>

          <p>The "coolcations" trend is booming as tourists increasingly prioritize cooler, less crowded, and off-peak destinations, shifting away from Europe's traditional summer hotspots. This pivot is driven by growing concerns over blistering heatwaves and wildfires, which have impacted southern European infrastructure. Travel trend forecasters describe 2025 as a "turning point" for European tourism, emphasizing climate volatility. Data indicates Europeans are not compromising on travel but prefer quieter destinations and non-peak seasons, with rising interest in Nordic countries like Iceland and Norway, and Central European nations like Slovenia. While this trend may alleviate overtourism, it poses potential economic challenges for tourism-reliant southern European countries.</p>
