            <h2>Analyst Dismisses Trump's Idea of Domestic iPhone Production</h2>

            <p>Following comments from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt about potentially moving iPhone manufacturing to the U.S., Needham analyst Laura Martin stated that such a move is not feasible. Martin argued that Apple's production costs would increase dramatically, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives estimating an iPhone could cost $3,500 if made in the U.S. Furthermore, Martin believes that shifting Apple's supply chain would take years and is considered largely impossible by experts. These remarks come as Apple's shares face pressure due to manufacturing exposure in countries facing tariffs, which could increase costs by 50%.</p>

            <p>President Trump's new tariffs on imports from various countries, including a 104% tariff on goods from China, have taken effect, intensifying global trade war fears. Asian and European markets reacted negatively, while U.S. stock futures showed mixed signals. The White House claims the tariffs are designed to initiate negotiations, prioritizing allies like Japan and South Korea for potential deals. China has vowed to retaliate, asserting its ability to defend its interests, while the EU warns against escalating the trade conflict. These tariffs are intended to revive American manufacturing, but concerns are rising about potential inflation and economic disruption.</p>

            <p>Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated that a "commercial solution" for British Steel is achievable as the government considers nationalizing the Chinese-owned company, Jingye. British Steel faces challenges due to 25% tariffs on exports to the US and the financial unsustainability of its blast furnaces. The government has offered £500m to support a transition to electric arc furnaces, which Jingye rejected. The company says it has suffered financial losses of around £700,000 a day. Nationalization is being considered to secure the future of British Steel and steel production in the UK.</p>

            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House cannot restrict Associated Press (AP) journalists from accessing the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other press events. The ruling came after the White House limited AP's access because the news agency refused to adopt Trump's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America." Judge Trevor McFadden stated that blocking AP journalists based on viewpoint is "contrary to the First Amendment." The ruling emphasizes that while the White House can control access, it cannot discriminate against journalists based on their viewpoints.</p>

            <p>In Gainesville, Florida, opinions are split regarding President Trump's sweeping tariffs, with some residents expressing support for the "Make America Great Again" agenda and the idea of bringing back jobs to the U.S. However, others are worried about potential price increases and the possibility of an economic recession. Concerns are rising, especially as grocery prices in Florida are already high. Sweetwater Organic Coffee Company, for instance, anticipates having to raise prices due to the tariffs, which disproportionately affect coffee sourced from developing countries. The tariffs' chaotic rollout is causing stress for coffee businesses already struggling with rising coffee prices.</p>

USDA is meeting the challenge head-on and holding trading partners accountable. The USDA secretary has announced an aggressive international travel agenda to expand market access and to reassert what our great farmers produce for the world. The administration is also responding to the ever-evolving needs of our farmers and ranchers here at home as they continue to produce the safest, most abundant food supply in the world.</p>

            <p>A bipartisan group of Senators, led by Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), introduced legislation to curb presidential power over tariffs. The bill would require the president to notify Congress of impending tariffs within 48 hours, with Congress needing to approve the action within 60 days. President Trump has threatened to veto the bill, but Cantwell argues that Congress needs to reassert its role in trade policy due to the negative impact of tariffs on consumers and businesses. The bill faces an uncertain path to passage, but reflects growing concern over the economic consequences of the administration's trade policies.</p>

Samsung operates one of the few foundries capable of rivalling industry-leading Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in producing advanced chips at 7-nanometre or above.

The president acknowledged that "these things must be done," and follows former President Joe Biden, who took office at the same age. Trump has been less forthcoming about his health information, but his past disclosures showed that he was in good health. His previous physician once stated that if he had a healthier diet, he might live to be 200 years old. The public and media expect presidents to get physicals, but medical records are private, and presidents do not have to reveal their records.</p>

However, perceptions of the value of college degrees have decreased slightly in the past year. The survey also indicates that respondents believe college will pay off financially within five years, and they express confidence in the quality of education and job-related skills gained.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The word "tariff," central to President Trump's trade policy, has a rich history rooted in global trade. Originating from the Arabic word "taʽrīf" meaning "notification" or "inventory," the term evolved through various languages before entering English in the 16th century. Tariffs have been a part of U.S. trade policy since the country's founding, initially aimed at raising revenue and protecting domestic manufacturing. However, their use has shifted over time, leading to controversies such as the Tariff of Abominations in 1828 and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930. The word's meaning may be broadening beyond a simple tax rate to encompass broader economic punishment.</p>

            <p>Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, mocked Washington and its Asian allies for their calls for North Korea's denuclearization. She insisted that North Korea will never give up its nuclear weapons program, stating that it is enshrined in the country's constitution. Her statement came in response to a meeting between the top diplomats of the United States, South Korea, and Japan, who reaffirmed their commitment to push for North Korea's denuclearization. Tensions in the region have increased as Kim Jong Un continues to flaunt his military nuclear capabilities and align with Russia.</p>

            <p>Amid escalating trade tensions between China and the United States, some Chinese exporters are abandoning shipments mid-voyage to avoid the crushing costs of President Trump's tariffs. The situation is being described as "preparing for the Long March," reflecting a grim outlook for cross-Pacific trade. Some companies have halted all shipping plans and are scrapping orders, while others are surrendering goods already at sea to shipping companies. This drastic measure highlights the severe impact of the new tariffs on Chinese businesses and global trade.</p>

            <p>The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump approved a US$4.7 billion loan for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique to bolster American companies against their Chinese competitors in Africa. The loan, reapproved by the US Export-Import Bank (Exim), supports the export of American equipment and services for the construction of the US$20 billion LNG project under TotalEnergies. It is the biggest loan in Africa in US Exim Bank’s 91-year history, reflecting America's move to invest in strategic industries to counter China’s influence on the continent. This financing aims to make American companies and suppliers more competitive.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's latest tariffs on America's trading partners have taken effect, imposing additional taxes ranging from 20% to 104% on imported goods. Trump claims tariffs will boost the U.S. economy and protect jobs, but economists warn that the move could harm the world economy and push up prices for consumers. Tariffs are taxes charged on goods bought from other countries, and Trump has long argued that the U.S. should use them to encourage domestic consumption and reduce the trade deficit. The new tariffs have caused significant volatility on global stock markets and are expected to push up prices across a range of imported goods.</p>

            <p>Federal prosecutors say Ryan Routh, accused of trying to assassinate President Trump, also attempted to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane. In August, Routh sought to purchase the devices online from an associate Routh believed to be a Ukrainian with access to military weapons. Routh allegedly told an associate to "'send me an rpg [rocket propelled grenade] or stinger and I will see what we can do,'" according to the court document. Routh is suspected of hiding in some bushes with a gun near Trump International, about 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump, who was then the Republican presidential nominee.</p>

            <p>China's central bank has asked major state-owned banks to reduce U.S. dollar purchases to prevent sharp declines in the yuan, as the currency faces downward pressure following massive U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) sent informal guidance to state banks, asking them to withhold U.S. dollar purchases for their proprietary accounts and to step up checks when executing dollar purchase orders for their clients. The country's big state banks were seen selling dollars and buying yuan aggressively to slow the pace of yuan declines in the onshore spot market. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>India's central bank cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6%, marking its lowest level since September 2022, as growth concerns mount in the world's fifth-largest economy. The rate cut was in line with expectations and comes as the U.S.' reciprocal tariffs kicked in, with a 26% levy slapped on goods coming in from India. In its monetary policy statement, the Reserve Bank of India noted that tariffs have increased uncertainties clouding the economic outlook across regions, posing new headwinds for global growth and inflation.
