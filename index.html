          <p>President Trump announced 25% tariffs on non-U.S.-made cars and parts, effective April 2nd.  This caused significant drops in GM and Stellantis shares, while Tesla and Ford saw less impact due to their domestic production.  Analysts predict varying levels of exposure for different automakers.</p>
