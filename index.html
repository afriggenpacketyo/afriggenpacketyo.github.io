          <p>An armed man, identified as 42-year-old Joshua Runkles, was arrested outside the State Farm Stadium in Arizona, the venue for a memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Secret Service agents approached Runkles after observing suspicious behavior; he falsely claimed to be a law enforcement officer. He was booked for impersonating an officer and carrying a weapon in a prohibited place at the high-security event, which is designated a SEAR Level 1 and will be attended by President Trump.</p>

While Russia claimed all its military-industrial targets were hit, Ukraine stated its air defenses intercepted most projectiles and reported its own successful drone strikes on Russian oil facilities.</p>

          <p>During a promotional quiz for LADbible, longtime friends and co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon shared surprising personal details. Aniston was left speechless after learning that Witherspoon's real first name is Laura, not Reese, which is actually her mother's maiden name. The revelation prompted Witherspoon to admit she did not know Aniston's middle name is Joanna. The two actresses, whose friendship began when Witherspoon guest-starred on "Friends" in 2000, jokingly adopted new nicknames for each other.</p>

Meanwhile, in the Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Gabrielle is forecast to intensify into a hurricane over the weekend. However, it is projected to remain at sea and pose no direct threat to land.</p>

          <p>A chaotic Formula 1 qualifying session in Baku, Azerbaijan, was marred by a record six red flags as over a quarter of the drivers crashed due to challenging windy and cold conditions. Title contenders Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri both made errors, with Norris hitting a wall on his final lap, resulting in them starting seventh and ninth, respectively. Max Verstappen secured pole position, while the difficult session highlighted the fine margins on the Baku street circuit, which punished even minor mistakes from the drivers.</p>

In their letter, they accused Republican leadership of refusing to engage in bipartisan talks to keep the government funded beyond the September 30 deadline.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has escalated its clash with so-called sanctuary states this week, warning California, New York, and Illinois in letters obtained by CBS News that refusal to honor immigration detainers could trigger federal legal action. In letters dated Sept. 10, Acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons ordered the attorneys general of the three states to declare within two days whether they would comply with "thousands of ICE detainers" lodged against individuals in state custody, according to DHS. Immigration detainers are formal requests by ICE asking local jails and prisons to notify the agency before releasing an individual, and to hold them briefly so federal agents can take undocumented migrants into federal custody.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration stepped in to stop U.S. Steel from idling operations at its Granite City, Ill., plant, exercising new powers tied to the company's recent takeover, the Wall Street Journal reported. The steelmaker had informed nearly 800 workers that the plant would close in November, noting however that they would still be paid. But after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned CEO Dave Burritt the administration wouldn't allow it, U.S. Steel reversed course on Friday, saying the facility would keep rolling slabs into sheet steel, the Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations on the contentious issues of climate change and abortion took place across Germany on Saturday. Climate activists, organized by Fridays for Future, rallied in Berlin and other cities to protest the government's new energy policy, which includes building new gas-fired power plants. Simultaneously, thousands participated in both anti-abortion "March for Life" demonstrations and pro-choice counter-protests in Berlin and Cologne, highlighting the deep societal divisions on the legality and accessibility of abortion services in the country.</p>

          <p>A panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show as part of a wider trend of the Trump administration cracking down on dissent. Panelists argued that the response to Charlie Kirk's killing, including pressure on media and investigations into political opponents, cannot be viewed in isolation. They suggested these actions represent a significant shift in the rules of political engagement, with the administration using the tragedy to target its critics and consolidate power, raising concerns about the erosion of free speech.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article in The Guardian critiques the new, thinner iPhone Air as a symbol of a broader cultural trend toward a "miserable minimalism." The author argues that technology, design, and art are increasingly spartan and unobtrusive, contrasting the sleek new phone with the colorful, maximalist designs of past products like the 1998 iMac. This aesthetic of "less is more," seen in everything from interior design to theater, is described as a hollow status symbol that asserts a false sense of control in a chaotic world.</p>

          <p>Estonia has requested consultations with fellow NATO members under Article 4 after three Russian fighter jets reportedly violated its airspace on Friday.

Russia's Defense Ministry has denied the violation, stating its jets were conducting a scheduled flight in neutral waters.

          <p>President Trump's response to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being characterized by critics as a politically motivated effort to crush dissent. The administration has escalated threats against "the radical left" and is considering designating some groups as domestic terrorists, despite no evidence linking them to the killing. Political scientists and commentators warn that this follows an "autocrat's playbook," using a tragedy as a pretext to crack down on civil liberties, undermine political opponents, and erode free speech protections under the guise of preventing violence.</p>

          <p>In the wake of his killing, conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being positioned as a martyr for the Christian nationalist movement, a cause his own political activism increasingly embraced. Religious and political allies are using the language of spiritual warfare, with his widow's statement being described as a "battle cry" and pastors calling for followers to be "more bold." Analysts note this framing transforms a tragedy into a powerful tool for mobilization, intertwining Kirk's death with an ideology that seeks to establish the U.S. as an explicitly Christian nation.</p>
