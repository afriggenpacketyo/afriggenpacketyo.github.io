          <p>This article details the 25-year feud between Scotland's Lyons and Daniel crime families, tracing its evolution from local violence to an international criminal enterprise. It explains how the conflict escalated through drug trafficking and alliances with global cartels, such as the Kinahan group based in Dubai. The report culminates with the recent, mysterious arrests of four key Scottish gang figures in the UAE, highlighting the ongoing investigation and the potential for their extradition to face justice back in Scotland.</p>

          <p>This article provides context on Transnistria, a pro-Kremlin breakaway republic in eastern Moldova that remains internationally unrecognized and serves as a major Russian foothold. It explains its history, from its formation after a post-Soviet war to its current status as a Russian military base with about 1,500 stationed troops. The report details how the region, controlled by an oligarchic group, functions as a hub for Russian influence and money laundering, posing a persistent challenge to Moldova's sovereignty and European integration efforts.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover after a severe cyber-attack halted the company's production for several weeks. This financial guarantee is primarily intended to support JLR's vast supply chain, protecting thousands of jobs and preventing smaller partner businesses from collapsing due to the shutdown. The intervention is reportedly the first time a government has provided such support to a company specifically in response to a major cyber-attack.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the United States under Donald Trump and Russia under Vladimir Putin are engaged in a coordinated, or at least parallel, effort to undermine European democracies, drawing comparisons to the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The article contends that both leaders share a hostility towards the EU, liberal values, and international law, employing methods like political interference and support for far-right parties. This perceived "pincer movement" is described as a significant threat to Europe's security, prosperity, and progressive values.</p>

Supporters argue the devices are harmful to the environment, while opponents contend the ban is an example of an unnecessary and restrictive prohibition on citizens.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has publicly responded to Berkshire Hathaway selling off its entire, long-held stake in the company. BYD executives framed the divestment as a "completely normal" part of investing, expressing gratitude for Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger's 17 years of support. Despite the amicable statements, BYD's shares fell following the news, which comes as the company faces signs of cooling growth, including a recent quarterly profit decline and a reduction in its 2025 sales target.

          <p>Singer Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine has revealed that she underwent life-saving emergency surgery for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy in August 2023. Welch explained that she was experiencing serious internal bleeding while performing on stage, unaware of the severity of her condition at the time. The diagnosis required immediate surgery to remove her fallopian tube, a situation she described as the closest she has ever come to death, which led to the cancellation of several concerts last year.</p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating between the Trump administration and Oregon officials over the deployment of federal troops to Portland. President Trump announced he has directed troops to the city to protect federal facilities from perceived threats, a move Oregon's governor and Portland's mayor have strongly opposed, stating there is "no need" for a military presence. The action follows a directive from the Attorney General to deploy DOJ agents to safeguard federal property and arrest individuals engaged in what were termed "criminal mobs."</p>
