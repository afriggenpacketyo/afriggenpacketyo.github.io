After retiring, Simpson famously returned as captain at age 41 during the World Series Cricket era and later coached the team from 1986, transforming it into a global powerhouse and laying the groundwork for a golden age of Australian cricket.</p>

          <p>Rising heavyweight prospect Moses Itauma is set to face veteran Dillian Whyte in a significant bout in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The article gathers predictions from various boxing experts, who overwhelmingly favor the younger, undefeated Itauma to win. They cite Itauma's speed and sharpness against Whyte's age and recent inactivity as key factors. While acknowledging Whyte's experience and power, the consensus is that this fight marks a pivotal step-up for Itauma, potentially leading to a victory by knockout.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China have voiced concerns about the sustainability of Washington's expanding national debt, suggesting a gradual reduction in China's exposure to U.S. dollar assets. For three consecutive months, China has been trimming its holdings of U.S. Treasuries, which are now at their lowest level since 2009. The researchers recommend a strategic adjustment, advocating for an increase in reserves of gold and other key strategic materials to mitigate potential risks associated with U.S. fiscal policy.

The majority of fatalities occurred in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where numerous homes were damaged and a rescue helicopter crashed, killing its five crew members. Authorities have declared disaster zones in several areas as heavy rainfall is expected to continue, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Scientists attribute the increased frequency and intensity of such weather events to climate change.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in its plan to send astronauts to the moon by 2030, following a successful test of the engines for its new-generation Long March-10 rocket. The test confirmed that the 21 YF-100K engines, which will power the rocket's core stage and two boosters, can operate in sync under various power conditions. The superheavy launcher is designed to deliver a 27-tonne payload to a trans-lunar orbit, playing a crucial role in the planned mission to land Chinese astronauts on the lunar surface.</p>

          <p>The high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a significant breakthrough on the war in Ukraine. Trump described the talks as "productive," while Putin called them a "starting point" and proposed a future meeting in Moscow. Despite discussing many points, Trump conceded that a final deal was not reached and that the next steps are now up to Ukraine and European allies. The summit was Putin's first visit to the U.S. in nearly a decade.</p>

          <p>This article provides five key observations from the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, highlighting its significance more for its optics than for concrete results. The first takeaway is Putin's successful return to the world stage, marked by a warm, red-carpet welcome on U.S. soil. The article also notes the lack of a ceasefire agreement, Putin's reiteration of maximalist demands for peace, and the vagueness of Trump's statements, which did not mention Ukraine directly. Finally, it points to Putin's invitation for a future meeting in Moscow.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government, under President Lai Ching-te, is proposing significant changes to its residency rules for mainland Chinese spouses, citing national security concerns. The new policy would require applicants to provide notarized proof of having relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. This move is part of a broader strategy to address perceived threats from Beijing, including societal infiltration and identity ambiguity. The proposed amendment marks a sharp turn in cross-strait residency governance and aims to eliminate dual-status ambiguities.</p>
