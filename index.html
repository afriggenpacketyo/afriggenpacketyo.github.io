          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at a four-year low in March, with the consumer price index increasing by 0.9% year-on-year, aligning with February's figures and slightly below Reuters' expectations. Core inflation also decreased to 0.5%, primarily due to lower inflation across core CPI categories excluding food. This economic backdrop unfolds as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledging cost-of-living pressures as a significant concern. Singapore recently eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time in April, amidst projections of potential zero growth for 2025 following a lower-than-expected GDP expansion in the first quarter.

Officers found the deceased Teresita Sayson with trauma to her face and upper body, and a broken jewelry box with blood and hair was discovered at the scene, believed to be the murder weapon.

The report also indicated record-low birth rates among teenage girls and young women, while birth rates increased for women aged 40-44, a trend that has been ongoing since 1985. The increase in births appears to be driven primarily by Hispanic and Asian women, whose birth rates increased, while birth rates declined for Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native women.</p>

          <p>US country music star Jelly Roll, formerly a rapper known as Jason DeFord, is seeking a pardon to clear his criminal record, which includes convictions from his teenage years. He hopes that receiving a pardon will allow him to travel internationally for performances, which is currently difficult due to his past. The Tennessee Board of Parole has recommended a pardon, and the final decision rests with Governor Bill Lee. Jelly Roll has openly discussed his criminal record and works to inspire others who are in similar situations.</p>

          <p>Six major policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry are jointly lobbying the Trump administration to prevent the implementation of 25% tariffs on auto parts. The groups, representing dealers, suppliers, and automakers, argue that the tariffs would jeopardize U.S. automotive production and could lead to production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies for many suppliers. The letter to Trump administration officials emphasizes the importance of the automotive sector to the U.S. economy and the potential for significant negative impacts from the tariffs.</p>
