          <p>President Trump avoided direct answers regarding his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, instead redirecting focus to others like Bill Clinton. When questioned about a potential pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking ring, Trump stated he had not considered it but acknowledged he has the authority to do so. This comes as a top Justice Department official continues to interview Maxwell, and her lawyer claims she is being treated as a scapegoat. The situation is unfolding amid public pressure for more transparency on the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Daniel Born, the deputy speaker of the Baden-Württemberg state parliament in Germany, has resigned from his leadership role after admitting to drawing a swastika on a ballot. The Social Democrat politician stated he made a "serious mistake" in a moment of "rash emotion" during a vote for a council that included candidates from the far-right AfD party. While Born has stepped down from his party group leadership, he has not yet given up his parliamentary seat, despite calls for him to do so. The act is under criminal investigation, as the use of unconstitutional symbols is illegal in Germany.</p>

          <p>A former sanitation worker at the Dharmasthala temple in Karnataka, India, has alleged he was forced to dispose of hundreds of bodies, many of whom were women and girls showing signs of sexual assault. In a police complaint, the man claimed that between 1995 and 2014, temple supervisors covered up the deaths and threatened him into silence. The allegations have prompted the state government to form a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the claims. The case has also led families of individuals who disappeared or died mysteriously in the area to demand their cases be reopened.</p>

Texas Republicans, at the behest of President Trump, are using a special session to push for new maps that could add up to five GOP seats, bolstering their narrow majority in the U.S. House. The Texas Democrats are criticizing Governor Greg Abbott for prioritizing redistricting over flood recovery efforts.

          <p>Many Americans claim Social Security benefits at the earliest possible age of 62, which permanently reduces their monthly payments. To avoid this, the article suggests several financial strategies to bridge the income gap until age 70, when benefits are maximized. These methods include investing in an immediate or deferred income annuity to create a personal pension, utilizing a reverse mortgage to tap into home equity, and maximizing catch-up contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. Proper planning with these tools can provide the financial flexibility needed to delay claims and secure a more stable retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

The withdrawal from the regional bloc ECOWAS has further isolated the nation.

While talks are ongoing, with a 15% U.S. tariff on EU imports reportedly being discussed, President Trump has stated there is only a "50-50" chance of an agreement. In a no-deal scenario, the EU is expected to respond with tit-for-tat tariffs and may consider deploying its "anti-coercion instrument". (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche is meeting with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell for a second day of interviews at a federal facility in Florida. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. Her lawyer described the first day of questioning as "very productive," stating she answered every question posed. The interviews come amid ongoing public pressure on the Trump administration to release all files related to the Epstein investigation. Meanwhile, Maxwell's legal team is preparing to appeal her conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <h2>Experts Highlight Signs and Treatment Challenges of Depression in Older Adults</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mental health experts emphasize that depression in older adults often presents with more physical, or somatic, symptoms compared to younger populations, leading to frequent misdiagnosis as normal aging. Stigma and a lack of awareness among both patients and doctors can cause delayed recognition, allowing the condition to become more chronic. Treatment is complicated by the fact that older adults are often on other medications, increasing the risk of adverse drug interactions. Experts stress the importance of professional diagnosis and note that older adults are frequently excluded from clinical trials, slowing progress in treating late-life depression.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, for a story about a sexually suggestive birthday card he allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. This legal action is part of a broader pattern of Trump using the courts and his executive power to challenge media outlets he deems critical. The lawsuit aims to punish the newspaper and serve as a warning to other media organizations. This move represents a significant escalation in his long-standing war on the press, turning a former political ally into a legal adversary.</p>

          <p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, has criticized the UK government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Turk described the ban as a "disturbing" and "disproportionate" misuse of counter-terrorism laws that infringes on rights to freedom of expression and association. The ban, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense, was enacted after activists damaged military aircraft they claimed were used to support Israel. Turk argued that the UK's broad definition of terrorism goes beyond international standards.</p>

Despite calls for a ceasefire from the US and other international bodies, and an offer of mediation from Malaysia, Thailand has stated that third-party intervention is not yet needed.

          <p>British fashion chain River Island is in a precarious position as it awaits a court ruling on its proposed restructuring plan. The company intends to close 33 UK stores and secure rent reductions for 71 others, citing financial losses due to the shift to online shopping and rising operational costs. Analysts note the retailer faces intense competition from online giants like Shein and has struggled to maintain its relevance and customer base. The future of the high-street stalwart, which has been in business since 1948, now depends on whether its creditors and the High Court approve the plan.</p>

          <p>The US National Transportation Safety Board has determined that a 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene "Buzzy" Peltola Jr., husband of then-US Rep. Mary Peltola, was caused by overloading. The report states the small Piper PA-18 plane was nearly 120 pounds over its maximum weight due to a cargo of moose meat. Additionally, moose antlers had been improperly strapped to the plane's wing strut, which degraded the aircraft's performance and flight characteristics. Peltola lost control of the plane shortly after taking off from a remote area near St. Mary's, Alaska, leading to the fatal wreck.</p>

While a majority of UN member states support recognition, key Western powers like the US, Canada, and Germany maintain that it should only come as part of a final peace settlement with Israel.
