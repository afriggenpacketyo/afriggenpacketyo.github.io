            <p>Uber's annual lost and found index reveals a variety of forgotten items in rideshares, ranging from common items like phones and wallets to bizarre objects such as Shrek ears and divorce papers. New York City is identified as the most forgetful city, with phones being the most frequently lost item. Uber provides instructions on how to report lost items, even if the phone itself is lost, by accessing the account through a computer. The rideshare company also notes trends in lost items, such as legal documents, liquors, and red-colored items, and observes that cowboy hats are most often left behind on Saturdays.</p>

            <p>Ascent, a 284-foot luxury apartment building in Milwaukee, is the world's tallest timber-concrete hybrid structure, showcasing the potential of mass timber construction. Developer Tim Gokhman emphasizes the environmental benefits of using wood over steel and concrete, citing the lower carbon footprint and reduced labor intensity. Mass timber is created by gluing prefabricated wood pieces together, resulting in a strong and lightweight material that is also easily recyclable. The timber's fire resistance was tested at the U.S. Forest Services laboratory, confirming its compliance with building codes and ensuring safe evacuation times.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on most new tariffs and lowered the reciprocal tariff rate to 10%, while simultaneously increasing tariffs on goods imported from China to 125%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that the 10% tariff rate applies to virtually all countries except China. Trump explained that the pause was initiated because countries were getting "a little bit yippy" and to address concerns in the bond market. Bessent stated that Trump wants to be personally involved in negotiations with over 75 countries seeking trade solutions.</p>

            <p>England's Children's Commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, believes that decisions regarding phone bans in schools should be left to head teachers rather than imposed nationally. A survey indicates that most schools already limit phone use, but children are spending more time on devices at home. Dame Rachel suggests that parents need support in managing their children's online activities, and technology companies should prioritize online safety. While supporting head teachers' autonomy, the report also recommends further research into the potential benefits of wider restrictions on children's phone use, particularly social media.</p>

            <p>The House passed the No Rogue Rulings Act, which aims to limit federal district judges' ability to issue nationwide injunctions, restricting their scope to directly affected parties in most cases. Republicans argue that Democrat-appointed judges have been blocking President Trump's policies on a national scale. Representative Issa expressed hope for bipartisan support, while others emphasized the bill's commonsense approach to reining in the overuse of nationwide injunctions. Despite its House passage, the bill faces uncertain prospects in the Senate, requiring support from several Democrats to reach the 60-vote threshold.</p>

            <p>Despite President Trump's tariffs intended to punish China, the country's grip on American life remains strong, particularly in everyday goods. The tariffs often hit American consumers hardest, failing to dislodge China's dominance in stationery and other necessities. For example, China produces approximately 85% of the pens and pencils used in the United States, and a significant portion of America's religious book imports, including Bibles, come from China. This highlights the complex and often ironic nature of the US-China trade relationship.</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists have developed a process to overcome metal fatigue, transforming common stainless steel into a material suitable for aerospace and high-grade applications. The team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences altered the steel's internal structure by twisting it, more than doubling its yield strength and increasing its resistance to metal fatigue by a factor of up to 10,000. Potential applications include undersea pipelines and engine components exposed to pressure, offering technological support to high-end equipment manufacturing and engineering sectors. The internal structure of the material is transformed without visible change to the surface.</p>

            <p>President Trump ordered the Justice Department to investigate Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs, former homeland security officials who refuted claims of election fraud. Taylor, who wrote anonymously against Trump, is accused of leaking classified information, while Krebs, who declared the 2020 election secure, is accused of weaponizing his position against free speech. Trump accused both men of treason and fraud, respectively, and ordered investigations into their activities. These actions came amid a flurry of executive orders and memoranda signed by Trump, including measures aimed at reviving US shipbuilding and deregulating water pressure in showers.</p>

            <p>Following President Trump's pause on tariffs, Jim Cramer shared four lessons learned from the week's market turmoil. He advised against panicking, emphasizing that staying the course is key to making money in the market (not investment advice). Cramer noted that the market punished negative investors and rewarded those who stuck with their investments. He also cautioned that investors should expect volatility with Trump in charge, but assume he will change course if policies harm stocks. Finally, Cramer advised against betting against good companies, even when they face temporary setbacks.</p>

            <p>President Trump signed an executive order to change the federal definition of "showerhead," aiming to "end the Obama-Biden war on water pressure." Trump has long complained about inadequate water pressure in American showers and blamed federal water-conservation standards. The executive order applies to multiple household appliances, including toilets and sinks, with the White House claiming it will "make America's showers great again." Appliance experts have noted Trump's continued focus on American water pressure, despite past efforts to roll back stricter energy-efficiency standards being reversed by Joe Biden.</p>

            <p>The Dodgers ended their three-game losing streak with a 6-5 win over the Nationals, fueled by an early four-run burst and a seventh-inning rally. After a frustrating series, the Dodgers showed renewed intensity, with Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández leading the offensive charge. Despite the Nationals briefly taking the lead, Andy Pages's game-tying home run and Hernández's go-ahead single secured the victory. Freddie Freeman is expected to return to the lineup for the team's upcoming homestand.</p>
