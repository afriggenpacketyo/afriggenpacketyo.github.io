          <p>Hurricane Erin is projected to grow larger and bring dangerous rip currents to the U.S. East Coast this week, though it is not expected to make direct landfall. The storm, downgraded to a Category 2, had maximum sustained winds of 110 mph and was moving northwest. Coastal flooding and strong winds are possible in North Carolina's Outer Banks, prompting mandatory evacuations. Forecasters warn that ocean conditions will be unsafe for much of the week, with high waves expected along the Eastern Seaboard.</p>

          <p>An Alabama inmate scheduled for execution by nitrogen hypoxia in October has filed a lawsuit, challenging the method as unconstitutionally cruel. Anthony Boyd, convicted of a 1993 murder, is pushing for alternative execution methods such as firing squad, hanging, or medical-aid-in-dying. His attorneys argue that previous nitrogen gas executions showed signs of "conscious suffocation, terror, and pain." Alabama officials maintain that inmates lose consciousness quickly and do not experience unconstitutional suffering.</p>

          <p>Viking Therapeutics' shares fell 40% following the release of mid-stage trial data for its obesity pill, VK2735, which disappointed investors. The results suggest the drug's efficacy and side effect profile may be inferior to competitors like Eli Lilly's oral drug, potentially hindering Viking's position in the booming weight loss market. High discontinuation rates due to gastrointestinal side effects were noted in the trial, reinforcing the dominance of established players. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A series of clean energy tax credits, originally established under the Inflation Reduction Act, are now set to expire earlier than planned due to President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Homeowners installing solar panels, heat pumps, and other technologies, as well as electric vehicle buyers, face accelerated deadlines, mostly by December 31, 2025. This change significantly shortens the window for consumers to take advantage of these financial incentives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new episode of Vox's The Gray Area podcast explores the 'New Right,' a movement of radical intellectuals hostile to American liberal democracy, who see Donald Trump as a vehicle for fundamental overhaul. Political theorist Laura Field categorizes these thinkers into groups like Claremonters, post-liberals, and national conservatives, highlighting their shared principles such as economic nationalism and culture war commitment. The article discusses their growing influence on the Republican Party and the potential implications for American politics.</p>

          <p>Families of incarcerated individuals who died or were harmed due to alleged negligent care by private-equity-backed prison healthcare companies, Corizon (now YesCare) and Wellpath, continue their fight for justice. Despite documented constitutional violations and preventable deaths, these companies have used bankruptcy filings, like Corizon's 'Texas two-step' maneuver, to shield assets from lawsuits. This article highlights the difficult battle faced by plaintiffs in bankruptcy courts, though some have achieved unusual leverage and settlements.</p>

          <p>Divorce remains deeply stigmatized and challenging for women across Asia, despite rising rates in many countries. In Pakistan, women often forfeit their Haq Mehr (dower) to initiate divorce, and face false accusations and social shaming, as highlighted by one woman's experience. The Philippines, conversely, remains one of only two places globally where divorce is illegal, forcing couples into lengthy and expensive annulment processes. This article underscores how financial dependence and collective societal norms often compel women to remain in unhappy marriages.</p>

          <p>Silicon Valley is seeing a rise in 'zombie startups' as tech giants like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon poach founders and top AI researchers through high-priced licensing deals instead of full acquisitions. This practice allows larger companies to skirt regulatory scrutiny while leaving investors and remaining employees of the original startups in limbo, effectively hollowing out the organizations. Critics argue this trend threatens innovation by diverting talent from ambitious projects to established corporations. (not investment advice)</p>
