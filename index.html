          <p>China's air force deployed its KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft overseas for the first time in a joint exercise with Egypt, signaling closer defense ties with Africa. The deployment includes YU-20 aerial refueling aircraft and J-10 fighter jets for the “Eagles of Civilisation 2025” drill. The KJ-500 is an advanced radar aircraft with sophisticated electronic warfare systems and 360-degree coverage. This move demonstrates China's growing military modernization and its capacity for strategic airlift operations and force projection in strategically sensitive areas like the Red Sea.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s claims that autism "destroys" children and families have sparked criticism for reducing complex human stories to simple tragedy. Advocates argue that such remarks distract from the urgent issues facing families with autistic individuals, including proposed Medicaid cuts. The rising prevalence of autism reflects better awareness and improved diagnostic tools, not a catastrophe. Instead of blame, families need investment in services, housing, employment pathways, and research, as well as dignity and the right to a full life.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Vision for a 'Golden Dome' Missile Defense System Faces Challenges</h2>

          <p>President Trump's proposal for a "Golden Dome" missile defense system, involving space-based interceptors, is being re-examined by the Pentagon. Such a system would be far more complex and expensive than existing missile defenses like Israel's Iron Dome. Building a comprehensive shield against intercontinental ballistic missiles would require a large constellation of satellites, raising concerns about cost and potential escalation with rival powers. Experts are divided on the feasibility and strategic implications of the Golden Dome.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Tammy Duckworth, are pressing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth for updates on the military's treatment of transgender servicemembers. They are seeking clarification on compliance with court rulings blocking President Trump's executive order attempting to ban transgender troops. The letter denounces the ban as discriminatory and harmful to national security. The inquiry highlights the ongoing conflict between the administration and the courts over transgender rights.</p>
