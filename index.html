          <p>The article discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, sparked by Israeli airstrikes, and questions whether Israel's goal is to dismantle Iran's nuclear program or topple its government. While Prime Minister Netanyahu claims the strikes are to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb, some analysts suggest the implicit goal is regime change. The article also explores the potential for the United States to become directly involved in the conflict, highlighting conflicting views within the Trump administration and the Republican Party. The piece emphasizes the instability and potential consequences of regime change, drawing comparisons to past U.S. interventions in the Middle East. Optimism in the region is low given the current circumstances.</p>

          <p>Sen. Mike Lee faced backlash and subsequently deleted social media posts that appeared to politicize the assassination of a Minnesota state representative and her husband. The posts, which blamed the governor and Marxists for the shootings, were condemned by fellow senators and representatives from both parties, who deemed them dangerous and unacceptable. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar confirmed she had a conversation with Lee before the posts were removed. The incident has amplified calls for elected officials to tone down heated rhetoric in the current political climate.

          <p>Former Senator Bob Menendez reported to a federal correctional institution in Pennsylvania to begin serving an 11-year prison sentence following his conviction on federal bribery charges. Menendez was found guilty of accepting bribes in exchange for political favors, including protecting New Jersey business owners and assisting Egypt in accessing U.S. military aid. The FBI's search of his home uncovered a large sum of cash, gold bars, and a luxury convertible, further solidifying the case against him.

          <p>A federal appeals court is reviewing President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities, following a district judge's order to return control of the Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The legal battle centers on whether Trump exceeded his authority by invoking Title 10, claiming the protests in Los Angeles constituted a "rebellion." The Trump administration argues that courts should not second-guess the president's military judgments, while California officials contend that the deployment infringes on the state's sovereign interests. The court is also considering whether the Trump administration properly notified Newsom of its order. The article presents a legal and political conflict.</p>

          <p>The Senate's proposed tax bill includes a provision for "Trump accounts," which are similar to 529 college savings plans and come with tax incentives. For children born between 2024 and 2028, the federal government will deposit $1,000 into these accounts as part of a "newborn pilot program." To be eligible, the child must be a U.S. citizen at birth, and both parents must have Social Security numbers. While supporters claim these accounts will promote wealth-building, some experts criticize them as overly complicated compared to universal savings accounts. The article is a straightforward explanation of the tax proposal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a tax break for tipped workers as part of a larger tax cut package, mirroring a similar provision passed by the House. Both versions offer a deduction on qualified tips, but the Senate proposal caps the deduction at $25,000 per year and gradually reduces its value for individuals earning over $150,000. The House bill, in contrast, has no cap and completely eliminates the deduction for individuals earning over $160,000. Tax experts note that the tax break would only benefit a small percentage of workers. The article provides a detailed comparison of the two proposals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans are proposing to add work requirements for millions of Americans receiving Medicaid and food stamps, arguing that it will encourage employment and prevent abuse of the system. The proposal would raise the age limit for SNAP work requirements to 64 and mandate that Medicaid recipients prove they are working or volunteering to qualify for benefits. However, research suggests that work requirements do not significantly boost employment and can lead to people losing benefits due to administrative hurdles.
