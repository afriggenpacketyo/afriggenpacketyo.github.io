          <p>Toyota is shifting its focus toward plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as a strategic move amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company aims to increase PHEV sales to roughly 20% of its U.S. volume by 2030, aligning with California's emission standards. Toyota plans to enhance the EV-only range of its PHEVs and is evaluating where to integrate plug-in technology across its lineup, considering factors like production capacity and competitive advantages. This expansion demonstrates Toyota's commitment to offering diverse powertrain options and adapting to evolving market demands.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Elon Musk's role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is 'continuing and permanent,' rejecting attempts by the White House to characterize his position as merely advisory and temporary. This ruling comes in response to a lawsuit filed by 14 states alleging that Musk lacks the legal authority to make sweeping changes to the federal government without Senate confirmation. The judge found that Musk's influence extends throughout the executive branch, granting the states a credible argument to proceed with their case. The article also notes that the states allege DOGE had gained 'unauthorized access' to 'private and proprietary information'.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to the Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which manages federal payments. This ruling allows four DOGE employees to access the system after the Trump administration established a training program to prevent improper disclosures. Democratic attorneys general initially sued to block DOGE's access, but the judge permitted access after appropriate training and restrictions were implemented. The ruling marks a win for the Trump administration, streamlining DOGE's access to critical financial data. The article emphasizes the court's decision to avoid functioning as Treasury's 'de facto human resources officer'.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined Â£122.7 million, the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat, for breaching rules related to sewage spills and shareholder payouts. Ofwat found that Thames Water routinely released raw sewage and made 'undeserved' dividend payments, violating environmental standards and regulatory obligations. The penalties will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers, and the funds will go to the Treasury. The article details the investigations that led to the fine, highlighting the company's struggles with a Â£20 billion debt pile and the potential for government intervention. The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized the Republican spending bill, stating that it undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to reduce wasteful government spending. In an upcoming interview, Musk expressed disappointment with the bill, projecting that it will increase the budget deficit. DOGE claims to have saved $170 billion since January by targeting government waste and redundancy, including significant staff reductions. Musk has scaled back his involvement with DOGE to focus on his companies, noting that the federal bureaucracy is 'much worse than I realized' and DOGE became 'the whipping boy for everything'.

The article suggests that Hanoi is attempting to curry favor with the Trump administration, especially considering the 46% tariff threatened by the U.S. on Vietnamese goods.
