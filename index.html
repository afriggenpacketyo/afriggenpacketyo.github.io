          <p>Atlanta rapper Silentó, known for "Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)," received a 30-year prison sentence after pleading guilty but mentally ill to voluntary manslaughter and other charges related to the 2021 shooting death of his cousin, Frederick Rooks III. Security footage and ballistics testing connected Silentó to the crime, and he confessed to the shooting during an interview with investigators. The rapper's struggles with depression and mental health issues were highlighted, with his publicist noting a prior suicide attempt in 2020 and his own statements about battling demons throughout his life. Prior to the arrest, Silentó had faced charges including domestic violence and assault with a deadly weapon, indicating a pattern of instability.

          <p>Researchers in mainland China have created a detailed electronic warfare simulation covering Taiwan and nearby waters. The simulation, developed by a team at the University of Electronic Science and Technology, models the complex terrain and electromagnetic environment with nanosecond-level precision. This allows for realistic war game scenarios, such as simulating how signals from a PLA mobile electronic warfare platform might navigate Taiwan's mountainous terrain. The technology is intended to improve computational speed and precision for channel modeling in large-scale battlefield environments.

          <p>The head of FEMA's National Response Coordination Center, Jeremy Greenberg, resigned, adding to a leadership exodus at the agency less than two weeks into hurricane season. Greenberg's role was crucial for coordinating the government's response to storms and other major disasters, including overseeing mission assignments to the Pentagon and deploying Urban Search and Rescue Teams. His departure, along with that of regional administrator Tony Robinson, raises concerns about FEMA's ability to effectively respond to future disasters. President Trump's earlier remarks about "weaning" states off FEMA assistance further fueled concerns about the agency's future direction.

The deliberations were tense, with the jury foreperson reporting an alleged threat from a fellow juror, leading to defense attorneys requesting a mistrial.
