          <p>A deceased serial killer and sexual assaulter, Robert Eugene Brashers, has been identified as a suspect in the infamous 1991 murder of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop. This significant breakthrough, revealed by an original investigator, comes through DNA evidence, providing a potential resolution to a decades-old cold case that baffled authorities. The victims, Eliza Thomas, Amy Ayers, Jennifer Harbison, and Sarah Harbison, were found gagged, tied, and shot, with the shop set on fire. The investigation previously saw four men wrongly arrested and later released when DNA evidence failed to match them, underscoring the complexities of the initial probe. This article details the long-running inquiry and the new development, offering a critical step towards justice.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted on two counts: making false statements and obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave almost five years ago. This marks a major escalation in President Trump's efforts to target political opponents, with Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging Comey obstructed a congressional investigation into sensitive information disclosure. This article reports Comey asserted his innocence in a video, stating there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump and expressing confidence in the federal judicial system. His arraignment is set for October 9 in Alexandria, Virginia.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals is currently hearing a high-stakes Medicaid fraud case that could compel Planned Parenthood to repay up to $1.8 billion in funds. This extensive lawsuit, brought by an anonymous litigant on behalf of Texas and Louisiana, stems from the states' controversial decision to strip Planned Parenthood affiliates of their Medicaid qualifications after activist David Daleiden released video footage discussing fetal tissue sales. This article highlights the significant financial implications, with opponents suggesting the outcome could severely impact the organization's national operations and potentially alter the abortion landscape. Planned Parenthood, however, vehemently defends its actions, characterizing the lawsuit as a politically motivated attempt to undermine access to essential sexual and reproductive healthcare services.</p>

          <p>Recently released documents from the Jeffrey Epstein Estate mention prominent figures like Elon Musk and Prince Andrew, alongside others such as Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon. These files, turned over to the House Oversight Committee, include a reminder about Musk potentially visiting Epstein's island in December 2014 and a May 2000 flight manifest listing Prince Andrew among passengers with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. This article clarifies that the mentions do not suggest involvement in Epstein's criminal activities, and both Musk and Prince Andrew have previously denied wrongdoing. Democrats on the committee are urging the Attorney General to release more files for victims' justice, while Republicans accuse them of politicizing the issue.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid funding, granting an emergency request in a dispute with Congress over appropriated money. This 6-3 decision effectively extends a temporary freeze on a lower court injunction that required the administration to spend the funds. This article notes the ruling is not a final determination on the merits but reflects a preliminary view that the government's argument against the lawsuit has sufficient showing. Dissenting justices highlighted the substantial consequence of allowing the executive branch to cease obligating funds intended for critical overseas development, peacekeeping, and democracy promotion projects, emphasizing the high stakes for the separation of powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt totaling a staggering $1.21 trillion, this article comprehensively explores how debt forgiveness, or settlement, can significantly reduce a $20,000 credit card balance. It explains that successful settlements typically cut debt by 30% to 50%, potentially saving borrowers between $6,000 and $10,000 or more. The article contrasts this with traditional minimum payments, which could lead to paying over double the original amount due to high interest compounding daily. It highlights settlement as a faster path to becoming debt-free, typically resolving debts within three to five years, albeit with potential negative impacts on one's credit score.

          <p>This article details the current monthly costs for a $20,000 home equity loan following recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, noting that payments for a 10-year loan are approximately $246 and for a 15-year loan, about $194. It highlights that while recent rate cuts have had only a muted impact on these specific loan costs, home equity loans remain an inexpensive and secure borrowing option with fixed rates. Furthermore, they offer potential tax advantages if funds are used for eligible home repairs. Borrowers are advised to calculate their costs closely to ensure long-term affordability, as using one's home as collateral always warrants careful consideration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced new 50% tariffs on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 30% on upholstered furniture, controversially citing national security concerns. Experts are questioning this rationale, finding it difficult to connect these specific products to national security, even broadly defined. This article highlights that the tariffs, imposed under Section 232 of a national security law, bypass Congress and are raising significant concerns about their impact on U.S. consumers and businesses. The affected industry itself is not immediately celebrating, and critics warn of enormous uncertainty and volatility in the trade landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump is threatening to move World Cup matches out of U.S. cities he deems "a little bit dangerous," specifically targeting Democratic-led cities like Seattle and San Francisco. Despite Trump lacking the direct authority to relocate FIFA-controlled matches, his "great friend" FIFA leader Gianni Infantino has previously accommodated his requests. This article highlights concerns that Trump could still make things difficult by influencing federal security funding for host cities, which typically rely on such allocations. Lawmakers and experts dismiss the threat as "bluster" but acknowledge the divisive rhetoric as part of his broader theme of crime and retribution against Democratic administrations.</p>

This article notes Begum criticized the party for suspending MPs who vote with their conscience, while the move comes amid rising pressure on ministers to abolish the policy, which prevents payments for a third or subsequent child and costs £3.5bn to scrap.</p>
