          <p>The Supreme Court of Argentina discovered 83 boxes filled with Nazi materials dating back to World War II within its basement archives. The collection includes photographs, postcards, notebooks, and propaganda intended to promote Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina. Experts from Argentina's Holocaust Museum have been invited to document and preserve the materials, and further analysis will seek to uncover details about the Holocaust, such as international financing networks used by the Nazis. The boxes originated from the German embassy in Japan and were intercepted by Argentine customs in 1941 due to concerns about Argentina's neutrality during the war.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to sign an executive order to lower medication costs by tying Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctor's offices to the lowest price paid by other countries. This initiative, dubbed the 'most favored nation' policy, aims to address the high cost of prescription drugs in the United States compared to other wealthy nations. The proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that lower prices will negatively impact innovation and research. A similar attempt by Trump during his first term was blocked by court orders citing procedural issues, and the Biden administration later abandoned the proposal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 plane as a donation from the Qatari royal family, which would be upgraded to serve as Air Force One, making it one of the biggest foreign gifts ever received by the U.S. government. The plane would then be donated to President Trump‚Äôs presidential library when he leaves office, raising concerns about the intersection of Trump‚Äôs official duties with his business interests and potential use of the plane after his presidency. While a Qatari official described the proposal as still under discussion, Democratic lawmakers and good government groups have expressed outrage over the substantial ethical issues the plan presents.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order to lower some drug prices in the United States by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay. This 'most favored nation' pricing model aims to address the high cost of prescription drugs in the US. The proposal will likely face legal challenges and opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it would cut into profits and reduce investment in research. The plan revisits an idea that was blocked in court during Trump's first term.</p>

The article explores whether this trend is a marketing gimmick or if these products are genuinely useful for building muscle or living a healthy life. While high-protein diets are necessary for building muscle, experts recommend obtaining protein from whole foods rather than processed snacks. Many supermarket products advertising their protein content are considered gimmicky and may not be as healthy as advertised, with some being ultra-processed and high in calories.</p>
