          <h2>German Parliament President Orders Removal of LGBTQ+ Rainbow Flags from Offices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 07:51:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The president of Germany's Bundestag, Julia Klöckner of the conservative CDU, has ordered the removal of rainbow flags from parliamentary offices, citing house rules that prohibit posting signs on windows visible from the outside. This move has sparked controversy, with opposition parties like the Greens and Left accusing her of having a "bigoted understanding" of neutrality, especially at a time of rising hostility towards queer communities. The decision follows Klöckner's earlier refusal to fly the Pride flag over the Bundestag for Christopher Street Day, a tradition since 2022, further intensifying the debate over political symbols in the legislature.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's manager, Arne Slot, has spoken publicly for the first time about the death of player Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash along with his brother. Slot encouraged his players to be true to their emotions, stating they should laugh or cry as they feel necessary while processing the tragedy. The club has retired Jota's number 20 shirt and held tributes, including a visit to Anfield by the squad and Jota's family. In his interview, Slot emphasized that the team will carry Jota's memory with them and that the best way to honor him is for everyone to be themselves, just as Jota always was.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The bald eagle has been officially designated as the national bird of the United States, a move that holds special significance for many Native American communities who have long revered the eagle as a sacred messenger to the Creator. For many Indigenous peoples, the bird is a powerful symbol of strength and spirituality, and its feathers are bestowed in ceremonies to mark important life achievements. While the eagle has been a national symbol since 1782, this formal recognition is seen by some, like members of the Prairie Island Indian Community, as a hopeful sign that could foster greater respect and unity in a divided nation.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old boy has died after an incident in the River Kelvin in Glasgow, with his body recovered late at night by emergency services. The tragedy occurred on Saturday, which was Scotland's hottest day in two years, with temperatures reaching 32.2C in some areas. On the same day, a 63-year-old woman also died after a fall near a waterfall in East Dunbartonshire. Police have stated that neither of the deaths is being treated as suspicious, and the heatwave had prompted authorities to urge public caution as many people flocked to outdoor beauty spots.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the European Union to "defend European interests resolutely" and prepare for a potential trade war following Donald Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on most EU imports. Macron urged the European Commission to accelerate the preparation of credible countermeasures if a deal is not reached by August 1. While other European leaders, including those from Germany and Italy, have called for calm and a pragmatic negotiated solution, the threat has sent shockwaves through the bloc. The Federation of German Industries described the announcement as a "wake-up call" for industries on both sides of the Atlantic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, activists reflect on the five years since the murder of George Floyd, arguing that the initial wave of corporate diversity statements and symbolic political gestures has failed to deliver meaningful change. They contend that the demands for deep economic and political transformation were met instead with increased police budgets and a new era of authoritarianism. The authors assert that the machinery of repression, once used on marginalized communities, is now being expanded to quell any dissent. They call for a renewed focus on grassroots organizing and building community-based safety alternatives to resist state violence and create a more just society.</p>

          <p>A month of relentless immigration raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Los Angeles has created a pervasive climate of fear, particularly in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods like MacArthur Park. Residents and business owners report that the constant presence of federal agents has severely impacted local economies, as people are afraid to leave their homes. The raids, which critics and a legal complaint describe as targeting people based on their appearance, have led to nearly 2,800 arrests in the region. A federal judge recently issued a temporary restraining order barring agents from stopping people without "reasonable suspicion," potentially disrupting the aggressive enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated a landmark civil rights settlement designed to address a decades-old raw sewage crisis in Lowndes County, Alabama, dismissing it as an "illegal" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative. In this impoverished, majority-Black county, many residents lack functioning sanitation systems, forcing them to live with raw wastewater near their homes. The 2023 settlement, reached under the Biden administration, had mandated the state to fix the problem and provided federal funds for new septic systems. The termination of this agreement leaves residents in a state of uncertainty and puts the responsibility back on Alabama lawmakers to resolve the longstanding public health issue.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas Hill Country, questions are being raised about the state's political culture, which seems to prioritize disaster recovery over proactive prevention. Texas is the most disaster-prone state in the U.S., yet lawmakers recently killed a bill to create a statewide emergency alert system over cost concerns. This pattern of inaction is not new, echoing the responses to the 2021 winter storm that crippled the power grid and Hurricane Ike in 2008. Observers suggest this "Texas way" is rooted in a political aversion to government regulation and spending, influenced by climate change skepticism and the fossil fuel industry.</p>

          <p>With the NFL committing to send its players to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics for flag football, Major League Baseball is facing pressure to do the same for baseball. Despite stars like Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge expressing interest, MLB has not yet agreed to let its top players participate, a decision that could cede the spotlight to other sports. The primary conflict appears to be logistical, as the Olympics occur mid-season, and financial, as MLB controls its own successful international tournament, the World Baseball Classic.

          <p>The current season of 'Love Island USA' has been notable for its increased racial diversity, with Black contestants being a consistent and central presence from the start. The article observes how dark-skinned Black women on the show have navigated the villa, seemingly aware of the trope that often casts them as villains, and have consciously avoided conflict. However, the analysis points out a significant contradiction: while the show appears to decenter whiteness in its casting, it has failed to address real-world racism. Two contestants were unceremoniously removed from the show after past racist posts resurfaced, but producers only vaguely cited "a personal situation" to the audience.</p>

Health officials attribute the rise in measles cases to a decline in the uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

The author argues that society has traded true heroism, defined by public contribution and courage, for flimsy celebrity and fame. The article heavily criticizes several Republican politicians for what it calls their cowardly and self-serving votes on the "Big Beautiful Bill," accusing them of abandoning their stated principles on fiscal responsibility and healthcare. It concludes that America doesn't need a superhero, but rather more everyday people with the courage to do the right thing.</p>

          <h2>Columnist Suggests LeBron James Could Learn from Kobe Bryant's Approach to Retirement</h2>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times columnist argues that LeBron James, now playing on a one-year expiring contract for the first time in his career, should consider how to manage the end of his career by looking at Kobe Bryant's example. The article notes that the Lakers did not offer James an extension, suggesting the team is now built around Luka Doncic and may view James's contract as an albatross. It recalls how Bryant announced his retirement early in his final season, which allowed him to control the narrative and experience a celebrated farewell tour. The author suggests this approach could provide a graceful exit for James and give the Lakers a head start on rebuilding.</p>

          <p>California is establishing a new state agency dedicated solely to housing and homelessness, an issue consistently ranked as a top concern by residents. Governor Gavin Newsom's reorganization plan splits the unwieldy Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency into two, creating a new Cabinet-level secretary focused on housing. Supporters believe this will elevate the issue to the highest level of state government and is a crucial first step toward streamlining the state's complex and fragmented affordable housing finance system. Critics, however, are skeptical that a bureaucratic reshuffle alone will solve California's deep-seated housing affordability and construction cost problems.</p>

          <p>The class of 2025 is struggling to find employment in a surprisingly difficult job market, with economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York calling it one of the toughest in recent memory, outside of the pandemic. Despite a low overall unemployment rate, cautious employers, job cuts in sectors like tech and government, and fewer people quitting have resulted in limited opportunities for entry-level workers. A ZipRecruiter survey found a significant gap between the salary expectations of graduates and the actual pay they are receiving. Experts advise graduates to be flexible, as even a less-than-ideal first job can be a valuable stepping stone for their careers.</p>

          <p>The death toll from the devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country has risen to 129, with search and recovery operations still underway for missing individuals. In response to the tragedy, more than 30 active duty and former Navy SEALs have volunteered to assist, using their expertise to navigate the difficult, debris-filled terrain of the Guadalupe River. During a visit to the area, President Donald Trump praised the response efforts as "incredible" and "heroism." He dismissed questions about the timeliness of warning alerts as being from "a very evil person," and stated that the state would "figure something out" regarding the future of the alert system.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting is set to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week to try and prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The doctors are demanding a better pay offer, arguing that this year's 5.4% increase is insufficient to restore pay value, which they claim has fallen by 20% in real terms since 2008. The government has insisted it cannot improve the current offer. While the BMA expressed hope for constructive discussions, health department sources indicate the health secretary is firm on salary but may be open to improving working conditions for the doctors.</p>

          <p>The final fight in the Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano trilogy is framed as a transcendent moment for women's boxing, not for its chaotic drama, but for its tactical maturity. The author argues that true equality in the sport is the right for female fighters to be strategic and "win ugly," just as men do, without the pressure to constantly provide a spectacle. However, the article also points to the sport's contradictions, where elite fighters earn millions while undercard athletes struggle financially, and sexist imagery persists. It concludes that by fighting for their own glory and legacy, Taylor and Serrano reclaim their bodies and challenge traditional notions of womanhood.</p>

It is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before crashing into the Sahara desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Analysis confirmed its origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. This single meteorite represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material currently on our planet.</p>

Amber heat health alerts are still in effect for southern and eastern England, warning of potential health risks, especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.

          <p>After a four-decade-long conflict, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its armed struggle against the Turkish state and initiated a disarmament process. The move, which follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, is seen as a major opportunity for reconciliation. The PKK has laid out demands, including Ocalan's release and amnesty for fighters, while the Turkish government remains cautious. Analysts believe a successful peace process could not only resolve the domestic conflict but also improve Turkey's strained relations with Kurds in Iraq and Syria, enhancing its overall status in the Middle East.</p>
