          <p>A significant cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a provider of check-in and boarding systems, has caused widespread disruption at major European airports, including London's Heathrow, Berlin, and Brussels. The attack on the company's MUSE software has forced airlines to resort to manual check-in processes, leading to long delays and flight cancellations for a second consecutive day. This incident highlights the vulnerability of the aviation industry's interconnected digital infrastructure to supply chain attacks, prompting calls for enhanced cybersecurity and international cooperation.</p>

          <p>UK Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey is urging the communications regulator, Ofcom, to take action against Elon Musk, alleging that "crimes" are being committed on the social media platform X.

He is calling for Musk to be held personally accountable and plans to use his party's conference to criticize Musk's influence on British democracy.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is anticipated to announce the United Kingdom's formal recognition of a Palestinian state, marking a significant shift in British foreign policy. The decision follows a deadline set for Israel to agree to a ceasefire and commit to a two-state solution, a move that has drawn criticism from the Israeli government and some hostage families. This policy change reflects growing international pressure on Israel amid the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the expansion of settlements in the West Bank.</p>

          <p>An email from 2011 has resurfaced in which Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a "supreme friend." The email was reportedly sent shortly after she had publicly disavowed him, stating her association was a "gigantic error of judgment." A spokesperson for the duchess explained that the email was sent in an attempt to dissuade Epstein from suing her for defamation after her public condemnation, and reiterated that she stands by her denunciation of his actions.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues for Empathy Amid Rising Societal Hate and Division</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 05:00:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, author Keith Magee reflects on the normalization of hate and prejudice in both the United States and Britain, citing his own experiences with racism and connecting them to broader trends of political violence. The article argues that a growing "deficit of empathy" is corroding democratic societies and fostering cultures of cruelty fueled by divisive rhetoric. Drawing on the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the author calls for empathy to become a public practice to heal societal divisions and break cycles of hate.</p>

          <p>As several Western nations prepare to recognize a Palestinian state, analysts are debating the tangible effects of such a move. While largely symbolic, recognition could grant Palestinians a stronger diplomatic standing in future negotiations, elevating their status from an "entity" to a state in bilateral and international forums. However, critics argue that without concrete actions like sanctions against Israel for its actions in Gaza and the West Bank, recognition alone may be a "performative" gesture that fails to halt the ongoing conflict or change the reality on the ground.</p>

          <p>In the occupied West Bank, Palestinians are welcoming the expected recognition of their statehood by the UK and other nations, viewing it as an important affirmation of their rights. This diplomatic support comes as Israeli military control expands and settlements grow, with many residents feeling powerless and unprotected by the Palestinian Authority. While acknowledging that recognition will not immediately change their daily reality and may provoke further Israeli annexation, local leaders see it as a crucial step for their future.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced the appointment of his former lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, as the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The move came shortly after Trump publicly pressured Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue investigations into his political adversaries, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The previous US attorney for the district had recently resigned after concluding there was insufficient evidence to bring charges in a case the administration was pushing.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is strengthening over the central Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to become a hurricane by Sunday. The storm is currently expected to remain over open water, passing east of Bermuda on Monday without making landfall, and no watches or warnings are in effect. However, the National Hurricane Center predicts that distant swells from Gabrielle will reach the East Coast of the U.S. and Canada, continuing into early next week.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has found evidence of recent landslide activity on the moon, challenging the long-held belief that the moon is geologically dormant. By comparing high-resolution images taken since 2009, researchers identified 41 new landslides, which they believe were triggered by shallow moonquakes. This discovery has significant implications for future lunar missions and the establishment of permanent bases, highlighting potential geological hazards that must be considered for the safety of infrastructure and astronauts on the lunar surface.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at protecting residents from federal immigration enforcement operations, which he referred to as actions by "secret police." The new laws include the "No Secret Police Act," which bans on-duty federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings and requires them to be identifiable by name and badge. Other measures restrict immigration agents' access to schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant, representing a legislative pushback against the Trump administration's enforcement tactics.</p>
