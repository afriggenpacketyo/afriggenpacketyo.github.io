          <p>A South Korean court has ordered the Japanese government to pay compensation to the son of a former "comfort woman" for her treatment in military brothels during World War II. This is the third South Korean ruling in favor of comfort women, although Japan maintains that all claims related to its colonial rule were settled under a 1965 agreement. The Japanese government views the ruling as a violation of international law and the principle of sovereign immunity, further straining relations between the two countries despite previous attempts to resolve the issue.</p>

          <p>Amherst College, known for its diversity, is facing an identity crisis after a significant drop in Black student enrollment. Federal data from 2023 showed Amherst with a relatively high Black enrollment rate of 11%, but the incoming freshman class data revealed a stark decrease to only 3%. This decline has led to a noticeable shift in the Black student community, with reduced engagement and participation in campus events. Students are concerned about the impact on the college's commitment to diversity and inclusion, as well as the long-term implications for the campus climate.</p>

          <p>President Trump is increasing pressure on Russia and Ukraine to end their conflict, aiming to secure a peace deal within his first 100 days in office, even if it requires territorial concessions. Despite ongoing US-sponsored negotiations, Russia has intensified attacks on Kyiv, prompting a rare rebuke from Trump towards Putin. US envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow, signaling continued efforts to broker a deal, although the path to a resolution remains uncertain.</p>

This consideration comes as officials from China's commerce ministry engage with businesses to identify crucial imports vulnerable to the new trade barriers. The potential exemptions aim to mitigate disruptions to supply chains and address concerns from companies whose business models may be unsustainable under prolonged tariff wars, particularly in sectors like healthcare.</p>

He would consider it a "total victory" even if the U.S. has levies as high as 50% still in place a year from now.</p>

Trump's tariffs are likened to self-inflicted oil shocks, which will lead to higher prices, reduced demand, and job losses.

          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder overcame a 29-point deficit to defeat the Memphis Grizzlies 114-108, taking a 3-0 series lead after Ja Morant left the game with a hip injury. Morant's absence significantly impacted the Grizzlies' performance in the second half, as the Thunder mounted their comeback led by Chet Holmgren and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Thunder can close out the series in the next game, while the Grizzlies face uncertainty regarding Morant's availability.</p>

          <p>Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that domestic energy prices in the UK will fall in July, reversing three consecutive increases in regulator Ofgem's price cap. The annual bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity is forecast to fall by £166 a year, a drop of nearly 9%. This would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost £1,683.</p>
