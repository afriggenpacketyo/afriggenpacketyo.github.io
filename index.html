          <p>A public feud erupted between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, with Trump threatening to withdraw government contracts from Musk's companies and Musk suggesting Trump couldn't have won the election without him. The conflict began over Musk's criticism of Trump's tax-cut and spending bill, escalating into online exchanges on Truth Social and X. Billionaire Bill Ackman urged both men to reconcile for the country's benefit, while others like Steve Bannon suggested seizing SpaceX through the Defense Production Act. Mark Cuban seemingly endorsed a proposal from Musk to create a new political party representing the middle ground. </p>

          <p>Opposition is growing among Members of Parliament (MPs) regarding a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, with a number of MPs who initially supported or abstained now indicating they will likely vote against it. The bill, sponsored by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would allow terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to receive medical assistance to die. Some MPs who previously supported the bill now express concerns about protecting vulnerable individuals and ensuring alternative ways to improve their quality of life are considered. Concerns have also been raised about potential coercion and the lack of safeguards within the bill. </p>

          <p>Ispace, a Tokyo-based company, experienced a failed lunar landing attempt when its private lander crashed into the moon after communication was lost less than two minutes before its scheduled touchdown. The lander, named Resilience, carried a rover intended to gather lunar dirt and a Swedish artist's Moonhouse. Preliminary analysis suggests a laser system malfunction caused the lander to descend too quickly, resulting in a hard landing. CEO Takeshi Hakamada apologized and emphasized the company's commitment to future lunar missions, viewing this as a steppingstone for a larger lander launch planned by 2027 with NASA's involvement. The incident underscores the challenges faced by private entities entering the lunar exploration arena. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his claims, without providing evidence, that former President Joe Biden's aides illegally used an autopen to enact policies he didn't support. Trump has ordered the Justice Department to investigate the matter, despite Biden's denial and legal counsel's endorsement of autopens as lawful. Trump claimed he could identify which executive orders were signed with an autopen and that aides used it to enact "open borders" and transgender rights policies. Biden has dismissed the probe as a distraction. </p>

          <p>Lululemon's shares have experienced a significant drop as the company navigates the impact of Trump's tariffs and concerns about a slowing U.S. economy.

The company plans to strategically increase prices on a small portion of its assortment, while also cutting costs and negotiating with vendors. Last year, 40% of Lululemon's products were made in Vietnam, and 28% of its fabrics came from mainland China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reviews three new film releases. "Ballerina," starring Ana de Armas, is praised for its action sequences and Armas' performance, although the story is considered unconvincing. "Dangerous Animals" is a suspenseful thriller with a unique premise and strong performances, particularly from Jai Courtney. "The Ritual," starring Al Pacino, is considered less successful, with a weak storyline and stylistic choices that detract from the film's impact. </p>
