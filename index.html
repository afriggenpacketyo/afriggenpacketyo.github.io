          <p>Police in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, have initiated a murder inquiry after a man was found dead in a house on Sunday. A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the death. Authorities suspect the incident may be linked to a separate, serious assault on a priest that occurred earlier the same day. The priest, Fr. John Murray, was attacked with a bottle inside St Patrick's Church and remains in serious condition, adding a disturbing layer to the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid tribute to Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell, who passed away at the age of 97. Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," described the astronaut as a leader who dared to venture where others would not. Lovell famously commanded the near-disastrous 1970 lunar mission, which became known as a "successful failure" after the crew returned safely to Earth following an in-flight explosion. In his tribute, Hanks celebrated Lovell's spirit of exploration and his voyages into the cosmos, concluding with "God speed you."</p>

          <p>Former Surgeon General Jerome Adams criticized the decision by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to halt approximately $500 million in mRNA vaccine research funding. Adams, who served in the Trump administration, argued that the move is based on false assertions about the technology's efficacy and warned that "people are going to die" as a result. He highlighted that mRNA technology saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic and holds promise for treating cancer and HIV. Adams also condemned Kennedy's response to a recent shooting at the CDC.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended a planned military offensive into Gaza City, stating it is the only way to achieve the "complete the defeat of Hamas." He asserted that Israel's goal is to "free Gaza," not occupy it, and that a short timetable is in place for the operation. The plan, which has drawn international condemnation, involves dismantling Hamas strongholds while moving civilians to designated safe zones.

The article argues that Spark, often celebrated as a comic writer, was fundamentally a religious one whose work was deeply influenced by the Bible, particularly the Book of Job. Her novels often explore themes of divine judgment and human fallibility through a darkly comic lens. Spark's theology was expressed through narrative form, where she played a god-like role as an author with her characters.</p>

          <p>Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told staff that Friday's shooting attack on their Atlanta campus was a targeted and deliberate act.

Law enforcement sources indicate the suspect may have targeted the CDC over health concerns he blamed on the COVID-19 vaccine.

          <p>In her upcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggests that her predecessor, Alex Salmond, may have leaked details of the sexual misconduct investigation against him. Allies of Salmond, who was cleared of all charges in 2020 and died in 2023, have dismissed the claim as a "fabrication." The journalist who broke the story also expressed skepticism, calling it a "conspiracy theory too far." The controversy highlights the deep and bitter rift that formed between the two once-dominant figures of Scottish politics, whose partnership led Scotland to an independence referendum.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he designed with Adidas Originals culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by huaraches, which are made by Indigenous artisans in Mexico. The design drew backlash, including from Mexico's president, for being produced without partnership or credit to the origin communities. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in direct collaboration with the Oaxacan community, and promotional images of the shoe have been removed from social media.</p>

          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic explores the complex dynamics behind President Trump's planned meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The summit, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, has raised concerns among allies that Trump might concede Ukrainian territory to Russia. The piece details the back-channel negotiations led by envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's personal frustration with Putin's previous lack of commitment to peace talks. While Trump views himself as a peacemaker, the article highlights the risk that the summit could legitimize Putin without achieving a just or lasting peace for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," delves into the literary tradition of strange sisters who are perceived as a menace by their community. Set in 18th-century England, the story follows five sisters accused of witchcraft and transforming into dogs, exploring why femininity itself can be seen as an unnatural force. The novel directly engages with the subtext of witch stories, questioning why women's bodies and bonds are often feared. By referencing classic literature and using a lush, violent prose, the book examines the potent and often dangerous allure of this enduring cultural trope.</p>

A significant advantage is that Americans can stay in Albania for up to a year without a visa, making it an ideal location to "test drive" life abroad.
