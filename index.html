          <p>The United States is considering lifting sanctions on Syria, a move that could have significant implications for Lebanon. President Joseph Aoun believes that stability in Syria could positively impact Lebanon and the region. The potential lifting of sanctions could lead to increased regional trade, the return of Syrian refugees, and economic recovery for Lebanon, which faces soaring inflation and political turmoil. Analysts suggest that economic integration between Lebanon and Syria could exceed any competition, with the opening of land corridors linking Lebanon to Jordan, Iraq, and the Gulf countries.</p>

          <p>A vote on a megabill aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners. Representatives Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman, and Chip Roy voted against the bill, citing concerns about the timing of savings and Medicaid work requirements. The move is a setback for Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump, who had urged Republicans to unite behind the bill. Negotiations will continue over the weekend, with the Budget Committee reconvening on Sunday night, but the bill's future remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A military parade to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade in Washington, D.C., is expected to include over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters. The event will feature Abrams tanks, requiring metal plates to be laid down to protect the pavement. While the White House says the cost will be shared, the plans have drawn criticism from Democrats, who view the event as wasteful and self-aggrandizing. This parade follows Mr. Trump's interest in military pageantry dating back to his first term.</p>

This includes "duty-related physical and psychological fitness-for-duty examinations; work performance records," and any criminal or investigation records.

          <h2>Americans Fear Losing Medicaid Coverage Due to Proposed Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts to fund President Donald Trump's agenda have sparked fear among Americans who rely on the program for healthcare. An analysis suggests that these cuts could increase the number of uninsured by at least 8.6 million by 2034. While Republicans claim the cuts will only eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse, some Americans worry about reduced access to care or having to choose between healthcare and necessities. The proposed bill also includes work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients, which could jeopardize care for those with substance use disorders or other challenges.</p>

          <p>A federal judge expressed frustration with the Trump administration for withholding details on efforts to reverse the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly sent to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis accused the Justice Department of failing to adequately comply with her order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. The Justice Department cited state secrets privilege to withhold information, which the judge rejected. The case involves allegations that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, which his lawyers deny, and the judge questioned the legality of his removal.</p>

The indictment alleges that Combs and his associates used force, threats, and controlled substances to coerce women into sex acts with male prostitutes. Combs' attorney claims the charges are overblown and that the case is about love, jealousy, infidelity, and money.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to remove endangered species protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird in the southern Great Plains. Despite being granted protection under the Endangered Species Act in 2023 due to a significant population decline, the administration argues that federal officials made an error in listing the bird. This move is seen as prioritizing oil and gas drilling over environmental safeguards, as prairie-chicken habitats overlap with these industries. If successful, it could signal that no endangered species is safe, especially those in fossil fuel-rich areas.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is considering participating in a television show that would have immigrants go through a series of challenges to get American citizenship. The challenges would be based on various American traditions and customs. The agency said it was happy to review “out-of-the-box pitches,” particularly those that celebrate “what it means to be an American.” The show would end with someone being sworn in as a U.S. citizen, and the pitch has not yet reached the level of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.</p>
