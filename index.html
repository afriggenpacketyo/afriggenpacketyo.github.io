          <p>The UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, reports that Iran has significantly increased its production of highly enriched uranium, now possessing over 400kg enriched to 60% purity, which is close to weapons grade. This is a near 50% increase in three months, raising concerns as Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed state producing uranium at this level. The IAEA cannot confirm whether Iran's program remains peaceful, and Director General Rafael Grossi expressed serious concern. Israel has accused Iran of being determined to acquire nuclear weapons, while Iran maintains its nuclear weapons are unacceptable. The report details troubling findings about Iran's past undeclared nuclear activities. The Optimism score reflects the overall sentiment of the report.</p>
