            <p>Global bond yields reversed course after a volatile week driven by President Trump's tariff policy, which initially caused investor queasiness. Trump acknowledged the bond market's influence, leading to a temporary tariff pause. Economists attribute the bond market reversal to a reassessment of monetary policy and profit-taking by leveraged investors. While sentiment has shifted, uncertainty remains regarding trade deals and China's response, suggesting continued market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

The average MLB salary hasn't kept pace with the league's revenue growth, a trend that a salary cap could potentially address.</p>

            <p>Consumer price inflation eased more than expected in March to 2.4%, with core inflation at a four-year low of 2.8%. Slumping energy prices contributed to the tame inflation, while food prices climbed. Shelter prices increased modestly, marking the smallest gain since November 2021. These figures precede tariffs expected to impact the auto industry.</p>

            <p>Given the unpredictability of tariff developments, uncertainty looms over markets, requiring investors to exercise caution. Investors should diversify across regions and asset classes, maintaining a long-term focus rather than attempting to time the market. Maintaining a resilient financial plan, including an emergency fund, is crucial in navigating geopolitical unpredictability. US president Donald Trump's U-turn on many tariffs has driven the latest swing in stocks, serving as another reminder as to how quickly sentiment can switch in markets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% annually in March, indicating progress in the Federal Reserve's efforts to lower inflation. Easing inflation, combined with a pause in reciprocal tariffs, could alleviate concerns for the Federal Reserve. However, other tariffs recently enacted could still cause inflation to pick up later in the year. Economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady at its next meeting.</p>
