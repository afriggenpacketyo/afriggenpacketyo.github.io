          <p>Son Heung-min, the 33-year-old captain of Tottenham Hotspur, has announced he will leave the club this summer, concluding a decade-long tenure. The South Korean international, who recently led the team to its first trophy in 17 years by winning the Europa League, stated the decision was the most difficult of his career. Citing the need for a new environment to challenge himself, Son is reportedly considering a move to Major League Soccer. He is set to play his final game for the club in his home country of South Korea during a pre-season tour.</p>

          <p>Authorities in southwestern Montana are actively searching for a suspect who opened fire in a bar, killing four people in what is described as a "senseless act of violence." The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, fled the scene and is considered armed and dangerous. Law enforcement has located the suspect's vehicle but not the individual, prompting a concentrated search and a warning for local residents to remain on high alert. The motive for the shooting at The Owl Bar in Anaconda remains unknown as the investigation continues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has maintained a temporary restraining order preventing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from conducting "roving patrols" in much of Southern California. The ruling affirms a lower court's decision that such patrols, which involve stopping individuals without reasonable suspicion, likely violate the 4th Amendment. The court rejected the government's argument that the injunction would irreparably harm its enforcement efforts. This decision is seen as a significant victory for civil rights groups and local officials challenging the Trump administration's aggressive deportation tactics.</p>

          <p>Amidst a scorching summer, experts are advising travelers on how to handle holidays booked in European destinations affected by wildfires, such as Greece and Turkey. While the UK Foreign Office currently deems travel safe, the article outlines options for concerned tourists. Standard travel insurance typically covers cancellations or curtailments only if official advice changes to "do not travel." However, some policies offer additional coverage for natural disasters, and travelers are encouraged to communicate directly with airlines and hotels for potential bespoke solutions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kim Kardashian's brand, Skims, has released a new "face shapewear" mask, sparking debate online over its efficacy and impact on beauty standards. The product, which quickly sold out, is marketed to provide a "sculpted" jawline but has been criticized as promoting unrealistic ideals. Medical professionals state there is no scientific evidence for lasting effects, warning that such products could at best offer temporary de-puffing and at worst cause skin irritation. Critics argue the trend medicalizes normal features and negatively impacts the self-esteem of young consumers.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread user fatigue, dating app companies are innovating with new features designed to make online dating less of a chore. Some apps are cutting out pre-date messaging to encourage in-person meetings, while others are introducing group date functionalities to lower the pressure on individuals. This shift comes as major platforms like Tinder and Hinge have seen a decline in usage, and users report frustration with repetitive profiles and "ghosting." The article explores whether these new approaches can successfully rekindle interest in finding love through algorithms.</p>

          <p>China's General Administration of Customs has tightened import rules for durians from Vietnam after detecting harmful levels of cadmium and an organic compound. The new regulations mandate enhanced pre-export safety checks and require "batch by batch" testing upon arrival in China. Any shipments that fail to meet the standards will be returned or destroyed, and the corresponding exporters will face suspension. These stricter measures have already led to a significant 45% year-on-year decrease in the value of fresh durian shipments from Vietnam in the first half of 2025.</p>

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 crash that resulted in one death and serious injuries, ordering the company to pay $243 million in damages. The case involved a Tesla Model S on Autopilot that failed to stop and collided with two people standing by their parked vehicle. The plaintiffs' attorneys successfully argued that while the driver was distracted, the Autopilot system should have been disabled or issued alerts, as it was being used in an environment for which it was not designed. Tesla has stated it will appeal the verdict, maintaining the driver was solely responsible.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, stating the president has "real concerns" about the accuracy of federal economic data. Speaking after a jobs report showed a hiring slowdown, Greer suggested that large revisions to past jobs numbers have raised questions about their reliability. The firing has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who called the move groundless and a dangerous precedent that undermines the credibility of vital economic statistics. Greer maintained that the president has the authority to choose who serves in the executive branch. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Warn New U.S. Tariffs Will Create Protracted Uncertainty for Businesses</h2>

          <p>President Trump's executive order imposing widespread new tariffs on imports is expected to increase consumer prices and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. With a new baseline tariff of at least 15% on most countries, the average U.S. effective tariff rate has risen to its highest level in decades. Economists predict this will make a wide range of imported goods, from clothing and toys to cars and furniture, more expensive for American consumers. Businesses are struggling with the lack of clear implementation details, making it difficult to plan and manage supply chains effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, fell short in his bid to secure a spot on the U.S. Junior Ryder Cup team.

This finish was outside the automatic qualifying positions for the prestigious junior event.

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence, calling on its board to overrule Chairman Jerome Powell and cut interest rates. In a series of social media posts, Trump labeled Powell a "stubborn MORON" following the Fed's decision to hold rates steady and a disappointing jobs report. This breaks with the presidential tradition of respecting the central bank's autonomy to make objective policy decisions without political pressure. The president's public criticism of Powell, whom he appointed, comes amid growing concerns over the economic impact of his administration's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

This model is gaining attention as a potential national strategy, with a bipartisan bill in Washington aiming to invest federal funds to eliminate the disease.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he has ordered the deployment of two nuclear-capable submarines to "appropriate regions" in a direct response to what he termed "highly provocative statements" from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.

Trump's move, announced on his Truth Social platform, was described as a measure to protect American interests, though it has been viewed by some analysts as a significant rhetorical escalation.

          <p>A new form of psychological trauma, dubbed "droneophobia," is affecting Ukrainian soldiers returning from the war. The condition is characterized by acute stress and panic triggered by everyday mechanical sounds, such as lawnmowers or motorcycles, that resemble the high-pitched whine of enemy FPV drones. Psychiatrists at Kyiv's military hospital report a surge in mental health injuries directly linked to the constant threat of being hunted by these ubiquitous weapons. This sound-based trauma highlights the evolving nature of warfare and its lasting psychological impact on soldiers long after they have left the battlefield.</p>

However, some Palestinians on the ground in the West Bank feel it is "too late," expressing doubt that recognition will change the reality of Israeli settlement expansion and occupation. Israeli officials, meanwhile, have condemned the plan, viewing it as a reward for terrorism and an illegitimate imposition on their sovereignty.</p>
