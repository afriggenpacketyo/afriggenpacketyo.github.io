          <p>R&B singer R. Kelly was reportedly hospitalized due to an alleged overdose caused by prison officials, according to his lawyers. However, sources indicate that Kelly was taken to the hospital for routine medical care and has since returned to the North Carolina prison where he is serving a 30-year sentence for racketeering and sexual assault convictions. Kelly's attorney, Beau B. Brindley, alleges mismanagement by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and claims Kelly was denied surgery. The Bureau of Prisons has declined to comment on the matter, citing privacy and security concerns, but Kelly's legal troubles continue with additional convictions in Chicago. </p>

James emphasized that winning a ring is a team accomplishment and that individual achievements should be appreciated more.

The incident occurred during a discussion about a newly signed UK-US trade deal, which Starmer highlighted as a significant relief for Jaguar Land Rover workers due to tariff removals.

          <p>China's restrictions on antimony exports, implemented late last year, are causing significant challenges for lead-acid battery manufacturers. The restrictions, including a ban on shipments to the U.S., have led to a surge in antimony prices, now exceeding $60,000 per metric ton. U.S. companies are heavily reliant on China for antimony supply, and buyers are increasingly turning to a "grey market" with inflated prices. Steve Christensen of the Responsible Battery Coalition described the situation as a national emergency, highlighting antimony's critical role in various industries and military equipment. </p>

Health officials attribute the increase to declining vaccination rates, with only 93% of kindergarteners vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year. HHS Secretary Robert F.

Utilities are building new infrastructure and raising rates to meet this demand, with some considering special rates for high-energy users like data centers.

          <p>Trump Mobile's new T1 phone, marketed as "Made in America," is facing skepticism from analysts who believe it will likely be manufactured in China. The $499 Android handset can be preordered with a down payment, but experts warn that true U.S. manufacturing is unlikely. Some suggest that even if assembly occurs in the U.S., core software and hardware will still be sourced from abroad. Critics view the phone as a licensing play aimed at conservative buyers rather than a genuine effort to reshore manufacturing. </p>

          <p>President Trump is considering joining Israel in strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, with one potential target being the Fordo site, according to multiple sources. Fordo is a subterranean uranium enrichment facility considered key to Iran's nuclear program. The issue was discussed in a meeting with Trump's national security team. Trump has publicly warned Iran against any action against U.S. troops, but hasn't ruled out American participation in the conflict. </p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment, introduced by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a majority of 242 votes, preventing women who terminate their pregnancies outside legal guidelines from facing police investigation. The law will still penalize those who assist a woman in getting an abortion outside the current legal framework. The new clause does not change any law regarding the provision of abortion services within a healthcare setting, including the time limit or the requirement for two doctors' approval. </p>

          <p>President Trump's declaration that "We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran" has raised questions about the extent of U.S. involvement in the conflict. The statement contradicts earlier U.S. assertions that Israel's offensive against Iran was being carried out without U.S. participation. The White House has been asked to clarify the president's comments. Trump also made menacing statements about Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. </p>
