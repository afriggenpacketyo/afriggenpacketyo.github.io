The annual physical, conducted at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, included diagnostic and laboratory testing, along with consultations with fourteen specialty consultants. The release included Trump's vital statistics, such as height, weight, heart rate, and blood pressure, all of which were within normal ranges for his age and physical condition.

Residents reported hearing and feeling the explosion, which collapsed the house, around 11:25 am CDT.

            <p>Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown accused Donald Trump of "weaponizing" the global trading system with steep import tariffs, which he believes threatens a breakdown in the global economic order. Brown urged governments and central banks to create a "global rescue plan" similar to the 2008 financial crisis response, including synchronized interest rate cuts. He warned that without action, a recession could escalate into a depression reminiscent of the 1930s, emphasizing the need for international cooperation to rebuild the world order.

            <p>President Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested Sunday that the reciprocal tariff exemptions for some electronics may be short-lived, and said separate tariffs for these products are "coming soon." Lutnick's comments throw cold water on hopes that popular tech products made in China, such as computers, laptops, smartphones, and flat-panel TVs, would be spared from Trump's 145% reciprocal tariffs — duties that raise prices for U.S. importers and are generally passed on to consumers. China has responded by saying the US needs to “completely cancel” his so-called reciprocal tariffs, as a trade war between the world's two biggest economies grinds on.</p>

            <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is attempting to distance herself from a recent Oval Office appearance with President Donald Trump, where she was photographed covering her face with binders. Whitmer, considered a potential 2028 White House contender, visited Trump to discuss various issues, but was unexpectedly brought into a press conference where Trump signed executive orders. A spokesperson for Whitmer stated that she was caught off guard and that her presence did not endorse the actions taken or statements made at the event.</p>

            <p>Saturday Night Live addressed the nation's anxieties over President Trump's sweeping global tariffs through multiple sketches. One standout was "Check to Check Business News," where anchors Ego Nwodim and Jon Hamm explained the trade battle's impact on everyday grocery items. The sketch resonated by grounding the economic alarm in relatable terms, highlighting how tariffs are affecting the cost of staples like mac and cheese and candy bars. The show also parodied HBO's 'The White Lotus', using it as a vehicle to satirize the Trump administration's response to economic turmoil.</p>

            <p>Chinese officials are urging the US to completely remove the "reciprocal tariffs" implemented by President Trump, as the trade war between the two countries continues. This follows Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on global tariffs while increasing levies on Chinese imports. While the Trump administration offered a concession by exempting some technological products, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested these exemptions would be temporary. China's commerce ministry has described the exemptions as a "small step" and is evaluating the impact of the move.</p>
