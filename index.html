          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has declared that universities must act to protect Jewish students, citing an "unacceptable increase in antisemitism" that has left many feeling unsafe on campus. The government is funding training programs, delivered by the Union of Jewish Students, to help staff identify and combat harassment and hate. These measures come in response to a report showing a significant rise in antisemitic incidents and ongoing protests related to the conflict in Gaza, which have heightened concerns for the Jewish community.</p>

The prolonged uncertainty is causing significant financial hardship and emotional distress for hundreds of thousands of workers who are unsure about their next paycheck or the future of their jobs.</p>

          <p>This article highlights the significant difference between the national average savings interest rate of 0.40% and the rates offered by top high-yield savings accounts, some of which exceed 4% APY. It provides examples of how much more interest can be earned with these accounts compared to traditional ones, emphasizing the importance of shopping around for better rates. The piece notes that while overall interest rates have been falling, competitive options remain available for savers looking to maximize their returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have utilized an advanced AI protein language model to study convergent evolution, where unrelated species independently develop similar traits. The AI helps analyze complex 3D protein structures, revealing deeper sequence-based connections that traditional methods often miss. This innovative approach provides new insights into how different species, such as bats and dolphins with echolocation, independently arrive at similar biological functions through different evolutionary paths, deepening our understanding of genetics.</p>

          <p>IMF head Kristalina Georgieva has urged global economic leaders to "buckle up," citing rising uncertainty as the new normal for the world economy. Her warning was quickly underscored by President Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, which caused immediate market jitters. The article suggests the global economy's apparent resilience is being flattered by a massive AI investment boom, which could itself be a speculative bubble, adding another layer of significant risk to a landscape already menaced by geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>An agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein to formalize unpaid leave for Muslim employees and students on two major Islamic holidays has triggered a national debate. While officials clarify that the rule simply extends an existing practice available to other religious groups and does not create "extra holidays," the move highlights Germany's ongoing conversation about integration and religious freedom. The country has a complex system of public holidays, with many tied to Christian traditions and varying by state.</p>

          <p>The Philippines has accused a Chinese Coast Guard ship of intentionally ramming one of its government vessels near Thitu Island in the disputed South China Sea. Manila stated that Chinese maritime forces also used water cannons in an act of intimidation against ships that were supporting local fishermen. Beijing has blamed the Philippines for the collision, claiming the Filipino vessels "illegally entered" its waters, marking another dangerous escalation in the ongoing territorial disputes in the strategically vital waterway.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered the mechanism that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a whole new plant. Their research, published in the journal Cell, identifies two key genetic switches that can revert a differentiated somatic cell back to an embryonic state. This breakthrough in understanding somatic embryogenesis could have significant implications for agriculture, plant breeding, and biotechnology by providing new, more efficient ways to propagate valuable plants.</p>
