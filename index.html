          <p>A former Disney World employee, Michael Scheuer, was sentenced to three years in prison for hacking into the park's menu system. Scheuer, who had been a menu production manager, altered allergy information, added profanities, and changed pricing after a contentious termination. While none of the changes made it to printed or digital versions, the damages exceeded $150,000. Scheuer initially denied involvement but later pleaded guilty and must forfeit his computers and pay restitution to Disney.</p>

          <p>Brian Fanion, a Massachusetts detective, is under scrutiny after his wife's death was initially reported as a suicide. Investigators discovered deleted text messages between Fanion and another woman, as well as peculiar web searches on his work computer. These searches included inquiries about household poisons, overdose medications, and gunshot residue testing. The prosecution argues that these searches, combined with the absence of gunshot residue on Amy's head, suggest that Fanion planned and committed the murder.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the shooting death of Amy Fanion in Westfield, Massachusetts, revealed an affair between her husband, Brian Fanion, a local detective, and another woman, Cori Knowles. Brian initially claimed his wife shot herself, but inconsistencies in his story and the discovery of suggestive text messages with Cori raised suspicions. The investigation also uncovered that Amy's body was not found with gun shot residue which was inconsistent with Brian's claim. Brian was eventually charged with Amy's murder.</p>
