          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly relying on officials to fill multiple roles simultaneously, a practice known as dual-hatting, due to difficulties in finding or confirming individuals for specific positions. Marco Rubio, for example, serves as secretary of state, acting administrator of USAID, acting archivist of the United States, and acting national security adviser. This approach, while intended to streamline operations, raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, neglect of duties, and the weakening of crucial institutions like the National Archives, which lacks a full-time leader at a critical time for record-keeping. The article suggests this trend reflects broader challenges in staffing the administration and could lead to dysfunction and incompetence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to lower tariffs on Chinese goods offered a temporary respite to businesses, but long-term uncertainty persists. The remaining 30% tariff continues to burden small companies, forcing them to consider layoffs, delay new product launches, or negotiate cost-sharing with vendors. Unlike large retailers, small businesses have limited leverage and are more vulnerable to tariff-related cost increases. The article highlights the strategies of several business owners who are grappling with the impact of tariffs on their bottom lines and future plans.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's efforts to end birthright citizenship, focusing on the authority of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against presidential orders. Justices across the ideological spectrum questioned the scope of lower courts' power and the merits of the birthright citizenship order itself, with the US solicitor general arguing that lower courts overstepped their authority. The New Jersey solicitor general countered that siding with Trump would create a chaotic, patchwork system of citizenship, and protestors gathered outside the court to voice opposition to Trump's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park's High Sierra Camps, which have been closed since 2018, will remain closed this summer due to the unavailability of potable water and functioning toilets. The decision, made in collaboration with the National Park Service, impacts thousands of visitors who stay at the five separate camp locations each year. Impacted guests are being contacted and offered alternative accommodations within the park, and the lottery for the 2026 season will open in November. The Yosemite camps offer glamping amenities such as high-end meals and access to running water.</p>
