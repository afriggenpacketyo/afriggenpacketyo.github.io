          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of poisoning relatives with a mushroom meal, testified that she unintentionally served the toxic meal and then panicked. Prosecutors argue she intentionally used death cap mushrooms, cooked them for her relatives, and lied to police while disposing of evidence. Patterson has pleaded not guilty to three counts of murder and one of attempted murder related to a beef wellington lunch in July 2023. She explained her strained relationship with the Patterson family and communication issues with her estranged husband, Simon, including a difficult birth experience. Patterson will continue her testimony, with the defense aiming to show her actions were unintentional and driven by panic.</p>

          <p>A suspect identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman is in custody following an attack at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, where eight people were injured. Witnesses reported that the suspect used a "makeshift flamethrower" and Molotov cocktails during a march in support of Israeli hostages. Soliman, an Egyptian national, allegedly shouted "free Palestine" during the attack, leading the FBI to investigate it as a targeted act of violence and potential terrorism. The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, included a Holocaust refugee and a university professor, prompting condemnation from Colorado's Governor and Israeli Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>China has rejected accusations from President Trump that it violated the trade truce between the two countries. In response to Trump's claims, China stated that the United States was the party imposing "discriminatory restrictive measures." This denial comes after a period of relative calm in trade relations following a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, where a temporary suspension of tariffs was agreed upon. The dispute signals renewed tensions between the two economic powers, potentially impacting global trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by President Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential runoff election against liberal Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland is expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under Nawrocki's leadership. While most day-to-day power rests with the prime minister, the president influences foreign policy and can veto legislation. Nawrocki's victory complicates Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to reverse laws that politicized the court system, potentially impacting Tusk's ability to fulfill electoral promises.</p>

          <p>Multiple people were injured in a fire attack in Colorado after a suspect shouted "free Palestine" and threw Molotov cocktails at a gathering supporting Israeli hostages. Eight people, aged 52 to 88, were injured at the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder. The FBI has called it a suspected terror attack, and the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices. The attack occurred during a weekly demonstration by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israeli group.</p>

          <p>A Harvard Chinese graduate's speech calling for unity in a divided world has drawn mixed reactions in the US and China.
