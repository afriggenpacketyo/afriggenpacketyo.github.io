          <h2>Developed Nations Seek Tungsten Supply Diversification Amid China's Export Restrictions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Producers in developed nations, particularly in the defense sector, are increasingly seeking to diversify their tungsten supply sources after China imposed export restrictions on critical industrial metals. The restrictions, part of Beijing's retaliation against U.S. tariffs, have caused panic within the industry, which has relied on China for raw materials for three decades. The U.S. defense contractors face a deadline to cease using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027. Tungsten, essential for cutting tools, machinery, ammunition, and clean energy applications, has not been commercially mined in the U.S. for a decade, highlighting the urgent need for alternative supply chains.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, sparking outrage from congressional Democrats. Hayden, whose term was set to expire next year, faced criticism from a conservative group accusing her of promoting "radical" content in children's books and literary material authored by Trump opponents. Democrats condemned the firing as an assault on the American way of life, particularly the Library of Congress's role as the People's Library. Trump's decision was communicated via email from the White House‚Äôs Presidential Personnel Office, marking an unexpected end to Hayden's tenure.</p>

          <p>A town hall held by New York Attorney General Letitia James was briefly disrupted by a Trump supporter who challenged her to apologize to the former president for what he deemed a "witch trial." The incident occurred as James faces a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice, stemming from accusations of misrepresenting her primary residence to obtain favorable loan terms. This probe follows James's lawsuit against Trump and his family, alleging financial fraud, which Trump has decried as a politically motivated "witch hunt." The article notes that some believe the DOJ investigation is retaliatory, triggered by James's years-long pursuit of Trump in court.</p>

          <p>China's latest stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have failed to boost its stock market significantly due to persistent worries about economic deterioration and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. Investors remain concerned that the trade war is negatively impacting China's economy, outweighing the optimism typically associated with stimulus packages. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this round is more targeted at industrial and social needs rather than directly supporting the stock market. Analysts suggest that more targeted fiscal measures are needed to boost consumer sentiment and stabilize the real estate sector for a meaningful market rally.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaners, white descendants of Dutch colonizers in South Africa, who are scheduled to arrive in the U.S. This move follows an executive order signed by President Trump prioritizing humanitarian relief for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination. The decision has sparked controversy, with some criticizing the prioritization of a privileged group while vulnerable individuals from other regions are denied asylum. The South African government has refuted claims of discrimination against Afrikaners, adding to the complexity of the situation. The refugees will be resettled in various states across the country and will be eligible for U.S. citizenship and government benefits.</p>

          <p>A woman used an A.I.-generated likeness of her deceased brother, Christopher Pelkey, during the sentencing of Gabriel Horcasitas, who was convicted of manslaughter in Pelkey's death. The video, which included a disclaimer about its A.I. origin, presented a message of forgiveness from the victim, which the judge praised. This unprecedented use of A.I. in a legal proceeding has sparked debate, with critics raising concerns about manipulation and deception, while others argue it's a tool to tell the victim's story. Legal experts note that Arizona provides broader latitude for victim statements, though the defense lawyer suggested that the court‚Äôs reliance on the A.I. video could be grounds for appeal.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host and former New York prosecutor Jeanine Pirro as interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C. Pirro, a longtime ally of Trump, replaces Ed Martin, who was removed after facing opposition from Republican Senator Thom Tillis. Trump praised Pirro's legal background and her role on Fox News. Martin will now serve as director of the "weaponization working group," focusing on officials who investigated Trump. This move raises legal questions about bypassing Senate confirmation for U.S. attorney appointments, potentially allowing the president to appoint interim attorneys indefinitely.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to immediately remove transgender troops from the military, following a Supreme Court decision allowing the ban to be enforced.

This proposal was discussed at a second world war history seminar in Beijing, where academics emphasized the need to recognize China's frontline efforts against fascism.

          <p>Josh Raffaelli, a former fund manager at Brookfield Asset Management, has filed a lawsuit accusing the company of fraud and attempted bribery. Raffaelli claims Brookfield mistreated investors and improperly limited investments in a Musk company. The lawsuit alleges that Brookfield backtracked on pledges and vetoed a foreign conglomerate's investment to prop up another company, Pinegrove Capital Partners. Raffaelli, who had close ties to Elon Musk, says Brookfield offered him a bribe to support the Pinegrove merger. Brookfield denies the claims, calling the suit without merit.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax hike on rich Americans in the fiscal package, proposing a new top income bracket for people making over $2.5 million per year, taxed at 39.6 percent. This would partially reverse the 2017 tax cuts, which reduced the top rate to 37 percent. The move is intended to offset the cost of continuing the 2017 tax cuts and protect Medicaid from spending cuts. Republicans are also considering raising taxes on stock buybacks and limiting executive compensation deductions.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly ready to eliminate tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a major shift in its protectionist stance. President Trump has referred to India as the "tariff king," but recent reports indicate that India is nearing a trade deal with the U.S. A trade deal could boost India's economic growth, but there are concerns about its impact on domestic manufacturing. Experts suggest that even with zero tariffs on certain sectors, India will be careful not to harm domestic businesses.</p>

The Kooks' debut album sold 1.5 million copies in 2006, while Hard-Fi's Stars of CCTV was nominated for the Mercury Prize.
