          <p>The U.S. Senate conducted an all-night session, setting a new record for the longest series of consecutive votes, known as a "vote-a-rama," on President Trump's major legislative package. Lawmakers debated and voted on dozens of amendments, a process used by Democrats to force Republicans to take public stances on controversial elements of the bill, such as cuts to Medicaid and clean energy credits. With a very narrow Republican majority, party leadership worked intensely to maintain unity and secure enough votes for the bill's passage, highlighting the deep partisan divisions and complex political maneuvering involved.</p>

          <p>According to nutrition experts, a common breakfast mistake of choosing carbohydrate-heavy foods over protein can lead to midday energy crashes and cravings for sugary snacks. Dietitians explain that protein digests more slowly than simple carbs, promoting longer-lasting fullness and helping to stabilize blood sugar levels throughout the day. They recommend consuming 20 to 30 grams of protein in the morning, suggesting simple additions like beans, hemp seeds, or Greek yogurt to common breakfast foods, and cautioning against processed, high-sugar options often marketed as healthy.</p>

          <p>The classic childhood pastime of bicycling has seen a significant decline in recent decades, with the number of children aged 7 to 17 who ride regularly falling by nearly half since the 1990s. This article explores the reasons behind the trend, pointing to parental fears about traffic safety as a primary cause. The increase in larger vehicles like SUVs, busier roads, and higher speed limits has made streets more dangerous for cyclists. This decline means children are missing out on an activity that fosters independence, physical health, and spatial awareness.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of the 2022 fatal stabbings of four University of Idaho students, is reportedly expected to plead guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty. According to media reports citing a letter sent to the victims' families, the agreement would result in a sentence of life in prison without parole. The development brings a potential conclusion to a case that shocked the nation, though it has elicited mixed reactions from the victims' families, with some expressing frustration while others see it as a path to avoid decades of appeals.</p>

          <p>New York City's Pride celebrations ended in violence when two teenage girls, aged 16 and 17, were shot near the historic Stonewall Inn. Police report that during a fight between two groups, the 16-year-old fired a gun, missed her intended target, and hit the 17-year-old bystander in the leg. An associate of the original target then allegedly shot the 16-year-old in the head, leaving her in critical condition.

          <p>Foreign policy analysts are concerned that escalating conflict in the Middle East, particularly between Iran and Israel, could further destabilize volatile regions in Africa. The Horn of Africa is seen as particularly vulnerable due to existing alliances, such as Iran's support for Houthi rebels in Yemen who in turn cooperate with Somalia's Al-Shabab militia. Experts note that both Iran and Israel have strategic interests and relationships in the Horn of Africa and Sudan, raising fears that a wider conflict could expand existing proxy wars and draw international resources away from the continent.</p>

Analysts suggest this trend is driven by the perception of jewelry as a more stable investment, especially with rising gold prices, and its higher sentimental value for consumers.
