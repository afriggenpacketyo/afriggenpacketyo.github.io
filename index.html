          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:30:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, announced a significant policy shift, stating that agents will arrest any person they find in the country illegally, regardless of their criminal history. While the agency will still prioritize dangerous criminals, this change ends the previous administration's ban on so-called "collateral" arrests. Lyons also emphasized a renewed crackdown on companies that hire unauthorized workers, framing it as an effort to stop the exploitation of laborers. This new, broader mandate is part of the second Trump administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Former Obama Speechwriter Advocates for 'Neutral Ground' to Bridge Political Divides</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a commentary adapted from his new book, former Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that overcoming political division requires finding "neutral ground" rather than common ground. He uses his personal experience of learning to surf with his politically different brother-in-law to illustrate his point. Litt argues that shared activities, which focus on something other than political differences, can foster friendships and create space for genuine discussion. This approach allows people to connect on a human level, even when they disagree on major issues.</p>

          <p>During the closing night curtain call for the opera 'Il trovatore' at London's Royal Opera House, a cast member staged an unauthorized protest by unfurling a large Palestinian flag. An official attempted to take the flag, leading to a brief scuffle, but the performer held on. The Royal Ballet and Opera condemned the action as "completely inappropriate" and a violation of its political impartiality. The protest, which occurred amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, drew a mixed reaction of cheers and boos from the audience.</p>

          <p>Exit polls from Japan's recent upper house election project that the ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party, is poised to lose its majority. This potential defeat follows the coalition's loss of the more powerful lower house, signaling significant public frustration over rising prices and trade negotiations with the U.S. Losing control of the upper house would severely undermine Ishiba's ability to govern and could increase pressure on him to resign less than a year into his term, potentially destabilizing Japanese politics.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia prompted the temporary closure of Moscow's four major airports, leading to the cancellation or redirection of over 270 flights. Russia's defense ministry claimed to have downed more than 230 drones across multiple regions, including the capital. This disruption marks a significant escalation in Ukraine's use of drones to strike deep within Russian territory. Meanwhile, Russian air strikes in Ukraine resulted in at least three fatalities, as both sides continue their long-running conflict.</p>

          <p>A heated verbal altercation occurred between New York Yankees star Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Atlanta Braves third base coach Eddie Perez during a game on Saturday night. The confrontation, captured by television cameras, appeared to stem from Perez's belief that Chisholm was stealing signs and relaying them to a teammate at bat. Both individuals exchanged words from across the field, with Yankees manager Aaron Boone stating the incident should be reviewed. The Yankees went on to win the game 12-9 after a dramatic late-inning comeback.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection, which is the ability to tune into their own emotions and needs. The article argues that when parents dismiss a child's feelings by saying things like "you're okay," it can erode the child's self-trust. Instead, validating their emotions, welcoming their full selves, and allowing them autonomy helps build emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. This fosters better mental health and a stronger sense of self-worth into adulthood.</p>

This article highlights the work of author Olga Khazan and professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala, whose studies show that individuals can alter ingrained traits like neuroticism or introversion by consistently practicing behaviors associated with the desired personality. By forcing oneself out of comfort zones, such as an anxious person taking an improv class, it is possible to create lasting changes in one's characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving.</p>

A key factor in the declining support is the view, held by a majority of Americans and Hispanic Americans, that Hispanic people are being unfairly targeted, which has also led to a drop in the president's approval among Hispanic voters.

          <p>Despite exit polls indicating his ruling coalition has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced his intention to remain in his post. Breaking with the precedent of resigning after such a defeat, Ishiba cited the critical importance of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States as his reason for staying on. This decision comes amid rising public discontent and sets the stage for a period of significant political instability in Japan.</p>

          <p>A team of archaeologists believes they have identified the wreck of the 'Nossa Senhora do Cabo,' a Portuguese warship captured in 1721 by the notorious French pirate Olivier Levasseur, also known as 'La Buse.' The ship, found off the coast of Madagascar, was laden with a vast treasure of gold, silver, and diamonds that would be worth an estimated $138 million today. This discovery could be a major breakthrough in the 300-year-old search for the pirate's legendary and still-missing treasure.</p>

The author contends that by dramatically increasing tariffs and demanding mandatory purchases, Washington is no longer fostering mutually beneficial trade.

          <p>According to a new report from the Lowy Institute, China's influence in Southeast Asia is set to increase significantly as it solidifies its role as the region's largest infrastructure financier. This shift is occurring as traditional partners, namely the United States and the European Union, are making substantial cuts to their foreign aid budgets.

By declaring a national energy emergency, the administration is justifying policies that gut green energy tax credits and slash funding for climate research at agencies like NOAA and the EPA.
