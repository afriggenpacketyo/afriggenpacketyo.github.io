          <p>The European Commission has proposed doubling tariffs to 50% on steel imports that exceed a newly reduced quota, a move aimed at protecting the struggling European steel industry from global overproduction. This policy mirrors tariffs imposed by the US, leading to speculation that the EU is using the measure as leverage to negotiate better trade terms with the Trump administration. The decision has drawn criticism from China as protectionist and raised concerns in the UK and India, whose steel industries rely heavily on EU exports.</p>

          <p>The White House has strongly condemned a statement from Senator Chuck Schumer, who reportedly said that each day of the government shutdown "gets better" for Democrats. White House officials labeled the comment "disgusting," accusing Democrats of inflicting pain on Americans for political gain, particularly over healthcare funding disputes. This exchange intensifies the political blame game as the shutdown continues, affecting federal workers, military families, and government services while funding negotiations remain at a standstill.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump will visit Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a "routine yearly checkup," his second such examination in just six months. The visit comes ahead of a potential trip to the Middle East following a recently announced Israel-Hamas peace deal. This unscheduled physical has raised questions, though his physician maintains he is in "excellent" overall health despite recent observations of swollen ankles, which were attributed to chronic venous insufficiency.</p>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has granted a stay of execution for Robert Roberson, who was scheduled to die for the 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines the concept of "collective illusions," where individuals privately disagree with a perceived majority opinion but remain silent out of fear of social rejection. Drawing on research from the think tank Populace, it highlights how this phenomenon leads to widespread self-censorship on sensitive topics, creating a gap between public discourse and private belief. The author references philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay "Self-Reliance" as a guide for breaking free from this conformity by embracing honesty and intellectual independence.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis suggests the new Israel-Hamas deal represents the first realistic opportunity to end the two-year war, though it is far from a final resolution. The agreement, heavily influenced by U.S. pressure following a controversial Israeli strike in Doha, sets a framework for hostage release and an IDF pullback but leaves key issues unresolved. Significant obstacles remain, including Hamas's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal and Israel's insistence on the complete demilitarization of Gaza, making the path to a lasting peace uncertain.</p>
