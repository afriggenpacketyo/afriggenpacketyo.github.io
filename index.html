          <p>This article explores Elon Musk's legacy, arguing that he is a visionary figure akin to Cecil Rhodes, who is capable of bending reality to his will. Despite recent criticisms and political setbacks, Musk's space program, SpaceX, has achieved remarkable success. The author highlights Musk's long-term goal of interstellar colonization to save humanity from eventual solar incineration. The piece suggests that Musk's current endeavors in Washington will be seen as minor footnotes if he succeeds in his broader vision of space exploration and ensuring the survival of humanity, which is a key aspect of his overall plan. The article posits that Musk's impact extends beyond mere business or political influence. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk has launched another attack on a megabill supporting President Donald Trump's agenda, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" on X. He claims the bill will drastically increase the budget deficit to $2.5 trillion and burden American citizens with unsustainable debt. The legislation extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increases spending on military and border security while cutting Medicaid, SNAP, and other assistance programs. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed Musk's criticism, stating that the president is aware of Musk's stance but remains committed to the bill.

          <p>Five police officers were killed in an ambush by an armed group in Chiapas, Mexico, near the Guatemalan border. The attack occurred in Frontera Comalapa, prompting the deployment of over 1,000 officers to secure the area. The slain officers were identified, and images of their charred patrol vehicle were shared by the local Security Secretariat. A suspect was arrested near the crime scene, carrying an AK-47 rifle and military uniforms, but further details about other suspects were not immediately available. The region has been plagued by a turf war between the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation cartel, making it a major smuggling hub for drugs and migrants. </p>

          <p>With above-normal temperatures expected this summer, home electricity bills are projected to reach a 12-year high, impacting lower-income households the most. Experts recommend using fans instead of or in addition to air conditioners, setting ceiling fans to rotate counterclockwise, and changing AC filters monthly. Other tips include using indoor plants for shade, keeping curtains closed, limiting oven use, and unplugging small appliances when not in use. Utility companies and state governments offer programs to help residents lower their electricity bills, including rebates for efficient appliances and home energy assessments. The article provides practical advice for managing energy consumption and reducing costs during the summer months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is reportedly considering renaming several naval ships, including the USNS Harvey Milk, named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran. Documents show proposed timelines for the name change, aligning with the Trump administration's priority of "reestablishing the warrior culture." Other vessels on the "recommended list" for renaming include the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and USNS Harriet Tubman. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi criticized the decision as a "shameful, vindictive erasure" of those who fought for equality. The potential renaming reflects ongoing tensions between inclusivity and traditional military values within the armed forces.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering long-standing U.S. immigration policy. The proposal, driven by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, aims to suspend the issuance of new work permits until asylum claims are decided within an average of 180 days. Critics argue this timeframe is unrealistic given current backlogs, and the rule could push migrants into the underground economy. The changes reflect the administration's broader efforts to curtail asylum claims and deter migrants from using the system to work in the U.S.</p>

The bill includes changes to Medicaid and ACA enrollment, with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimating that it would leave nearly 9 million more people without health insurance by 2034.

          <p>A series of deadly incidents have occurred near an aid distribution site in Gaza, operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and backed by the US and Israel. Thirty-one Palestinians were reportedly killed by Israeli fire on Sunday, with additional fatalities reported on Monday and Tuesday. Israel denies targeting civilians and claims its troops fired warning shots or opened fire on "several suspects." The GHF's system is intended to bypass the UN, which Israel accuses of failing to prevent Hamas from diverting aid. The incidents have raised concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the new aid system.</p>

          <p>German customs reported a significant increase in the number of items cleared in 2024, primarily driven by e-commerce, with 90% of online deliveries originating from China. Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil noted the rise in cheap goods and counterfeit products entering Germany. Discussions are ongoing to potentially abolish the â‚¬150 tariff limit on goods, which would affect deliveries from websites like Temu. The customs office also seized a substantial amount of illegal items, including weapons and drugs, with marijuana seizures increasing following Germany's partial legalization of the drug in April 2024.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook expressed concerns that President Donald Trump's trade policies, particularly tariffs, could lead to higher inflation and potentially cool the labor market. She noted that while recent inflation readings have shown progress, the broad range of the tariffs could reverse this trend. Cook emphasized that price increases tied to trade policy changes might hinder further progress in the near term, and the recent experience with high inflation could make firms more willing to raise prices. Her comments come ahead of the Fed's next policy meeting, where interest rates are expected to remain on hold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has lowered its economic growth forecast for the UK, citing the impact of US tariff barriers and high interest payments on government debt. The OECD now expects UK growth to be 1.3% this year, down from its previous forecast of 1.4%.
