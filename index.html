          <p>The Trump Justice Department is reversing the Biden administration's oversight of local police departments, a move celebrated by GOP Congressman Abe Hamadeh. The DOJ is ending "pattern and practice" probes initiated under former AG Merrick Garland, arguing they were politically motivated and hindered law enforcement. This decision affects investigations in multiple jurisdictions, including Phoenix, Trenton, and Minneapolis. Hamadeh praised the move as fulfilling his promise to end the weaponization of the judicial system against police, while critics express concern over the potential impact on police accountability.</p>

However, the policy may also lead to issues such as income misclassification and a shift in compensation structures. Experts caution that tipping is a social behavior, making it difficult to predict the policy's long-term effects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA is expanding the warning labels on Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines regarding the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, primarily in males aged 16-25. The warning is based on findings from a study published last year and new agency data, citing a higher incidence rate in this age group. The CBS News article notes that the CDC has described these side effects as rare and that acute myocarditis tends to resolve quickly, but the FDA is taking precautionary measures to ensure awareness and inform individuals about potential risks.</p>

          <p>A Vox analysis argues that despite the extreme weirdness of national politics, the Republican party's budget priorities remain consistent: tax cuts for the wealthy, lower spending on programs for the poor, and increased defense spending. The article contends that the 'One Big, Beautiful Bill of 2025' exemplifies this pattern, redistributing income upward and maintaining the party's traditional economic agenda. While some Republicans may gesture at breaking with this orthodoxy, the analysis suggests that these deviations are minimal compared to the overall continuity of the party's budgetary views.</p>
