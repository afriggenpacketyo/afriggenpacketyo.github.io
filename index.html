          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:00:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a new, non-waivable $250 "visa integrity fee" for most nonimmigrant visitors to the U.S., effective from fiscal year 2025. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and has raised questions among travel industry groups about its implementation. While the provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if visitors comply with their visa terms, such as not overstaying, experts advise treating the fee as nonrefundable due to the expected difficulty in getting money back from the government. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it will generate nearly $29 billion in revenue over a decade.</p>

          <p>A U.S. envoy has announced that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, have agreed to a ceasefire. The agreement, also supported by Turkey and Jordan, follows recent Israeli airstrikes on Damascus, which Israel stated were to defend the Druze minority. The envoy called for all minority groups in Syria to lay down their arms and work towards building a new, united national identity. This development comes after Sharaa's forces recently overthrew the Assad regime, altering the region's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Following a directive from President Trump, the Department of Justice has formally petitioned a court to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. This move responds to intense public pressure for greater transparency after the administration initially stated no further files would be released. The filing emphasizes that the request is due to significant public interest and that victim-related information will be redacted before any release. The motion covers records from both the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases, aiming to provide more clarity on the federal investigations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion libel lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal's publisher, its parent company News Corp, and owner Rupert Murdoch. The suit alleges that a story published by the newspaper about a "bawdy" birthday letter allegedly sent from Trump to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003 is false and defamatory. Trump has publicly denied writing the letter, which the Journal claimed featured a drawing of a nude woman. The lawsuit faces a high legal bar, as public figures must prove "actual malice" to win defamation cases.</p>

The format struggles with its topical nature, which has a short shelf life, and the rise of online content creators who offer similar entertainment at a lower cost.

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between gut bacteria and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response characteristic of ulcerative colitis. The study, published in Science Immunology, found that a gene called OTUD3 normally acts as a brake on the immune system. However, in individuals with a common variant of this gene, the brake can fail, causing an overreaction to harmless gut bacteria and leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain the disease's unpredictability and could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies targeting this specific pathway.</p>

He emphasized that these stations are often the primary, and sometimes only, source of local news, emergency alerts, and educational content for their communities. Unlike larger urban stations that can rely more heavily on listener donations, rural affiliates are critically dependent on federal funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

          <p>The tech company Astronomer has launched a formal investigation after a video showing two people in a close embrace at a Coldplay concert went viral. The pair, rumored to be the company's CEO and Chief People Officer, were shown on the venue's large screen and quickly tried to hide their faces. The incident gained widespread attention after Coldplay's lead singer, Chris Martin, joked that they were either "having an affair, or they're just very shy." The company has stated its leaders are expected to set a high standard of conduct and will share more details soon.</p>

          <p>Albert Serra's new documentary, "Afternoons of Solitude," provides an immersive and unflinching look into the world of bullfighting, following star Peruvian matador Andrés Roca Rey. The film avoids explaining or contextualizing the controversial tradition, instead using long takes and a focused camera to capture its ornate rituals and gruesome violence. It presents the spectacle as an elemental contest between man and beast, highlighting both the palpable danger for the matador and the grim, inescapable fate of the bull. The review praises the film for its honest and spellbinding portrayal of a practice that is both inhumane and deeply human.</p>

          <p>Ten American citizens held in Venezuela have been freed and are returning to the U.S. as part of a three-way prisoner exchange. The deal involved El Salvador repatriating 252 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported from the U.S. and held in a high-security Salvadoran prison. In return, Venezuela released the Americans, including a former Navy SEAL, as well as dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners. U.S. officials credited Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele for his role in facilitating the complex, "down-to-the-wire" negotiations, which underscore his administration's close relationship with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Golfer Shane Lowry has expressed his disappointment after receiving a two-stroke penalty during the second round of The Open for a rules violation he claims he did not see. Officials determined that Lowry's ball moved in the rough at the 12th hole during a practice swing, which he caused. Lowry argued he was looking at the ball and did not see it move, but accepted the penalty to protect his reputation from accusations of cheating. The R&A, the sport's governing body, stated that video evidence showed discernible movement and that the penalty was correctly applied according to the rules of golf.</p>

          <p>NPR and PBS are facing a severe crisis after Congress approved a Trump administration proposal to rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Media leaders, including filmmaker Ken Burns, warn that the cuts will be devastating, particularly for smaller, rural stations that rely heavily on federal money for their operations. These stations provide essential local news, educational programming, and emergency alerts to their communities. The move fulfills a long-standing goal of conservatives who have criticized public media for a perceived left-leaning bias, but opponents argue it will harm millions of Americans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the Trump administration's internal struggle over how to handle the persistent controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case, a firestorm the president himself once stoked. Initially, Trump was frustrated by the issue and resisted calls for more transparency, feeling betrayed by MAGA supporters who wouldn't accept his declaration that there was nothing more to see. However, after a Wall Street Journal report on an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, the White House shifted tactics, with Trump ordering the Justice Department to seek the unsealing of grand jury records, effectively redirecting the narrative back towards a familiar fight with the media.</p>

          <p>Despite being an early pioneer in artificial intelligence research, Meta is now playing catch-up to competitors like OpenAI and Google in the generative AI race. To accelerate its efforts, the company has launched a new division, Meta Superintelligence Labs, and is aggressively recruiting top talent with massive compensation packages. This overhaul marks a significant shift from its previous strategy, which centered on open-sourcing its Llama AI model. The company's new goal is to build "personal superintelligence for everyone," though it remains to be seen if this new, costly approach will succeed in a highly competitive field.</p>

The five-year-old springer spaniel was in a police unit vehicle with his handler and another dog when it collided with a BMW while responding to an emergency. PD Bert, a highly-praised sniffer dog credited with locating large sums of cash, was so severely injured that he had to be euthanized.

He also defended the practice of ICE agents wearing masks during arrests, stating that while he is not a proponent, he will allow it for the safety of his officers amid an 800% increase in attacks. Lyons attributed the rise in violence partly to the administration's expanded immigration enforcement and the prevalence of sanctuary city policies that force agents into communities more frequently.</p>
