          <p>A South African court has denied an urgent request from Thabo Bester, a convicted murderer and perpetrator of sexual assault, to block the release of a Netflix documentary about his crimes. Bester, who gained infamy for faking his own death to escape from prison in 2022, was recaptured in Tanzania a year later. He and his partner argued the documentary would violate their rights to a fair trial, but the judge dismissed the application, stating the case is already firmly in the public domain and they can sue for defamation after it airs.</p>

During a House of Lords debate, May voiced strong opposition, warning it could pressure vulnerable people into ending their lives. Leadbeater countered that the terminally ill individuals she has met are not suicidal but are seeking choice in the face of inevitable death, emphasizing the legislation aims to create a robust and compassionate legal framework.</p>

Robinson was apprehended after his father recognized him in police photographs and facilitated his surrender. Investigators revealed that Robinson had become more political in recent years and had expressed disdain for Kirk's viewpoints, with messages found indicating he planned the attack and retrieved a rifle from a hiding spot. The rifle and engraved bullet casings with anti-fascist messages were recovered by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption protests that led to the resignation of the prime minister, Nepal has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as the head of an interim government. Karki, 73, becomes the first woman to lead the nation, tasked with organizing general elections within six months. The unrest, which saw over 50 people killed, was initially sparked by a social media ban but quickly escalated into a mass movement against the political establishment, culminating in protesters setting fire to parliament.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened further military action in Qatar if the nation does not expel Hamas leaders, following a recent Israeli strike in Doha. This stance directly contrasts with that of U.S. President Donald Trump, who stated he assured Qatari leaders such an attack "will not happen again on their soil." The incident has heightened regional tensions, with Qatar's prime minister stating the strike has "killed any hope" for the return of remaining hostages held by Hamas, further complicating ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer is purchasing additional shares of Boeing, taking advantage of a price dip caused by news of a certification delay for its 777X aircraft. The club's rationale is that such delays are not uncommon in the aerospace industry and represent a buying opportunity, as the issue is unlikely to affect the company's long-term cash flow or fundamentals. This move reflects a strategy of building a position in a new holding by buying into what is perceived as short-term market weakness. (not investment advice)</p>
