        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits saw a rise of 3% in April, marking a second consecutive month of growth despite tariffs imposed by the U.S. This cumulative profit increase follows a return to growth in the first quarter, reversing previous declines. While U.S. tariffs reached as high as 145% before a recent trade truce, China's manufacturing activity experienced a contraction. Exports to the U.S. significantly decreased due to these tariffs, but overall exports grew due to increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially impacting the high prices paid for teams. The legislation would affect future owners, limiting their ability to deduct the full value of intangible assets like player contracts and media rights over 15 years. While the White House claims the measure aims to ensure fairness for fans, some team owners view it as punitive, especially given President Trump's past conflicts with leagues like the NFL. The proposed tax change could raise nearly $1 billion over 10 years and might influence the timing of team sales. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite its impressive growth, IonQ faces challenges in scaling at the same pace as other AI subsectors, with a substantial cash burn compared to its revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Physicists are studying the sounds of rocket launches to understand the impact of noise on communities and to inform potential mitigation strategies. With the increasing frequency of rocket launches, particularly by SpaceX, researchers are investigating the complex ways sound waves travel and affect the environment. One area of focus is the unique three-part sonic boom generated by Falcon 9 boosters returning to Earth. The research aims to gather data that can help lessen disruptions caused by rocket noise before the problem becomes pervasive.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, surpassed by Germany, despite an increase in its net external assets. The Finance Ministry attributes this shift to the yen's depreciation, which boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, and Germany's large current account surplus. While Japan's gross external assets increased, they were still below Germany's total, with the United States holding a significant net external liability. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the union is urging members to vote for strike action, arguing that the pay rise is insufficient to compensate for previous below-inflation pay awards.

Only students under the age of 21 will qualify for funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree. While promising more training opportunities for young adults, the government is pulling funding from postgraduate apprenticeships, a move that has drawn criticism. The changes aim to shift more money towards entry-level apprenticeships, and will also involve an increase in a charge paid by employers recruiting from outside the UK to create 45,000 training places.</p>
