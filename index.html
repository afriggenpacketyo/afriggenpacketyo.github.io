          <h2>Auto Industry Groups Unite Against Trump's Proposed Parts Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 23:17:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leading U.S. automotive industry groups have joined forces to lobby the Trump administration against the implementation of 25% tariffs on auto parts, warning of potential damage to domestic production and the supply chain. In a letter to administration officials, the groups, representing major automakers and suppliers, emphasize that many suppliers are already facing financial difficulties and would struggle with additional costs. They argue that these tariffs could lead to production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies within the industry, which supports 10 million American jobs and contributes $1.2 trillion to the economy. The groups urge reconsideration of the tariffs, similar to relief provided for consumer electronics and semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists suggest that President Trump's recent comments indicating a softening stance on tariffs against China may not signify progress in trade talks but could instead provide Beijing with leverage for a better deal. Trump's remarks about tariffs "not being as high as 145 per cent" suggest anxiety from the U.S. side, according to analysts. They argue that China is not showing similar signs of impatience, potentially placing them in a stronger negotiating position. The lack of substantial progress in negotiations coupled with Trump's signaling could be interpreted as pressure on the U.S. to reach an agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year. The FDA intends to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and work with the food industry to eliminate six others commonly found in cereals, snacks, and more. The plan relies on an "understanding" with major food companies for voluntary removal, aiming to meet consumer demand. This initiative follows growing concerns about the health risks associated with synthetic dyes, including potential links to hyperactivity and other conditions, although scientists caution that the evidence is not fully conclusive.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its 2025 GDP growth projections for China, India, and Japan, citing trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Globally, the IMF also reduced its growth forecast, attributing the changes to tariffs announced by the U.S. and its trading partners. This forecast aligns with a broader trend of research firms and banks cutting growth forecasts for Asian economies, largely due to the escalating U.S.-China trade war. The IMF's report underscores the potential for trade conflicts to negatively impact economic activity and the overall outlook.</p>

          <p>Police chiefs in the UK will be granted new powers to automatically dismiss officers who fail background checks, aiming to boost public confidence in policing. This change follows calls for revised vetting procedures after a report on the Sarah Everard murder case. The new measures make passing background checks a legal requirement for all serving officers, addressing situations where officers who fail vetting can remain employed on full pay. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has emphasized the necessity of these reforms to ensure only officers of the highest standards wear the uniform, restoring public trust in law enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's energy-storage industry is facing difficulties due to the escalating US-China trade war and reduced government support, prompting caution against price competition. Higher tariffs are expected to impact exports to the US, potentially leading to reduced capital expenditure and slower expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS). The sector is also grappling with a price war resulting from overproduction. The challenges highlight the complex interplay between trade policies, market dynamics, and the growth of renewable energy technologies.</p>

The zoo stated that it is currently not feasible to replace the herd members who recently died, and elephants need to live in larger social groups. Animal welfare organizations have expressed mixed feelings about the relocation, advocating for the elephants to be moved to a sanctuary instead.</p>

This phenomenon is attributed to the region's strong cultural values and traditions, which are difficult to replicate nationwide.

After that, the Department of Health and Human Services said, it will work with industry to eliminate six petroleum-based food dyes: blue 1, blue 2, green 3, red 40, yellow 5 and yellow 6. The FDA is instead encouraging the use of so-called natural food dyes such as gardenia blue and calcium phosphate.</p>
