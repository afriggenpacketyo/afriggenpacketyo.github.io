          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports starting August 1, escalating trade tensions between the two nations. The stated justification for the new levy is to pressure Canada into doing more to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States. This move adds to existing tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and autos, with the administration warning of even higher duties if Canada retaliates. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated his government will continue to defend its workers and businesses while working toward a resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis examines the shared challenges facing UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. Both leaders are grappling with declining poll numbers and the rise of anti-establishment populist parties, namely Reform UK and National Rally. The article suggests they are trying to advocate for pragmatic, nuanced governance in an era where voters are impatient and drawn to simplistic solutions. Their recent collaboration on migration is framed as an attempt to demonstrate that their moderate approach can deliver results, countering the narrative of their populist rivals.</p>

          <p>A roundup of UK newspaper headlines reveals varied reactions to the new UK-France migration deal, with some outlets calling it a "joke" while others focus on the unclear timetable. Another major story covers a government pilot scheme aimed at reducing the number of people signed off work by having GPs refer patients to job coaches or gyms instead. The Financial Times reports that Chancellor Rachel Reeves is pausing controversial reforms to cash ISAs following industry backlash. Other topics include the BBC's handling of a presenter's dismissal and a gaffe made by President Trump regarding Liberia.</p>

          <p>A tense confrontation occurred in Ventura County, California, as federal agents executed a warrant at a licensed marijuana facility. Protesters gathered to support workers, leading to clashes where agents deployed tear gas and less-lethal rounds. Officials reported that ten undocumented minors were found at the facility, prompting an investigation into potential child labor violations. The incident has drawn sharp criticism from state officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who condemned the "militaristic raids" and their impact on farmworker communities.</p>

          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a celebrated IVF pioneer and Labour peer, has resigned from the British Medical Association (BMA) in protest of planned strikes by resident doctors. The five-day walkout is scheduled for late July over a pay dispute with the government. Lord Winston, a BMA member since 1964, argued that strike action is inappropriate when the country is struggling and that it erodes public trust in the medical profession. The BMA contends that the strikes are a last resort after the government refused to negotiate on pay, which they claim is 20% lower in real terms than in 2008.</p>

Researchers and officials noted that the anger and distrust fostered during the pandemic created a fertile ground for these new flashpoints, which are often fueled by misinformation on social media.

Officials state the goal is to streamline a "bloated bureaucracy" and focus on core diplomatic priorities, such as consolidating multiple sanctions offices into one.

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian protest leader, has filed a $20 million claim against the Trump administration for what he alleges was false arrest and malicious prosecution. Khalil was detained by ICE for over three months, with the government seeking his deportation on the grounds that his activism posed a risk to U.S. foreign policy. The claim, a precursor to a lawsuit, alleges his detention was retaliation for his constitutionally protected speech. The Department of Homeland Security has called the claim "absurd," stating Khalil terrorized Jewish students with hateful rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted 'Hillside Strangler' serial killers, has been denied parole after 46 years in prison. Bianchi and his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., terrorized Los Angeles in the 1970s, murdering 12 women whom they lured by impersonating police officers. The parole board determined that Bianchi, now 74, will not be eligible for another hearing for ten years. Bianchi pleaded guilty to multiple murders in California and Washington and is serving his sentences in a Washington state penitentiary. His partner, Buono, died in prison in 2002.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning NWA 16788, the largest known piece of the planet Mars on Earth, with an estimated value of up to $4 million. The meteorite, weighing over 54 pounds, was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023 after traveling 140 million miles through space, likely dislodged from Mars by an asteroid impact. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, accounting for only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on our planet. This specific piece represents approximately 6.5% of all known Martian material on Earth, offering a significant dataset for scientists studying the red planet.</p>

          <p>Despite high-level diplomatic meetings, ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have stalled, with an Israeli official suggesting a deal could still be weeks away. Meanwhile, intense conflict continues in Gaza, with recent Israeli strikes killing dozens of Palestinians. In a notable incident, a strike near a health clinic in Deir al-Balah killed 15 civilians, including ten children, who were waiting for nutritional aid. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a terrorist and that it is investigating the harm caused to uninvolved individuals, an event condemned by aid groups as a violation of humanitarian law.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science has made an unlikely paleontological discovery directly on its property: a dinosaur fossil found under its parking lot. The hockey-puck-shaped vertebra bone was found in a narrow core sample drilled over 750 feet deep during a study for geothermal heating potential. Curators described the find as incredibly rare, believing it to be from a small, plant-eating dinosaur that lived around 67.5 million years ago. While not scientifically groundbreaking, the fossil is now on display, marking the deepest and oldest dinosaur discovery in Denver's history.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House, coinciding with his company becoming the first to close a trading day with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. The meeting's agenda was not disclosed, but it comes as Nvidia grapples with U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, which have effectively cut off sales to the $50 billion Chinese market. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance, linking its 47% rise to his administration's tariff policies. The administration is also planning new restrictions on which countries can receive Nvidia's powerful technology. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil is stretching the limits of his emergency economic powers, which are already facing a legal challenge. The president cited Brazil's treatment of its former leader Jair Bolsonaro as a reason for the tariff, an unusual justification under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Critics argue this is an abuse of power, especially since the U.S. maintains a trade surplus with Brazil, contradicting the administration's claims of a deficit. The use of IEEPA for such tariffs is currently being contested in a federal appeals court. (not investment advice)</p>

The suit also alleges Ye created a hostile work environment with antisemitic slurs and stalked her after she filed her initial lawsuit, including by arranging a "swatting" event at her home.

          <p>The iconic red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris are turning once again, 14 months after they were knocked down by high winds. Hundreds of locals and tourists gathered in the Montmartre district to celebrate the restoration, an event marked by a can-can performance from 60 dancers and a fireworks display. The original sails collapsed in April 2024 due to a mechanical failure in the central axis. While new aluminum blades were installed last summer for the Olympics, delays with a new electric motor kept them motionless until now, restoring a beloved symbol of Parisian nightlife.</p>

The eight words that resonate most with voters are: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. According to the analysis in the new book "Eight Words That Changed The World," these words act as "emotional shortcuts" that work across different cultures and political ideologies.

He fears that technology is making society less intelligent and creative, leading to a "post-culture society" of "dumbed down machines." Welsh argues people are nostalgic for the 1990s because it was an era before the internet became a dominant, controlling force.</p>
