          <p>Mexico has initiated legal action against Google for altering the name of the 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America' on its maps platform, following a U.S. presidential order. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that the lawsuit was filed after previous warnings to Google were ignored. The Mexican government argues that the name change affects their continental shelf and contradicts international agreements, while Google defends its policy of reflecting local official names. The dispute arose after the U.S. president issued an executive order to rename the northern part of the gulf, leading to Google Maps displaying different names based on the user's location.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party in the UK is preparing to introduce new measures aimed at reducing net migration, which reached 728,000 last year. The proposed changes include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, potentially restricting visa applications from countries with high overstay rates, and extending the waiting period for migrants to apply for permanent residency, possibly up to 10 years. Tougher English language requirements for immigrants are also being considered, alongside stricter enforcement of rules for recruiting international care workers. The article also mentions a review of how the 'right to family life' under the European Convention on Human Rights is applied in immigration cases.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have released records detailing key moments in a corruption case involving New York City Mayor Eric Adams, including a warrant to search a person's phone for evidence of fraud related to his mayoral campaigns. The case was dropped after the Trump administration intervened, leading to accusations of a corrupt deal trading dismissal for help with immigration policies. The documents reveal the investigation focused on Adams's fundraising and connections to Turkey, with agents considering seizing his electronic devices. The mayor was also investigated for witness tampering, although he was never charged with that crime.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are meeting with Chinese officials, led by Vice Premier He Lifeng, in Geneva to address escalating trade tensions. The goal is to de-escalate the trade war, which has resulted in tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods and 125% on American goods, significantly disrupting trade. While prospects for a major breakthrough are uncertain, there is hope for a reduction in tariffs, which would provide relief to financial markets and businesses. The Trump administration has been using tariffs as an economic weapon, particularly against China, citing unfair trade practices and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te is facing criticism for his V-E Day speech, which commemorated the end of World War II in Europe. Critics argue that Lai's speech sidestepped Japan's wartime atrocities in China and minimized the role of the Republic of China (ROC) in the Allied victory. Lai's address focused on the importance of democratic countries uniting against modern authoritarian threats, drawing parallels to the challenges faced during World War II.</p>

          <p>The British steel industry experienced a wave of relief after President Trump agreed to lift the 25 percent tariffs on steel exported to the United States. This trade deal provides some respite for struggling businesses like Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield, which ships a significant portion of its steel to the U.S. However, uncertainties remain regarding the implications for products processed in the European Union and the overall impact of the Trump administration's trade policies. The move is expected to boost demand and provide some stability, but concerns persist about the long-term viability of the industry.</p>

The judge found that the administration likely exceeded its legal authority in attempting to reorganize and downsize the federal government without congressional approval.
