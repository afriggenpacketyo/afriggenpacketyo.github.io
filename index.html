          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, part of a pre-arranged plan to sell up to six million shares. This transaction follows a similar sale in June and comes as Nvidia's market capitalization surpassed $4 trillion, briefly making it the world's most valuable company. Huang's personal net worth has surged to around $143 billion, placing him in close competition with Warren Buffett for a top spot on global wealth indexes. The sale is a scheduled part of his financial planning, and he still retains a massive holding of over 858 million shares in the AI chipmaking giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six months after the destructive Palisades fire, small businesses along Malibu's Pacific Coast Highway are still struggling to recover financially. Despite being peak tourist season, many eateries, surf shops, and souvenir stores report that business is down significantly compared to previous years. The extended closure of the highway isolated the area, and even with its reopening, the return of customers has been slow. Business owners are grappling with lost revenue and the slow pace of rebuilding in the surrounding community, expressing cautious hope that normalcy might return by next summer as they navigate the difficult aftermath.</p>

Curated by a husband-and-wife team, the show features all-women artists whose works highlight how communities of color are disproportionately affected by a lack of trees and cooling shade. The installations, placed throughout the gardens and in galleries, prompt visitors to consider historical planning decisions and envision a greener future for Los Angeles.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests 'Superman' Film's 'Woke' Backlash Ignores Character's Core Themes</h2>

          <p>James Gunn's new "Superman" movie is facing criticism from some circles for being "superwoke," largely due to the director's comments acknowledging the character's immigrant origins. However, the article argues this backlash is overblown, pointing out that Superman has always been an immigrant story about an outsider assimilating and using his powers for good. The film itself reportedly emphasizes that Clark Kent's heroism stems from his all-American upbringing in Kansas, not just his alien heritage. The piece concludes that while the character's story is inherently political, it has rarely been radical, and the current controversy overlooks the long-established themes of the superhero.</p>

The revised national plan aims to reduce projected fatalities by 80% through infrastructure improvements like higher sea walls and refuge towers.

Wales built an early lead with tries from Kieran Hardy and Josh Adams, but had to withstand a strong second-half comeback from Japan before a late try sealed the much-needed victory. The result provides a significant morale boost for the team and its supporters, and it marks a positive conclusion for interim head coach Matt Sherratt's tenure.</p>

          <p>As France's far-right National Rally party gains popularity, it is carefully managing its relationship with the Trump administration, balancing ideological alignment with potential political risks. While sharing anti-immigration and nationalist views, the party is wary of being too closely associated with a U.S. leader unpopular with many French voters and whose tariff policies could harm its blue-collar base. Party leader Marine Le Pen has spent years trying to moderate the party's image to broaden its appeal. This cautious approach reflects a strategy to maximize votes ahead of the 2027 presidential election, avoiding alienating potential supporters.</p>

          <p>The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) hosted a league event inside the Intuit Dome, home of the NBA's Clippers, by trucking in 300 tons of sand to create an indoor beach. The move is part of an effort to grow the sport, attract new fans, and provide players with a professional-feeling venue complete with a halo scoreboard and arena amenities. Players embraced the novel setting, noting that the controlled, wind-free environment led to faster, more powerful play. The event represents a significant experiment for beach volleyball, testing its appeal beyond its traditional coastal roots and exploring new ways to present the sport to a wider audience.</p>

          <p>A proposal by Germany's Education Minister to consider a quota limiting the number of immigrant children in schools has ignited a national debate. The minister suggested a cap of 30-40% could be a "conceivable model" to improve educational outcomes, an idea that has drawn both support and sharp criticism. Proponents argue it could aid integration and language acquisition, but critics, including teachers' unions and student bodies, warn it is discriminatory, stigmatizing, and logistically unfeasible. The debate highlights broader challenges within Germany's education system, which has seen declining performance and struggles with language support.</p>

          <p>Chelsea is set to face Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final, a match that presents a formidable challenge against the reigning European champions. While PSG is heavily favored after a dominant win over Real Madrid, the article notes that Chelsea sees the final as a validation of its youth-driven project, regardless of the outcome. Manager Enzo Maresca is expected to stick to his positional, possession-based style rather than "park the bus," despite PSG's intense pressing game. For Chelsea, the match is a chance to prove their progress on the world stage and cap a successful season.</p>

          <p>The owner of a penthouse in a luxury Mayfair apartment building has been in an eight-year legal dispute with companies controlled by the family of the late Mohamed Al Fayed. The conflict, detailed in High Court filings, began over a lift installation agreement and has escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched renovations, and the "malicious" use of a noisy lift at night. The Fayed-controlled companies have denied the allegations and are counterclaiming for hundreds of thousands of pounds in unpaid ground rent and costs. The protracted battle reflects Al Fayed's famously combative approach to business disagreements.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive surge. After falling behind 8-2, the Dodgers' bats came alive, tagging Giants ace Logan Webb for six runs and cutting the deficit to one. Shohei Ohtani hit his 32nd home run of the season into McCovey Cove. However, the early hole, created by a rough outing from starter Dustin May who gave up seven runs, proved too deep to escape. The losing streak is the team's longest since 2017 and has shrunk their division lead to four games.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a contained camp in Rafah constitutes a crime against humanity. The author, Raja Shehadeh, reflects on the dehumanization of Palestinians since 1948 and the repeated failure of international law to protect them or enforce accountability. He contends that despite this, hope lies not in legal institutions but in Palestinian resilience and their enduring connection to their land, a spirit of "sumoud" or steadfastness. The article concludes that when the war ends, the truth of the suffering in Gaza will emerge and it will be shared humanity, not law, that ultimately holds Israel accountable.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a $6.7 billion deal to acquire a second batch of 180 K2 main battle tanks from South Korea, underscoring both nations' evolving military roles. The agreement highlights Poland's emergence as a major European military power on NATO's eastern flank and South Korea's status as a go-to arms supplier for U.S. allies. As the war in Ukraine depletes Western stockpiles, Warsaw is rapidly modernizing its forces, with plans to eventually acquire nearly 1,000 Korean tanks. The deal includes establishing a K2 production line in Poland, further cementing the strategic defense partnership between the two countries.</p>

          <p>According to Palestinian officials, negotiations in Qatar for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal are close to collapsing. The officials claim the Israeli delegation stalled the process and lacked the authority to make decisions on key issues, such as the extent of troop withdrawal and humanitarian aid distribution. Deep divisions reportedly remain, with a significant dispute arising over a map of proposed Israeli buffer zones that contradicted an earlier, more compromising message. Hamas officials now view the talks as a bad-faith maneuver by Israel to buy time, eroding trust and dimming hopes for an imminent agreement.</p>
