          <p>A federal appeals court has extended its block of a judge's order that would have returned control of California's National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom, allowing President Trump to continue deploying troops to Los Angeles. The deployment was initially authorized in response to demonstrations against immigration raids. The Justice Department argued that the president has the authority under Title 10 to call the Guard into federal service during a rebellion or when unable to execute U.S. laws. California officials argued that Trump should have considered less drastic measures and consulted with Newsom before deploying the Guard.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering whether to join Israel's attacks on Iran, specifically targeting the Fordow nuclear enrichment site. He is reportedly weighing the effectiveness of US "bunker buster" bombs against the site, which is built deep into a mountain. Israel lacks the capability to significantly damage the secretive Fordow site, making US involvement a crucial factor. Trump is expected to make a decision within two weeks, while diplomatic efforts are underway to find a resolution to the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Trump administration can maintain control of the National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles while California's legal challenge proceeds. The court found that the president has broad authority to deploy the military in American cities, although this power is not "unreviewable." The ruling focused on the limits of presidential power and refuted the argument that the decision to federalize the National Guard troops was beyond judicial review. The court's decision returns the issue to a lower court, but leaves open the question of whether the administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

This decision follows a deterioration in relations after the military junta took over Niger in 2023, leading to the withdrawal of French troops.

          <p>Several airlines have suspended flights between the United States and the Middle East due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. United Airlines paused its daily flights between Newark and Dubai, while American Airlines temporarily suspended flights between Philadelphia and Doha. Delta Air Lines has also suspended flights between New York and Tel Aviv. The suspensions come as Israel has been bombing nuclear and military targets in Iran, leading to airspace closures and travel advisories. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem is making plans to assist U.S. citizens departing from Israel.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, Iran's most secure nuclear site, viewing its disabling as necessary. He approved attack plans but has not made a final decision, setting a two-week deadline to allow for potential negotiations. The U.K. is engaged in active diplomacy to find a resolution, with meetings scheduled between foreign ministers. Intelligence reports indicate the estimated speed at which Iran could produce bombs, influencing Trump's considerations. Iran has prepared missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign.</p>

          <p>The Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument is at risk of closure due to proposed budget cuts for the National Park Service and a legal opinion allowing presidents to revoke or shrink certain national monuments. The monument, which commemorates the story of Emmett Till, was designated in 2023 and consists of sites in Mississippi and Illinois. Advocates and former officials warn that the budget cuts could force the closure of over 300 park sites. There are concerns that land under consideration for revocation could be used for mineral extractions.</p>

          <p>President Trump marked Juneteenth with a Truth Social post arguing that the United States has "too many non-working holidays." He claimed that these holidays cost the country billions of dollars and that workers do not want them. Trump honored Juneteenth during his first term, but his recent post contrasts with the recognition of the holiday by former President Biden, who signed a bill making Juneteenth an official federal holiday in 2021. The holiday commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. after the Civil War.</p>
