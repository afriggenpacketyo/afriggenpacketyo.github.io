          <h2>Japanese Farm Minister Resigns Amid Rice Price Controversy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing public criticism for stating he never buys rice due to receiving it as gifts, a remark that angered citizens struggling with rising rice prices. This resignation comes as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government deals with low approval ratings before an Upper House election and ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. The article notes that soaring rice prices are due to inclement weather, policies protecting local farmers, and increased demand from tourists, leading to panic-driven hoarding. Koizumi Shinjiro will succeed Eto as farm minister.</p>

          <p>A recent satellite analysis reveals that tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate in 2024, with fires surpassing agriculture as the primary cause, particularly impacting the Amazon due to severe drought conditions. This record loss released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, equivalent to the emissions of the European Union. The article highlights concerns about some forests, like parts of the Amazon, reaching a 'tipping point' of irreversible decline. South East Asia, however, showed positive trends due to government policies enforcing 'no burning' laws, demonstrating the importance of political will and consistent protection policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, aiming to expand the country's air defense system by the end of his term, similar to Israel's Iron Dome. U.S. officials state the system is needed to protect against catastrophic attacks, but experts cite logistical and financial hurdles. The project, a priority for Trump, faces potential cost overruns, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating costs between $161 billion and $542 billion. The article notes that the system aims to intercept missiles launched from anywhere, even space, but technical challenges exist due to America's vast territory.</p>

          <p>Record-breaking global temperatures in 2024 contributed to a catastrophic surge in forest loss worldwide, with wildfires responsible for nearly half of the destruction, particularly in Latin America. Brazil experienced its worst year for forests since 2016, with two-thirds of the loss due to fires, mainly in the Amazon rainforest. The article highlights that these fires not only emit greenhouse gases but also degrade the forests' ability to mitigate climate change.

The method has been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact type of tumor. The article notes that the new technique allows surgeons to perform more radical surgery, if needed, at the time of the original procedure. The faster classification could allow patients to get radiation treatment or chemotherapy, more quickly, and that the quicker diagnoses often reduced the anxiety patients felt while waiting for test results.</p>
