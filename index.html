          <p>A group of international culinary experts toured Higashikagawa and Miki in Kagawa Prefecture, Japan, to learn about the region's food culture. The chefs visited a soy sauce brewery, made somen noodles by hand, and participated in a traditional tea ceremony. Participants enjoyed a performance of gagaku, Japan's classical court music, and met with Miki Mayor Yoshiharu Ito. The chefs remarked on the emphasis on simple cooking that highlights local ingredients, drawing parallels between Japanese and Italian culinary traditions. The tour was organized in conjunction with a national conference for promoting food education in Tokushima.</p>

          <p>Germany faces potential tax hikes and increased debt as NATO allies consider a higher defense spending target of 5% of GDP. In 2024, Germany spent approximately 2% of its GDP on defense, totaling over 90 billion euros. Meeting the proposed target would require Germany to allocate significantly more funds to defense, potentially necessitating loans, budget cuts, and tax increases. Experts have raised concerns about the feasibility of long-term financing through loans and the potential impact on the EU's fiscal rules. The German government is exploring options to balance defense spending with economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines the timeline of the 2018 murder of Blaze Bernstein, an Ivy League student who went missing while visiting family in Orange County, California. Sam Woodward, a high school classmate of Bernstein, was arrested and charged with murder after Bernstein's body was found in a shallow grave. Prosecutors later added a hate crime enhancement to the charges, alleging that Woodward killed Bernstein because he was gay. Woodward was eventually found guilty of first-degree murder with the hate crime enhancement and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. After their son's murder, Blaze's parents started a movement called "BlazeItForward" inspiring acts of kindness.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed "Meteor-1", the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, which could be a milestone for using light to perform simultaneous operations. The chip achieves a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, comparable to Nvidia's advanced GPUs. The development comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors. Expanding computational parallelism is seen as a necessary path forward for optical computing, as it allows chips to multitask more effectively.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing fears of escalating conflict in the Middle East. Prices had initially jumped following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites but retreated as investors anticipated de-escalation. President Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the strike, enabling preventative measures. Analysts suggest the market believes the conflict will de-escalate following the initial U.S. response. Trump called on the Islamic Republic to move toward peace and said he would encourage Israel to do the same.</p>

          <p>China has become increasingly reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, accounting for 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. Myanmar is a key source of dysprosium and terbium, heavy rare earths crucial for high-tech manufacturing. China's reliance on Myanmar poses supply chain risks due to the ongoing civil war in Myanmar, particularly in the Northern Kachin State where most of the heavy rare earths originate. Imports of rare earth oxides from Myanmar have fallen by over a third in the first five months of the year, highlighting the vulnerability of the supply chain. The Global Witness reports that China has effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar "at a terrible cost to the environment and local communities."</p>

          <p>More than 100 Labour MPs are supporting an effort to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. The MPs have signed an amendment that would allow them to vote on a proposal to reject the welfare reform bill in its entirety. The welfare reform bill includes proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). The Labour MPs opposing the government's welfare plans could be enough to inflict defeat on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in the House of Commons, if all the opposition parties also oppose the plans.</p>

          <p>Florida has begun constructing a detention center, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' to temporarily house migrants on an air strip in the Everglades. The facility, costing approximately $450 million a year, will be built on the site of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. The state's Attorney General, James Uthmeier, suggested the location would deter escapees due to the surrounding environment. The proposal has drawn criticism, with Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniela Levine Cava expressing concerns about the potential environmental impact on the Everglades ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded the 2001 "Roadless Rule," a policy that protected 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins described the rule as outdated and overly restrictive, arguing that rescinding it will enable better forest management for fire risk and timber production. Environmental groups have denounced the decision, stating that it will harm wildlife habitats and water sources. Opponents also dispute the claim that eliminating the rule will reduce fire risk, arguing that commercial logging can exacerbate climate change.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume quick deportations of certain immigrants without advance warning or the chance to challenge their deportation. The court lifted an injunction that had blocked the practice, which was implemented following an executive order signed by President Trump in January. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the decision as a gross abuse of the Court's discretion. An official from Homeland Security praised the ruling, while the head of a legal group representing the immigrants expressed concerns about the removal of due process protections.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential payoff of President Trump's high-risk strategy of involving the US in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Trump announced a ceasefire between the two countries, which could mark a significant step back from escalating regional conflict. The article notes that Iran stated it would halt attacks if Israel ceased aggression by a specific time, and Israeli attacks reportedly ceased by that deadline. This development follows a day of heightened tensions, including Iranian missile strikes on a US base in Qatar, which resulted in no casualties.</p>

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, expressed concern over the president's unilateral actions and the admission of engaging in war without congressional approval. Rep. Thomas Massie stated that he would not push forward with a resolution requiring congressional approval for attacking Iran, given the ceasefire agreement.</p>

Key witnesses, including ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura (Cassie), testified about abuse and coercion. The prosecution also presented evidence, including a surveillance video and testimony from hotel staff, to support their claims.

The search for the two missing people covered over 390 square miles and was suspended late Sunday morning pending further developments, the Coast Guard said.
