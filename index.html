          <p>The Republican-led House has moved forward with debating the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,‚Äù a key piece of President Trump's agenda, despite internal party disagreements. The bill includes changes to Medicaid work requirements, state and local tax deductions, and clean energy credits. While Trump administration officials are urging immediate passage, Democrats are denouncing the measure as detrimental to social programs. The bill now faces the Senate, where further changes are expected, revealing the competing priorities within the Republican party regarding taxes, spending, and social programs.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how right-wing Afrikaner lobbyists have successfully exploited MAGA culture to elevate their cause in geopolitical discussions. They falsely claim that the South African government is responsible for targeted violence against white farmers, despite evidence to the contrary. The article argues that these lobbyists are attempting to rewrite South Africa's history and cast former oppressors as victims. The author also points out that South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy is often misunderstood, with the white minority still holding a significant portion of the country's wealth.</p>

          <p>A landmark review in the UK recommends releasing violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, after serving just a third of their sentence to ease prison overcrowding. The review also suggests managing more offenders in the community and expanding a voluntary chemical castration pilot for sex offenders. While the government plans to accept some measures, concerns are raised about the impact on the Probation Service and the views of victims. Critics argue that there is no excuse for letting the worst offenders out of prison early.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. Despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's price rise reflects investors seeking alternative stores of value. Macro concerns, including Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have further fueled Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Recent pro-crypto developments in the U.S. regulatory landscape, along with JPMorgan's decision to allow clients to buy Bitcoin, have contributed to the market's bullish sentiment (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Despite Russia's apparent reluctance to pursue peace negotiations with Ukraine, increasing economic and military pressures may eventually drive Moscow to the negotiating table. Sanctions on revenue-generating exports and domestic pressures such as rampant inflation are taking a toll on Russia's war-focused economy. While Russia's central bank is keeping interest rates high to combat inflation, a marked slowdown in GDP growth has surprised economists. Experts suggest that further offensive operations into 2026 will require forced mobilization, posing political and economic challenges.</p>

From 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to approximately 15,000 deaths from exposure to fine particulate matter from wildfires, costing around $160 billion. The study emphasizes the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the increasing problem of deaths from wildfire smoke.

          <p>The UK is facing increasing economic and political divisions, with public confidence in the government at record lows. Keir Starmer is attempting to address these issues through initiatives like the Council of the Nations and Regions, aiming to foster collaboration between the UK government and devolved governments. However, challenges remain, including differing powers among devolved bodies and a more challenging political environment. Collaboration between governments and mayors is crucial for achieving priorities and restoring public confidence in politics.</p>

          <p>One year after winning the general election, the Labour government is still blaming the Conservatives for current challenges.

However, questions arise about the effectiveness of continually blaming the previous administration as Labour approaches its first anniversary in office.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are poised to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." The waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue they have the authority to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The outcome could impact cities and states nationwide that have adopted California's standards, with potential legal challenges anticipated.</p>
