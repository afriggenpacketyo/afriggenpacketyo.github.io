          <p>President Trump stated that reaching a trade deal with China's President Xi Jinping is proving "extremely hard" as trade tensions escalate between the two nations. This statement comes amid White House suggestions that the leaders might speak this week. Trump highlighted Xi's toughness on Truth Social, while Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticized recent U.S. measures as undermining China's interests. Analysts believe Beijing is trying to convey the impression that Trump desires to talk, suggesting a phone call is imminent, especially after U.S. Ambassador Perdue emphasized trade and fentanyl concerns to Wang. Optimism is tempered by the complexities of the negotiations and the potential for surprises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% has sparked concerns in Europe, though the UK has been temporarily spared. The move aims to protect the U.S. steel industry from cheaper foreign imports, but it has drawn criticism from European exporters. The UK received a temporary exemption with a 25% tariff remaining in place, pending the finalization of its trade deal with the U.S. Uncertainty remains regarding the final tariff rates, potentially impacting UK orders and the overall steel industry during a period of global oversupply and weak demand.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's sales in Australia rebounded in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the Model Y. Despite facing declining sales in the U.S. and Europe, Tesla's Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, primarily due to a 122.5% year-over-year increase in Model Y sales. However, overall sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the previous year, and Tesla faces increased competition, especially from Chinese EV makers like BYD, and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk. While the Australian rebound is encouraging, it does not necessarily indicate a broader global recovery for Tesla.</p>

          <p>The United States has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, intensifying trade war concerns and impacting the global economy. This decision has strained relationships with trading partners and sparked negotiations to avoid the levies.

While some of the levies face legal challenges, they remain in place, increasing tension with partners like the EU and Canada, who express strong regret and call the tariffs unjustified.

          <p>Fran Kirby has retired from her England career, a decision influenced by a series of lengthy injuries and illnesses. Despite her unquestionable talent, these health concerns prevented her from reaching a century of international appearances. She struggled with knee and ankle issues, pericarditis, and fatigue, leading to time off and missed opportunities, including the 2023 World Cup. While she will be remembered as one of England's greatest players, fitness concerns played a significant role in her decision to step down.</p>

          <p>European companies are facing production halts due to Chinese government restrictions on the export of rare earth elements, which are essential for manufacturing smartphones and electric vehicles. These measures, seen as retaliation against U.S. tariffs, have created a backlog of export applications in China. The EU Chamber of Commerce in China reports that some companies have already stopped production due to the delays. The restrictions impact several rare earth elements, including dysprosium and terbium.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, aiming to bolster the American steel industry. Critics argue the move could harm steel producers outside the US, provoke retaliation, and increase costs for American consumers. The UK received a temporary exemption, with tariffs remaining at 25%, contingent on ongoing trade discussions with the US. Economists warn that the tariffs could lead to job losses in sectors reliant on steel and aluminum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government knew from the outset that the Â£2.35 billion frozen from the Chelsea sale might not reach Ukraine, according to sources involved in the deal with Roman Abramovich. Concerns arose from a "deed of undertaking" where Abramovich agreed to donate the money to charity for victims of the war, but he insisted on including Russian victims, which the government rejected. Legal action is now being considered to break the deadlock, though previous governments hesitated due to potential risks to investors and the complexity of seizing Russian assets. The delay has drawn criticism from various parties, including a House of Lords committee.</p>
