          <p>Former President Donald Trump visited Capitol Hill to assist Speaker Mike Johnson in garnering support from Republican hard-liners for his legislative agenda. With Speaker Johnson needing every vote to pass the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," Trump's presence aimed to unify the party amidst concerns from both conservatives and moderates. The bill faces sticking points regarding Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions, with ongoing negotiations attempting to strike a balance. Speaker Johnson expressed optimism about reaching an equilibrium point, emphasizing the bottom-up process used to develop the bill, while aides stressed that significant portions of the bill are already finalized.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the crash of a Mexican navy training ship into the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in the deaths of two sailors and injuries to 19 others. The incident occurred as the ship was departing from Pier 36 with tugboat assistance, and the NTSB is examining the crew, vessel, and environmental conditions to determine the cause. The investigation timeline indicates a rapid sequence of events leading to the collision, and the NTSB is coordinating with the Mexican government to access the ship's data recorders and interview the crew. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) refuted claims by Senator Schumer that budget cuts impacted the Coast Guard's ability to prevent the incident.</p>

          <p>Richard Garwin, the physicist who designed the first hydrogen bomb, passed away at 97, leaving behind a complex legacy. Though his work brought the world a weapon of unprecedented destructive power, Garwin dedicated his life to undoing the dangers it posed. Inspired by a conversation with Enrico Fermi, Garwin advised 13 presidents on nuclear arms control and pushed for a comprehensive test ban treaty. Despite his pivotal role in creating the H-bomb, Garwin initially kept it secret, fearing the attention of foreign intelligence agencies, and he maintained that its development was inevitable, though he sped it up. He also contributed to the advancement of spy satellite technology and the discovery of gravitational waves.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that markets and central banks are underestimating the risks posed by record U.S. deficits, tariffs, and international tensions. Speaking at his bank's annual investor day, Dimon expressed concern about higher inflation and stagflation, believing the risks aren't adequately reflected in stock market values. He anticipates a decline in S&P 500 earnings growth and highlighted the complacency surrounding tariffs, following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating due to government debt concerns. Dimon also noted that corporate clients are in a "wait-and-see" mode regarding acquisitions, while investment banking revenue is expected to decline.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was unlawful and a "gross usurpation of power." The ruling stated that President Trump's efforts to dismantle the agency exceeded his constitutional authorities and violated the statute that established USIP. Judge Howell criticized the use of law enforcement to carry out the executive order, stating it traumatized USIP employees. The ruling effectively nullifies the actions taken by DOGE officials, including the removal of USIP's president and staff, and the transfer of USIP property.</p>

          <p>President Trump is demanding a "major investigation" into celebrity endorsements of former Vice President Kamala Harris, alleging illegal payments were made to stars like BeyoncÃ© and Bruce Springsteen. Trump criticized the celebrities for supporting his opponent, accusing the Harris campaign of using payments for entertainment as a guise for illegal endorsements. He specifically cited unconfirmed reports that BeyoncÃ© received $11 million to endorse Harris, while also targeting Taylor Swift for her past support. Trump's outburst followed criticism from Springsteen regarding the "incompetent and treasonous administration," which led to a heated exchange between the two.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased after Moody's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating, citing concerns over the government's growing debt burden. The 30-year Treasury yield briefly surpassed 5%, reaching levels not seen since November 2023, before settling slightly lower. Moody's attributed the downgrade to the increasing cost of financing the government's budget deficit and the high cost of rolling over existing debt. The agency's move aligns it with other major credit rating agencies that had already given the U.S. their second-highest rating, and analysts view it as a significant symbolic move.</p>

A variety of debt relief options, ranging from debt consolidation loans to credit counseling, exist to help borrowers navigate their specific circumstances, with some potentially eligible for credit card debt forgiveness programs.

          <p>President Trump is pressuring major U.S. companies, like Walmart and Mattel, to absorb the costs of his tariffs instead of passing them onto consumers. This comes as businesses signal they may need to raise prices due to the persistent global trade war. The White House insists that foreign countries bear the burden of the tariffs, while dismissing warnings from companies about financial strain. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed Walmart would "eat some of the tariffs," despite the retailer's concerns about absorbing all the pressure.</p>
