          <p>College students and graduates are entering a challenging period as pandemic-era student loan relief measures expire and new Republican proposals aim to overhaul financial aid.

          <h2>Japan's Prime Minister Rules Out Consumption Tax Cut Amid Inflation and Tariff Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided against reducing the consumption tax rate to alleviate the impact of inflation and U.S. tariffs, despite calls for tax relief measures. The government views the consumption tax as a vital revenue source for Japan's debt-ridden economy. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized that reducing the rate would be inappropriate. Komeito, a junior coalition partner, suggests a consumption tax cut on food items to ease household burdens ahead of the House of Councillors election.</p>
