          <h2>CBS's Cancellation of 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' Sparks Debate on the Future of Late-Night Television</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:34:55 EDT</div>

          <p>The decision by CBS to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 has ignited discussions about the viability of the late-night television format. While Paramount cites financial pressures, with the show reportedly losing $40 million annually, some speculate about the timing following Colbert's criticism of the company. The industry now looks to Disney's upcoming decision on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" as a key indicator for the genre's future, as rising production costs and declining linear TV ad revenue challenge the traditional model. Despite its high ratings, Colbert's show, like others, faces an aging viewership and a shifting media landscape.</p>

          <p>A severe heatwave is affecting over 185 million people across the eastern United States, with heat indices expected to reach dangerous levels from 105 to 120 degrees. The Southeast, Midwest, and Northeast are all under extreme heat alerts, exacerbating hazy conditions from Canadian wildfire smoke in some areas. This prolonged event poses a significant health risk, as nighttime temperatures are not providing adequate relief, and cities like Tampa have already broken all-time heat records. The CDC reports that extreme heat causes nearly 2,000 deaths annually in the U.S. on average.</p>

          <h2>New Orleans Jail Mistakenly Releases Inmate Amid Scrutiny Over Recent Mass Escape</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:26:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An inmate held on multiple violent charges was accidentally released from a New Orleans correctional facility, the same jail from which ten other inmates escaped in May. Officials attributed the mistaken release of 30-year-old Khalil Bryan to a clerical error involving another inmate with a similar last name. The Orleans Parish Sheriff has taken full responsibility, calling it a "serious error" and a "failure of internal processes" that is now under investigation. This incident further heightens concerns about security and procedural integrity at the troubled facility.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly shortened his deadline for Russia to reach a peace agreement with Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to just 10 or 12 days. Citing a lack of progress and expressing disappointment in Vladimir Putin, Trump stated that the U.S. would impose massive "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners if a deal is not reached. The president remarked on the brutality of Russia's attacks on Ukrainian cities, signaling a hardening stance and a departure from his previously more reserved criticism of the Russian leader. This move escalates pressure on Moscow to end the conflict imminently.</p>

          <p>Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications have dominated the UK's App Store download charts after the Online Safety Act's age verification requirements took effect for sites with adult content. The surge suggests many users are using VPNs to disguise their location and bypass the new rules on platforms like PornHub and Reddit. One VPN provider reported an 1,800% increase in sign-ups, indicating public concern over privacy and data collection associated with age-check methods. However, cybersecurity experts warn that many free VPN services may pose significant security and privacy risks to users.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators is urging the Trump administration to stop funding the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and resume support for UN-led aid distribution. The senators expressed "grave" concerns over the GHF's operations, which have been linked to hundreds of Palestinian deaths as people seek food in designated military zones. Citing a worsening humanitarian crisis and the risk of mass starvation, the letter questions the administration's $30 million pledge to the private organization. This call is echoed by international allies and humanitarian groups who criticize the GHF for being ineffective and dangerous.</p>

          <p>Following intense international condemnation over a worsening humanitarian crisis, Israel has begun allowing more aid into Gaza and has declared daily "humanitarian pauses" in fighting. While convoys and airdrops are resuming, the United Nations warns the amount is a small fraction of what is needed to prevent mass starvation for the roughly 2 million displaced Palestinians. The UN's relief agency, UNRWA, states that at least 500-600 trucks are required daily, compared to the 120 that entered on Sunday. The situation remains desperate, with reports of "self-distribution" as starving people loot aid trucks before they reach depots.</p>

Following military coups in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso, anti-smuggling laws previously supported by the EU were abolished, leading to a boom in criminal enterprises. UN data shows drug seizures in the area have increased by over 11,000% since 2020, with cocaine trafficking from Latin America to Europe being a primary driver.

          <p>A real estate agent with over a decade of experience advises that homebuyers have significant leverage to negotiate terms beyond the sticker price, potentially saving thousands. Key negotiable items include seller concessions to cover closing costs, interest rate buydowns, and the inclusion of personal property like furniture. Buyers can also negotiate for specific pre-closing repairs, such as a new septic system which could cost up to $50,000, and request home warranties or professional cleaning. The article emphasizes that creative deal-structuring can be more impactful than simply lowering the sale price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 32-year-old woman in Crimond, Aberdeenshire, has been ordered to perform 134 hours of community service after she admitted to letting a girl under the age of 10 drive her car. The incident, which was filmed and appeared on social media, showed the barefoot child struggling to see over the steering wheel while operating the vehicle in poor weather. The woman pleaded guilty to culpable and reckless conduct that endangered the child and the public. The sentencing sheriff described her actions as "reckless in the extreme" and noted she was fortunate that more serious consequences did not occur.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the second Trump administration has effectively ended the long-standing U.S. foreign policy tradition of promoting democracy and human rights abroad. The author points to the dismantling of programs at USAID and the State Department, the targeting of the National Endowment for Democracy, and a new policy of downplaying election rigging. This shift is exemplified by Jared Kushner's firm building a Trump Tower on the site of NATO-bombed buildings in Serbia, a country backsliding into authoritarianism. The essay contends this new approach emboldens autocrats worldwide, who no longer fear consequences from Washington for their repressive actions.</p>

The business failed within a month because, as he discovered, nobody wanted the product, teaching him a valuable lesson about market demand. Cuban emphasizes that for aspiring entrepreneurs with no money, the key is to invest sweat equity into a service-based business that leverages a personal skill.

          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, a simple yet powerful way to become more influential and likeable at work is to practice active listening. This involves more than just hearing; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking thoughtful follow-up questions or paraphrasing what the other person has said. This technique, which Brooks calls a "superhero move," shows competence, builds trust, and demonstrates empathy, making you more likeable to colleagues and managers. Research confirms that people who ask more questions are perceived more positively, which can correlate with better job performance reviews.</p>
