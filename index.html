          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a significant tax and spending package, a key legislative priority for the Trump administration, in a tight 51-50 vote with the Vice President casting the tie-breaker. The bill, which includes increased spending for border security and defense alongside extensions of tax cuts, now returns to the House for final approval. The legislation's passage followed a marathon session and intense negotiations to secure support from wavering Republican senators. The Congressional Budget Office projects the legislation will add approximately $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, has threatened to prosecute CNN for its reporting on an app called IceBlock, which allows users to track and report the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Officials argue that reporting on the app encourages the avoidance of law enforcement and is illegal. President Trump also suggested the network should be prosecuted for its reporting on a recent U.S. military strike in Iran. This represents a significant escalation in the administration's ongoing conflict with news media organizations over their coverage.</p>

          <p>A provision to eliminate federal income tax on tips for service industry workers is a key feature of the massive budget package recently passed by the U.S. Senate. The proposal would create a new deduction for workers like restaurant servers and bartenders, though they would still be responsible for state, local, and payroll taxes. The House and Senate versions differ on details like income caps and the maximum deductible amount, and the tax cut is set to expire in 2028. Critics argue the measure would not benefit the lowest-earning workers who already have no federal tax liability.</p>

          <p>Recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids on California farms have created significant labor shortages, according to local farmers and workers. The crackdown has reportedly caused a large portion of the immigrant workforce, many of whom are undocumented, to stay away from the fields, leading to crops rotting at peak harvest time. This situation highlights the agricultural industry's heavy reliance on immigrant labor and raises concerns about potential food price hikes and economic disruption. Even President Trump has acknowledged the negative impact the raids are having on the nation's farmers.</p>

          <p>Veteran ESPN broadcaster Dick Vitale has publicly condemned the treatment of WNBA star Caitlin Clark by her peers, calling it "ABSURD." His comments came after players voted Clark as only the ninth-best guard for the upcoming All-Star Game, a stark contrast to her leading position in fan voting. Vitale suggested that other players are benefiting from the increased attention, salaries, and charter flights that Clark's popularity has brought to the league. The ranking discrepancy has fueled ongoing discussions about professional jealousy and the reception Clark has received since entering the WNBA.</p>

This case has drawn sharp criticism from veterans' advocacy groups, who argue the U.S. is betraying allies who face mortal danger if returned to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.

          <p>In a positive sign for consumers feeling the pinch of high food costs, Waffle House has officially removed the 50-cent surcharge it had placed on eggs. The restaurant chain implemented the temporary fee in February in response to record-high egg prices caused by a widespread avian flu outbreak that disrupted supply. The removal of the surcharge reflects the recent normalization of wholesale and retail egg prices, providing some relief to breakfast patrons. The price spike had been a notable challenge for the chain, which serves hundreds of millions of eggs annually.</p>

This measure, intended to reduce U.S. reliance on China's dominant clean energy supply chain, could jeopardize numerous planned projects and freeze investment in the sector.

          <p>Republican lawmakers in the House and Senate have both proposed significant cuts to Medicaid to offset tax reductions in their respective versions of President Trump's domestic policy bill. The Senate version proposes over $930 billion in cuts over a decade, which the CBO estimates would leave nearly 12 million more people uninsured by 2034. Both bills introduce work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, though the Senate's version expands work rules to include parents of older children.

          <p>Legal experts are expressing concern over a growing, bipartisan trend of politicians using defamation lawsuits as a political weapon against news organizations. This tactic, used aggressively by President Trump against outlets like CBS and ABC News, has recently been adopted by California Governor Gavin Newsom in a suit against Fox News. While critics of certain media outlets may cheer these actions, 1st Amendment scholars warn that the trend has a chilling effect on free speech and journalism. They fear it could weaken legal protections for the press and put publicly owned media companies in a vulnerable position.</p>

          <p>California has passed a major overhaul of its landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), in a bid to accelerate housing construction and address the state's severe housing shortage. The new rules, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, will exempt most housing projects built within existing developed areas from the law's often lengthy and costly review process. While housing advocates have praised the move as a critical step to remove bureaucratic roadblocks, some environmental and social justice groups have opposed the changes, fearing they will weaken public protections and facilitate industrial development.</p>
