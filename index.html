        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has denied the U.S. Department of Education's request to temporarily halt a district judge's injunction, preventing the Trump administration from proceeding with its plan to dismantle the department. Washington, D.C., along with two states, had requested the court to block the planned Reduction in Force (RIF) of half the DOE's employees and the closure of the department, which was announced in March 2025. The court emphasized the importance of allowing the department to carry out its statutory functions, citing the extensive findings of the District Court. Republican senators have also introduced legislation to redirect portions of the department to other federal agencies, reflecting widespread support among Republicans to eliminate the agency. The optimism score reflects the ongoing contention and uncertainty surrounding the future of the Department of Education. </p>

          <p>President Trump has barred most international students from entering the United States to study at Harvard University, escalating the administration's conflict with the Ivy League school. The order suspends entry for foreign students unless deemed in the national interest and directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking existing student visas. The administration accuses Harvard of failing to report student disciplinary records and of having ties to researchers based in China. This action follows previous attempts to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students, including an attempt to remove Harvard's certification in the federal government's student visa database. The optimism score is low, reflecting the restrictive and potentially discriminatory nature of the policy. </p>

The White House stated the restrictions are necessary due to terrorism concerns, inadequate vetting, and lack of cooperation on deportations. Exemptions exist for U.S. permanent residents, diplomats, and Afghans who assisted American forces.

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, a crucial step in the development of birds' flight capabilities. Researchers conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period, examining how feathers evolved during this era. The development of feathers that generate thrust and lift was essential for the evolution of birds. Scientists believe that while modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same ability to fly. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the scientific progress and understanding gained from the research. </p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether former President Joe Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents, claiming it was a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's cognitive decline. Trump argues that if Biden's advisers secretly used the autopen, it could impact the legality and validity of numerous executive actions. The investigation will also probe whether Biden's aides conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the president's authorities. Presidents have used autopens for decades, and the Justice Department previously stated that a president can legally use an autopen to sign bills into law. The optimism score is low due to the contentious nature of the investigation and its implications for the legitimacy of past executive actions. </p>

The department's Office for Civil Rights notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education of the alleged violation. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students after the October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. The accreditation process determines which schools are eligible for federal student loans and Pell Grants, potentially impacting Columbia's eligibility for federal funding.

          <p>The White House's steel and aluminum tariffs are impacting several of Munchkin's products, a popular baby products company. The CEO of Munchkin stated that the tariffs would significantly increase the cost of making their popular soft bite baby spoon. The company has already laid off workers due to the tariffs' impact on profits. Munchkin says manufacturing its products in the U.S. isn't feasible, and the White House's shifting tariffs have created uncertainty for the company. The optimism score is low, reflecting the negative impact of tariffs on businesses and consumers. </p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling more than a dozen flights a day as tariffs hinder its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft. The airline said it wouldn't immediately accept delivery of two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring extra tariff-related costs. The delayed aircraft were expected to arrive from Brazil in May, and Brazilian imports to the United States have been subject to a 10% tariff since April. Alaska said it is cutting routes that are served by multiple flights, so that no single route is eliminated entirely, even temporarily.

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss injections to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The UK drugs regulator, doctors, and pharmacists are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines are not being used safely. Women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant. Weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese.
