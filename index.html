          <p>Chess is experiencing a global resurgence, and India is at the forefront of this boom, boasting 85 grandmasters and some of the world's youngest top-ranked players. Chennai, Tamil Nadu, has become the epicenter of Indian chess, driven by a grassroots teaching system where schools and local businesses support promising players. Parents play a crucial role, encouraging their children's chess pursuits, sometimes at the expense of traditional academics. YouTube channels like the Tamil Chess Channel are expanding access to chess education, aiming to make India a chess powerhouse by nurturing talent at all levels. The popularity of chess has increased so much that players can now make a living from it, especially in a country with limited job opportunities. Optimism is high for India's continued success in the chess world.</p>

          <p>Colombian senator and presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot in the head at a Bogotá campaign event, sparking concerns about a return to political violence ahead of the 2026 elections.

The incident evokes memories of past political assassinations and cartel violence, raising fears of a destabilized political climate in Colombia.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian discusses the phenomenon of "anticipatory compliance" with Donald Trump's policies and argues for a strategy of "anticipatory noncompliance." The author cites examples of universities, law firms, and corporations preemptively censoring themselves or altering their behavior to avoid Trump's ire. The article contends that this compliance paves the way for autocracy and calls for active resistance to unconstitutional actions. Examples of anticipatory noncompliance are provided, such as universities pushing back against demands and states challenging the administration's reading of civil rights law. The piece suggests that restoring democracy requires a multifaceted approach, including demonstrations, boycotts, litigation, and political organizing.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News asserts that the "Global Intifada" has arrived in the United States, with attacks linked to Hamas. The author cites incidents like the Molotov cocktail attack in Boulder, Colorado, and the murder of Israeli Embassy staff in Washington, D.C., as evidence of organized violence. The author argues that campus protests are part of a larger terrorist network using students to stoke violence. The piece calls for new strategies to combat these attacks, including holding perpetrators accountable and disrupting their support networks, rather than solely focusing on universities' response to anti-Semitism. The article suggests that these actions are calculated campaigns resembling military engagements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that anti-Jewish attacks inadvertently strengthen the case for Zionism. The author points to recent incidents in Colorado, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania as examples of anti-Semitic violence motivated by anti-Zionist sentiment. The piece contends that such attacks raise the costs of being Jewish outside of Israel and make the prospect of a Jewish state more appealing to those who might otherwise be indifferent. The author claims that a truly effective anti-Zionist movement would focus on making Jews feel welcome and safe in their home countries, thereby rendering Zionism obsolete. The article concludes that by making Jewish life less livable, anti-Zionist violence ultimately undermines its own cause.</p>

          <p>A network of women in Latin America transformed safe abortion practices by spreading information about misoprostol, a drug that enables self-managed abortions. Activists shared knowledge about the drug at feminist gatherings, leading to the establishment of abortion hotlines and accompaniment networks. These networks provided information and support to women seeking abortions, often in countries where it was illegal. The work of these activists contributed to the legalization of abortion in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico. The networks continue to provide support even in countries where abortion is legal, offering a warm, friendly, and committed approach that complements medical care.</p>

Head coach Steve Clarke had previously expressed concern about the team's lack of options in the goalkeeping position. With Craig Gordon, Zander Clark, and Liam Kelly already missing due to injury, the team has been forced to turn to Doohan and McKenna to fill the void.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's spending package, known as Section 899, is causing concern on Wall Street due to its potential impact on foreign investments. The House-approved measure would allow the U.S. to impose a tax of up to 20% on foreigners with U.S. investments if their home country levies "unfair foreign taxes" against U.S. companies. Some analysts have dubbed it a "revenge tax," and experts warn it could affect cross-border income earned by hedge funds, private equity funds, and other entities. The Investment Company Institute has cautioned that the provision could limit foreign investment in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A top state regulator, Jordan Maynard, has warned that the U.S. gambling industry has become a "highway without speed limits" amid its rapid expansion. He urges lawmakers to consider nationwide rules on advertising by betting firms and nationwide exclusion lists for problem gamblers. Maynard's relationship with operators has been strained, as he emphasizes the need for regulations to protect patrons and citizens from harm. He criticizes the industry's use of the unregulated market as a "boogeyman" to resist reasonable regulations. Maynard believes artificial intelligence can be used to promote healthy betting behaviors and that some reasonable friction is a good thing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Vietnam, the term "Cali," referring to the Vietnamese diaspora in California, has become a slur among nationalists, used to criticize those perceived as opposing state policy. This sentiment has been fueled by growing nationalism and perceptions of American influence. Incidents such as attacks on a U.S.-backed university and criticism of a pop star for singing at an anti-communist activist's memorial reflect this trend. The government's control over media and education, combined with cyber troops policing online content, reinforces nationalistic narratives and discourages dissenting views.

These tsunamis could bring life-threatening waves in as little as 10 minutes, leaving limited time for warning or evacuation. A study identified nine densely populated areas particularly vulnerable, including Long Beach and Huntington Harbour. In Newport Beach, a local-source tsunami could inundate areas up to 33 feet above sea level.

Southern California could see over 350 casualties from a distant-source tsunami if evacuation is delayed, while the Bay Area could experience over 1,300 casualties.

Legislation is in its final stage in Chilean congress that would deem salmon farming and the Kawésqar people's traditional way of life in the area "totally incompatible," halting the expansion of the industry.
