            <h2>Trump's Tariffs Prompt China to Consider Joining CPTPP</h2>

            <p>President Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on imports, dubbed "Liberation Day," has sparked fears of a global recession and prompted countries to seek alternatives to US trade. Analysts suggest this could open the door for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a trade bloc including countries like Australia, Canada, and Japan. China applied to join the CPTPP in 2021, and the global response to Trump's tariffs may accelerate its inclusion as nations look to counter American trade policies. The CPTPP was formed from the remnants of the Trans-Pacific Partnership after the US withdrew under Trump's initial presidency.</p>

            <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have reached an agreement allowing ICE to access taxpayer information to locate undocumented immigrants subject to deportation. This memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishes a process for ICE to request taxpayer information from the IRS to further investigations of criminal undocumented immigrants who have failed to leave the United States after a judge's removal order. Treasury Department officials emphasize that the MOU includes safeguards to protect the privacy of law-abiding taxpayers, while still enabling law enforcement to pursue criminal violations related to immigration. Some IRS officials have raised concerns about the policy's potential impact on tax collection from undocumented immigrants.</p>

            <p>The stock market experienced significant volatility as President Trump threatened to escalate tariffs against China, leading to increased recession concerns. Leading indexes initially fell sharply, briefly rebounded, and then declined again, reflecting market uncertainty. Goldman Sachs economists raised the odds of a recession to 45% due to the tariffs and declining business and consumer confidence. Trump's threats to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports further exacerbated market instability, with overseas stock markets also experiencing steep losses. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>European and Asian defense stocks are outperforming their U.S. counterparts, driven by increased defense spending and a decline in trust in the U.S. as a reliable ally. Countries are investing in their own defense budgets due to concerns over the Trump administration's realignment with Russia and perceived betrayals of allies. This shift is leading European countries to favor European or allied arms manufacturers, as international arms transfer agreements allow the selling country to control weapon usage. Increased defense spending in Europe and Asia is expanding order books for companies like ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and Rheinmetall.</p>

The ACLU claims the ruling as a victory, stating that individuals must be given due process to challenge their removal.

            <p>The article discusses the increasing engagement between Europe and China amidst the US-China trade war instigated by President Trump's tariffs. Despite past turmoil and calls for de-risking, there is a softening tone towards China from European leaders and increased diplomatic and business interactions. Hong Kong is seen as a gateway between the world and mainland China, with growing interest in understanding life in the region. The article suggests that increased European engagement with China could offer a contingency plan for an increasingly adversarial transatlantic relationship.</p>

            <p>Defensive miscues and missed opportunities plagued the Los Angeles Dodgers in their 6-4 loss to the Washington Nationals, marking their third loss in four games. Errors by Mookie Betts and Miguel Rojas contributed to unearned runs, while stellar defense from the Nationals prevented potentially dangerous Dodgers rallies. Manager Dave Roberts expressed frustration with the team's lack of clean baseball, highlighting the need to improve fundamentals. Despite a strong offensive performance from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' defensive struggles overshadowed their efforts.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has issued a 5-4 decision that allows the Trump administration to proceed with deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, a 227-year-old law, but with some limitations. The Court ruled that anyone targeted for deportation under this law must be given "notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal." The decision is a win for the Trump administration, as it allows deportations to resume, but it also stipulates that individuals can challenge their detention on a person-by-person basis. The dissent warns that individuals without legal counsel face the prospect of removal to perilous conditions.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the United States will hold direct talks with Iran on its nuclear program, starting Saturday. The meeting will be at "almost the highest level," according to Trump, who withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal during his first term. Netanyahu expressed his support for the goal of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Trump warned that if the talks aren't successful, "it will be a very bad day for Iran."</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump may continue using a 1798 law to deport alleged gang members to Venezuela, but with certain limits. Any challenges to the wartime law, called the Alien Enemies Act, must take place in Texas, where the migrants were held, and not in Washington DC. Despite siding with the administration, the court's majority placed limits on how deportations may occur, emphasizing that judicial review is required. Trump celebrated the ruling, while critics argued that the administration improperly utilized the act.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Utah recently became the first state to ban fluoride from drinking water systems. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the EPA is also reviewing "new science" on fluoride. A report from the National Toxicology Program found lower IQ in children who had higher levels of fluoride exposure, prompting a federal judge to order the EPA to take steps to lower the potential risk of fluoride.</p>

            <p>China has vowed to take countermeasures against any move by the United States to further raise tariffs and pledged to take firm action to stabilize the markets. This comes after US President Donald Trump threatened to slap another 50 per cent duty on Chinese imports. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said it would “provide relending support if necessary to resolutely defend the stability of the capital market”. Chinese markets picked up slightly on Tuesday after plunging on Monday.</p>

Observers caution that diplomatic talk aside, there appears to have been few actual gains on contentious sticking points, with core disputes lingering over enforcement mechanisms, geographic scope, legal status and the role of external powers. The Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations issued an unusually tough statement last month, accusing China of “illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions”.</p>

Zelensky said the main objective was to protect Ukraine's Sumy and Kharkiv border regions and to "ease the pressure" on other parts of the vast front line. He thanked several army units defending Ukraine, including the 225th Assault Regiment deployed in the Belgorod region. Ukraine's operation in Belgorod is believed to be on a much smaller scale compared to its actions in Kursk.</p>
