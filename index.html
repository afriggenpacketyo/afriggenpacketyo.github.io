          <p>Florida's Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, has announced that the state is taking steps to "end all vaccine mandates." This policy shift represents a significant move against public health measures that were widely implemented during previous health crises. The announcement was brief and labeled as a developing story, indicating that further details about the implementation and scope of this prohibition are expected to be released soon. The move signals a continued divergence in public health policy among different U.S. states.</p>

          <p>Newsmax has initiated a federal lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the conservative media giant of unlawfully monopolizing the right-leaning cable news market. The suit alleges that Fox News uses anticompetitive practices, such as coercive agreements with cable distributors, to suppress its rivals and maintain its dominant position. Newsmax is seeking a permanent injunction against these practices and triple the amount of damages it claims to have sustained. A Fox News spokesperson dismissed the lawsuit as a response to Newsmax's own "competitive failures."</p>

          <p>A group of Jeffrey Epstein's survivors delivered emotional testimony on Capitol Hill, demanding the public release of all files related to the convicted sex trafficker. They directly challenged President Trump's characterization of the issue as a "hoax," urging him and lawmakers to support a bipartisan effort to force the Justice Department's hand. This push for transparency is being led by a discharge petition in the House, though it faces opposition from both House Republican leadership and the White House, creating a complex political battle.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul has voiced strong opposition to the Trump administration's decision to acquire a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel for $8.9 billion. Paul condemned the move as a "bad idea" and a step toward socialism, expressing concern that the free-market principles of the Republican party are diminishing. This government investment is one of several recent instances where the administration has taken a more interventionist role in the private sector, a trend that has drawn criticism from conservatives but support from figures like Senator Bernie Sanders.

Earlier, the 30-year bond yield had briefly surpassed the 5% threshold, driven by concerns over potential tariffs and threats to the Federal Reserve's independence. This market volatility reflects investor uncertainty as they weigh the impacts of administration policy against economic indicators ahead of the upcoming monthly jobs report.

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to shrink or eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is causing a significant migration of disaster-management experts from public service to private contracting. Former FEMA officials report that these private firms are hiring experienced government employees to fill the anticipated gap, as states will likely need to contract out for disaster response and recovery services. While proponents argue this shifts responsibility to the states, critics worry about a lack of transparency, accountability, and equitable aid distribution in a for-profit disaster response model.</p>

Savers must therefore decide whether their primary goal is to secure the highest possible rate or to maximize their overall interest earnings over time.

The senators accuse the department of a lack of basic oversight and are calling for an immediate cessation of funding to GHF, urging that the money be redirected to more experienced aid organizations.</p>

          <p>Over 100 survivors and family members of victims from Maine's deadliest mass shooting are suing the U.S. government, alleging the Army was negligent in failing to prevent the tragedy. The lawsuit claims that Army officials knew reservist Robert Card was delusional, violent, and had access to firearms, yet they failed to follow mandatory policies to ensure his weapons were removed. The plaintiffs argue that the Army's inaction and failure to inform local law enforcement directly led to the shooting, which they describe as one of the most preventable mass tragedies in American history.</p>

The incident highlights the challenges of content moderation on massive e-commerce platforms and the strange online phenomenon that has seen some frame Mangione as a folk hero.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has agreed to a $10 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that it illegally enabled the collection of personal data from children on YouTube. The FTC complaint claimed that Disney failed to properly label some of its YouTube content as "made for kids," which allowed data to be collected from viewers under 13 for targeted advertising without parental consent. As part of the settlement, Disney will pay the civil penalty and implement a program to ensure its content is correctly designated in the future.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner, the UK's Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary, has admitted to underpaying stamp duty on the purchase of her £800,000 flat in Hove. She attributed the "mistake" to incorrect legal advice regarding complex trust arrangements for her family home in Manchester, which should have triggered a higher tax rate for the additional property. Rayner has now contacted tax authorities to settle the amount owed and has referred herself to the Prime Minister's standards adviser for investigation, amid calls from the opposition for her to be sacked.</p>

Leon, a 42-year-old disabled Army veteran, has been charged with murder, and a search of his home uncovered numerous firearms and grenades. A judge set his bond at $1 million.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature suggests that the world has significantly less capacity to securely store carbon dioxide underground than previously believed. After excluding geological areas prone to leaks, earthquakes, or groundwater contamination, researchers found that global storage capacity is only one-tenth of prior estimates. This finding drastically lowers the potential of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a tool to combat climate change, reaffirming the critical need for rapid and direct reductions in greenhouse gas emissions rather than relying on future technological fixes.</p>

          <p>In a recent podcast episode, journalist David Frum analyzed the potential future of the U.S. government, contrasting President Donald Trump's leadership style with that of Vice President J.

The episode also featured an interview with Jonathan Rauch, who discussed the societal systems used to determine truth and the dangers of government-led disinformation campaigns that undermine the "constitution of knowledge."</p>

          <p>A group of over three dozen Democratic and independent senators is pressing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to clarify its policy regarding DACA recipients. The inquiry follows a DHS statement that suggested DACA beneficiaries are "not automatically protected from deportations" and encouraged those in the country illegally to self-deport. The senators argue this contradicts the program's own guidance, which states that DACA recipients are considered lawfully present for the duration of their deferred action, and they are seeking to confirm the administration's commitment to the program.</p>

He and his spokesperson were flagged down by a woman on a New Hampshire interstate who claimed to be a victim of domestic violence. However, after police intervened, a trooper suggested to Giuliani that the woman was actually the assailant and a man was the victim. Shortly after leaving this scene, their vehicle was struck from behind by another car, leaving the 81-year-old Giuliani with fractured vertebrae.</p>

The deals must now be approved by a majority of the EU's 27 member states, with some nations, particularly those with large agricultural sectors like France, still expressing reservations.</p>
