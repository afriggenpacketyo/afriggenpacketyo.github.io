          <p>Chinese on-demand delivery leader Meituan has announced its daily orders have reached a new record of 150 million, a significant milestone achieved shortly after surpassing 120 million. This surge in transactions for both food and retail goods signals the company's success in defending its market share against intense competition from rivals like JD.com and Alibaba. Meituan's founder, Wang Xing, has committed to substantial investments, including 100 billion yuan for the food service industry, to maintain dominance in the fiercely contested instant delivery market.</p>

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in a Florida motel room revealed a complex and volatile "throuple" relationship involving her, Zachary Abell, and Christina Araujo. Investigators connected Seiden's badly beaten body, found dumped by a road, to a bloody crime scene in Room 15 of the Sportsman's Lodge Motel. The case, which took nearly six years to go to trial, centered on the toxic dynamic between the three, marked by jealousy, alcohol-fueled violence, and control. Ultimately, both Abell and Araujo were convicted for their roles in Seiden's death.</p>

          <p>Kindergartens across China are struggling with the economic consequences of a sharp decline in the country's birth rate, forcing them to adapt to a shrinking pool of prospective students. One formerly exclusive government-affiliated kindergarten in Harbin now recruits from the general public to fill its classes, a sign of the widespread challenge. Nationally, over 38,000 kindergartens closed between 2020 and 2024, and total enrollment dropped by more than 25%, reflecting a significant demographic shift with profound implications for the education sector.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's large dams on the Brahmaputra river, contrary to fears in India, may actually be increasing water flow during the dry season. By analyzing data from two existing dams since 2014, researchers found that downstream water levels rose significantly, with low flows in February up by over 50%. This evidence suggests that instead of causing drought, the dams' water regulation might be mitigating water scarcity for downstream nations, providing a new perspective on the potential impact of China's planned mega-dam in Tibet.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly fired at least 20 Justice Department prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Donald Trump. According to sources, this move follows the earlier ousting of most senior prosecutors associated with the probes and has created a climate of fear among the department's career employees. The firings, identified through a "weaponization working group," have targeted individuals with varying levels of involvement, including litigation assistants and U.S. marshals, in a significant purge at the DOJ.</p>

          <p>Hong Wang, a prominent Chinese mathematician and a leading contender for the prestigious Fields Medal, has become a target of online cyber-nationalists in China. The criticism erupted because she delivered academic seminars at top Chinese universities, including her alma mater Peking University, in English rather than Mandarin. Despite her groundbreaking research and international acclaim, the online backlash highlights a growing nationalist sentiment that scrutinizes the actions of high-profile figures, even in academic settings. Wang is a graduate of Peking University and currently an associate professor at NYU.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting is scheduled to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week in an attempt to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The strike, set to begin on July 25, stems from an ongoing dispute over pay, with doctors arguing that a proposed 5.4% increase is insufficient to restore real-terms pay levels from 2008. The BMA has stated the strike will only be called off if the talks result in a credible offer, while the government maintains it cannot improve upon the current proposal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a major reorganization by laying off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees, part of a broader plan to reduce its domestic workforce by 15%. The cuts, which are part of a plan to eliminate redundant offices and streamline the department, have disproportionately affected bureaus focused on human rights, refugee admissions, and foreign assistance. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the move will weaken America's diplomatic corps and undermine national security interests during a period of complex global challenges.</p>
