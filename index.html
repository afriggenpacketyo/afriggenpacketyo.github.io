          <h2>Green Party Urges Withdrawal of Single-Sex Space Guidance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 11:04:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Green Party is calling for the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to withdraw its interim guidance on single-sex spaces, deeming it "ill-considered and impractical." Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer argues that the guidance, which followed a UK Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' by biological sex under the Equality Act, puts trans people at risk of discrimination. The guidance addresses the use of facilities in places like hospitals and restaurants, suggesting that trans women should not be permitted to use women's facilities, but should also not be left with no facilities at all. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has also voiced concerns, stating that there are questions over enforcement. The EHRC is expected to launch a two-week consultation in May to seek views from those affected by the guidance.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended President Trump's trade negotiation tactics, describing them as "strategic uncertainty." He stated that he did not know if President Trump had spoken directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but noted that they have a good relationship. Bessent suggested that a trade deal with China could take months to finalize, but an agreement in principle, along with good behavior from trading partners, could prevent tariffs from escalating. Bessent dismissed concerns about investors losing confidence in the U.S. economy, characterizing recent market fluctuations as potentially just statistical or market noise, and emphasizing the long-term fundamentals of a strong dollar and economy.

          <p>The Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) reports a significant increase in requests for church asylum, driven by growing fears of deportation among refugees. Some regions have seen requests nearly quadruple, but due to high demand, many requests cannot be granted. The incoming government plans to increase deportations, adding to the insecurity among those with uncertain residency status. Churches in Germany have a long-standing tradition of providing temporary shelter to refugees, allowing their asylum cases to be reevaluated, however, the practice is facing increasing criticism and challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not reduce tariffs on China unless they offer something "substantial" in return, indicating a continued hardline stance in trade negotiations. He clarified that he seeks a more open Chinese market for U.S. businesses and products, suggesting that he wants China to "free up" and allow greater access. Trump acknowledged that a deal was once close but China backed out, and he expressed uncertainty about whether he would even ask for an open China, as they may not want it.</p>

Coach Mike Tomlin has expressed interest in bringing in the four-time MVP, but the decision ultimately rests with Rodgers, who is also considering retirement. The Steelers have bolstered their offense, potentially enticing Rodgers to join their team.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is experiencing growing uncertainty about the reliability of American support following President Trump's recent tariff actions. The unexpected 32% tariff on Taiwanese exports to the US blindsided Taipei and sent shock waves through key sectors, despite Taiwan's significant investments in the US. Taiwan's exclusion from the initial round of trade negotiations further raised concerns about whether its strategic value is being judged primarily by its economic and military contributions.</p>
