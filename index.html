          <p>President Trump announced that the United States attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, calling it a "spectacular military success." The strikes involved B-2 bombers dropping Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs and a U.S. Navy submarine launching Tomahawk cruise missiles. Trump addressed the nation following the strikes, but the full impact of the operation and Iran's potential response remain uncertain, raising concerns about further escalation in the region. The strikes come amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Optimism surrounding this event is low, as this is an escalation of a conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. officials claim strikes on Iranian nuclear sites devastated the program, but experts analyzing satellite imagery suggest otherwise. Jeffrey Lewis and David Albright note that key elements, like enriched uranium stocks, remain untouched. The U.S. military operation, codenamed "Operation Midnight Hammer," involved B-2 bombers and cruise missiles targeting facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. While the strikes may have damaged centrifuges and infrastructure, the experts believe Iran could reconstitute its program, especially if enriched uranium was moved prior to the attack. This raises questions about the long-term effectiveness of the strikes.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, U.S. leaders called for Iran to pursue diplomacy rather than retaliation. President Trump stated that Iran must now make peace, while Vice President Vance clarified that the U.S. is at war with Iran's nuclear program, not Iran itself. Defense Secretary Hegseth emphasized that the strikes were intentionally limited and should invite peace, but also warned that the U.S. is prepared for any potential Iranian response. The U.S. is signaling to Iran that it should return to negotiations regarding its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade route for crude oil. This call follows Iran's warning that it reserves all options to defend its sovereignty after U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites. Blocking the strait could have significant consequences for the global economy, potentially driving oil prices above $100 per barrel. Rubio suggests it would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as it would halt its own oil exports to China. (not investment advice)</p>
