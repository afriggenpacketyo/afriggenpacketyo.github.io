          <p>Turkey's primary opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), has re-elected Ozgur Ozel as its chairman in an extraordinary congress. This move is seen as a defensive strategy to shield Ozel and other senior party members from a pending court ruling that could annul his previous election and remove them from their positions. The case is viewed by critics as part of President Erdogan's efforts to undermine political opposition. By holding a new vote, the CHP aims to provide Ozel with a fresh mandate from the party.</p>

The article identifies nine key practices, including openly discussing feelings to build emotional vocabulary, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by trusting children to try and fail. Rather than focusing on rote memorization of manners, these methods teach emotional regulation, conflict repair, and social awareness, which are the true foundations of strong interpersonal skills.</p>

Kelly also warns against hoarding points, as their value can be devalued by issuers at any time, and encourages cardholders to contact their credit card company to negotiate the annual fee before deciding to cancel or downgrade a card.</p>

Key obstacles include the lack of a defined territory, with the West Bank fragmented by settlements and Gaza devastated by war. Furthermore, Palestinian governance is deeply divided between the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, with no unified leadership or recent elections. These issues complicate the process of establishing a viable and functioning state, even with growing international recognition.</p>

          <p>This article examines how authoritarian and fascist regimes, from Nazi Germany to contemporary right-wing movements, rely on promoting traditional domestic roles for women to stabilize society and advance state ideology. It draws parallels between the propaganda of "children, kitchen, church" in the 1930s and the modern digital "womanosphere" of influencers who champion homemaking and normative femininity. The analysis argues that these movements reframe domestic duty as a prestigious substitute for female autonomy, masking regressive policies that ultimately place the burdens of state failures on women.</p>

          <p>During a "power of unity" military parade, Serbia publicly showcased its Chinese-made FK-3 and HQ-17AE air defense missile systems for the first time. This display of advanced weaponry highlights the deepening military cooperation between Belgrade and Beijing. The event occurs at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions across Europe, with Serbia's procurement of Chinese military hardware being watched closely by neighboring countries and Western powers as a sign of its strategic alignment.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's recent entry into the top 10 of the UN's Global Innovation Index demonstrates the ineffectiveness of the United States' strategy of technological containment. Instead of hindering China's progress, U.S. policies like export controls and blacklisting have spurred massive domestic investment in research and development, accelerating its drive for self-sufficiency. The article contends that this approach is counterproductive, undermining both global innovation and America's long-term interests as China becomes a technological powerhouse.

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, has publicly accused Elon Musk of being a "criminal" for allegedly inciting violence and allowing harmful content related to self-harm and child abuse on his social media platform, X. Davey is calling for the UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, to investigate both Musk personally and his company for failing to comply with the Online Safety Act. The sharp criticism follows Musk's video message to protesters at a far-right rally in London, where he told them to "fight back or you die."</p>

          <p>This article explains that the tiny, pin-sized holes located near the charging port on most iPhones and Android devices are microphones. Modern smartphones are typically equipped with a full microphone array, often including two or three separate mics placed at the top, back, and bottom of the device. These multiple microphones work together to provide features like noise cancellation during calls, improved audio capture for video recording, and better voice recognition for digital assistants like Siri.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested its stake in the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, concluding an exceptionally profitable investment. The initial $230 million purchase in 2008, championed by the late Charlie Munger, grew in value by approximately 3890% over the 17 years Berkshire held the shares. While Buffett has praised BYD, the sale aligns with a broader reduction in exposure to geopolitical risks associated with China, similar to the firm's quick exit from Taiwan Semiconductor.

The newly formed Northeast Public Health Collaborative, which includes seven states and New York City, aims to coordinate on issues like vaccine policy, emergency preparedness, and lab capacity. This trend, also seen on the West Coast, reflects a significant shift as states increasingly decouple their public health decisions from the national level to ensure consistent access and information for their residents.</p>

          <p>This article highlights a significant gap in sex education: the lack of information about fertility, which many women only learn about when they struggle to conceive later in life. Experts and women who have undergone fertility treatments argue that curriculums should cover not only pregnancy prevention but also the biological realities of conception, such as ovulation cycles and the decline of fertility with age. They believe that providing this knowledge earlier could empower individuals to make more informed decisions about family planning throughout their lives.</p>
