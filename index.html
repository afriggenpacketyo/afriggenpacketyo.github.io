          <p>The Trump administration has proposed increasing timber harvesting on federal lands as a strategy to mitigate wildfire risks, a move celebrated by logging communities in places like Oregon. However, the plan faces strong opposition from environmental groups who fear it will lead to deregulation, harm to ecosystems, and the destruction of old-growth forests. Stakeholders, including former U.S. Forest Service employees and local community leaders, express concern over the practical implementation of the policy, questioning if federal agencies have the staffing and resources to manage increased logging responsibly while adhering to environmental laws.</p>

          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the site of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major infrastructure project designed to upgrade the county's aging wastewater system. Fortunately, none of the workers sustained visible injuries, and they were able to escape by climbing over a large pile of debris. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) is now investigating the cause of the collapse, and the project has been put on hold indefinitely.</p>

          <p>Patty Hartman, a 17-year public affairs specialist at the Justice Department, has been fired, becoming the fourth person connected to the January 6th prosecutions to be terminated recently. Hartman warns that the traditional separation between the White House and the DOJ has eroded, suggesting the firings are a form of political retribution by the Trump administration. She describes her dismissal as part of a broader destabilization, stating that the administration has "thrown all of the rules out the window." An anonymous colleague called the firing "unconscionably petty and vindictive."</p>

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris have started turning again after being inactive for 14 months following an accident. The original sails collapsed in April 2024 due to a mechanical failure, but no one was injured. The restoration was celebrated with a street performance by 60 can-can dancers and a fireworks display, marking the return of a beloved Parisian landmark. The historic cabaret, a symbol of Parisian nightlife since 1889, attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors annually and is now fully restored.</p>

The attack, which injured two officers and a Border Patrol employee, comes as the Department of Homeland Security reports a nearly 700% increase in assaults against federal immigration agents compared to the previous year. While the shooter's family suspects mental health issues, the incident has intensified political debate, with the White House urging Democrats to moderate their rhetoric against ICE and Border Patrol.</p>

          <p>Irvine Welsh, author of the cult novel "Trainspotting," reflects on the cultural shifts since his book's release in the 1990s, expressing concern over the impact of technology. He argues that the internet and AI are creating a "post-culture society" where people are becoming "dumbed down machines" by letting technology think for them. As he releases a new novel, "Men in Love," Welsh discusses how he explores themes of love as an antidote to modern hate, while also noting the increasingly censorious environment for creative expression. He connects the social decay depicted in his work to ongoing economic precarity.</p>

Climate scientists emphasize that this is not "just summer," but a clear manifestation of human-induced climate change, which makes extreme heat events more frequent and intense. While some compare the heat to the legendary summer of 1976, data shows that current heatwaves are warmer on average and part of a consistent warming trend. Projections indicate that such hot spells will become an increasingly regular feature of UK summers, especially in the southeast.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance, signaling strong consumer demand for its products. The denim maker announced it plans to absorb some of the increased costs from new U.S. tariffs to protect consumers, a strategy aided by strong international sales and a reduction in promotions. The company's forecast assumes a 30% tariff on goods from China and 10% on the rest of the world, though this could change with evolving trade policies. The positive outlook caused Levi's shares to rise in extended trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump White House is compelling former Biden administration aides to provide "unrestricted testimony" to a congressional investigation into Joe Biden's health by waiving executive privilege. This move reverses the stance Trump took during the Jan. 6 investigation, when he warned that such waivers would do "grave damage" to the presidency by turning the privilege into a political weapon. Constitutional experts worry this could create a cycle of retribution between opposing parties, potentially chilling the candid advice presidents receive from their staff.
