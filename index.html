          <p>The investment platform Yieldstreet has notified customers to anticipate significant losses on $89 million worth of defaulted marine loans. The company reached a $5 million settlement with the borrowers, but stated this amount will not cover its own extensive legal recovery costs, leaving no funds for investor repayment. This outcome follows a multi-year effort where Yieldstreet accused the borrowers of fraud after losing track of the ships used as collateral. The episode has disappointed investors, some of whom have lost over 90% of their original investment in what was marketed as a short-term deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned from her roles as UK Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary after an investigation found she underpaid tax on a property sale. The inquiry by the prime minister's ethics adviser concluded she breached the ministerial code, although it noted she had acted with integrity. Rayner accepted full responsibility for the error, stating she failed to seek specialist tax advice regarding complex family arrangements. Her departure has prompted a major cabinet reshuffle and is expected to trigger a new deputy leadership election within the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>During a special legislative session, Colorado Democrats approved millions in state Medicaid reimbursements for Planned Parenthood, a move criticized by Republicans as the state faces a projected budget shortfall of up to $1.2 billion. The funding is intended to cover a gap created when a new federal law, HR-1, prohibited federal Medicaid funds from going to the organization for one year. Democrats argue they are responsibly addressing the consequences of federal policy changes, while Republicans contend the state should prioritize its own budget crisis before funding external entities. The decision highlights the contentious political divide over fiscal priorities and reproductive healthcare funding.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on three Palestinian human rights organizations—the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and Al-Haq. The sanctions were enacted because the groups requested the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate alleged Israeli war crimes and genocide in Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the action was taken for their efforts to have the ICC prosecute Israeli nationals without Israel's consent. The sanctioned groups, which have been documenting the conflict for months, condemned the move as "immoral, illegal and undemocratic," highlighting the significant humanitarian crisis and rising death toll in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A major immigration raid at a Hyundai electric vehicle factory construction site in Georgia resulted in the detention of 475 people. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stated the operation was part of a criminal investigation into unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, marking the largest single-site enforcement in the agency's history. A majority of those detained were Korean nationals, prompting South Korea's foreign ministry to express concern over a potential "unjust infringement" of its citizens' rights. Hyundai Motor Company confirmed the incident occurred at a supplier's site and stated none of the detained were its direct employees.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot approaching $1.8 billion, a data analysis shows how a winner's location significantly impacts their net prize. Federal taxes claim about 37% of winnings, but state taxes vary widely, creating large disparities in take-home amounts. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to keep the most money after federal deductions. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, result in the lowest after-tax payouts. The report also notes this jackpot run is the longest in Powerball history without a winner.

In response to the financial pressure, PBS has also slashed its overall budget by 21% and reduced the dues it collects from local stations.

          <p>Swedish prosecutors are observing a disturbing trend of teenage girls being recruited as contract killers in the country's escalating gang wars. According to authorities, girls are using encrypted messaging apps to offer their services, sometimes seeking to prove they are more ruthless than their male counterparts to secure roles within criminal networks. This development highlights a previously overlooked aspect of organized crime in Sweden, which has seen a surge in shootings and bombings. Experts note that many of these young women are themselves vulnerable, often dealing with drug addiction and past trauma, making them susceptible to exploitation by gang leaders.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added only 22,000 jobs in August, and a revision revealed a loss of 13,000 jobs in June, ending a 53-month streak of growth and confirming a significant labor market slowdown. Economists describe the current environment as "frozen," with hiring at its slowest pre-pandemic pace since 2013, even as layoffs remain low. For job seekers, this creates a challenging "game of musical chairs" with more unemployed people than job openings for the first time since 2021. Career experts advise workers to focus on networking, skill development, and seeking internal opportunities to navigate the difficult market. (not investment advice)</p>

Eight states, including Florida and Texas, do not tax lottery winnings, offering the highest possible take-home prize.

          <p>This opinion article asserts that Donald Trump's proposal to use the National Guard to address crime in cities like Chicago and Baltimore is a politically astute move that aligns with public sentiment. The author argues that despite criticism of the plan as authoritarian, it addresses a real crisis of public safety that has persisted under Democratic leadership. The piece contends that Trump is effectively using a "political jiu-jitsu" to force opponents into defending unpopular positions on crime. It concludes that the American public broadly supports a tougher law-and-order approach, and Trump's proposal taps into this concern, making it a winning issue for him.</p>

An excerpt reveals the personal toll of the process, including intense media scrutiny and a loss of privacy for her family, which she was reluctant to repeat after being a finalist for a previous vacancy. She recounts that she and her husband, Jesse, agreed to "burn the boats," committing fully to the path ahead without second-guessing their choice. Barrett writes that despite her fears, she felt a sense of duty to serve and uphold the rule of law.</p>

The new data also included a downward revision for June, showing a net loss of 13,000 jobs that month, the first monthly decline since December 2020. The continued slowdown is likely to solidify the Federal Reserve's decision to implement an interest rate cut at its next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

In a television interview, Lutnick claimed that "holdovers from the Biden administration" were "rooting against America" and creating "noise against the president." He suggested that removing such individuals would lead to an agency that is on the president's side and focused on putting out correct numbers, a statement made just before the BLS reported a disappointing 22,000 jobs were added.</p>

Germany suspended mandatory service in 2011, but the current geopolitical climate has renewed the discussion.
