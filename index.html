          <p>Owen Farrell has been named captain of the British and Irish Lions for their upcoming match against a First Nations and Pasifika XV in Melbourne. This will be Farrell's first start of the tour, playing at inside centre in a completely changed lineup from the first Test against Australia. The selection provides an opportunity for numerous squad players to make their case for inclusion in future Test matches. The team for this mid-week game includes a heavy contingent of Scottish players and recent call-ups.</p>

          <p>The family of legendary England batter Graham Thorpe, who took his own life last year, is organizing a special tribute to celebrate his memory and raise mental health awareness. The event, 'A Day for Thorpey,' will take place during the fifth England-India Test at The Oval on what would have been his 56th birthday. Headbands, a nod to Thorpe's trademark accessory, will be sold to raise money for the charity Mind. His family hopes to reduce the stigma around suicide and encourage people to seek help early.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Singapore dollar (SGD) is increasingly viewed as a "quasi safe-haven" currency, especially within Asia, due to Singapore's strong institutional framework and stable policymaking. However, this analysis notes that it has not yet achieved the global status of traditional safe havens like the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, or Swiss franc. The primary hurdles for the SGD are its relatively small market size and the managed nature of its exchange rate, which limits liquidity and large-scale speculation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Armed Bedouin clans have withdrawn from the Druze-majority city of Sweida in southern Syria, following a week of deadly clashes that killed hundreds. A U.S.-brokered ceasefire has brought a cautious calm to the region, allowing humanitarian aid convoys to enter the battered city. The fighting, which threatened to unravel Syria's fragile post-war stability, was sparked by sectarian tensions and a series of kidnappings. The withdrawal marks a critical de-escalation, though underlying tensions between the groups remain high.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man, Keith McAllister, has died in a tragic accident after being pulled into an MRI machine by a heavy metal chain he was wearing. The incident occurred when McAllister entered the MRI room to help his wife, who was undergoing a scan, while wearing a 9kg weight-training chain. The machine's powerful magnetic force violently pulled him in, causing him to suffer a series of heart attacks from which he did not recover. The event highlights the extreme dangers of bringing metallic objects near active MRI equipment.</p>

          <p>A significant contrast in energy policy is emerging between the U.S. and China, particularly as global electricity demand rises due to AI. China is forging ahead with substantial investments in renewable energy as part of its technological and strategic goals. Conversely, the Trump administration is actively canceling tax credits for wind and solar power, labeling them as unreliable and a threat to the American electric grid. This divergence highlights two distinct paths in addressing climate change and energy security amid their ongoing tech rivalry.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to derail the Washington Commanders' plans for a new stadium in D.C. unless the NFL team reverts to its former name, the Redskins. In a social media post, Trump stated he might put a restriction on the deal if the name is not changed, claiming there is a large demand for the original name. This intervention creates a significant political obstacle for the team's proposed move from Maryland back to the nation's capital, a project that requires navigating complex land-use agreements.</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing its worst measles outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 1998, with case numbers now surpassing those in the much larger United States. The surge, centered in provinces like Alberta and Ontario, is being driven by declining vaccination rates and the spread of anti-vaccine misinformation, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. Health officials note that some Mennonite communities, where vaccination uptake has historically been lower, have been significantly affected. The situation highlights a growing public health challenge in a country previously known for high immunization coverage.</p>

          <p>Despite market anxiety over approaching tariff deadlines, this analysis argues that multiple strong undercurrents are buoying stocks. The article points to a strong earnings season, significant consumer and business tax relief in President Trump's "big beautiful bill," and massive investment in data centers and the electrical grid. Further optimism is drawn from relaxed bank lending rules, a resurgence in the U.S. energy sector, and a primed IPO market, suggesting the economy has substantial momentum.

          <p>The UK government has issued a warning that people retiring in 2050 are projected to be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless action is taken. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to find ways to boost retirement savings. The department's analysis revealed stark gaps, with nearly half of working-age adults, particularly the self-employed, low earners, and certain ethnic groups, not contributing to a private pension. This initiative aims to build a national consensus on a future strategy.</p>
