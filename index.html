          <p>European stocks are poised for a broadly higher open on Tuesday, mirroring a robust Wall Street rally that propelled all three major U.S. indexes to new record highs. This optimistic outlook is significantly bolstered by chipmaking giant Nvidia's announcement of a substantial $100 billion investment in OpenAI to construct new data centers, sparking a tech sector surge. Global investors are also closely monitoring the latest developments in Sino-U.S. relations, with the U.S. Ambassador to China indicating a highly anticipated meeting between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping is now more likely in early 2026. Upcoming economic data releases, including HCOB Manufacturing PMI data for Germany and S&P Global's U.K. Manufacturing PMI, will provide further direction for European traders, contributing to a generally positive market sentiment.

          <p>China's global manufacturing hub, Guangdong province, has been brought to a standstill as it prepares for Super Typhoon Ragasa, anticipated to be the most powerful typhoon in recent years. The province has upgraded its alert to Level 1, the highest in a four-tier system, with officials declaring a "combat-ready" status. Over ten major cities, including the technology hub Shenzhen, have announced comprehensive closures of markets, schools, factories, and transport systems, advising residents to stay indoors and stockpile food and water. Widespread hoarding has already led to shortages in online grocery shops, while Shenzhen and Guangzhou airports have cancelled flights, underscoring the severe disruptions and the region's preparations for the worst.</p>

          <p>Issuers from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau are significantly increasing their activity in the offshore dollar bond market this year, driving total issuance to its highest level since 2022. Among these is Seazen Group, a struggling developer, which is seeking another two-year dollar bond deal to refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes, following a previous $300 million offering. This renewed interest highlights a crucial reopening of financial channels that had largely closed during China’s unprecedented property crisis and economic slowdown. The changing interest-rate environment now allows companies to refinance at more palatable terms, potentially rebuilding trust in sectors previously deemed untouchable by global investors, signaling a cautious recovery.

          <p>Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have jointly announced their immediate withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), denouncing its jurisdiction as an "instrument of neocolonial repression" and a "global example of selective justice." The military-led West African states criticized the court for being "incapable" of prosecuting proven war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, arguing it unfairly targets less privileged nations. These nations, which formed the Alliance of Sahel States after recent coups, plan to establish "indigenous mechanisms for peace and justice" and have increasingly distanced themselves from Western powers, strengthening ties with Russia. Their armies have faced accusations of crimes against civilians amidst ongoing conflicts with jihadist groups, further complicating the regional security landscape.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order officially labeling the left-wing Antifa movement as a "domestic terrorist organization." The White House cited a "pattern of political violence designed to suppress lawful political activity and obstruct the rule of law" as the basis for the designation. This controversial move follows the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which Trump has publicly attributed to left-wing rhetoric. The order directs federal agencies to investigate and dismantle the decentralized movement, prompting significant concerns among critics who warn it could expand surveillance powers, curb free speech, and unfairly target Trump's political opponents, particularly as legal experts note a lack of precedent for such a domestic designation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to China, David Perdue, stated that a highly anticipated meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping is more likely to occur in early 2026 rather than this fall. This clarification comes despite Trump's earlier social media comments suggesting a meeting next month and a China visit early next year, details which were notably absent from the Chinese readout of their recent call. Perdue emphasized the "very good and very encouraging" current relationship between the two leaders, highlighting ongoing discussions with Vice Premier He Lifeng and Premier Li Qiang during a rare U.S. congressional delegation visit to Beijing. The delegation also discussed boosting communication, particularly on military issues and TikTok ownership, aiming to foster better understanding between the two countries.</p>

          <p>NFL Week Three was marked by an extraordinary Sunday of dramatic finishes, with five games decided on the last play, including four thanks to last-gasp field goals. The Philadelphia Eagles staged a massive comeback against the Los Angeles Rams, remaining unbeaten after blocking a field goal and returning it for a touchdown. In a significant upset, the Cleveland Browns ended an eight-game losing run by beating the Green Bay Packers with a 55-yard kick as time expired. Other notable performances included Mac Jones steering the San Francisco 49ers to a 3-0 start, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers becoming the first team in the Super Bowl era to win their first three games in the final minute.</p>

          <p>Scientists, backed by a $7 million grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation, have achieved a breakthrough in creating "infinitely recyclable" bioplastics called polyhydroxyalkanoates from common agricultural materials like sugar, corn, and agricultural waste. This innovation aims to address the significant global plastic pollution crisis, where only 5% of plastics are currently recycled, with the rest contributing to landfills and microplastic contamination. The new bioplastics, developed by a collaborative team including Purdue and Stanford, promise to reduce manufacturing costs by using domestic materials and mitigate environmental harm. While still requiring refinement for high-temperature durability, this technology holds substantial potential for diverse real-world applications, from medical devices to product packaging, fostering a cleaner, cooler future.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mike Freelander, a pediatrician with nearly 40 years of experience, strongly advocates for paracetamol (acetaminophen) as a safe and essential medication during pregnancy, directly refuting recent unscientific claims linking it to autism. He emphasizes that extensive studies, including the largest and most recent Swedish and Japanese research, have disproven a causative effect, despite small associations, and that the number of autism diagnoses is increasing due to better diagnostic methods. Medical regulators globally, like Australia's TGA, classify paracetamol as safe based on rigorous scientific evidence, unlike less safe alternatives for expectant mothers. Dr. Freelander stresses the importance of trusting regulatory frameworks and expert consensus over poorly informed health policy, highlighting the potential for significant anxiety and inappropriate health outcomes from such claims.</p>

Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club demonstrated the severity of the problem during a recent match against Tottenham, where over a hundred illegitimate tickets, including one purchased by a fan who traveled 5,500 miles, were blocked. Clubs are now implementing new technologies, such as encrypted barcodes and AI-driven risk assessment systems that apply a "risk score" to transactions, to combat resellers who use bots and fake identities.

This ruling follows a similar decision that restored $81 million to UCLA from the National Science Foundation.

Allardyce, who guided Bolton to Europe with this style decades ago, notes a return to long balls and the effective use of big strikers, with recent high-profile transfers reflecting this trend. He also points out the rising importance of specialized set-piece coaches, like Arsenal's Nicolas Jover, and the increasing percentage of goals scored from dead-ball situations, advising young coaches to embrace tactical innovation and be different to surprise opponents.</p>

It also uncovers instances of residents working illegally to supplement meager government allowances and the high cost of taxi journeys for necessary travel, despite public transport options.

This grave accusation is vehemently denied by Israel, which maintains it abides by international law and is acting in self-defense against Hamas, which it states is prolonging the war. The debate centers on the 1948 convention's definition of genocide and the intent to destroy a group, with some citing Israel's "total siege" and high Palestinian casualties.

          <h2>China Advocates for Distinct Foreign Relations Knowledge System, Rejecting Western Frameworks</h2>

          <p>Zheng Yongnian, dean of the school of public policy at Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, has urged China to develop a unique foreign relations knowledge system, separate from Western frameworks. This initiative aims to better explain China's foreign policy and global role to the world, aligning closely with Beijing's recently introduced Global Governance Initiative (GGI) which promotes a multipolar, inclusive global order emphasizing sovereign equality and multilateral cooperation. Zheng argues that international relations, and China's role within them, have for too long been viewed through a Western lens dominated by theories such as realism and liberalism. This move signifies a strategic push for intellectual autonomy as a key part of China's expanding global influence and diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Lions delivered a commanding 38-30 upset victory over the Baltimore Ravens on Monday night, showcasing a powerful ground game and relentless defense. Running backs Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery each scored two touchdowns, contributing significantly to the Lions' 224 rushing yards, overwhelming the Ravens' front. Detroit's defense was particularly disruptive, sacking Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson seven times and limiting his effectiveness. Key plays included a crucial fourth-down conversion and a Montgomery touchdown late in the game, which sealed the win. This impressive performance moves the Lions to a 2-1 record, highlighting their physical dominance and strategic play-calling against a formidable opponent in a high-scoring affair.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Porsche's stock plummeted by more than 7% on Monday after the company warned that delays in its electric vehicle (EV) rollout will significantly dent its 2025 earnings. Facing weakening demand for EVs and intense competition from Chinese rivals, Porsche will slow its push for electrification and extend the production of combustion engine models. This strategic shift includes launching an upcoming line of sport utility vehicles exclusively with combustion engines and plug-in hybrid options, rather than fully electric. Parent company Volkswagen also saw its shares fall by over 7% on the same day. The challenges underscore broader difficulties for European manufacturers navigating electrification deadlines, market competition, and a slowing luxury car market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 33-year-old man, Jacob Samuel Winkler, has been arrested and charged with a federal felony for allegedly shining a laser pointer at Marine One, the presidential helicopter carrying President Trump. A U.S. Secret Service patrol officer observed Winkler acting erratically before he aimed a red laser beam at the officer's face and then at the helicopter, an act that could temporarily blind or disorient a pilot and risk an airborne collision. Winkler reportedly told investigators he points lasers "at all kinds of things" and was unaware it was illegal to target Marine One. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro condemned the behavior, emphasizing that such acts endanger those on board and will be fully prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has intensified into a major Category 4 storm, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, with its center expected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday night. Packing maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, Gabrielle is tracking northeast, and while no watches or warnings are currently issued for Bermuda, those in the Azores archipelago are strongly advised to monitor its progress. Swells generated by the hurricane are forecast to reach the East Coast from North Carolina northward to Atlantic Canada through the early part of this week, creating life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. NOAA had initially predicted a busier-than-average season, though hurricane activity has so far been quieter than anticipated.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miller delivered a eulogy for Charlie Kirk that served as a "battle cry" for the Trump administration’s "state-sponsored war" against perceived foes, which critics argue is a jarring piece of rhetoric. Miller's speech depicted opponents as "wickedness" and "nothing," destined for destruction, drawing condemnation for its Manichean style and perceived hypocrisy in holding enemies to standards he refuses to abide by. The article contrasts Miller's divisive language with Barack Obama's call for reconciliation after a similar tragedy, highlighting how Miller's address intensified political polarization. Critics question the premise that Kirk’s murder "awakened" Miller’s desire to crush enemies, suggesting it merely provided a convenient pretext for existing animosity.</p>

The series, starring David Tennant as investigative Guardian reporter Nick Davies, delves into the extensive hacking at the Sunday tabloid News of the World and the troubling relationship between the press, politics, and police. Thorne highlighted the contrast with the Post Office Horizon IT scandal, where journalism struggled for public traction, celebrating the phone hacking journalists for their bravery in holding their own industry accountable. He noted their willingness to "do damage to that industry" for the sake of truth, calling their actions quite remarkable.</p>

          <p>China has decisively rejected Nvidia's B40-series chips, stripped-down versions designed for its market after stringent U.S. export restrictions, signaling a firm pivot towards technological independence. Regulators reportedly ordered leading technology companies to halt purchases of these chips and initiated antitrust investigations into Nvidia, viewing continued reliance as accepting U.S.-dictated tech inferiority. This refusal highlights how Washington's bans have reshaped internal debates in Beijing, shifting the conversation from whether self-reliance was desirable to whether it was an unavoidable national necessity. The move underscores Beijing's determination to build a self-sufficient semiconductor industry, perceiving every U.S. restriction as a reinforcement of the need for indigenous innovation rather than a viable compromise.</p>

Macron, speaking at a summit not attended by the U.S., Germany, or Italy, emphasized the need for a two-state solution where "Israel and Palestine side by side in peace and security." Israel views such recognition as rewarding Hamas, while the UN Secretary-General called the Gaza situation "morally, legally and politically intolerable," reinforcing the urgency for a resolution.</p>

Reality TV star and fitness coach Holly Hagan-Blyth shared her personal struggle with intimacy post-pregnancy, highlighting the crucial role of open communication with her husband to alleviate pressure and misunderstanding. Experts explain that physical healing, drastic hormonal shifts like drops in estrogen causing vaginal dryness, and the profound emotional transition to parenthood contribute to this change for both mothers and fathers. Therapists and childbirth charities emphasize honest dialogue and mutual understanding between partners as crucial steps to navigate these challenges and rebuild intimacy, stressing that dealing with these emotions is often not prioritized.</p>

          <p>New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has agreed to participate in an ABC town hall after the network reinstated Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani had initially withdrawn from the televised event in protest of ABC's decision to suspend Kimmel, which followed threats from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair over Kimmel's criticism of the Trump administration's response to Charlie Kirk's death. The suspension sparked widespread backlash concerning free speech and media independence, prompting boycotts and protests. Disney's decision to bring Kimmel back on air, following "days of thoughtful conversations," resolved the boycott. Mamdani emphasized the importance of standing up for free speech against perceived authoritarian pressures, calling it an attack on the city's artists and a threat to American rights.</p>

The incident began when the boy took the truck to his former school, knocking over several traffic cones. Fortunately, no one was injured during the dangerous event, and the boy was subsequently taken into custody on multiple felony charges, including assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer and reckless evasion. In California, 12 is the minimum age for criminal responsibility in juvenile court, and he is expected to be released to his parents, with probation officers to determine further action.</p>
