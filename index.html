            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 10:30:00 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have significantly lowered the reported death toll from a recent boat fire, attributing the initial higher figures to confusion. The tragedy occurred at the confluence of the Congo and Ruki rivers near Mbandaka, where a vessel carrying approximately 400 people caught fire. While initial reports suggested as many as 148 fatalities, the official count now stands at 33, with 195 survivors, including 22 burn victims receiving hospital care. The cause of the fire is believed to be cooking activities onboard, a common risk in a region where boat travel is prevalent due to limited infrastructure.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans detained in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, responding to an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The court's order prevents removals from the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice, ensuring detainees have the opportunity to argue their case in court. This decision follows concerns that the Trump administration was rapidly deporting individuals with alleged gang ties without due process, a practice previously challenged by federal judges in other states. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, questioning the court's jurisdiction and the factual basis for the emergency relief.</p>

            <p>Tom Homan, former Trump administration "Border Czar," defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, asserting that he posed a public safety threat as an alleged MS-13 member. Despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. for trial, Homan claimed the administration lacks the authority to bring him back, arguing he is under El Salvador's jurisdiction. Homan also criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, accusing him of prioritizing a gang member over the victims of MS-13 violence. Abrego Garcia's attorneys and family deny his gang affiliation, disputing the allegations in court.</p>

Recent reports from Walmart, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Paychex indicate a fundamentally healthy economy with solid momentum, strong business results, and a stable small business labor market, though continued monitoring of future earnings releases is advised.

            <p>The Justice Department is entering the final phase of its antitrust case against Google, arguing that the company illegally stifled competition by paying to be the default search engine on web browsers and phones. The government is proposing remedies such as halting third-party payments and potentially spinning off Chrome and Android. Google contends that these remedies are unwarranted and would harm consumers, while antitrust experts believe the case could reshape digital market regulation and impact tech innovation, particularly in areas like AI.</p>

            <p>The article suggests that China should strategically counter U.S. tariffs by requiring bilateral trade to be settled in renminbi, which would strengthen the currency and challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar. This move would force the U.S. to purchase large quantities of renminbi, increasing its demand and exchange rate. A stronger renminbi could also attract global investors to China, signaling strong economic fundamentals and potentially increasing capital inflows.</p>
