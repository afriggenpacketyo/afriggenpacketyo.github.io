          <p>Meta's stock price increased by 10% following the release of its second-quarter earnings, which surpassed revenue expectations. The company reported revenue of $47.52 billion against an anticipated $44.80 billion and provided a third-quarter sales forecast that also exceeded Wall Street estimates. While its Reality Labs division continues to operate at a loss, the deficit was smaller than predicted, and the company's family of apps saw growth in daily active users. The positive results come as Meta invests heavily in its "personal superintelligence" AI strategy, leading to increased expense outlooks for the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

Prosecutors presented evidence of Craig's incriminating internet searches, such as "how to make murder look like a heart attack." Craig was also convicted on several other charges, including soliciting an inmate to kill an investigator on his case. The defense had suggested the possibility of suicide, but the jury delivered a guilty verdict on all counts, resulting in an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas and five others were arrested for allegedly running an illegal high-stakes poker and gambling ring from a California mansion owned by Arenas. Federal prosecutors claim the operation took place between 2021 and 2022 and involved a suspected member of an Israeli organized crime group. Arenas faces charges of conspiracy, operating an illegal gambling business, and making false statements to investigators. This incident adds to a history of off-court issues for Arenas, who was previously suspended from the NBA for a firearm-related incident in 2010.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement, which would see the European Union import over $750 billion in US energy, primarily fossil fuels, over three years, has drawn sharp criticism from environmental organizations. Critics argue the deal locks Europe into long-term fossil fuel dependency, undermining the bloc's climate goals, including its Green Deal and 2050 carbon neutrality target. While the agreement aims to replace Russian energy sources with "more affordable" US liquefied natural gas (LNG), experts warn that LNG's production and transport emit more methane. Skepticism also exists regarding the EU's ability to fulfill the purchase pledge, as the European Commission cannot compel member states to buy US energy.</p>

Police report that a suspect entered the building, doused Vogler with a flammable liquid, and then ignited him outside. The suspect, identified as Shotsie Michael Buck Hayes, has been arrested and charged with attempted first-degree murder and aggravated malicious wounding. Investigators believe the attack was motivated by a "personal matter" and is not related to Vogler's political duties. Vogler is currently being treated at a burn center.</p>

          <p>Baltimore Orioles center fielder Cedric Mullins made a remarkable defensive play, robbing the Toronto Blue Jays of a potential home run during a recent game. Scaling the center field wall, Mullins reached over to snatch the ball just before it could clear the fence, a feat that is being hailed as a catch of the year candidate. This play comes just days after he made another home run-robbing catch and an impressive diving play. Despite his individual heroics, the Orioles ultimately lost the game to the Blue Jays 9-8 amid ongoing trade deadline activities for the team.</p>

Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated there is growing interest in options to break the "logjam," as Democrats have been using procedural tactics to slow down confirmations. The average time to confirm presidential nominees has significantly increased over recent administrations.

The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed Governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence.

This article explores the potential earnings of a $10,000 deposit in such an account, demonstrating how different annual percentage yields (APYs) can impact growth over time. For example, at a 4.30% APY, a $10,000 deposit could earn approximately $430 in one year. However, it is noted that these accounts have variable rates that can change with market conditions, unlike the fixed rates offered by certificates of deposit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to suspend the "de minimis" trade exemption for all countries, which previously allowed parcels valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. without tariffs. The White House stated the move closes a "catastrophic loophole" used to evade duties and import illicit goods. This global suspension follows a similar action in May that targeted imports from China and Hong Kong, impacting ultra-low-cost online retailers like Shein and Temu. The number of de minimis shipments has surged dramatically in recent years, with Customs now processing over 4 million such packages daily.</p>

          <p>An Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas has publicly criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to recognize a Palestinian state. The former hostage argued that the move "risks rewarding terror" and sends a dangerous message that violence earns legitimacy. She questioned whether such a move would have been considered for Nazi-occupied countries during World War II. Her statement echoes concerns from lawyers representing other British hostage families, who fear the UK's policy could disincentivize Hamas from agreeing to a ceasefire and releasing the remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) present more affordable borrowing options compared to high-rate personal loans or credit cards. As of late July 2025, average rates for home equity loans range from 8.25% to 8.40%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.26%. The article explains the difference between the two products: home equity loans provide a lump sum at a fixed rate, while HELOCs offer a variable-rate revolving line of credit. It also notes the potential for tax deductions if the funds are used for eligible home improvements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has revealed that the Army helicopter involved in the fatal mid-air collision over Washington D.C. had faulty altimeters. The investigation found the gauges showed the helicopter was flying 80 to 130 feet lower than its actual altitude, causing it to fly higher than permitted. The January 29 crash killed all 64 people on an American Airlines flight and the three crew members on the Black Hawk helicopter. The NTSB hearing is presenting findings but is not expected to determine the final cause of the crash until 2026.</p>

          <p>According to leading humanitarian organizations, the hunger crisis in Gaza has severely intensified, with a majority of malnutrition-related deaths in 2025 occurring in July. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warns that the "worst-case scenario of Famine is currently playing out," with half a million people facing starvation. The situation deteriorated sharply after a ceasefire ended in March, leading to significant disruptions in aid. While Israel has recently taken steps to allow more aid, humanitarian groups say the measures are insufficient and that distribution is hampered by logistical, security, and bureaucratic impediments.</p>

This move follows a directive from President Trump to release the testimony to address public interest in the case. The DOJ argued that releasing the material would provide information to the public while remaining sensitive to victims' rights.</p>

In Russia, the powerful quake caused flooding and some injuries but no major damage was initially reported.

          <p>President Trump has signed an order imposing a 50% tariff on all imported copper, effective immediately, in a move the White House says is aimed at boosting domestic industry. The surprise announcement caused U.S. copper prices to plummet in after-hours trading and sent shares of copper mining companies sharply lower. This action follows similar steep tariffs placed on steel and aluminum. Experts warn that the new duty could increase costs for a wide range of consumer and industrial products, as the U.S. imports nearly half of its copper. (not investment advice)</p>

While Danaher raised its full-year earnings guidance, it did not increase its revenue outlook, citing ongoing uncertainty, particularly in China.
