          <h2>Former Vice President Pence Calls for Release of Epstein Investigation Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 19:42:07 EDT</div>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly called for the Trump administration to release all records related to the investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein, emphasizing the need for transparency. Pence stressed that the names of victims must be protected and redacted from any public disclosure. His stance creates a notable contrast with President Trump, who has dismissed the renewed focus on the Epstein case as a politically motivated "hoax" and criticized supporters who have engaged with the story. Pence asserted that the matter transcends politics, as the investigation has spanned multiple presidential administrations.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has launched a new "everything app" called the Base App, which integrates a digital wallet, trading, payments, and social media functions onto its Base blockchain. The move aims to attract a broader consumer base beyond speculative crypto traders by creating a "super app" similar to WeChat. Key features include Base Account for identity verification and Base Pay, a one-click checkout system for USDC stablecoin payments developed with Shopify. The company hopes this will drive real-world utility for its network, particularly for content creators, and reduce its reliance on trading fee revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula was canceled after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck approximately 50 miles south of Sand Point. The quake initially triggered a tsunami warning, prompting evacuations in towns like Seward, but was later downgraded to an advisory as authorities determined large, widespread waves were not expected. The U.S. Coast Guard in Kodiak also evacuated personnel before standing down. Officials noted the quake occurred in shallow water, mitigating the risk of significant inundation. While some small sea level changes were possible, there was no danger to Anchorage, the state's most populous city.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid has revealed he is no longer on speaking terms with his former teammate, James Harden, following Harden's contentious departure from the team. In an interview, Embiid expressed his hurt, suggesting that Harden may believe he was involved in the front office's decision not to offer Harden a max contract. The duo was highly effective on the court, with Embiid winning an MVP and Harden leading the league in assists during their time together. The fallout began when Harden became publicly disgruntled with team president Daryl Morey, leading to a trade request and his eventual move to the Los Angeles Clippers.</p>

          <p>The average cost for parents in Britain to cover the six-week school summer holiday with childcare clubs has risen to £1,076 per child, according to the charity Coram. Prices have increased regionally, with some areas seeing hikes as high as 13% from last year, driven by high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run programs. Many families struggle with the upfront costs, as government benefits like Universal Credit are paid in arrears. The report also highlights a significant lack of available places for older children and those with special educational needs, adding to the financial and logistical strain on working parents.</p>

          <p>Thousands of flat owners in the United Kingdom are planning a class-action lawsuit against large freehold companies, alleging they were charged for secret commissions on building insurance policies. Lawyers claim that freeholders received these commissions from insurers and then passed the inflated costs to leaseholders through service charges without their knowledge. The legal action seeks compensation that could amount to £2,000 per flat owner. This issue has gained prominence as insurance costs for apartment blocks have soared since the Grenfell Tower fire, potentially allowing property owners to profit from the disaster through percentage-based commissions.</p>

The note outlines several chaotic scenarios, including Powell attempting to remain in his post while litigation proceeds. This analysis follows reports that Trump considered the firing, a move former Treasury official Roger Altman called a "dreadful idea" that would undermine the central bank's crucial independence.

The stalemate raises doubts about the House GOP's ability to unify on crypto policy and the extent of President Trump's influence over his party's members.

Millions of dollars for the library are reportedly coming from legal settlements and leftover inaugural funds, with little public visibility into the donors.

          <p>Crystal Palace has been demoted from the Europa League to the lower-tier Conference League after UEFA ruled the club breached its multi-club ownership regulations. The issue stems from American businessman John Textor's ownership stake in both Palace and French club Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. A group of Liberal Democrat MPs has written to the UK's culture secretary, calling the decision "disgraceful" and "disproportionately punitive." They argue the process has been opaque and undermines the club's historic achievement of winning the FA Cup to qualify for the European competition in the first place.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Reversal on Epstein Narrative Creates Rift with MAGA Base</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump is losing control of the narrative surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, a story he and his allies helped amplify. After years of fueling conspiracy theories, Trump's recent dismissal of the matter as a "hoax" and his disavowal of supporters fixated on it has caused a significant rift within his base. The Epstein saga is uniquely potent because it combines known facts with a central mystery—the alleged client list—that appeals to a broad audience beyond hardcore conspiracists. The administration's abrupt reversal and contradictory statements have only fueled more suspicion, creating a political firestorm that Trump appears unable to extinguish or control.</p>

          <p>Germany has committed to passing new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants to the United Kingdom. The new law will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to the UK, closing a loophole that existed because the UK is outside the European Union. This change is expected to help German authorities target warehouses and facilities used to store small boats intended for Channel crossings. The announcement was part of a broader new agreement between the UK and Germany covering migration, business, and defense, signed during German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's visit to the UK.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the annual Festival Chapín de Los Angeles, a major Guatemalan cultural event, have postponed the festival due to widespread community fear over recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities. The event, which typically draws 80,000 people, was moved from August to October to ensure the safety of attendees, vendors, and staff. This follows the cancellation or postponement of several other community events in the Los Angeles area for similar reasons. The decision comes as a federal judge issued a temporary injunction to restrict aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, though the Trump administration is appealing the ruling.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have observed the earliest moments of planet formation around a sun-like baby star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using NASA's Webb Space Telescope and other observatories, scientists detected minerals like silicon monoxide just beginning to crystallize from gas and dust, a process that mirrors how our own solar system began. This discovery provides an unprecedented glimpse into the initial stages of planetary construction, watching the "seeds of the planets" take shape. Researchers believe this finding will help them identify other budding solar systems and better understand the dawn of our own.</p>

          <p>Nebraska lawmakers have narrowly failed to lift a state ban that prohibits individuals with drug convictions from receiving government food assistance. The policy is a remnant of the "war on drugs" era, and while many states have since repealed such restrictions, Nebraska will continue to enforce its ban. The legislative effort to do away with the rule fell just short of the votes needed to pass. This means that access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will remain restricted for a segment of the population based on past criminal convictions for drug-related offenses.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has scheduled an October 16 execution date for death row inmate Robert Roberson, who was convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter in 2002. Roberson's conviction was based on what was then known as shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that has since faced significant scientific and medical challenges. His legal team argues that new evidence from pathologists indicates the child's death was a tragic accident, not a crime, and that no rational juror would convict him today. Despite these appeals and support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers, the state is moving forward with the execution.</p>

          <p>Authorities in California have taken more than 20 children into protective custody while investigating a Los Angeles-area couple who are their legal parents, primarily through surrogacy. The investigation began after an infant in the couple's care was hospitalized with a traumatic head injury, allegedly caused by a nanny. As authorities investigated, they discovered the large number of children, ranging from two months to 13 years old. Some of the surrogate mothers have come forward, claiming they were misled and unaware the couple was using multiple surrogates simultaneously. The FBI is now involved in the complex case.</p>

Issues include claims filed past the deadline, duplicate filings, or cases involving religious orders not under the archdiocese's direct authority. If these claims are disqualified, it would significantly alter the dynamics of the settlement vote, potentially making it easier for a dissenting group of victims' attorneys to block the deal. The proposed settlement involves a trust of at least $180 million, but its approval hinges on a two-thirds vote from all eligible claimants.</p>

Initially, Trump distanced himself, claiming he "wasn't a fan," but later suggested Epstein may have been killed in prison. On the campaign trail, he pledged to declassify and release the Epstein files. Now, facing backlash from his own supporters, Trump has reversed course, dismissing the entire matter as a "Democratic hoax" and admonishing his base for their continued interest in a story he now calls "boring."</p>

The method involves transferring the nuclear DNA from the parents' embryo into a donor embryo that has healthy mitochondria, effectively eliminating the risk of passing on the often-fatal conditions. The children, all born at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, are reported to be healthy and developing normally. This landmark achievement offers hope to families affected by these incurable genetic disorders and confirms the viability of the controversial but legal procedure.</p>

The president has frequently and publicly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates faster, calling him a "knucklehead." While the president can legally remove a Fed governor "for cause," this is typically understood to mean serious misconduct, not policy disagreements.
