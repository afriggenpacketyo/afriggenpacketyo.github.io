          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has warned that a prolonged federal government shutdown could negatively affect the airline's bookings as public confidence wanes. While the shutdown has not yet impacted business, Kirby noted that continued uncertainty discourages travel planning. The impasse, which began October 1, has also raised concerns about staffing shortages among essential personnel like air traffic controllers, potentially disrupting flights. Delta Air Lines' CEO issued a similar warning, highlighting the growing economic risks the shutdown poses to the airline industry.</p>

          <p>Beijing has accused the United States of intentionally creating panic by exaggerating the impact of China's new controls on rare earth mineral exports. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce stated that the U.S. interpretation seriously distorts the measures, while also indicating that China is open to trade talks to resolve the escalating dispute. The controls were announced ahead of a potential meeting between the two nations' presidents, as the U.S. works to establish a domestic rare earth supply chain to reduce its dependency on China.</p>

This vote on a standalone Pentagon funding bill represented an alternative strategy by Republican leadership after a broader bill to fund the entire government also failed.

However, the report also revealed that interest payments on the national debt reached an unprecedented high of over $1.2 trillion for the year.

          <p>Two men from Trinidad and Tobago have been identified by family members as being among those killed in a recent U.S. airstrike on a boat in international waters off the coast of Venezuela. The Trump administration claimed the vessel was trafficking narcotics and associated with "narcoterrorist networks," a claim the family of one victim disputes. The incident, which killed at least six people, is part of an expanded U.S. mission in the Caribbean that has heightened fears among local fishermen and drawn criticism from some regional leaders.</p>

After Avila's passing in July at age 48, his family has stepped in to ensure the project, which now serves around 20,000 people annually, continues its vital outreach work.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines Colorado Governor Jared Polis as a rare Democrat who aligns with parts of the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda championed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Polis has supported Kennedy on issues like banning soda purchases with food stamps, reflecting an eclectic political ideology that blends libertarianism with progressive and populist stances. However, Polis distances himself from Kennedy's anti-vaccine positions, recently signing an order to ensure vaccine access and joining a public-health alliance to counter the health secretary's policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Guillermo del Toro's new adaptation of "Frankenstein" is being hailed as a career-best, reframing the 19th-century story as a critique of modern tech-industry arrogance. The film stars Oscar Isaac as a brilliant but egocentric Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his handsome, android-like Creature. Del Toro's version emphasizes the creator's moral culpability, portraying him as an emotionally stunted man-child enabled by a venture capitalist, played by Christoph Waltz. The review praises the film's stunning production design, powerful performances, and its timely warning about the dangers of unchecked innovation.</p>

Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), stated the effort targets views that are "beyond the pale," such as supporting foreign terrorist ideologies or the violent overthrow of the country. While Edlow insisted this would not penalize constitutionally protected speech, critics argue the policy could be used to punish noncitizens for their political expression.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance for individuals being sued over unpaid credit card debt, explaining that hiring a lawyer is not always necessary. For straightforward cases with undisputed debt, individuals can respond to the lawsuit themselves to avoid a default judgment, which could lead to wage garnishment. Options for resolving the suit without a court trial include negotiating a settlement or payment plan directly with the creditor, seeking assistance from a credit counseling agency, or, in cases of overwhelming debt, filing for bankruptcy to halt legal action.</p>

          <p>The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has ruled that pets transported in an aircraft's hold are legally considered "baggage," not passengers, for the purpose of airline liability. The judgment came in a case where a Spanish woman sought non-material damages after her dog was lost by an airline. The court found that compensation for the loss of a pet is subject to the same liability limits as lost luggage under the Montreal Convention, unless a special declaration of interest was made and an additional fee was paid beforehand.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic explores the growing convergence of real relationships and one-sided parasocial relationships in the digital age. As social media platforms pivot from connection to content consumption, interactions with friends and family are increasingly flattened into a passive stream of media, similar to how one follows celebrities. This shift, combined with the rise of group chats and voice notes, can reduce the expectation of reciprocity, making real relationships feel more like performances for an audience. Researchers suggest this may rewire how we perceive and engage with our social connections.</p>

The article contends that the tariffs create investment paralysis due to uncertainty and disrupt global supply chains, ultimately functioning as a tax on Americans that slows growth and increases economic risks.
