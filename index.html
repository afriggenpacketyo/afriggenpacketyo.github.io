          <p>Ukraine has lost an F-16 fighter jet and its pilot, Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, while repelling one of the largest Russian air attacks of the war. According to Ukraine's air force, the pilot successfully shot down seven targets before his aircraft was damaged, and he guided the plane away from residential areas, leaving no time to eject. The massive overnight assault involved nearly 540 Russian drones and missiles targeting multiple regions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ordered an investigation into the pilot's death and reiterated the urgent need for more advanced air defense systems to protect the country.</p>

          <p>Iran's judiciary has announced that an Israeli airstrike on Tehran's Evin prison killed at least 71 people, including prisoners, staff, and visitors. The notorious political prison holds numerous high-profile inmates, including Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi. This event is part of a wider escalation in the region, with Israel also issuing new evacuation orders for northern Gaza as it intensifies its military operations there. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts continue, with Qatar seeing a potential 'window of opportunity' for a Gaza truce following the recent ceasefire between Israel and Iran, though tensions remain extremely high across the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The Northern Irish rap group Kneecap delivered a politically charged performance at the Glastonbury Festival, defying criticism from UK politicians and the ongoing legal troubles of one of its members. Rapper Mo Chara, who faces a terrorism charge, appeared on stage as the band led pro-Palestinian chants and criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The trio is known for its anarchic energy and use of Irish republican symbolism, and their set drew a large, supportive crowd waving Palestinian flags. The performance highlighted the ongoing intersection of music, free speech, and contentious political issues at the world-famous festival.</p>

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran could restart enriching uranium for a potential bomb within a matter of months. His assessment suggests that recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities caused significant but not total damage, contradicting claims that the program was completely destroyed. Grossi emphasized that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to resume its nuclear activities if it chooses to do so. This development comes as Iran's parliament has moved to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, further complicating diplomatic efforts to find a long-term solution.</p>

          <p>The recent murder of a 17-year-old TikTok star in Pakistan has renewed focus on the severe dangers women face in digital spaces within the country. The article explores how online visibility and self-expression for women often lead to threats, privacy violations, and real-world violence, rooted in deep-seated patriarchal norms. Through interviews with female content creators, it reveals a pattern of online stalking, harassment, and death threats, which social media platforms often fail to adequately address. The issue highlights a systemic problem where women who challenge traditional values are targeted, making their online presence a perilous act of defiance.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 81 Palestinians and injured over 400, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. One notable incident involved a strike near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City, which was being used as a shelter for displaced people, killing at least 11 individuals, including children. This ongoing violence occurs as mediators from Qatar and the US intensify efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. The stark contrast between the deadly attacks on civilian areas and the diplomatic negotiations highlights the immense difficulty in achieving a lasting peace in the region.</p>

          <p>After a six-year legal process, Samuel Woodward has been convicted of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of his former classmate, Blaze Bernstein. The prosecution successfully argued that Woodward, a member of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, targeted and killed Bernstein because he was gay and Jewish. The defense conceded that Woodward killed Bernstein but claimed it was an impulsive act of manslaughter provoked by an unwanted sexual advance, an argument the jury rejected. Woodward now faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, concluding a long and painful journey for the victim's family.</p>

This move is part of a broader push for European technological sovereignty in the growing space race. However, industry experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near future. They point to significant hurdles, including Starlink's massive lead in satellite constellation size, launch capacity, and manufacturing throughput, suggesting Eutelsat is better positioned for niche sovereign and enterprise markets rather than the mass consumer market.

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, bringing a close to the vehicle's distinguished 24-year career as a cornerstone of the nation's space program. The H2A series, developed jointly by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), has been a reliable workhorse for numerous missions. This final launch marks a significant transition, as Japan's space efforts will now be led by the new, more cost-effective H3 rocket. The event celebrates a long history of success while paving the way for the next generation of Japanese space exploration.</p>

          <p>In response to the perceived threat from Russia, five Eastern European NATO countries have announced their intention to withdraw from the Ottawa Convention, a treaty banning anti-personnel land mines. The nationsâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”plan to produce and potentially deploy mines along their borders with Russia and Belarus as a powerful deterrent. This strategy aims to create a new 'Iron Curtain' to inflict heavy losses on any potential aggressor. However, the move is highly controversial, sparking concerns from humanitarian groups about the long-term danger to civilians and the immense cost and difficulty of future demining operations.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a comprehensive new smoking ban that extends to all public beaches, parks, and areas near schools, libraries, and swimming pools. The rules, which went into effect on Sunday, are a key part of the government's national plan to combat tobacco use. The primary goals are to protect the public, especially children, from the dangers of passive smoking and to help create a "tobacco-free generation" by the year 2032. The ban does not apply to e-cigarettes or the outdoor terraces of bars and restaurants, but violators could face significant fines.</p>

According to officials interviewed, these local measures can be even stricter than the central government's regulations, creating a climate of caution. This phenomenon, described as "adding extra layer upon layer of control," reflects the immense pressure on public officials to avoid any appearance of impropriety. The trend shows how top-down political directives are being intensely amplified at the local level, impacting daily social behaviors and the local economy.</p>
