          <h2>Post Office Entangled in Costly Horizon Contract Despite System Flaws</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 00:46:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Post Office has spent over £600 million to continue using the flawed Horizon IT system due to the terms of its original 1999 deal with Fujitsu. Despite wanting to switch suppliers since 2012, the Post Office did not own the software's core code, preventing them from inspecting transaction processes and forcing reliance on Fujitsu's assurances. This reliance led to the wrongful prosecution of about 700 sub-postmasters for theft, fraud, and false accounting based on Horizon's reported shortfalls, and highlights the long-term consequences of the initial contract's intellectual property terms.</p>

          <p>Terry Branstad, former US ambassador to China, suggested that the US might reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to facilitate renewed trade talks. Branstad emphasized the need for reciprocal action from China to reach a deal, predicting movement within the next year. His comments follow reports that the White House is considering cutting tariffs by more than half on non-strategic Chinese goods. Most countries, including many US allies, saw a 90-day pause in Trump’s tariffs introduced on April 2, but the duties imposed on China were kept in place.</p>

          <p>Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, reportedly had an unsecured internet connection installed in his Pentagon office to bypass security protocols and use the Signal messaging app on a personal computer.
