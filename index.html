The individuals taken into custody face charges ranging from gang membership and illegal re-entry to felony sexual assault and drug distribution. One individual, Carlos Torres Valdovinos, was removed to Mexico on Sunday, while the others remain in custody pending removal proceedings.

          <p>Twenty companies have applied to purchase a total of 110,000 tons of the Japanese government's stockpiled rice following revisions to the scheme aimed at curbing soaring prices. This amount represents over 30% of the 300,000 tons slated for release through direct sales contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi indicated that contracts would be finalized quickly, with deliveries potentially starting soon. The move comes as supermarket rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, despite previous government efforts to lower costs.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to brand damage linked to Elon Musk's political activities and growing competition. Despite an overall increase in battery electric car sales in Europe, Tesla sold only 7,261 cars, marking a nearly 40% year-on-year decline over the first four months of the year. The company faces challenges from traditional automakers and aggressive Chinese players like BYD, which outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time. European consumers are also showing a preference for hybrid electric vehicles, a segment in which Tesla does not compete.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved a $6.3 billion spending package to mitigate the economic impact of tariffs imposed by the United States. The funds will support small and medium-sized businesses and subsidize household energy costs. This action underscores the precarious position of the Japanese government ahead of an upper house election, as it manages an economic slowdown and public concerns over rising consumer prices and government debt. President Trump has paused a 24 percent tariff on Japanese goods until July, but the automotive sector is already suffering from a 25 percent U.S. tariff on finished automobiles and car parts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study by Chinese scientists has revived the long-dismissed evolutionary theory of Lamarckism, demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without DNA changes. The research, published in Cell, showed that rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on a tolerance to low temperatures across multiple generations through DNA methylation changes. This challenges the core principles of Darwinism, which emphasize random genetic mutations as the primary driver of evolution. The study suggests that environmentally induced epigenetic variations can contribute to the inheritance of acquired characteristics, positioning Lamarckism as a significant factor in evolution.</p>

          <p>The diamond industry faces multiple challenges, including potential tariffs, a slowdown in luxury demand, and the rise of lab-grown diamonds (LGDs). A baseline 10% import duty to the U.S. market, which accounts for over half of global demand, adds pressure to the industry. LGDs, chemically identical to mined diamonds, are selling at an 80% discount, disrupting the market. Despite these challenges, some analysts believe the industry is nearing a point of stabilization between LGDs and mined diamonds, with key players like De Beers doubling down on natural diamonds.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales have plummeted by 52% in April, according to a trade group, with only 5,475 cars sold. This decline contrasts with the growing demand for electric cars in Europe, and Tesla's sales have decreased by 46.1% in the first four months of the year compared to the same period last year. Chinese manufacturer BYD has surpassed Tesla as the leading choice for Europeans looking to buy pure electric cars. Some experts attribute Tesla's decline to a slow rollout of the latest Model Y and Elon Musk's involvement in US President Donald Trump's administration.</p>

          <p>Legal obstacles are hindering the establishment of a regular mechanism for organ donation between Hong Kong and mainland China, despite discussions beginning in 2022. According to Wang Haibo, director of the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS), revisions to mainland laws, particularly those related to HIV regulation and the ban on cross-border organ transfers, are necessary. The COTRS is a national system that allocates organs for transplants throughout the country, and the specific law impeding the mechanism aims to prevent the spread of HIV.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to spread soil collected from near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on the grounds of the prime minister's office and other government buildings to demonstrate its safety. This initiative aims to dispel concerns about the soil, which retains low-level radioactivity, and promote its use in public works projects across Japan. The soil will be used in flowerbeds and for other purposes on government office grounds, marking the first time it has been repurposed outside Fukushima Prefecture. However, previous attempts to use the soil in other areas have faced local opposition.</p>
