          <p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei appeared in public for the first time since the recent 12-day war with Israel, attending a mourning ceremony without making a statement. During the conflict, Khamenei had been in seclusion, and his reappearance follows a fragile cease-fire. Despite U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, experts believe the regime remains committed to its nuclear program, with questions persisting about the extent of the damage and Tehran's next steps.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel's war in Gaza is causing a collapse of the international rules-based order, with significant implications for global and domestic politics. The author highlights the case of a Palestinian American student at Virginia Commonwealth University whose degree is being withheld for activism, illustrating how free speech is being suppressed. The piece contends that the West's failure to hold Israel accountable for its actions is shifting the boundaries of acceptable state behavior, threatening legal and political norms established over decades.</p>

          <p>Despite rising geopolitical and trade tensions at the national level, many local government officials in the United States remain receptive to Chinese investment. According to the China General Chamber of Commerce in Chicago, city leaders are keen to attract Chinese-funded projects, particularly in manufacturing, to stimulate local economies. This sentiment persists even as President Trump's tariffs have created an incentive for Chinese companies to establish production facilities within the U.S. to serve the domestic market directly.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its influence in the Western Balkans through a strategy of "infrastructure imperialism," which includes funding major projects like the Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania. This soft power projection is intertwined with Turkey's economic, political, and military interests, positioning itself as a regional power and heir to the Ottoman Empire. President Erdoğan's approach uses historical and cultural ties to foster a "common destiny," with Turkish companies leading construction on everything from mosques to railroads, extending Ankara's geopolitical reach.</p>

          <p>A new biography titled "Mark Twain" by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow delves into the life and complexities of Samuel Langhorne Clemens. An excerpt from the book recounts Twain's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, a journey he undertook to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." The passage captures his nostalgic and bittersweet reflections on his time as a riverboat pilot, a profession he cherished for the sense of freedom it provided, and contrasts it with his later life as a world-renowned but more constrained literary figure.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Republican Loyalty Tested by Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill'</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite independent analysis suggesting President Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' (BBB) will increase the deficit and disproportionately harm the poor, it faced minimal opposition from Republicans in Congress. The article notes that only five GOP members voted against the act, which is a mix of tax cuts, ideological spending, and handouts, fewer than opposed any of Trump's first-term budgets. This high level of party discipline highlights the political risk for Republicans who consider crossing the former president, even on highly contentious fiscal legislation.

          <p>Reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the G8 summit at Gleneagles, this opinion piece laments the decline in global commitment to international development and poverty reduction. The 2005 summit led to historic promises on aid and debt relief, but the author argues that the current global landscape is vastly different, fractured by economic crises, geopolitical tensions, and rising nationalism. The article criticizes the UK Labour government for slashing the aid budget and suggests that the political will for bold, collaborative action on global poverty has significantly eroded.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has officially signed Spanish international midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a deal worth nearly £60 million.

Zubimendi was a key member of the Spanish team that won Euro 2024 and reportedly chose Arsenal over an approach from Liverpool last year, drawn by the prospect of working with manager Mikel Arteta, who is also from the Basque city of San Sebastian.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that ranked-choice voting (RCV) was a major factor in Zohran Mamdani's surprising victory in the New York City mayoral primary. The author contends that RCV allowed a slate of progressive candidates to run without splitting the vote, giving a long-shot candidate like Mamdani time to build a coalition and momentum. The system fostered a more positive, issue-focused campaign and led to historic turnout, demonstrating how RCV can empower voters and change electoral dynamics by rewarding broad appeal over narrow, divisive tactics.</p>

          <p>Right-wing influencer Laura Loomer has emerged as a surprisingly powerful, if unofficial, adviser on national security in the second Trump administration. Despite holding no government position, she has had direct access to the president and has reportedly influenced the dismissal of several National Security Council staffers and even the director of the NSA. This article profiles Loomer's rise and her polarizing role, noting how she has pushed for ideological purges while championing Trump's recent strike on Iran, demonstrating the primacy of personal loyalty within the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that despite its economic power and diplomatic efforts, China is not ready to be a major political or security player in the Middle East. The recent Iran-Israel conflict highlighted Beijing's limitations, as it was unable to play a significant mediating role. While China is a key economic partner for countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia, its reluctance to form military alliances and its inability to project power in the region mean that the United States remains the indispensable power for security and diplomacy, a fact regional leaders still acknowledge.</p>

This analysis details how Kennedy is reviving discredited theories, particularly the link between vaccines and autism, while dismissing decades of genetic research. His use of what critics call outdated and stigmatizing "tragedy framing" to describe autism has offended many advocates and parents. There are also growing fears that a new government plan to create a vast, non-transparent autism data platform could violate privacy and lead to further stigmatization.</p>

It discusses how Black artists like Beyoncé are increasingly reclaiming the flag and its red, white, and blue imagery, reframing it as a symbol of their heritage and their ancestors' contributions to building the nation. This reclamation is happening as the definition of Blackness in America expands and as younger generations, further removed from the Jim Crow era, assert their claim to the country and its iconography.</p>

Despite its discredited link to autism and its removal from most childhood vaccines since 2001, the new recommendation by a committee revamped by Health Secretary Robert F.

          <p>The UK Labour government's recent reversal on a package of welfare reforms has made future spending decisions, including the potential removal of the two-child benefit cap, more difficult, according to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. A rebellion by Labour MPs forced the government to water down the reforms, losing or delaying an estimated £5 billion in annual savings. While a government taskforce is examining the benefit cap, which affects 1.6 million children, the Chancellor has indicated the lost savings will constrain future policy choices.
