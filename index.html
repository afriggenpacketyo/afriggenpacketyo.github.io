          <p>Eight OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, will increase their collective oil output by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This hike is larger than the previously anticipated 411,000 barrels per day and is part of a strategy to gradually unwind voluntary production cuts. The decision was attributed to a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories. This move continues the alliance's phased rollback of supply reductions implemented earlier to support prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Doctors are examining the common belief that drinking soda, particularly Coke, can relieve migraines. Experts suggest that caffeine is the key ingredient, as it can constrict blood vessels and disrupt nerve activity, providing temporary relief for some individuals. However, they caution that caffeine can also be a migraine trigger for others and that excessive consumption can worsen the situation long-term. Health professionals recommend healthier alternatives like water with electrolytes, magnesium, or organic coffee for managing headaches, rather than relying on sugary drinks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article profiles Reverend William Barber and his revived Poor People's Campaign, a national movement using nonviolent protest to challenge poverty and systemic injustice. Rooted in a "fusion movement" that unites diverse groups, the campaign confronts what Barber calls "policy murder"—legislative cuts to social services like Medicaid and food assistance. The movement draws on a tradition of moral and religious protest to force a public reckoning with inequality, viewing current political issues as symptoms of a deeper national moral failing. It aims to build a moral witness against injustice, regardless of immediate political outcomes.</p>

However, late payments or accumulating too much debt through services like Affirm and Klarna could negatively affect scores. While the change aims to provide lenders with a more accurate financial picture, it raises concerns for sub-prime borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation has uncovered the Old Glory Club (OGC), a network of at least 26 far-right, men-only clubs operating across 20 U.S. states. The group, which includes military personnel, lawyers, and civil servants, promotes racist and antisemitic ideologies through podcasts, conferences, and online platforms. Key members advocate for a decentralized network to build offline social connections and political influence, aiming to create "anti-fragility" against a state they perceive as hostile. Experts express alarm, viewing the OGC as a new breed of extremist organization that poses a potential national security threat.</p>

          <p>Michigan's tart cherry industry, which produces 75% of the U.S. crop, is facing severe threats that jeopardize its future. Farmers are grappling with climate change, which causes volatile weather like late spring frosts and unusual wind patterns that damage buds and drastically reduce harvests. Additional pressures include rising land prices due to development, labor shortages, and the economic impact of tariffs. These challenges create a precarious situation for the multigenerational family farms that are central to the state's specialty crop industry and agrotourism.</p>

Hundreds of people have been evacuated, many by helicopter, but about 23 to 25 campers from Camp Mystic remain unaccounted for.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that the U.S. approach to the recent air strikes in Iran reflects a long-standing and flawed overconfidence in American air power. President Trump's declaration of a swift, total victory after a single night of bombing is seen as undermining a more methodical Israeli campaign and ignoring the complexities of achieving strategic goals. The article contrasts this with the more inventive and urgent military strategies of smaller countries like Ukraine. It suggests that the U.S. military's immense power has created a destructive luxury of not having to think deeply about how to actually win wars.</p>

The author argues that despite the acquittal on the most serious charges, the trial was not a victory, as Combs's own defense team admitted to his history of domestic abuse against his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. The piece critiques the defense's strategy of portraying the events as mere kink and suggests the verdict should not obscure the undisputed evidence of violence. The outcome is presented as a demoralizing example of how celebrity and power can influence justice.</p>

Iranian officials have asserted their national pride in the program and their ability to rebuild, while also limiting international inspectors' access.

          <p>Democrats are framing President Trump's major tax and spending bill as a key vulnerability for Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. They are focusing their message on the nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which they label as cruel and the largest healthcare cut in U.S. history. While Republicans argue the bill is about economic growth, polling shows the legislation is unpopular, and Democrats hope to leverage public support for Medicaid to their advantage. However, Democrats face their own challenges with low approval ratings for their performance in Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes showcased the blockchain's increasing integration into mainstream finance, with major players like Robinhood, Deutsche Bank, and BlackRock building on its infrastructure. Robinhood announced the launch of tokenized U.S. stocks on an Ethereum-based network, while other institutions are developing platforms for tokenized funds and assets. Despite price volatility, institutions are reportedly choosing Ethereum for its stability, security, and dependability as a settlement layer for the growing tokenized economy. The trend signals a shift from speculative hype to utility-driven adoption. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's plan to host a UFC event at the White House is more than a spectacle; it is a form of authoritarian theatre. The author draws parallels between Trump's use of the UFC and historical fascist regimes' use of sport to project strength, masculinity, and nationalism. The longstanding relationship between Trump and UFC CEO Dana White has allowed the promotion to become a stage for MAGA mythology, reinforcing a brand of confrontational politics. The event is framed as the climax of this partnership and a symbol of an administration that celebrates violence and a cult of personality.</p>

          <p>In a significant milestone for the solar industry, China has launched a large-scale floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao. The project, developed by state-owned Sinopec, is part of a larger initiative that will form the country's biggest offshore photovoltaic power generation project. The two combined projects are expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, significantly reducing carbon emissions. By placing the solar panels on the ocean's surface, their proximity to the water is expected to boost energy generation efficiency by up to 8 percent.</p>

          <p>Competitive eating icon Joey Chestnut has reclaimed his title at the Nathan's Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest, proving his dominance in the sport. Chestnut had been previously banned from the event due to a sponsorship deal with a rival plant-based hot dog brand, making his return a story of legacy and redemption. The article delves into the bizarre and physically demanding world of elite competitive eating, highlighting Chestnut's intense training regimen, which includes neck exercises and yoga. It reflects on the event as a uniquely American spectacle of excess, passion, and bewildering honesty.</p>

          <p>Two recent studies offer conflicting views on whether people from different cultures perceive visual illusions differently. One study found that people in Western, "carpentered" environments tend to see rectangles in the Coffer illusion, while rural Namibians see circles. However, another study convincingly dismantles the "carpentered world" hypothesis for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion, showing it affects non-human animals and even people blind from birth. The author suggests that while perceptual diversity is real, its causes are complex and not easily explained by simple cultural stereotypes, highlighting the need for more research into both between-group and within-group differences.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has officially reopened sections of the Seine River for public swimming. The city has established three supervised outdoor pool zones, complete with lifeguards and amenities, as a legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics. Swimming in the Seine was banned in 1923 due to severe pollution. A massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort, including a new underground wastewater storage tank, was undertaken to improve water quality for the Olympic events and for public use, marking a major milestone in the city's efforts to enhance quality of life and adapt to climate change.</p>

          <p>The 90-day pause on President Trump's sweeping "liberation day" tariffs is nearing its end, putting the U.S. on the brink of another trade assault against dozens of countries. While the administration has secured a few narrow agreements, the promised "90 deals in 90 days" have not materialized. This raises fresh concerns among business leaders and economists about the impact on inflation and consumer prices, as companies are already absorbing costs from existing tariffs. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has noted that tariff costs will ultimately be passed on to consumers, creating economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
