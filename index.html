          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed delegates at the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, emphasizing the critical state of the world's oceans due to issues like collapsing fish stocks, rising sea levels, and plastic pollution. The High Seas Treaty, adopted in 2023, aims to protect roughly two-thirds of the world's oceans by allowing countries to establish protected marine areas in international waters, requiring ratification by at least 60 countries to take effect. French President Emmanuel Macron highlighted that 50 countries have ratified the treaty, with 15 more promising to do so, while Guterres cautioned against deep-sea mining, warning it could turn the seabed into a "wild west," and Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva criticized the "predatory race" for critical minerals on the ocean floor. The article highlights the importance of the treaty for marine conservation and the need for substantial investment in ocean health. The article also touches on the absence of a US delegation at the conference, investment needs, and actions taken by small island nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, stemming from Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on the set of "It Ends With Us." Lively had filed a lawsuit against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios, claiming she was sexually harassed and faced retaliation, also detailing the allegations in a New York Times article. Baldoni then sued Lively, Ryan Reynolds, their publicist, and the New York Times, alleging they aimed to ruin his career with false allegations. The judge ruled that Baldoni had not adequately proven extortion or defamation, and that the New York Times did not act with malice. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies: Streaming and Studios, and Global Networks, the latter of which will house TNT Sports. The move raises questions about the future of live sports currently held by TNT, such as NCAA's March Madness, the French Open, and NASCAR. CEO David Zaslav indicated that U.S. sports haven't been a major driver for HBO Max sign-ups, suggesting TNT Sports might separate from the streaming service. Gunnar Wiedenfels, the future CEO of Global Networks, will decide how to monetize TNT's streaming and digital sports rights, including potential licensing deals or a merger with another entity. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that it would be a "great thing" if border czar Tom Homan arrested California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. This comment came before Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced they would sue Trump for deploying the National Guard to address protests over those enforcement actions. Newsom responded by accusing Trump of authoritarianism, while Trump labeled the protesters as "professional agitators" and "insurrectionists." The legal battle and political tensions are escalating between the state and federal governments.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's Attorney General Gentner Drummond announced that the state will retry Richard Glossip for the 1997 murder of Barry Van Treese, after the Supreme Court granted Glossip a new trial. However, the state will not seek the death penalty, instead pursuing a life sentence, because Justin Sneed, who confessed to the murder and implicated Glossip, is already serving a life sentence without parole. The Supreme Court had previously ruled that Glossip's due process rights were violated due to undisclosed information about Sneed's mental health treatment. Drummond stated his office will ensure Glossip receives a fair trial based on facts and evidence, acknowledging the misconduct of previous prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves' decision to reinstate the winter fuel payment for over three-quarters of pensioners in England and Wales, specifically those with an annual income of £35,000 or less, has elicited varied reactions. Some pensioners, like Bob Pritchard, express relief as the payment helps cover essential expenses like hospital travel, while others, such as Alice George, believe the money should be directed towards initiatives like the NHS or tackling the housing crisis. Ian Bryant supports the decision despite not being eligible himself, while Gail Impey, whose income slightly exceeds the threshold, laments missing out on the payment after struggling to afford heating last winter. Mike Hodges suggests lowering the income threshold to allocate funds to initiatives for younger people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to federalize 2,000 members of the California National Guard to address protests against federal immigration authorities is a concerning signal of using the military against demonstrators. This action raises legal questions under federal law, particularly regarding the president's authority to federalize a state's National Guard and use the military domestically. The protests do not appear to meet the criteria of a "rebellion against the authority of the Government," as defined by the relevant statute. The readiness to invoke this authority is alarming, as it suggests a willingness to suppress demonstrations, and the protests in Los Angeles do not warrant the federalization of the National Guard.</p>

          <p>The White House stated that President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles was intended as a deterrent to violence amid protests. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the decision followed a tense phone call with Governor Newsom and increasing violence, including assaults on federal law enforcement. Leavitt suggested that Newsom and Mayor Bass have "handicapped" the LAPD, while Trump has suggested political leaders could face arrest for obstructive behavior. The White House is keeping all options on the table, including invoking the Insurrection Act, to restore law and order.</p>
