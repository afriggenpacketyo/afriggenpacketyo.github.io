          <p>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was seen jogging at the Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where she is serving an 11-year sentence for fraud. This is the same minimum-security facility where Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, was recently transferred. The reason for Maxwell's transfer from Florida remains unclear, but it follows meetings with the Deputy Attorney General. Maxwell is currently fighting her sex trafficking conviction while reportedly seeking a pardon or sentence commutation.</p>

          <p>Authorities in London have seized thousands of counterfeit Labubu dolls, which are at the center of a major TikTok trend. The fakes, traced from a shop in Wales to a London industrial estate, pose a significant choking hazard as they easily fall apart. The Intellectual Property Office warns that such counterfeits, often made in China, Hong Kong, or Turkey, can also contain toxic materials. The high demand for the genuine dolls, which are quickly bought by scalpers, has created a thriving market for these dangerous knock-offs.</p>

          <p>A workplace tragedy in Gyoda, Japan, has resulted in the deaths of four municipal workers. The incident occurred when one worker fell into a manhole during a sewage pipe inspection, and three colleagues died while attempting a rescue. Authorities suspect the men may have succumbed to toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which was detected at the scene by rescuers. An investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of the accident and to assess the city's responsibility.</p>

          <p>A new climate study proposes an unintended consequence of successful anti-pollution efforts in East Asia. The significant reduction in air pollutants, particularly a 75% drop in sulphur dioxide since 2013, has improved public health but may have accelerated global warming. These aerosol particles previously reflected sunlight, providing a cooling effect that masked the full impact of greenhouse gases. The study estimates that the cleaner air in the region could be responsible for up to 0.05 degrees Celsius of the planet's recent warming trend.</p>

The game, held at the Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, sold over 85,000 tickets, far surpassing previous records. Despite the massive turnout and historic nature of the event, the game was suspended due to rain in the first inning. The event highlighted the potential for baseball in non-traditional, large-capacity venues.</p>

          <p>Germany has initiated a new phase of military support for Ukraine by agreeing to finance the production of long-range weapons directly on Ukrainian soil. This military-industrial cooperation marks a significant shift in Germany's approach to aiding Kyiv in its defense against Russia. The plan includes funding for approximately 500 An-196 Liutyi attack drones, which have a range of over 2,000 kilometers. This strategy aims to bolster Ukraine's domestic defense industry and provide a steady supply of crucial weaponry.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Simon Tisdall argues that recent US and Israeli military strikes against Iran have failed to achieve their objectives and have had severe negative consequences. Instead of halting Iran's nuclear program or weakening the regime, the attacks have led to increased internal repression, with a surge in political executions. The author contends that the aggression has bolstered hardliners, damaged international law, and ironically increased the likelihood of Iran pursuing a nuclear weapon for defense, urging a return to diplomacy.</p>
