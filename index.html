          <p>US senators, led by Republicans Rick Scott and James Risch, urged President Trump to discuss the deteriorating health and continued incarceration of 78-year-old Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai with Chinese President Xi Jinping. They highlighted Lai's poor health, including diabetes and numerous physical ailments, which are exacerbated by his imprisonment. The senators noted Lai's representatives' assurance that he would leave Hong Kong permanently and renounce public life if released. This bipartisan appeal emphasizes the humanitarian and political stakes involved, warning that Lai's death in prison would transform him into a powerful and enduring symbol of opposition against Beijing's actions, making his case a critical diplomatic point during the leaders' upcoming meeting.</p>

          <p>Debris from the recently demolished White House East Wing is being transported to various locations, including Smith Industries, a Maryland scrap yard, and Hains Point parkland in Washington D.C. The East Wing, originally built in 1902 and completed in the 1940s, was razed to make way for an upgraded walkway and a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom. This project is a privately funded initiative by President Trump, which has drawn considerable public attention. While historical components like former First Lady Rosalynn Carter's original office were reportedly saved, Jacqueline Kennedy's garden was removed amid the demolition efforts. This article traces the physical aftermath of the controversial renovation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to name the new White House ballroom after himself, with senior administration officials already referring to it as 'The President Donald J. Trump Ballroom.' This 90,000-square-foot addition, replacing the recently demolished East Wing, is a $300 million project primarily funded by private donations, with $350 million reportedly raised so far. Trump has a known history of branding his construction projects with his name and has stated he personally contributes millions to the White House. The move highlights the President's personal influence on the historic residence and raises questions regarding the allocation of the additional $50 million raised beyond the project's estimated cost.</p>

          <p>President Trump is embarking on an Asia trip, facing renewed North Korean ballistic missile launches and escalating trade tensions with China. He is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit, following Beijing's imposition of export controls on rare-earth magnets. In response, the US plans a new 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, effective November 1st. Despite these challenges, Trump expressed confidence in achieving a positive trade deal. His itinerary includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, with North Korea's recent aggression adding a layer of urgency to the regional diplomatic engagements.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines has resumed flights following a nationwide ground stop caused by a significant IT outage, though disruptions persisted into Friday with over 400 flights canceled. The Seattle-based carrier, which includes Horizon Air, confirmed operations were restored after the system-wide halt. The outage affected more than 49,000 passengers, prompting the airline to implement a flexible travel policy and issue apologies for the widespread inconvenience experienced by travelers. The Federal Aviation Administration issued the ground stop at the airline's request, but the specific nature of the technical issue that led to the operational disruption remains undisclosed to the public.</p>

          <p>President Trump sanctioned Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his family, and foreign minister, and suspended aid to Colombia, escalating a feud after Petro accused the US of 'murder' for killing a Colombian fisherman in a Caribbean strike. These strikes are part of a broader US campaign against drug cartels, with at least 43 people killed in 10 operations. Critics argue these attacks are illegal, represent an overreach of presidential power, and that the sanctions are a tool of political pique rather than serious foreign policy. The US justifies deadly force by classifying drug cartels as entities involved in 'noninternational armed conflicts' against the nation.</p>

          <p>The recent demolition of the White House East Wing, making way for a privately funded, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, has sparked concerns about transparency and the symbolic integrity of American democracy. Critics argue that summarily destroying a part of the historic residence without public consultation threatens the republic's fundamental idea of government by and for the people. This article contrasts the current project with past White House renovations, which involved public accountability and careful consideration of its historical representation. The move is seen as reflecting President Trump's indifference to the building's history and potentially creating an architectural imbalance that undermines its traditional sense of proportion and purpose.</p>

          <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a pause on the province's anti-tariff advertisement campaign in the US, effective Monday, after President Trump abruptly terminated trade talks over the ad. The campaign, which quoted former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs, drew Trump's strong disapproval, who called it 'FAKE' and 'egregious.' Ford stated that the ad had achieved its goal of initiating a broader conversation about tariffs and their economic impact on American audiences at the highest levels. This development highlights the contentious trade relations between the US and Canada, with Ottawa seeking to resume negotiations to ease tariffs on Canadian goods.</p>

CMT is a group of inherited conditions that cause nerve damage and smaller, weaker muscles, with symptoms typically appearing in the teen years or early adulthood. While CMT is generally not considered a fatal disease, certain symptoms can lead to complications such as injuries from falls or breathing difficulties.

The administration has designated cartels as terrorist organizations to justify force, but Congress has not authorized military action against them.

Critics argue this undermines Congress's constitutional role and represents a move towards autocracy.

          <p>A planned surge in federal immigration enforcement has been paused across the entire Bay Area, including Oakland, according to Mayor Barbara Lee. This follows an earlier announcement by President Trump and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie that the operations were called off specifically in San Francisco. Lee confirmed that Alameda County Sheriff Yesenia Sanchez received communication from federal immigration officials about the cancellation of the planned operations for the greater Bay Area. Despite initial concerns that the focus might shift to Oakland, the broader pause offers relief, though federal officials have condemned local leaders' warnings of potential arrests for agents violating the rights of Californians.</p>

          <p>Shares of footwear maker Deckers Brands plunged 15% after the company lowered its sales guidance for Hoka and Ugg, its key growth drivers, citing concerns that President Trump's tariffs are impacting consumer demand. Hoka's projected growth for fiscal 2026 was trimmed to low-teens, and Ugg's to low-to-mid single-digits, down from earlier forecasts that did not account for tariffs. Finance chief Steven Fasching confirmed tariffs and price increases are affecting consumer purchasing behavior in the discretionary space, leading to a 'reduction' in the company's outlook. Deckers expects tariff costs of $150 million this fiscal year, with only half offset by price adjustments and cost-sharing, contributing to investor unease. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US is deploying the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, to the Caribbean, significantly escalating its military presence in the region. This move, ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, follows weeks of increased US naval activity, including airstrikes on alleged drug trafficker boats that have killed dozens. The Pentagon stated the deployment will enhance capabilities to detect, monitor, and disrupt narcotics trafficking and transnational criminal organizations. Experts, however, suggest the extensive buildup is primarily intended to destabilize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government, with the carrier providing substantial resources for potential 'land action' inside Venezuela, intensifying geopolitical tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Portland, Oregon, rejected the Trump administration's request to immediately lift her order blocking the deployment of federalized National Guard troops to the city. Judge Karin Immergut cited two key reasons for her decision: the administration's attempt to evade her initial order by sending California Guard members after Oregon's were blocked, and an ongoing appeals court review of her first order. This ruling maintains the block on troop deployment, which Trump sought despite fierce local resistance, for what he claimed was a 'war-like rebellion.' The decision is part of a broader, ongoing legal battle over presidential power to deploy military forces in US cities against the will of local and state officials.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how Canada's anti-tariff ad, which angered President Trump, used excerpts from Ronald Reagan's 1987 address on foreign trade. While the ad did not alter Reagan's words, it significantly reordered them and omitted crucial context, leading to claims of misrepresentation from both Trump and The Ronald Reagan Foundation. For example, the ad's opening line from Reagan appeared halfway through his original speech, and key sentences were separated by over a minute of other remarks. The article details how these editorial choices shaped the ad's message, contrasting it with Reagan's full speech which also included justification for imposing tariffs on Japan, providing a deeper understanding of the political controversy.</p>

The US has offered a $50 million bounty for Maduro's arrest and authorized CIA covert operations.

          <p>Pakistan has banned Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a hard-line Islamist party, following deadly clashes with police during a march from Lahore to Islamabad. The federal cabinet unanimously approved the ban, citing the party's 'violent and terrorist activities' and its history of confrontational protests. The TLP, known for its fierce anti-blasphemy stance and demands for death sentences for insults to Islam, has amassed considerable grassroots support. The crackdown included raids on the leader's house and sealing associated mosques and seminaries. This action reflects Pakistan's complicated relationship with the TLP, which previously faced a ban in 2021, and its recent realignment with the United States, suggesting a firm stance against extremism.</p>

Barkley dismissed addiction as a factor for some, labeling those involved 'stupid' for attempting to fix games or provide insider information. Rozier is accused of providing private insider NBA information to help others profit from online bets, while Billups faces charges related to participating in a conspiracy to fix high-stakes poker games.

Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, criticized Israel for ceasefire violations, urging sanctions. The US is also facilitating aid deliveries, but Rubio explicitly stated the UNRWA aid agency would not be active in Gaza, despite desperate needs, as the US brands it an arm of Hamas, adding complexity to humanitarian efforts.</p>
