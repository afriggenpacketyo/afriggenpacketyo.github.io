          <p>President Trump announced the broad outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first such deal since the implementation of 'reciprocal' tariffs in April. While specific details are still being finalized, Trump highlighted that the agreement aims to increase market access for American exports by billions of dollars and reduce non-tariff barriers. The deal maintains a 10% U.S. tariff on UK imports, adjusts tariffs on UK autos, and seeks to create a $5 billion opportunity for new U.S. agricultural exports. Experts have downplayed the impact of the deal, suggesting it is a small win with limited scope.</p>

          <p>President Trump withdrew his nomination of Ed Martin as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia after Senator Thom Tillis voiced opposition due to Martin's defense of January 6 rioters. Martin, a conservative Republican, had faced criticism for his close ties to a man with antisemitic views and for allegedly making false statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Trump indicated he would nominate someone else for the position, suggesting Martin might find another role within his administration. The New York Times article details Martin's controversial actions, including threatening political opponents and alienating staff, which ultimately undermined his confirmation prospects.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a growing rebellion from Labour MPs over planned welfare cuts, with 42 MPs expressing concerns about the impact on disabled people and their families.

          <p>Economists are revising their forecasts for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts due to President Trump's tariffs, which pose a risk of higher inflation and slower economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's cautious approach, citing uncertainty surrounding the impact of tariffs on the economy. While economists increasingly predict a rate cut in September, some anticipate a later start date or a more aggressive half-point cut. The New York Times article suggests that the Fed needs concrete evidence of economic weakness before lowering rates, given persistent inflation and trade policy uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced he will double his charitable giving to $200 billion over the next 20 years, driven by challenges like children's health and climate change. Despite this increase, Gates emphasized that philanthropy cannot compensate for multibillion-dollar foreign aid cuts by wealthy countries. The CNBC article notes that the Gates Foundation will close at the end of 2045 after Gates has given away 'virtually all' of his wealth. Gates is among the few billionaires publicly increasing charitable giving amid federal funding cuts.</p>

          <p>Former CDC staff members are warning of a 'five alarm fire' due to widespread firings, reductions in force, and buyouts since January. The cuts are part of the Trump Administration's plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government. Public health workers feel demoralized, and they say the cuts have decreased the nation's ability to track and respond to health threats. The NPR article cites restricted communications, strict limits on supplies and hiring, and the decimation of programs dedicated to injury prevention, sexual health, and workplace hazard reduction.</p>

          <p>Home working appears to have led to a bigger decline in after-work drinking in city centers outside London, a Lords committee has heard. Pub spending data suggests that in London, post-work drinks have switched from Friday to Thursday. However, a similar shift could not be seen in other large British cities, where spending in bars was more likely to shift into the weekend. The BBC article details how this trend is affecting city-center spending and social habits.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Steven Levitsky, Lucan Way, and Daniel Ziblatt argue that America has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, where the cost of opposing the government has risen markedly. They contend that the Trump administration has weaponized government agencies and taken punitive actions against critics, targeting law firms, universities, and the media. The authors argue that this has created a chilling effect, where Americans are forced to think twice about engaging in constitutionally protected opposition, undermining the checks and balances of a healthy democracy.</p>
