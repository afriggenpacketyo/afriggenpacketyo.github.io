          <p>After years of index fund dominance, active management is experiencing a resurgence in the ETF market, as demonstrated by recent inflows into actively managed equity ETFs. Investors are seeking unique approaches to navigate market volatility, with a focus on funds that offer income, downside protection, or buffered strategies. This shift is driven by macro trends, the rise of younger retail investors, and concerns about volatility in the bond market. Experts suggest investors should remain invested during market swings and identify funds with a unique investment approach rather than engaging in panic trading, but also remember that passive funds are still a large share of the overall market.

          <p>Disney and Marvel's "Thunderbolts*" debuted with an estimated $76 million domestically and $162.1 million globally, marking the third-highest opening of 2025 and jumpstarting the summer box office season. The film's success is attributed to positive reviews and audience reception, signaling a potential turnaround for Marvel after inconsistent performance in recent years. Box office analysts note that this is a strong performance considering the ensemble cast of lesser-known characters, indicating Marvel's capability when its creative engine is firing on all cylinders. The film is expected to have long-term playability following in the footsteps of other recent hits.</p>

Ewers, however, plans to use the draft slight as motivation, embracing the lower expectations. Despite being the last quarterback selected, Ewers maintains high personal expectations and views the situation as an opportunity to prove himself, using it as fuel for his NFL career.</p>

          <p>Dozens of US arts organizations have been notified that offers of government grants have been terminated, hours after Donald Trump proposed eliminating federal agencies that support arts, humanities and learning. The cancellation of grant offers were reported from organizations across the US, and an email sent out to arts organization administrators said the NEA was updating its grant making policy priorities to focus funding on projects that “reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the president.” The proposed budget plan also includes cuts in support to public broadcasters and conforms to efforts by the president during his first term to see government support of the arts and humanities endowments eliminated.</p>

          <p>Survivors of grooming gangs have criticized Labour minister Lucy Powell for describing the issue as a “dog whistle,” accusing her of dismissing their experiences. Powell's comments, made during a BBC Radio 4 program, sparked outrage from victims who feel their concerns have been disregarded. Despite calls for a national inquiry into the historical sexual abuse of thousands of children, Labour has resisted, opting for a more flexible approach at the local level. Powell has since expressed regret for her remarks, stating that she regards issues of child exploitation and grooming with the utmost seriousness.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Mark Whitaker's new book, "The Afterlife of Malcolm X," focuses on the artistic choices made by Spike Lee and Denzel Washington in their 1992 biopic. The excerpt details the recreation of Malcolm Little's life, from his days as a street hustler to his role as a leader in the civil rights movement. The book examines the film's climactic assassination scene, including the use of dialogue, music, and camera work to convey Malcolm's premonition of his death, and underscores Lee's thesis about Malcolm's fatalistic state of mind.</p>

          <p>This month marks the 100th birthday of Malcolm X, the charismatic Black leader known for his blunt talk and biting humor. Over the years, Malcolm X has inspired leaders of the Black Power and Black Arts movements, activist athletes, and hip hop artists. His message of self-defense, Black pride, and cultural assertion still resonates in today's political climate. Historians compare Malcolm to Martin Luther King Jr., noting that the differences between them were really about how they conceptualized freedom for Black people.</p>

          <p>A psychologist who studies couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as highly damaging to relationships, leading to insecurity and questioning of worth. This comparison implies that the partner is not enough and that someone else could do a better job, stemming from a deeper issue of not feeling safe enough to voice needs plainly. Research suggests that partners who feel uncertain about the relationship are more likely to hold back, leading to the use of such phrases instead of direct communication. The key to a healthy relationship is clear, shame-free communication of needs without comparison.</p>

          <p>The media often portrays American employees as fed up and dissatisfied, coining terms like "quiet quitting" and "rage applying." However, these reports are often based on surveys conducted by HR firms with agendas, questionable statistical sampling, and a tendency to make employers the bad guys. Many people are generally happy with their jobs and understand the pressures employers face, recognizing that work is work and the perfect job doesn't exist. Dissatisfaction can also be a good thing, driving ambition and a desire for improvement.</p>
