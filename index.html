          <p>Indigenous communities across North America are rallying this week to raise awareness about the violence disproportionately affecting their people, particularly women and girls, and are urging for sustained responses. Through prayer walks, self-defense classes, marches, and speeches, they are pushing for better cooperation among law enforcement agencies to find missing people and solve homicides, addressing the over 4,300 open FBI cases. Many participants emphasize the importance of educating young people about the risks and advocating for bodily autonomy, while some tribes are inviting federal teams to lead simulation exercises to prepare communities for missing persons cases. This collective effort aims to break the cycle of violence and ensure the safety and well-being of Indigenous individuals and communities. </p>

          <p>In Romania's presidential election rerun, nationalist George Simion, known for his skepticism towards the EU and opposition to military support for Ukraine, secured a significant victory in the first round. Simion's success has sparked concern in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow, given Romania's strategic importance as a transit route for military aid to Ukraine and its hosting of a US missile defense shield. While Simion has expressed admiration for Donald Trump and believes in a strong NATO presence, his potential presidency raises questions about Romania's future foreign policy direction. His rise reflects public resentment towards financial support for Ukrainian refugees, though he denies being pro-Russian. </p>

          <p>Amidst rising tensions between Pakistan and India following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, Pakistan's army chief, General Syed Asim Munir, has adopted a hard-line stance, shaping the country's tone with tough rhetoric.

Analysts describe him as a hard-liner on India, influenced by his time leading military intelligence agencies and his belief in the religious nature of the conflict.

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado and the city of Denver, alleging that their "sanctuary laws" interfere with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit argues that these policies violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution and have allowed criminal elements, such as the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, to operate within the state. Local officials dispute the extent of the gang's control, but the Justice Department contends that the policies hinder the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Colorado officials maintain they are not a sanctuary state and cooperate with law enforcement agencies. </p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking among OECD members fell to fourth place in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place, according to preliminary data. The United States remained the top ODA donor, followed by Germany. The decline in Japan's donations was attributed mainly to the yen's depreciation. Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool amid China's growing influence. The OECD report also showed an overall decline in ODA by Development Assistance Committee members, marking the first decrease after five years of growth. </p>

          <p>Patsy Widakuswara, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit fighting Donald Trump’s order to dismantle Voice of America, has called for the media to resist as the administration becomes increasingly aggressive against the press. Trump signed an executive order that effectively cut off its funding via its parent company, the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM). For decades it has been seen as a form of soft power, encapsulating the values of liberal America. The lawsuit argues the Trump administration, through the actions of the defendants, USAGM, and the government’s special adviser Kari Lake, are attempting to unlawfully dismantle VOA’s operations because they deem it contrary to the government’s agenda. </p>

An influx of discounted goods intended for the U.S. market would also erode companies' profitability, which in turn would weigh on employment. </p>
