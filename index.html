          <p>Two U.S. citizen children, aged 4 and 7, were reportedly deported to Honduras along with their mother, according to the family's lawyer, marking another instance of American citizens being caught in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement. The mothers of both families claim they were not given the option to leave their children in the United States before deportation. President Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, refuted the claim that any American child was deported, stating that the mother was given a choice to be deported with or without her child. This incident raises concerns about the rights and treatment of U.S. citizens in immigration proceedings.</p>

          <p>A letter written by Titanic survivor Col. Archibald Gracie days before the ship's sinking sold for nearly $400,000 at auction due to its eerie foreshadowing. Gracie wrote of the 'fine ship' but reserved judgment until the journey's end, five days before the disaster that claimed 1,500 lives. The letter's high value reflects continued public fascination with the Titanic's story and the personal accounts of those involved. Gracie, who survived by clinging to a lifeboat, later wrote a book about the tragedy but died months later from related health issues.</p>

          <p>The Oscars' new rule allowing generative AI in nominated films has sparked debate, with concerns raised about its impact on human creativity. Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo argues that while AI can aid in filmmaking, it could diminish the human element crucial to art. He suggests that AI might lead to a 'diminishing return' by reducing human interaction and collaboration. The Oscars also announced a rule requiring members to watch all nominated films, potentially leading to fewer voters due to time constraints.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Cory Booker staged a sit-in protest on the Capitol steps to oppose the Republican budget plan, which is central to President Trump's agenda. The Democrats voiced concerns over potential cuts to Medicaid and criticized the plan's lack of bipartisan support. They were joined by other lawmakers and advocates who shared stories about the importance of Medicaid. This protest follows Booker's previous 25-hour speech against the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>The wreckage of two 18th-century ships found off the coast of Costa Rica has been identified as Danish slave ships, the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus. Investigations of ship timbers, bricks, and clay pipes confirmed the ships' identities, which were previously thought to be pirate vessels. The ships were wrecked in 1710, and the discovery marks a significant find for maritime archaeology. The Danish government banned the transatlantic slave trade in 1792, but slavery wasn't abolished until 1847.</p>
