          <p>A DW fact-check investigation concludes that X's Community Notes feature, intended to combat misinformation, often falls short and can be misleading. The system is vulnerable to being manipulated by coordinated groups, can be too slow to counter fast-spreading falsehoods, and sometimes distorts the original context of posts. Citing examples involving public figures and news reports, the article highlights expert warnings that the system's effectiveness is declining, posing risks as other platforms consider adopting a similar model without sufficient safeguards.</p>

          <p>The UK's Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, has refrained from setting a target for the number of migrants to be returned to France under a new agreement. The plan allows the UK to send back some individuals who arrive via small boats in exchange for accepting vetted asylum seekers from France. Cooper cited the plan's trial status and the need to avoid providing operational details to criminal gangs as reasons for not giving specific figures, while experts suggest the reported potential numbers may be too low to serve as an effective deterrent.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court justice has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest amid an ongoing trial into an alleged coup plot to overturn the 2022 election. The decision, issued by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, was prompted by Bolsonaro violating previous judicial restrictions by addressing supporters via his son's phone. The case has drawn international attention, including condemnation from the Trump administration, and is intensifying political tensions within Brazil.</p>

          <p>The aftermath of Storm Floris, described as an unusually powerful summer storm, has left thousands of homes in Scotland without power and caused significant travel disruption. Gusts of up to 90mph resulted in widespread train and flight cancellations, with the Highlands, Moray, and Aberdeenshire being the most affected areas. Utility company SSEN is working to restore power, but has warned that due to the complexity of the damage, some households may remain disconnected for several days.</p>

          <p>Chinese online retailer JD.com is expanding its presence into brick-and-mortar retail by planning to open five large discount superstores in two cities. This strategic move aims to capture a new segment of cost-conscious consumers as China's economic recovery slows and competition in the e-commerce sector intensifies. The expansion marks a significant push into physical retail for JD.com, contrasting with some rivals like Alibaba, which has been closing some of its physical grocery outlets.</p>

This transformation, including achieving funding parity with the district attorney's office, is credited with creating a fairer justice system and helping to lower the city's notorious incarceration rate.</p>

          <p>India's government has defended its purchase of Russian oil, stating that it was a necessary step for its energy security after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe. The statement came after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose substantially higher tariffs on India, accusing it of profiting from discounted Russian crude. India countered by noting that both the U.S. and EU continue to trade with Russia and that Washington had previously encouraged New Delhi to buy Russian oil to help stabilize global markets.</p>
