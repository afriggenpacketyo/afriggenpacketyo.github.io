          <h2>Singapore's Economy Narrowly Avoids Recession with Growth in Manufacturing and Construction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 03:07:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. This growth, which surpassed analysts' expectations, was driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector and a rebound in construction. Economists suggest this was partly due to businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential tariff changes. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant global economic uncertainty and maintaining a downgraded GDP growth forecast for the full year.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 03:05:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts, largely due to strong shipments to regions outside the U.S. and a temporary tariff truce that slowed the decline in exports to America. Imports also saw their first yearly growth in 2025, rising 1.1%, although this was below expectations. The data revealed a surge in shipments to Southeast Asia and the European Union, while exports of steel and rare earths hit record highs. However, economists remain cautious about the second half of the year, anticipating that the boost from front-loading exports may fade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value has soared to a new all-time high, exceeding $122,000, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The rally is also fueled by anticipation of upcoming U.S. crypto legislation, dubbed 'Crypto Week,' which aims to establish a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Analysts believe the surge is propelled by long-term institutional buyers, with some predicting the cryptocurrency could reach $125,000 in the coming months. The potential new laws, supported by the Trump administration, are expected to boost investor confidence and further integrate digital assets into the mainstream financial system.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled for a second official state visit to the U.K. from September 17-19, an unprecedented honor for an American president. He and First Lady Melania Trump will be hosted by King Charles II and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle. The invitation, delivered by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is viewed as a strategic effort to maintain strong diplomatic ties and mitigate the impact of U.S. trade policies. The visit may face protests, similar to his 2019 trip, and presents potential diplomatic complexities for King Charles, who is also head of state for Canada.</p>

          <p>London is facing concerns about its declining appeal as a global hub, prompted by an exodus of millionaires, businesses relocating, and workers leaving due to high living costs. A new tax regime has reportedly caused thousands of millionaires to depart, while homegrown firms increasingly look to list on foreign stock exchanges. Some market strategists argue the city's business "buzz" has faded due to over-regulation and political instability. However, other economists remain optimistic, pointing to London's strong fundamentals like the rule of law, cultural diversity, and a growing services export sector as key to its enduring resilience.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump marked the first anniversary of the 2024 assassination attempt on his life by attending the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey. Accompanied by family and advisers, he watched Chelsea defeat Paris Saint-Germain and presented the championship trophy to the winning team. In a statement, Trump said he believes God saved him for the purpose of restoring the nation. The event also served as an opportunity for informal diplomacy, with Trump's envoy indicating plans to meet with Qatari officials to discuss Gaza ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>An undercover BBC Panorama investigation has revealed potentially unlawful sales practices at two of the UK's largest estate agencies. At a Connells branch, an agent appeared to sideline a cash buyer in favor of another who agreed to use the company's in-house mortgage service, a deal potentially worth thousands to the firm. This practice, known as conditional selling, may violate industry codes. The investigation also found that Purplebricks was allegedly incentivizing staff to persuade sellers to accept price reductions on properties that may have been overvalued initially to win business. Both companies stated they are committed to fair practices.</p>

          <p>A woman has been found to have unlawfully brought a baby into the UK from Nigeria by fabricating a story of her own pregnancy and birth. The case, detailed in the Family Court, revealed that the woman, who was not pregnant, traveled to Nigeria and returned with a baby girl, claiming she had given birth there. DNA tests proved she was not the mother, and an investigation uncovered forged documents and evidence suggesting the baby was purchased. This case highlights a disturbing trend of child trafficking from West Africa, including from illegal "baby factories," and has resulted in the child being placed for adoption.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. This "acqui-hire" involves Google paying for compensation and licensing fees for some of Windsurf's technology, though it is not a full acquisition of the company. The move is the latest in an escalating AI talent war among tech giants, with companies like Meta and Microsoft also making multi-billion dollar deals to secure top researchers. Windsurf, which had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI, will continue to operate under a new interim CEO.</p>

          <p>The European Union is navigating intense trade pressures from both the United States and China, creating a challenging diplomatic and economic environment. The bloc is currently deliberating its response to President Trump's announcement of a 30 percent tariff on all EU-made goods, with France advocating for strong retaliation if no agreement is reached. At the same time, EU leaders are preparing for a summit in Beijing, which is expected to be a difficult affair. This dual pressure from the world's two largest economies has put the EU in a precarious position, forcing it to defend its interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking in Shanghai, has called for closer cooperation with China on developing green steel to decarbonize the industry. This initiative is presented as an opportunity to grow the trade relationship, which is heavily reliant on Australia's iron ore exports to China's massive steel sector. However, Albanese also urged China to address its steel overcapacity, which is causing trade friction globally. The push for green steel is also a strategic move for Australia, as decarbonization could threaten its current market dominance if it doesn't adapt to new, cleaner production methods.</p>
