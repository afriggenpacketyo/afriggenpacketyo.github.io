          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng has announced plans to launch its affordable Mona series in international markets, including Europe, starting in 2026. CEO He Xiaopeng stated the company's overseas expansion is progressing rapidly and also signaled openness to acquiring other EV companies to navigate the intense price war in China's domestic market. The move is set to increase competition for established automakers like Tesla, Volkswagen, and BMW, as Chinese firms like BYD continue to gain market share in Europe with competitively priced models.</p>

          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been publicly ranked in league tables, with specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. The rankings assess trusts on seven metrics, including waiting times, A&E performance, and financial management, sorting them into four performance categories. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables would increase transparency and accountability, allowing top-performing trusts more autonomy while underperforming ones receive enhanced support. However, organizations like NHS Providers have raised concerns about whether the chosen metrics accurately reflect quality of care.</p>

The court found his transfer from a jail cell to a luxury hospital wing after just one day was unlawful, as his condition was not critical.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers came within three outs of a combined no-hitter in a 3-1 win against the Colorado Rockies. Starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow was dominant, throwing seven hitless innings with 11 strikeouts before being removed due to a high pitch count. After reliever Blake Treinen pitched a perfect eighth, the no-hit bid was broken up by a double in the top of the ninth. The victory was crucial for the Dodgers, keeping them one game ahead of the San Diego Padres in the National League West division race.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is set to commission its nearly $5 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a project that promises to double the country's electricity output but has been a source of major tension with downstream nations Egypt and Sudan. Financed primarily through domestic bonds and public donations, the dam is a point of national pride but has been built amid unresolved disputes over water-sharing agreements. Egypt, which depends heavily on the Nile River, fears the dam poses an existential threat to its water supply, and years of negotiations have failed to produce a consensus.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an enhanced immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz," which it says will target "criminal illegal aliens." The move was made without prior notification to city officials, according to Mayor Brandon Johnson, who expressed opposition to the action, citing concerns over potential human rights abuses. The operation follows a social media post from President Trump threatening to "clean up" the city, escalating tensions between the federal government and the leadership of the sanctuary city.</p>

The outcome will be significant, as it could reveal the level of support for the government's perceived rightward shift following a recent cabinet reshuffle.

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has expressed serious concern that the country could be forced to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), similar to the 1976 sterling crisis. She argued that without a credible plan for economic growth from the current Labour government, rising taxes and unstable public finances could lead to a crisis. Badenoch offered to work with Prime Minister Keir Starmer on welfare spending cuts to avoid this outcome, a proposal a Labour source dismissed, citing the economic turmoil under the previous Conservative government.

          <p>An opinion article critiques President Trump's use of a meme titled "Chipocalypse Now" to threaten immigration enforcement action against Chicago. The piece argues that the meme, which references the film "Apocalypse Now" and includes the line "I love the smell of deportations in the morning," is a form of memetic warfare designed to normalize authoritarian threats under the guise of a joke. This tactic, combined with the renaming of the Department of Defense to the "Department of War," is presented as a dangerous escalation in rhetoric against a U.S. city.</p>
