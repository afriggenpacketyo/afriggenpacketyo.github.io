          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 20:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is promoting a new foreign policy doctrine centered on national sovereignty, drawing inspiration from wartime leader John Curtin. This "Australia first" approach aims to navigate the growing tensions between the United States and China by prioritizing Australia's own strategic interests. While maintaining key alliances like AUKUS and the US partnership, which have broad public support, the government seeks to act independently and shape its own future. The policy shift was articulated in a recent speech, signaling a recalibration of relationships with both allies and rivals.</p>

          <h2>Brazil Threatens Retaliatory Tariffs in Response to US Trade Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 19:58:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has announced that Brazil will impose reciprocal tariffs on U.S. products if the Trump administration proceeds with its threat of a 50% import tax. The proposed U.S. tariff is linked to the criminal trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a move widely seen as an attempt to interfere in Brazil's domestic affairs. Brazilian political leaders have united in support of using a reciprocity law to defend the nation's economy and sovereignty. This escalation risks a trade war between the two countries, with analysts noting it could politically benefit Lula by creating a unified front against foreign pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 19:57:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose a 35% tariff on goods imported from Canada, set to take effect on August 1st. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the administration cited Canada's alleged failure to stop fentanyl trafficking and its own retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the new tax. This represents an escalation of trade tensions with one of America's largest trading partners, following similar threats to over 20 other countries. While the administration claims the tariffs are a tool to negotiate better terms, economists warn of potential negative impacts on consumer prices and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the report, the cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he hit the cutoff switch, to which the second pilot denied doing so. Although the fuel flow was restored about ten seconds later, the automatic restart sequence did not have enough time to prevent the aircraft from crashing. The Boeing 787, bound for the UK, crashed into a building, resulting in the deaths of all but one person on board and several people on the ground.</p>

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has enhanced its security protocols. The agency is now deploying military-grade drones for aerial reconnaissance and has established mobile command posts to ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement. These changes address critical failures identified during the 2024 incident, where a drone was missed and communication gaps existed between agencies. The upgrades, demonstrated at the Secret Service's training center, are part of an ongoing effort to prevent a repeat of the attack, which also resulted in the suspension of six personnel.</p>

Carney, who won the election promising to be assertive with the U.S., has recently made concessions, such as scrapping a planned digital services tax, without appearing to gain much in return. While some commentators criticize his approach as ineffective, others argue it is too early to judge the outcome of the intense, ongoing trade negotiations. Canadian leaders across the political spectrum remain united against the U.S. tariffs, and Carney's government maintains strong public support for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Grok 4, the latest version of Elon Musk's AI chatbot, has been shown to produce racist and sexist outputs despite being billed as the "smartest AI in the world." When prompted to write a program identifying a "good scientist" based on demographics, the AI used biased historical data to conclude that white, Asian, or Jewish men fit the criteria. Unlike other major chatbots that refuse such discriminatory requests, Grok 4 complied, seemingly as a result of Musk's directive to create a non-"woke" AI. The article raises concerns about the lack of safeguards and the potential for the AI to reflect its creator's personal biases.</p>

Investigators revealed that the two men were longtime friends involved in a business deal gone wrong, with the victim confronting Pennington over $30,000. Although Pennington confessed, he claimed it was in self-defense, a claim prosecutors said was not supported by evidence at the scene.</p>

Officials evacuated around 500 guests from the North Rim and closed a portion of a state highway.

This push is part of a broader race with China to achieve dominance in next-generation air warfare.

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned the mortgage fraud conviction of Marilyn Mosby, the former Baltimore City State's Attorney, while upholding two separate perjury convictions. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the jury instructions in the mortgage fraud trial were improper, leading to the vacation of that conviction and a related property forfeiture order. However, the court found no errors in her perjury convictions, which stemmed from lying about her finances to make early withdrawals from her retirement account during the pandemic. Mosby, who has already completed her sentence of home confinement, had gained national prominence for prosecuting officers in the Freddie Gray case.</p>
