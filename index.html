            <p>This article examines the potential for Donald Trump's tariff policies to drive up consumer prices and enable corporate profiteering. Economists warn that tariffs provide a convenient narrative for companies to raise prices, even on goods not directly affected by the tariffs. Historical examples, such as tariffs on washing machines, show that domestic producers may also increase prices, leading to an overall increase in consumer costs. Consumer expectations of inflation, fueled by political divisions, could exacerbate the situation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Rev. Franklin Graham is calling the nation to remember that even in devastation, hope is not lost in an Easter message filmed from fire-ravaged neighborhoods in California. The program, which also features performances by Grammy-winning worship leader Michael W. Smith and artist Charity Gayle, was recorded in and around areas still scarred by flames. Samaritan’s Purse has deployed disaster relief teams across the U.S. to provide everything from physical labor to moral support. Graham credited the Trump administration with helping cut through bureaucratic red tape that often slows recovery efforts in disaster zones. Optimism score: 70</p>

This announcement came hours after Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the US would abandon talks without clear progress within days.
