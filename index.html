          <p>Senate Republicans have released an updated version of a major legislative package backed by President Trump, moving it closer to a final vote. The bill's central components include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increasing spending on border security and defense, and raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. To offset these costs, the legislation proposes significant changes and funding cuts to social programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), including adding work requirements and altering funding formulas for states. The Senate parliamentarian has been reviewing the bill's provisions to ensure they comply with the rules of the budget reconciliation process.</p>

          <p>The grandfather of Wess Roley, the suspected gunman in a deadly ambush in Idaho, has spoken out, expressing profound sadness for the two firefighters killed and one injured. He stated the victims "didn't deserve it" and described his grandson as becoming "kind of a loner" in the months prior to the attack. Officials believe the suspect started a brush fire to lure the first responders before opening fire. He was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound following a manhunt, and his family is cooperating with the investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has abruptly canceled two pandemic-era grant programs that provided approximately $1 billion for food aid organizations to purchase produce directly from local farmers. This decision, described as a "return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives," has left both nonprofits and small farms in a difficult position. Aid groups are now struggling to serve vulnerable populations in food deserts, while farmers who had expanded their operations to meet the demand from these programs are facing significant financial losses. Advocates warn these cuts will have a ripple effect on food security for many communities across the nation.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger has agreed to plead guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, thereby avoiding the death penalty. According to a letter from prosecutors to the victims' families, the plea deal includes four consecutive life sentences for the murder charges and a maximum 10-year sentence for burglary, with no right to appeal. The agreement was reached after Kohberger's defense team approached the prosecution last week. This resolution ensures a conviction and spares the families from a lengthy and uncertain trial and appeals process, with sentencing anticipated for late July.</p>

This reaction highlights the deep emotional conflict surrounding the legal resolution, which will see Kohberger plead guilty in exchange for life in prison.

          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was named a captain for the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game, largely due to receiving the most fan votes by a significant margin. However, a breakdown of the voting revealed a stark contrast in perception among her colleagues, who ranked her as only the ninth-best guard in the league. While fan votes account for 50% of the total, her low player ranking is notable, with some speculating it could be due to her missing several games this season or contentious on-court moments. Despite the peer ranking, Clark will captain a team at the All-Star game in her home arena.</p>

          <p>A booming coffee culture in China, traditionally a tea-drinking nation, is now expanding into the countryside, leading to a surge in rural and suburban cafes. This trend is fueled by a growing domestic market, which is now valued at around $42 billion, and a desire for unique, social-media-friendly experiences outside of cities. China's net coffee imports have grown over six-fold since 2020, reflecting a significant shift in consumer habits. However, some observers question the long-term sustainability of this influencer-driven cafe boom, noting that the novelty for customers can fade quickly after a single visit.</p>

In a series of posts on X, Musk called for supporters to "hang their head in shame" and threatened they would lose their next primary election. He also floated the idea of forming a new political party called the "America Party" if the bill passes. Musk's opposition centers on the bill's spending levels, particularly its $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling, and cuts to green energy tax credits.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made moves at the start of NBA free agency, losing a key defensive player but quickly signing a new forward. Dorian Finney-Smith, a versatile defender, has reportedly agreed to a four-year, $53-million contract with the Houston Rockets after opting out of his deal with the Lakers. In response, the Lakers secured forward Jake LaRavia on a two-year, $12-million agreement. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing player, averaged 6.9 points last season and is noted for his strong three-point shooting, which the team hopes will help fill the void left by Finney-Smith's departure.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a "landmark" review of the country's parental leave and pay policies for the first time in decades. The review will examine maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave to modernize a system that campaigners and a parliamentary committee have described as flawed and outdated. Critics point out that the UK's statutory paternity leave is among the least generous in Europe and that uptake of shared leave is very low, often because families cannot afford it. The goal is to create a system that better supports working families, though some express concern about placing additional cost burdens on employers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has denied Apple's request to dismiss a major antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. The ruling allows the case, which alleges that Apple uses its iPhone ecosystem to illegally stifle competition and maintain a monopoly, to move forward toward a potential trial. The Justice Department argues that Apple's "walled garden" approach harms consumers and innovators by limiting choices and enabling higher prices. Judge Xavier Neals determined that the government's allegations of anticompetitive conduct and the potential for an illegal monopoly were substantial enough to merit a full trial.</p>

Families face difficulties such as booking appointments at GP surgeries, getting time off work, and a lack of clear reminders about which vaccines are needed. This decline has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough, with no childhood vaccine currently meeting the WHO's 95% coverage target.

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not yet seen significant price increases for consumers resulting from U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. In an interview, Jassy explained that both Amazon and its third-party sellers mitigated the impact by making forward purchases and deploying inventory before the tariffs took full effect. He also noted that the competitive nature of Amazon's marketplace, with its two million sellers, helps keep prices stable. Jassy also discussed the transformative potential of generative AI, stating that it will make employees' jobs more interesting and that most consumers may have robots in their homes within a decade.</p>

          <p>Energy bills for 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales are set to decrease by about 7% starting Tuesday, as determined by the regulator Ofgem's latest price cap. This translates to a reduction of roughly Â£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts warn that prices are unlikely to fall much further and remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. With ongoing uncertainty in global markets, there are concerns that bills could rise again during the winter. Ofgem is encouraging consumers to explore fixed-rate deals, which are now more widely available and could offer more price certainty.</p>

The order also directs a review of the terrorist designations for the Islamist group HTS, from which the new transitional government emerged, and its leader.

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments over the Trump administration's use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of gang ties. The administration invoked the wartime law, arguing that the Tren de Aragua gang constitutes a "predatory incursion" against the U.S. The ACLU, representing the migrants, contends the act is meant for major military conflicts, not for addressing gang activity, and that its use in this context is an overreach of executive power. The judges appeared focused on whether the judiciary has the authority to overrule a president's determination of what constitutes an armed conflict.</p>
