          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession thanks to a strong performance in its manufacturing sector. Despite this growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious. Officials warned of significant downside risks and uncertainty for the second half of 2025, primarily stemming from global trade tensions and unclear U.S. tariff policies. The country had previously downgraded its full-year GDP growth forecast, reflecting the precarious international economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent article from CBS News recounts the horrific story of 11-year-old Jayden Perkins, who was killed while heroically defending his mother from a violent ex-boyfriend. The attack, which occurred last year, was witnessed by his five-year-old brother, Kameron, with whom Jayden shared a close bond and a birthday. The story serves as a grim reminder of the profound and tragic consequences of domestic violence, particularly on the youngest and most vulnerable family members. It underscores the lasting trauma inflicted upon children who are exposed to such brutal events.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Colorado's 18th Judicial District are set to drop an attempted kidnapping charge against a registered sex offender accused of trying to abduct a child from an elementary school. The decision was made after the suspect, Solomon Galligan, was found mentally incompetent to stand trial, leaving prosecutors to state they have no other legal option. The incident, which was captured on video, has caused significant fear and outrage in the community, leading to administrative changes at the school and heightened concerns about public safety.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine to help the nation defend itself against Russian attacks. Trump stated that the European Union and NATO would fully reimburse the U.S. for the sophisticated military equipment, framing the deal as a business transaction for the United States. This move signals a shift in approach, coming shortly after the Pentagon had paused some arms shipments and as Trump has expressed frustration with the lack of progress toward peace in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing for a $1.1 billion funding cut to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a move that could severely impact local media outlets, especially in rural America. While the president has framed the cuts as targeting biased national outlets like NPR and PBS, a significant portion of federal funding supports smaller, local stations. Some Republican senators from rural states, such as Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, have voiced opposition, warning that these stations provide an invaluable and sometimes life-saving resource for their communities.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Met Office warns that the United Kingdom is experiencing a "notably different" climate compared to just a few decades ago, with extreme weather events becoming the new normal. The country is breaking heat and rainfall records with increasing frequency due to human-caused global warming. The report highlights that the UK is warming at a rate of 0.25°C per decade, leading to more hot days, fewer cold nights, and wetter winters. This ongoing shift poses significant challenges for nature, infrastructure, and public safety.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his "illiberal democracy" and admired by global conservatives like Donald Trump, is facing a significant political challenge at home. A former insider, Peter Magyar, has emerged as a popular opposition figure, capitalizing on a government scandal and public discontent with the state of hospitals, schools, and the economy. While Orban's playbook of identifying voter fears has been successful for years, this new challenge from the center-right suggests his long-held power may be weakening ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

          <p>A decades-old water-sharing treaty between the United States and Mexico is under severe strain due to a crippling drought and escalating political pressure. Under the 1944 agreement, Mexico must deliver water from the Rio Grande to Texas, but it is currently in arrears. Farmers in Chihuahua, Mexico, argue the drought makes it impossible to send water, while Texan farmers and the Trump administration demand compliance, threatening tariffs. The conflict highlights a growing crisis over scarce resources, pitting treaty obligations against the harsh realities of climate change.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has confirmed that King Charles III will host U.S. President Donald Trump for a second state visit from September 17 to 19. The event, to be held at Windsor Castle, is unprecedented, as second-term presidents are not traditionally offered a full state visit. The invitation is seen as a strategic act of soft diplomacy by the British government to maintain close ties with the Trump administration. The visit will include a full ceremonial welcome and a state banquet, with senior members of the Royal Family in attendance.</p>
