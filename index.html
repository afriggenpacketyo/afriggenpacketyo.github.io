          <p>A former New Mexico judge and his wife have been arrested on charges of evidence tampering and harboring an illegal immigrant, Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, believed to be a member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Prosecutors allege the couple attempted to conceal incriminating images and videos of Ortega-Lopez, who had previously been released from custody due to overcrowding after entering the U.S. illegally. The investigation revealed social media posts suggesting Ortega-Lopez's ties to the gang, including images of weapons and gang-related tattoos. This case highlights the Justice Department's commitment to prosecuting those who support gang members, even if they are former judges.</p>

          <p>The FBI arrested Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly obstructing immigration officials who were attempting to arrest a man in her courthouse. Dugan is accused of misdirecting federal agents and allowing the individual, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, to evade arrest, leading to a foot chase before he was eventually apprehended. The arrest has sparked outrage, with some accusing the Trump administration of weaponizing federal law enforcement against immigrant communities.

          <p>A Los Angeles County resident has been diagnosed with measles after returning from Texas, where a significant outbreak of the disease is occurring.

          <p>Researchers in Japan have discovered that listening to a one-minute sound at 100 hertz can potentially prevent motion sickness by stimulating the inner ear and improving balance. The study involved exposing volunteers to the sound before activities like riding a swing or simulator, and showed a 70-80% reduction in motion sickness symptoms. This research is particularly relevant with the increasing use of self-driving vehicles, where passengers are more prone to motion sickness. The team hopes to implement this finding into practical applications after confirming its safety.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Russia and Ukraine are "very close to a deal" following talks between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the need for "real pressure on Russia" to accept an unconditional ceasefire. Reports suggest that Ukraine would be expected to cede land annexed by Russia under a US peace proposal, a condition rejected by Zelensky. The situation remains complex, with significant disparities between US, European, and Ukrainian proposals.</p>

          <p>This article examines the major militant groups involved in the Kashmir insurgency, including The Resistance Front (TRF), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Al Badr, and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGH). These groups, some with global jihadi connections, aim to challenge Indian control over Kashmir and potentially merge the region with Pakistan. The groups' activities and affiliations make the insurgency complex to track and contain. The landscape of militant groups in Kashmir is constantly evolving.</p>

          <h2>Bondi Rescinds Biden-Era Protections for Journalists</h2>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has revoked a Biden administration-era policy that restricted subpoenas of reporters' phone records in criminal investigations. The memo states that federal employees who leak sensitive information undermine foreign policy, national security, and government effectiveness. Bondi argues that the justice department will continue to employ procedural protections to limit the use of compulsory legal process. The move has raised concerns about press freedom.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reverses Termination of Visas for Foreign Students</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 18:13:09 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed the termination of visas for hundreds of foreign students, following numerous lawsuits. The administration is restoring visas for students who had their legal status abruptly terminated. Immigration officials are now working on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas. Many affected students appeared to have participated in political protests or had previous criminal charges. The policy reversal provides a reprieve for many students, but ICE retains the authority to terminate SEVIS records for other reasons.</p>
