          <p>'Buy now, pay later' plans are rapidly gaining consumer favor as an alternative to traditional credit cards, allowing for interest-free installment payments on purchases. This trend poses a direct challenge to the revenue models of major banks and credit card companies, who are losing transaction volume. Furthermore, financial institutions are wary because these loans create a significant blind spot in consumer credit profiles, making it difficult to accurately assess an individual's overall debt and financial risk. This article explores the disruptive impact of these services on the established credit industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During the first quarter of Sunday's game, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen experienced a frightening moment when he appeared to hit his head on a player's knee after a dive. He left the field bleeding but returned at the start of the second quarter after receiving medical attention. Allen's resilience was key as he went on to lead the Bills to a decisive 30-10 victory over the New York Jets, helping his team advance to a 2-0 season start.

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a Espana was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in central Madrid, knocking down barriers and occupying the road. As a result, Danish cyclist Jonas Vingegaard, who was leading, was declared the winner without a formal podium presentation. The event had seen previous disruptions related to protests against the Israel-Premier Tech team. The cancellation sparked political controversy, with Madrid's mayor blaming the Spanish prime minister's supportive comments for instigating the disruptive protests that led to clashes with police.</p>

          <p>A recent Rolling Stone profile portrays Stephen Miller, a key adviser in the Trump administration, as a deeply influential yet widely disliked figure. The article alleges that during his time on Capitol Hill, GOP staffers spread rumors about him to express their disdain. Inside the White House, he was reportedly nicknamed "President Miller" for his vast control over immigration policy, allegedly pushing for aggressive deportation tactics and dismissing humanitarian concerns. The piece paints a picture of Miller as the powerful architect behind some of the administration's most controversial and hardline initiatives.</p>

In a speech in Sunderland, Phillipson stressed the importance of party unity, warning that internal divisions would only benefit political opponents like Nigel Farage. She positioned herself as a candidate who could bring the party together to secure a second term in government. Phillipson is competing against her former Cabinet colleague Lucy Powell for the influential role within the party.</p>

          <p>UCLA has fired head football coach DeShaun Foster following a disappointing 0-3 start to the 2025 season. The dismissal of the former star running back comes after just 15 games and a 5-10 overall record, culminating in back-to-back losses to Mountain West Conference teams. The university has named Tim Skipper as the interim head coach for the remainder of the season while it begins a national search for a permanent replacement. The move signals a shift in expectations for the program as it competes in the Big Ten conference.</p>

          <p>Romania's defense ministry has reported that a Russian drone violated its airspace on Saturday during a Russian attack on Ukrainian infrastructure near the border. This marks the second such incursion into NATO territory, following a similar incident in Poland earlier in the week. Romanian fighter jets were monitoring the area and tracked the drone before it disappeared from radar. The incident has been condemned by the EU's foreign policy chief as an "unacceptable breach," escalating concerns about the war in Ukraine spilling over into neighboring NATO countries.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly stated that Prince Andrew needs to be fully investigated for allegations that he sexually abused her. In an exclusive BBC interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, argued that the Duke of York has not faced sufficient consequences despite being stripped of royal duties. He asserted that the prince's out-of-court settlement was not enough and that every person involved, regardless of status, deserves to be held to the fullest extent of the law for their alleged participation.</p>

          <p>In municipal elections held in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right CDU party is projected to finish first. However, the most significant trend from the vote is the surge in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has more than tripled its share of the vote from 5.1% in 2020 to a projected 16.5%. The results are seen as a key test for the national government and indicate a continuing rightward shift in the German electorate, with the AfD solidifying its position as a major political force.</p>

Rubio's visit is seen as an attempt to balance U.S. criticism of the strike with a broader message of support for Israel, even as President Trump was reportedly unhappy with the action.</p>

However, the market will be listening most intently to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference for clues about the central bank's future plans for monetary policy. After mixed inflation data and signs of a slowing job market, Powell's commentary will be crucial in shaping expectations for the economy through the end of the year. The week also features investor day events for CrowdStrike and DuPont. (not investment advice)</p>
