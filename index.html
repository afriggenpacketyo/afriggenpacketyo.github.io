          <p>Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi's MGX are set to be the primary investors in TikTok's U.S. business, collectively controlling about 45% of the new entity, TikTok USA. The deal, which awaits President Trump's final approval via an executive order, is structured to address national security concerns by placing the app's security under Oracle's oversight. Under the proposed structure, TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, will retain a 19.9% stake, with its existing investors and new holders owning the remaining shares.</p>

Jeffries stated that Democrats will not be intimidated by the Trump administration's warnings to federal agencies about potential mass firings. He emphasized that his party's key demand is the inclusion of an extension for the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits in any stopgap funding legislation, framing the issue as a defense against a Republican assault on healthcare.</p>

          <p>A new study on Maria Branyas Morera, who lived to be 117, suggests her extreme longevity resulted from a combination of protective genetic variants and healthy lifestyle habits. Researchers led by Dr. Manel Esteller found she possessed unique genes that guarded against many disorders and maintained a diet rich in fish, olive oil, and notably, three plain yogurts daily. The yogurt is believed to have contributed to a healthy gut microbiome, which helps combat chronic inflammation, a key factor in aging and disease. Branyas lived a long, healthy life free from major diseases like cancer or dementia.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed lawsuits against six states—California, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania—for failing to turn over their statewide voter registration lists. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that access to these rolls is necessary to ensure compliance with federal election laws, specifically the Help America Vote Act's list maintenance requirements. The states cited various reasons for their refusal, including privacy protections and a lack of legal basis for the request. This legal action aligns with President Trump's long-standing, unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud and his efforts to overhaul U.S. election procedures.</p>

          <p>A report from The Wall Street Journal describes significant internal turmoil within the Trump administration regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. The situation escalated after the Justice Department released a memo effectively closing the case, an act one official described as a 'bomb going off' in the White House. The article details a series of missteps, finger-pointing between officials, and high-level strategy meetings convened to manage the political fallout. President Trump was reportedly worried that friends might be implicated in the files and that documents could have been doctored to harm him politically.</p>

          <p>The Open Society Foundations (OSF), funded by George Soros, has denounced the Trump administration following reports that the Department of Justice is planning to investigate the organization. A New York Times report revealed that federal prosecutors were instructed to consider a range of charges, including racketeering and material support for terrorism. OSF condemned the move as a politically motivated attack intended to silence dissent and undermine First Amendment rights, unequivocally stating it does not fund terrorism. The action is seen as part of President Trump's broader effort to use the Justice Department to target his political adversaries.</p>

          <p>Recent and increasingly brazen Russian incursions into NATO airspace have prompted a significant shift in tone among European leaders, who now appear to be preparing for the possibility of a direct, albeit limited, conflict. Incidents involving Russian drones entering Polish territory and fighter jets violating Estonian airspace have led to explicit warnings that future unauthorized aircraft will be shot down. This hawkish turn, supported by leaders from Poland, the UK, and even U.S. President Donald Trump, marks a departure from the initial priority of preventing escalation beyond Ukraine's borders. The provocations are seen as a test of NATO's unity and resolve.</p>

          <p>The European Ryder Cup team, led by captain Luke Donald and star player Rory McIlroy, is considered the best-positioned squad since 2012 to win on American soil, potentially breaking a trend of one-sided home victories. The event at Bethpage Black is seen as crucial for the Ryder Cup's competitive validity, which has been dominated by home teams in recent years. McIlroy, fresh off his Masters win, is viewed as a cornerstone for the European side, which boasts talent, camaraderie, and detailed preparation.

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, President Donald Trump urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to stop purchasing oil from Russia as part of a broader effort to economically pressure Moscow over the war in Ukraine. Trump suggested that compliance could lead to a favorable deal for Turkey to acquire F-35 fighter jets and the potential lifting of existing U.S. sanctions on its defense industry. Turkey, a NATO member, has maintained a neutral stance and is a major buyer of Russian oil. The discussion also touched upon the conflicts in Syria and Gaza, highlighting differing positions despite the diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for the family of Kevin Rodriguez Zavala, a 32-year-old man with a spinal disability who died after riding a Universal Orlando roller coaster, assert his death was caused by blunt force trauma from the ride. They claim he hit his head on a restraint and was unconscious for most of the ride, and that his disability was not a contributing factor. The local medical examiner ruled the death an accident caused by multiple blunt impact injuries. The family's lawyers are challenging Universal's internal findings that the ride, Stardust Racers, functioned properly, arguing that a lack of malfunction does not equate to safety.</p>

          <p>Following his murder, conservative activist Charlie Kirk may become a powerful martyr for his movement, similar to how Malcolm X's legacy evolved after his assassination. This article draws parallels between the two figures, noting both were provocative speakers, effective grassroots organizers, and appealed to disaffected groups. A violent death often humanizes a polarizing figure, shifting public perception and allowing their message to gain broader sympathy and influence. Just as Malcolm X's autobiography reshaped his image, Kirk's legacy is already being memorialized by supporters and even some political opponents as that of a formidable and fearless persuader.</p>

Researchers now identify the skull as an early form of Homo longi, a sister species to Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, implying all three lineages existed concurrently a million years ago. This finding dramatically pushes back the timeline for the evolution of large-brained humans. However, other experts caution that while the conclusions are plausible, they are far from certain and require more evidence to be confirmed.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is facing criticism from fellow Labour MPs after indicating he might challenge Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for the party's leadership. While Burnham claims some MPs have urged him to stand, a BBC survey of Labour MPs revealed little appetite for a leadership change, with many calling his comments self-indulgent and unhelpful. In response, Sir Keir Starmer dismissed the issue as personal ambition and implicitly compared Burnham's spending proposals to those of former Conservative PM Liz Truss. The internal friction comes as the Labour government navigates a series of political challenges.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has suspended certain cloud services, including Azure storage and AI subscriptions, to Unit 8200 of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The decision follows the company's investigation into a report by The Guardian, which alleged the unit had developed a system to track Palestinians' phone calls. Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, stated that the company found evidence supporting elements of the reporting. This action comes amid pressure from Microsoft employees protesting the use of company software in the Gaza conflict and a week after a UN commission accused Israel of committing genocide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of used-car retailer CarMax fell by more than 20% after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street expectations. The company's CEO, Bill Nash, described the fiscal second quarter as 'challenging,' citing difficult market conditions and depreciation in its inventory. CarMax's revenue was approximately $6.6 billion, a 6% decrease from the previous year, while overall vehicle sales dropped by 4.1%. The poor performance of CarMax, often seen as a bellwether for the industry, also led to a decline in the stock prices of other auto retailers.</p>

          <p>Beginning September 30, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will transition away from mailing paper checks, requiring nearly 70 million recipients to receive benefits via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card. The agency cites improved efficiency, security, and cost savings as reasons for the change, noting electronic payments are significantly less likely to be lost or stolen. While the move aligns with a broader federal mandate to digitize payments, exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other way to receive funds. Advocates have raised concerns about the impact on the 'unbanked' population who rely on paper checks.</p>

          <p>Recent price hikes from Disney+, Apple TV+, and other streaming services are frustrating consumers who once saw cord-cutting as a cost-saving measure. The industry is shifting from a stable subscription model to one where companies leverage their 'essential' status to increase profits, leading to a battle of wills with customers. Experts note the market is splitting, with some companies adapting to 'seasonal' subscribers who hop between services, while others bundle offerings to create loyalty. This trend is driven by rising content production costs and a need to achieve profitability in a highly competitive landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his argument that the U.S. should regain control of Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, primarily due to its strategic proximity to China's nuclear activities. While China's main weapon manufacturing is deeper inland, the base is about 1,200 miles from the Lop Nur nuclear test range, which the U.S. is closely monitoring amid China's rapid arsenal expansion. Trump has suggested a negotiated return of the base is possible, but the Taliban has rejected the idea, citing the 2020 Doha agreement. Experts remain skeptical, stating the Taliban is unlikely to permit a U.S. return.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has begun a gradual restart of its operations after a major cyberattack in August forced a complete shutdown of its IT networks and production lines. While factories remain closed, the company has restored some systems, allowing it to process invoices and clear a backlog of payments to suppliers. The UK government is reportedly working on a support package for JLR's suppliers, many of whom face financial distress due to the prolonged shutdown. JLR's global parts logistics center is returning to full operations, a critical step for servicing existing customer vehicles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly informed Argentina that U.S. support for its loan request to the International Monetary Fund is contingent on Buenos Aires rolling back its financial ties with China. U.S. officials specifically targeted an $18 billion currency swap agreement with Beijing, arguing it poses a long-term risk to Argentine sovereignty and enables China to expand its regional influence. This demand underscores Washington's strategy of using financial leverage to counter China's growing presence in Latin America. Previously, a U.S. envoy described the Chinese credit line as 'extortionate' and a direct obstacle to U.S. support.</p>

          <p>An independent review of Los Angeles County's response to the deadly January wildfires found that significant delays in evacuation warnings were caused by a lack of resources and outdated emergency alert policies. The report, commissioned after the Eaton and Palisades fires killed over 30 people, highlighted critical staffing shortages, unreliable communication systems, and inconsistent practices among first responders. While praising the heroic actions of individuals on the front lines, the review concluded that systemic weaknesses hampered the overall effectiveness of the county's response. The causes of the fires remain under investigation.</p>
