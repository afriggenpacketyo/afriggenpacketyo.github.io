        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a new travel ban, restricting entry to the United States for citizens of 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Yemen, citing national security concerns and inadequate vetting processes. Additionally, partial restrictions have been placed on travelers from seven other countries. The policy, set to take effect on June 9, includes exceptions for U.S. permanent residents, athletes attending major sporting events, and immediate family members with verifiable identification and familial ties. The decision mirrors a similar ban from 2017, which was later rescinded by President Biden, and is based on information from various U.S. officials and agencies. Optimism score is based on the fact that there are exceptions to the travel ban.</p>

          <p>The Education Department has accused Columbia University of violating federal anti-discrimination laws, citing the university's failure to address anti-Semitism on campus following the October 7 attack against Israel by Hamas. According to the department, Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students, potentially jeopardizing the university's accreditation and eligibility for federal financial aid programs. A Columbia spokesperson stated that the school is aware of the Department of Education's concerns and is deeply committed to combating anti-Semitism on campus, working with the federal government to address the issue. The department's civil rights offices previously determined that Columbia failed to protect Jewish students from severe and pervasive harassment, denying them equal access to educational opportunities. The optimism score is based on the fact that the university is working with the government to address the issue.</p>

          <p>A climber, Alex Chiu, died after falling approximately 3,000 feet from Mount McKinley (Denali) in Alaska's Denali National Park. Chiu was ascending the West Buttress climbing route with two companions when the incident occurred at a location known as Squirrel Point. High winds and snow initially hampered rescue efforts, and Chiu's body was recovered two days after the fall. There are currently 500 climbers on Mount McKinley, and the climbing season typically runs from early May to early July. The low optimism score reflects the tragic loss of life.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has initiated an investigation into Joe Biden's actions during his presidency, alleging that Biden's aides concealed his cognitive decline and usurped presidential authority. The inquiry will scrutinize Biden's executive actions, including pardons and federal rules, with Republican lawmakers seeking testimony from former aides regarding Biden's mental and physical faculties. Biden dismissed the allegations as false, asserting that he made all decisions during his presidency, and Trump's memo targets Biden's use of an autopen for signing executive actions. The optimism score is low due to the contentious political nature of the inquiry.</p>

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from an uninhabited island in Puget Sound, hauling them to the mainland for deconstruction. This was the agency's largest operation of its kind, with 14 vessels removed, and the use of a helicopter was chosen to minimize disruption to the marine environment. The boat removal program has hauled out over 1,200 derelict vessels since 2002, addressing the challenge of people dumping old boats into the water. The optimism score is based on the positive environmental impact of the boat removal.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which were essential for early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The researchers conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period, and the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift was a critical feature of bird evolution. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly, though some species could glide or have powered flight.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review the latest data on mifepristone, a drug commonly used for medication abortions. The review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, but experts say concerns about its safety are misguided and fueled by a report from an advocacy group. Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after a thorough review determined it was safe and effective, and periodic reviews since its approval have not found new safety concerns. The optimism score is based on the fact that the FDA has previously determined the drug to be safe and effective.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump said the full travel bans and partial restrictions â€” affecting 19 countries in total â€” were because of what he called national security and public safety threats. Several countries were banned because of concerns over terrorism and their governments' lack of screening and vetting measures, while other countries are on the list because they don't have a "competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents." As well as having high overstay rates, some countries have also historically refused to take back their own citizens.
