          <p>The wife of a U.S. Coast Guardsman was arrested at the Naval Air Station in Key West after a routine security check revealed her work visa had expired in 2017. Homeland Security Investigations took her into custody after base personnel flagged her during a move-in day screening. While the Trump administration has prioritized immigration arrests, officials say this incident was not part of a broader sweep. The Navy cooperated with federal law enforcement authorities, emphasizing the importance of security and access at naval installations.</p>

          <p>A recent investigation reveals that a common aviation practice, visual separation, contributed to a fatal helicopter crash near Reagan National Airport in January. The Black Hawk crew requested and received permission to navigate visually around other aircraft, rather than relying on air traffic control. Aviation experts have long warned about the risks associated with mishandling visual separation, which, when mismanaged, can lead to deadly outcomes. The incident highlights the importance of stringent adherence to safety protocols even in routine aviation procedures.</p>

          <p>The Green Party is urging the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to withdraw its interim guidance on single-sex spaces, deeming it "ill-considered and impractical." The guidance, issued after a UK Supreme Court ruling, addresses the use of facilities by trans individuals. Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer argues the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination and creates confusion for employers and service providers. The Green Party advocates for more thoughtful guidance that considers the voices of all affected, as the Lib Dems also call for more guidance over the trans judgement.</p>

Repowering existing wind farms offers economic advantages, such as avoiding land acquisition costs and increasing electricity output. While new onshore wind farm growth has slowed, the U.S. is poised to surpass 160 GW of wind capacity in 2025, driven by the need to replace older turbines.</p>

          <p>Shareholders of Mayville Engineering Company (NYSE:MEC) have experienced substantial returns of 145% over the past five years, despite a recent quarterly share price drop. The company's transition from a loss to profitability has fueled significant share price growth. While the broader market gained, Mayville Engineering Company shareholders lost 11% in the last year, but they made 20% each year, over five years. Despite the drop, long-term investors may find the current sell-off an attractive opportunity, given the company's underlying business progress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan expressed cautious optimism regarding the Trump administration's approach to the war in Ukraine following President Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Sullivan noted Trump's more critical tone toward Putin after the meeting and Zelenskyy's positive comments, suggesting Trump may be recognizing Putin's role in prolonging the conflict. However, Sullivan cautioned against Trump reverting to placing pressure on Ukraine and making concessions to Russia, expressing concern about potential damage to America's credibility and alliances.</p>

          <p>Returning to a family business can be rewarding but also presents challenges. It requires learning the business, establishing trust, and navigating potential conflicts with family members and employees. Parents may have concerns about the returning child's expertise and intentions, and they may have other succession plans in mind. While it may mean giving up higher corporate salaries and perks, it can offer more control over one's life and the satisfaction of building value for the family. This decision requires a clear understanding of both the sacrifices and potential benefits.</p>
