            <p>President Trump's tariffs on imports from numerous countries, including a significant 104% on Chinese goods, have been implemented, escalating concerns about a potential global trade war. These tariffs, effective Wednesday, have disrupted the established global trading system, increased fears of recession, and caused instability in financial markets, with Asian markets showing a decline. The White House suggests these tariffs aim to initiate negotiations with trading partners, seeking deals that benefit American workers. However, China has expressed its determination to resist, vowing countermeasures to safeguard its interests amid rising trade tensions.</p>

            <p>India's central bank has lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6%, the lowest since September 2022, in an attempt to stimulate growth amidst a slowing economy. This decision aligns with analyst expectations and comes as the U.S. implements reciprocal tariffs, including a 26% levy on Indian goods. The Reserve Bank of India acknowledged that these tariffs have heightened uncertainties and pose challenges to global economic growth and inflation. The rate cut is also influenced by softening inflation, with the RBI expressing confidence in meeting its 4% inflation target over the next year. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have achieved a global first by using a real quantum computer to fine-tune an artificial intelligence (AI) model with 1 billion parameters. This breakthrough demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to improve the training of large language models. Using China's third-generation superconducting quantum computer, Origin Wukong, researchers achieved an 8.4% improvement in training performance while reducing the number of parameters by 76%. The improved AI model also showed better results on specific tasks, such as mental health conversation and math problem-solving.</p>

            <p>Chinese commentators suggest that China may retaliate against US tariffs by targeting the service sector, where the US has a trade surplus. Potential measures include restricting US firms from participating in government procurement and limiting cooperation between Chinese companies and US law firms. The move would expand the trade dispute beyond goods to include services. The commentators also suggest other countermeasures, including increasing tariffs on US soybeans and restricting imports of US poultry and Hollywood films.</p>
