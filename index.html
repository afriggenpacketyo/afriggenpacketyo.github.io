        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Emmanuel Macron has controversially reappointed Sébastien Lecornu as French Prime Minister, just four days after his previous resignation, following a week of intense political turmoil. Lecornu faces the daunting task of forming a government and presenting next year's budget to parliament by Monday, operating without a clear majority for Macron's party in the National Assembly. This unexpected move, made after talks with most major parties, has been met with skepticism and criticism from the opposition, including the far-right National Rally, who label it a "bad joke." Lecornu's challenge is immense, requiring him to stabilize France's public finances and address everyday problems for citizens amidst significant political division and Macron's record-low popularity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US stocks experienced their largest drop in months, with the S&P 500 falling 2.7%, after President Trump threatened a "massive increase of tariffs" on Chinese imports. This renewed trade tension stems from China's restrictions on rare earth exports and Trump's consideration of canceling a planned meeting with President Xi Jinping. The market, already seen by some as overpriced after a significant rally, reacted sharply to the uncertainty. Additional pressures included the ongoing US government shutdown and a third consecutive monthly decline in consumer sentiment, highlighting broader economic anxieties among consumers regarding high prices and weakening job prospects.

          <p>Applied Digital shares surged 16% on Friday, extending an impressive 344% year-to-date gain, following robust first-quarter revenue driven by high demand for artificial intelligence data centers. The company reported $64.2 million in revenue, an 84% increase from the previous year, and a narrower loss per share than anticipated by analysts. This strong performance is fueled by a substantial $7 billion lease agreement with CoreWeave for its Polaris Forge 1 campus and securing funding for a second North Dakota campus, totaling 600 MW capacity. CEO Wes Cummins emphasized the company's strategic position to serve the intelligence era, with hyperscalers expected to invest approximately $350 billion into AI deployment this year.

China's Ministry of Transport condemned US port fees as "discriminatory" and damaging to global trade, expanding a series of countermeasures that include new curbs on rare earth exports. This development further complicates the fragile US-China trade relationship ahead of an anticipated summit. (not investment advice)</p>

These measures include eliminating dozens of routes, reducing its fleet, and furloughing approximately one-third of its flight attendants, with ongoing negotiations for further concessions from its pilots' union. CEO Dave Davis views this milestone as crucial progress toward stabilizing the airline and securing its long-term future amidst past challenges like an engine recall and a failed acquisition.

This action, which the administration has long sought to implement to reduce the federal workforce, has immediately drawn a lawsuit from two major unions challenging its legality. Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have sharply criticized the decision, accusing the administration of causing "deliberate chaos" and using federal employees as political pawns in the funding stalemate.

          <p>Financial experts advise that the decision to open a gold IRA should primarily be driven by a desire for portfolio diversification, particularly in the current economic climate with expectations of continued record highs.

          <p>A proposed class-action lawsuit alleges that Amazon misled customers during its summer Prime Day sale by promoting "fictional" list prices to create the illusion of significant discounts. Plaintiffs Cathy Armstrong and Oluwa Fosudo claim Amazon advertised deals, such as 44% off headphones or 40% off a tablet, based on inflated original prices, making the "sale" prices appear better than they were. The lawsuit cites instances where Prime Day prices were higher than or similar to previous non-sale prices, arguing Amazon used "extreme time pressure" to entice purchases. Amazon declined to comment on the pending litigation, which follows similar accusations by a Substack newsletter.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled the vast Esmeralda 7 solar power project in Nevada, which would have been one of the world's largest, capable of powering nearly 2 million homes. This move, initially reported by Heatmap, signals a broader White House strategy to undermine renewable energy initiatives, following previous actions targeting wind power. While the Interior Department suggested developers could resubmit individual project proposals, the cancellation of this 185 sq-mile project, initially permitted under Joe Biden, marks a significant setback for clean energy. The administration's appointment of an oil industry trade group president to head the Bureau of Land Management further underscores its stance.</p>

          <p>Newly released documents have confirmed that Tony Blair met with Jeffrey Epstein in Downing Street in May 2002 while serving as UK Prime Minister, following advocacy from Lord Peter Mandelson. A senior civil servant's memo briefed Blair on Epstein, identifying him as a "super-rich" financial adviser and a friend of both Bill Clinton and Mandelson. Blair's spokesperson stated the meeting was brief, lasting less than 30 minutes, and took place years before Epstein's crimes and subsequent conviction for soliciting sexual assault from a minor became public knowledge. The disclosure of these documents, previously withheld due to concerns about UK-US relations, underscores the breadth of Epstein's connections within powerful political circles.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge has temporarily blocked California Attorney General Rob Bonta's attempt to place L.A. County's troubled juvenile halls into receivership, despite acknowledging "systemic failure" in improving conditions. The judge found Bonta had not met the legal grounds to strip local control, citing a lack of clarity in the 2021 settlement that mandated improvements. This decision comes after years of scandals, including drug overdoses and staff violence, which led to two halls being deemed unfit. While deferring immediate state takeover, the court emphasized the need for an "all-hands" mentality and scheduled further hearings, acknowledging the continued danger to youth in custody.</p>

          <p>Paul Ingrassia, President Trump's nominee to lead the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, has been reportedly accused of sexual harassment involving a lower-ranking female colleague on a business trip. Politico reported that Ingrassia allegedly arranged for the woman's hotel room to be canceled, forcing her to share a room with him, though they slept in separate beds. Ingrassia's lawyer denied the allegations, stating he "never harassed any coworkers." While an HR investigation reportedly cleared him, the woman later retracted her complaint due to fear of retaliation. This accusation further complicates Ingrassia's already faltering confirmation chances for the independent agency overseeing whistleblower complaints.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With increasing investor interest in physical gold due to inflation and economic uncertainty, understanding safe storage practices is crucial. Experts emphasize that physical gold carries unique risks like theft, damage, and natural disasters, unlike digital assets. Ben Nadelstein notes the importance of physical integrity for gold's value, while Brett Elliott highlights "contractual risk" with third-party facilities. Best practices include storing gold off-site at secure, independent depositories that are fully allocated, insured, and third-party audited, such as the Texas Bullion Depository. Investors should also be aware of storage costs, typically 0.33% to 0.5% of the gold's value annually, and understand liquidation terms. (not investment advice)</p>

The album was released in over 30 different versions, including various formats, artwork, merchandise, and bonus music, often marketed with time-limited offers and countdown clocks. This strategy transforms album releases into a high-pressure e-commerce event, encouraging fans to buy multiple copies and blurring the lines between art and commerce.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE) efforts to slash spending, federal expenditures increased by $301 billion in fiscal year 2025, reaching over $7 trillion. While tax collections also rose, the overall budget deficit only saw a minimal $8 billion reduction, still leaving a $1.8 trillion gap between spending and revenue. The Congressional Budget Office report highlights that the largest increases in spending were overwhelmingly in entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which collectively rose by $245 billion. This data underscores that significant fiscal reform requires addressing these major entitlement programs, rather than just cutting smaller government contracts. (not investment advice)</p>

President Trump had reportedly urged Turkish President Erdogan to leverage his nation's close ties with Hamas to secure the group's acceptance of the deal. The agreement outlines an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a partial Israeli troop withdrawal, with Turkey expected to join a task force alongside US, Egyptian, and Qatari units for implementation. Turkey's potential deployment of troops to Gaza, requiring parliamentary approval, underscores its growing geopolitical role and commitment to the peace initiative, despite lingering uncertainties about Israeli reservations.</p>

While details on tariff exemptions, similar to Pfizer's, remain unclear, AstraZeneca had already pledged a $50 billion investment in the US by 2030.

Legends like Manzanita Jr. and Pancho Acosta, along with Chacalón and Los Shapis, popularized the genre, making it the voice of marginalized migrants in Lima.

          <p>President Trump's direct intervention and strong-arming of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were instrumental in securing an initial Gaza ceasefire deal, which includes a hostage-prisoner exchange and a phased Israeli troop withdrawal. The article highlights that after months of Netanyahu's perceived obstruction, Trump leveraged significant US military and diplomatic support to compel an agreement. Despite Netanyahu's last-minute amendments allowing Israel to maintain forces in parts of Gaza, Hamas's qualified acceptance prompted Trump to decisively push for the deal's finalization. The author stresses the critical need for Trump to sustain this pressure on Netanyahu to ensure the ceasefire endures and the brutal war does not resume.</p>
