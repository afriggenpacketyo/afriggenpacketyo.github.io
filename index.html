          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a significant drop in second-quarter net earnings, largely due to a $3.76 billion writedown on its investment in Kraft Heinz. However, the company's operating earnings, a metric Buffett prefers, saw only a slight decline as its diverse portfolio of businesses generally performed well. The report also noted that Berkshire's massive cash reserve remains near a record high at $344.1 billion, as the company struggles to find attractively priced acquisition targets. This article also highlights speculation about potential mergers involving its BNSF railroad to compete with rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Palestinians in Gaza are facing a deepening starvation crisis, with residents describing the daily search for food as a "death journey." Despite some international aid deliveries and airdrops, many on the ground report that the assistance is insufficient and often dangerous to access, with hundreds reportedly killed trying to reach aid distribution sites. The article shares personal accounts of immense suffering, malnutrition, and psychological distress, as families struggle to survive on minimal resources. For many Gazans, diplomatic discussions about statehood feel meaningless without tangible changes to alleviate their desperate situation.</p>

          <p>Preliminary research from Hiroshima University in Japan suggests that a common sweetener could have anti-cancer properties. The study found that stevia leaf extract, when fermented with a specific bacterium, demonstrated enhanced ability to fight pancreatic cancer cells in a laboratory setting. While researchers believe this substance is a promising candidate for future treatment, medical experts caution that the findings are very early and have not been tested in humans. The study represents a step in the discovery process for new treatments, but more research is required to determine its safety and effectiveness in patients.</p>

The meeting occurred as families protested to urge the Israeli government to secure a deal, and it followed the release of distressing new videos of hostages by militant groups. The visit also came a day after Witkoff toured a U.S.-backed humanitarian aid distribution site in Gaza, which have become flashpoints of violence and desperation.

          <p>Authorities in southwestern Montana are continuing a large-scale manhunt for a suspect who allegedly shot and killed four people at a local bar. The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, fled the scene and is considered armed and dangerous, prompting officials to urge residents in the search area to remain indoors. Police have located the suspect's pickup truck, but the man remains at large, with the search focused on a highway west of the city of Anaconda. The motive for what authorities called a "senseless act of violence" remains unknown.</p>

          <p>The former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, William Beach, who was appointed by Donald Trump, has strongly condemned the president's firing of his successor, Erika McEntarfer. In a statement, Beach called the dismissal "totally groundless" and warned that it "sets a dangerous precedent" that undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics. The article notes that this criticism from a former Trump appointee adds significant weight to the backlash against the move, which has been widely viewed as an attempt to politicize a nonpartisan government agency. Trump defended the firing, stating a need for "people we can trust."</p>

          <p>Several senior Republican senators have publicly condemned President Trump's decision to fire the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, following a disappointing jobs report. Lawmakers including Cynthia Lummis, Thom Tillis, and Rand Paul expressed concerns that the move was impetuous and politicizes objective government data, which could damage public trust. Senator Lummis stated that if the statistics are accurate, it is not the statistician's fault that the president dislikes them. This criticism from within his own party highlights a significant split over the president's handling of unfavorable economic news.</p>

The report highlights that the least amount of space is found in large coastal cities like New York, Boston, and San Francisco, where housing demand far outstrips supply.

A key segment delves into potential childhood trauma, which he uses not for pity but as a springboard to examine how people process inflicting harm on others.

          <p>A federal jury in Miami has ordered Tesla to pay more than $240 million in damages after finding the company partially responsible for a 2019 crash that killed one person and severely injured another.

Lawyers for the victims also accused Tesla of hiding key data evidence, which was later uncovered by a forensic expert. Tesla called the verdict wrong and has stated it will appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>The average monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has surged to over €3,200, creating a significant financial burden for many seniors and their families. The sharp increase is primarily attributed to rising wages for care staff and an increase in staffing levels required in facilities. Germany's compulsory long-term care insurance only covers a portion of these costs, forcing many residents to rely on welfare or deplete their savings. The situation has prompted calls for urgent reform of the system, as an aging population is expected to exacerbate the financial pressures.</p>

Uribe, a polarizing figure credited by some for stabilizing the country but criticized by others for human rights abuses, has denied the charges and plans to appeal.

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially limited the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled that while the administration can continue to use its proclamation to deny access to the asylum system, it cannot use it to ignore U.S. laws that mandate protection for migrants facing persecution or torture. This means officials must still consider claims for "withholding of removal" and protection under the Convention Against Torture, which have a higher legal bar than asylum. The ruling represents a partial check on the administration's power to summarily expel all migrants without a hearing.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's restrictions on "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents cannot base arrests solely on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that using such factors to detain individuals violates the Constitution's protection against unreasonable seizures. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over raids conducted by the Trump administration that sparked widespread fear in the region's Latino community. The decision is being hailed by advocates as a crucial defense of constitutional rights for all individuals, regardless of immigration status.</p>

          <p>This article explores the duality of life for immigrants in Hamilton, Ohio, a town that has seen revitalization thanks to its growing Latin American community. While new businesses and cultural events signify a local dream, a climate of fear persists due to aggressive federal immigration enforcement and a controversial local sheriff who detains hundreds on immigration charges. The story highlights the tension between the community's positive contributions and the anxiety caused by the national crackdown, which has recently intensified with local deputies being certified as ICE agents. The situation reflects the broader American split on immigration policy and its human impact.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the legal strategies of imprisoned socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, including her recent meetings with the Department of Justice and her appeal to the Supreme Court. Legal experts suggest that her actions are likely a multi-pronged effort to secure her freedom from a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, rather than a genuine desire to reveal the full truth about Jeffrey Epstein. With avenues like a presidential pardon or clemency being explored, her cooperation is viewed skeptically as a calculated move to leverage the current political focus on Epstein. The piece questions whether any information she provides could be trusted given the context.</p>

          <p>A new Chinese-funded and constructed satellite data receiving ground station has been completed in Namibia, marking another step in China's growing space cooperation with African nations. The facility, located near the capital Windhoek, will help Namibia with environmental monitoring, disaster management, and resource assessment by processing remote sensing satellite data. As part of the partnership, China will also provide technical training to Namibian engineers to ensure independent operation of the station. The project is being hailed as a key example of China's support for developing Africa's own space infrastructure and capabilities.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece laments the denial of U.S. travel visas to a Venezuelan Little League team, preventing them from competing in the Senior League World Series in South Carolina. The team from Maracaibo, Venezuela, had won their Latin American qualifier but were unable to travel due to the visa denials, leaving the young players demoralized. The author questions the consistency and fairness of U.S. policy, which has exemptions for major sporting events, and asks what this decision implies for future international competitions like the World Cup and Olympics. The piece frames the situation as a heartbreaking denial of a cherished opportunity for young athletes.</p>

          <p>The European Union is grappling with a proposal to penalize Israel over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, revealing deep divisions among its 27 member states. For the first time, the European Commission has suggested barring Israeli startups from some EU research funds, citing violations of human rights and humanitarian law. However, the plan has stalled due to resistance from countries like Germany, while others like Spain, Ireland, and Sweden are pushing for even stronger measures, such as freezing the EU-Israel trade deal. The internal conflict highlights the bloc's struggle to back its diplomatic words with unified, concrete action.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man has appeared in court and been remanded in custody in connection with an incident where children at a summer camp in Leicestershire, England, fell ill. The man, Jon Ruben, faces three charges of wilful ill-treatment of a child after eight boys and one adult were hospitalized as a precaution. The charges allege that he gave the children sweets that were laced with a sedative.

          <p>Counter-terrorism police have made a seventh arrest in the investigation into a break-in at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where two military aircraft were damaged. The incident, which occurred in June, involved activists spray-painting and damaging two Voyager planes, causing an estimated £7 million in damages. The pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action, which has since been proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government, claimed responsibility for the act. Four individuals have already been charged in connection with the security breach, which prompted a review of security at all UK military bases.</p>

The move comes after Equinix's stock price dropped following an announcement of higher-than-expected capital expenditures, which concerned short-term investors. Elliott, known for its experience in the tech and data center sectors, likely sees long-term value in the company's expansion plans, which are a response to high demand from AI and hyperscaler growth. The article suggests Elliott may push for improved market communication, cost optimization, and financial restructuring to enhance shareholder returns. (not investment advice)</p>
