          <p>A recent study from Resumebuilder.com indicates a growing trend of managers using AI tools like ChatGPT for crucial personnel decisions, including hiring, promotions, and layoffs. Despite this reliance, the survey of over 1,300 managers found that a third have no formal training in using these technologies, raising concerns about fairness and accuracy. Experts warn that using AI without proper human oversight and high-quality data can lead to biased outcomes and potential legal challenges for companies, as AI systems can perpetuate existing biases.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his role in a scheme that uses fraudulent IT workers to generate revenue. These operatives, located in China and Russia, pose as American remote workers to secure jobs at global companies, with their earnings funneled to support North Korea's weapons programs. The scheme involved stealing U.S. citizens' personal information to create fake identities and has reportedly generated hundreds of millions of dollars for the Kim regime.</p>

          <p>This article presents a case for exploring credit card debt forgiveness in July, as millions of Americans struggle with high-interest debt. It argues that with Federal Reserve rate cuts unlikely this month and only minimal relief expected later, waiting is not a viable strategy while interest continues to compound. The piece suggests that high-rate debt negatively impacts overall financial health, including credit scores, making proactive solutions like debt forgiveness a potentially worthwhile option for eligible borrowers to regain financial stability.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a plan to impose tariffs of up to 200% on pharmaceuticals imported into the United States, with the measure potentially taking effect "very soon." However, he suggested that drugmakers would be given a grace period of about a year to a year and a half to adjust their operations and increase domestic production. This move is part of a broader Section 232 investigation into the national security impact of imports and has been met with resistance from pharmaceutical companies concerned about rising costs and supply chain disruptions.

These non-native bees now constitute about 90% of all bees in the surveyed coastal scrubland, a recognized biodiversity hotspot. The study found that honeybees can strip over 80% of pollen from native plants in a single day, leaving little for native species and potentially harming plant reproduction.

          <p>In a new federal court filing, the IRS has stated that churches and other houses of worship can endorse political candidates to their congregations without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This move effectively reverses a 70-year-old interpretation of the Johnson Amendment, which President Trump has long opposed. The filing argues that when a house of worship speaks to its congregation on electoral politics through the lens of faith, it does not constitute intervention in a political campaign. The change was part of a settlement in a lawsuit brought by religious groups against the IRS.</p>

          <p>Although the U.S. men's national soccer team lost the CONCACAF Gold Cup final 2-1 to Mexico, the tournament is being viewed as a strategic success by coach Mauricio Pochettino. With many star players absent, Pochettino used the event to test a younger, less experienced roster, challenging them to demonstrate heart and dedication ahead of the World Cup. Players like Diego Luna impressed, potentially earning spots on future rosters. The coach's message was that desire and pride are as crucial as talent, creating a new competitive standard for the team moving forward.</p>
