          <p>At least nine international students at Colorado universities had their F-1 student visas revoked by the Department of Homeland Security.  The reasons for the revocations remain unclear, with universities citing privacy concerns and refusing to identify the affected students.  Secretary of State Marco Rubio linked similar revocations nationwide to student protest involvement, sparking debate about due process and First Amendment rights.  The Department of Homeland Security has yet to comment.</p>

          <p>A Federal Reserve report reveals that 60% of Americans carry a credit card balance, facing interest rates averaging 23% annually.  This high cost of borrowing places significant stress on household budgets, particularly given the current economic climate.  The high rates are directly linked to the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate hikes aimed at combating inflation.  While future rate cuts may offer some relief, APRs are unlikely to fall drastically.</p>

          <p>Kevin Ryder has returned to KROQ-FM after being fired in 2020, marking a surprising comeback to the station where he worked for 30 years.  Ryder's return coincides with the return of his former boss, Kevin Weatherly, who is now the senior vice president of programming.  The unexpected reunion is described as a full-circle moment. Ryder's firing in 2020 was attributed to a change in station management and a shift in focus towards numbers over a family atmosphere.</p>
