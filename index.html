          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized that China-South Korea relations stand at a critical juncture for improvement, advocating for stability and continuity in Beijing's diplomatic approach. He urged both nations to prioritize friendship, expand shared interests, and judiciously handle sensitive issues to ensure the steady progress of their bilateral ties. The visiting South Korean delegation, led by former National Assembly speaker Park Byeong-seug, reciprocated this view, signaling Seoul's readiness to revitalize the strategic cooperative partnership through enhanced high-level exchanges and practical collaboration. This diplomatic push aims to reset relations following previous tensions, ensuring a more robust and mutually beneficial future for the two nations.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper has announced a significant acquisition, planning to take over Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's in a transaction valued at approximately $18 billion. Shareholders of JDE Peet's will receive 31.85 euros per share in cash, representing a substantial 33% premium over its recent stock price average. A key strategic outcome of this deal is Keurig Dr Pepper's intention to split its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, U.S.-listed entities, effectively reversing its 2018 merger between Keurig and Dr Pepper Snapple. This major restructuring aims to streamline operations, enhance market focus, and potentially unlock greater value for the company's various business segments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., are now carrying assigned service weapons, marking a significant escalation in President Trump's domestic law enforcement initiatives. This directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reverses previous guidance that troops would remain unarmed, despite a lack of reported threats that would necessitate weapons. Approximately 2,000 National Guard members are currently stationed in the city, primarily tasked with protecting landmarks and managing crowd control. Local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have criticized the initiative as unnecessary, pointing to a consistent decline in violent crime in D.C. over the last year and a half, contrary to the president's claims. This decision further deepens the federal government's intervention into local policing matters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant climb on Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surging over 2% to approach a four-year high, largely propelled by a robust tech sector rally. This positive momentum followed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish signals at Jackson Hole, hinting at potential monetary policy easing and interest rate cuts as early as next month. Additionally, Chinese property stocks saw strong gains after Shanghai relaxed home-buying restrictions, contributing to the overall market uplift. Analysts suggest maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining this momentum and potentially triggering capital rotation from the U.S. to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil undertook an unannounced visit to Kyiv, reaffirming Germany's steadfast support for Ukraine in its ongoing defense against the Russian invasion. Klingbeil highlighted the critical importance of establishing reliable security guarantees to secure lasting peace for both Ukraine and broader European security, asserting Germany's role as Ukraine's second-largest global supporter. This visit follows recent U.S.-Russia peace talks in Alaska that were widely criticized for excluding Ukraine and failing to produce concrete outcomes.

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased significantly in July, reaching a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, which marks its lowest point since January 2021 and falls below economists' projections. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, primarily due to falling prices in retail, other goods, electricity, and gas sectors. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) forecasts that inflation will remain moderate in the near term, attributing this to easing global crude oil prices and stable food commodity costs. Despite robust GDP growth earlier in the year, the MAS anticipates a moderation in economic growth during the second half, influenced by a "downshift" in the global trade environment and escalating trade tensions.

Despite a 2007 government commitment to dual the entire Inverness-Perth stretch by 2025, the project has faced significant delays, now pushed back to 2035, leading to widespread public frustration.

Travel tech company Flyr, alongside other industry innovators, aims to revolutionize the industry by integrating familiar features like shopping carts, enabling passengers to customize bookings with diverse seat classes, luggage allowances, and even combine multiple travelers on different flight segments within a single transaction. This significant shift will empower airlines to directly sell hotels, car rentals, and other ancillary services, allowing them to compete more effectively with online travel agents. Notably, Riyadh Air is poised to launch as the world's first "digitally native" airline, completely bypassing traditional Passenger Service System (PSS) technology.</p>

          <p>Boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. has been released from a Mexican prison, where he was held after being deported from the United States, and is now awaiting trial on serious charges of alleged cartel involvement and illegal arms trafficking. The son of the legendary boxer was deported in August for overstaying his visa and providing inaccurate information on a green card application. While released from custody, Chávez is strictly prohibited from leaving Mexico, and a three-month period has been set for further investigation into his case. Mexican prosecutors initiated their inquiry in 2019 following a U.S. complaint against the Sinaloa Cartel, which ultimately led to several arrest warrants, including one for Chávez, amidst ongoing U.S. pressure on Mexico to combat organized crime.</p>

          <p>A five-year-old boy tragically died after an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head inside an apartment in Chicago's Kenwood neighborhood on Sunday afternoon. Police responded to the scene, where a gun was recovered, and a source confirmed the boy accidentally shot himself. The family, who shared that their son had just started kindergarten last week, is understandably devastated by this sudden loss. This heartbreaking incident tragically underscores the critical importance of secure firearm storage, particularly advocating for the widespread use of gun locks, to prevent children's access to weapons in their homes. Advocates and the Chicago Department of Public Health emphasize the availability of free gun locks to help prevent such preventable tragedies.</p>

Baristas report frequent understaffing and chaotic "just-in-time" scheduling practices that severely disrupt personal lives, complicate child care, and limit consistent income. While Starbucks offers some benefits like healthcare and stock grants, many employees feel their concerns are unheard and believe that aggressive cost-cutting measures have eroded the company's once-supportive culture. Following a critical media report, Starbucks pledged reforms, including ending "clopening" shifts and improving scheduling, yet workers remain skeptical, demanding more fundamental changes like living wages and stable, predictable hours.</p>

This threat closely follows an FBI raid on former National Security Adviser John Bolton, another prominent Trump critic, and appears consistent with Trump's campaign pledges of political retribution against opponents.
