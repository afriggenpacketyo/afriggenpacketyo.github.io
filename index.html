          <p>Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who served as President Biden’s physician, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a House Oversight Committee deposition. Committee Chairman James Comer suggested the silence implies a cover-up regarding the former president's health, while Democrats argued it relates to patient confidentiality and an ongoing DOJ investigation into autopen use. The brief, 20-minute session ended with Dr. O'Connor refusing to answer any questions, fueling further political debate over the former president's fitness for office and the doctor's motivations.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, throwing three scoreless innings to help the Los Angeles Dodgers snap a seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. As he continues to build up his workload following Tommy John surgery, Ohtani struck out four batters and allowed only one hit, setting a positive tone for the team. While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan earned the official win, Ohtani's dominant start was crucial in halting the team's skid and showcasing his elite potential on the mound.</p>

          <p>England clinched a 2-0 series victory over Argentina after Jack van Poortvliet scored a dramatic, last-minute try to secure a 22-17 win in the second Test. The match was tied 17-17 for most of the second half until a late break by Guy Pepper set up the decisive score. The victory marks England's sixth consecutive Test win and is particularly impressive as the squad was missing numerous key players. The team will now travel to Washington to face the United States in their final summer Test.</p>

Democratic representatives described the conditions as "appalling," citing 85-degree temperatures in the medical area, small food portions, and claims of detainees drinking from toilets. Conversely, a Republican state senator found the beds comfortable and was satisfied with the facility. The visit followed weeks of denied access and lawsuits amid claims of inhumane conditions, which state officials continue to dispute.</p>

A leading demographer suggests that as AI evolves, it could fulfill roles traditionally met by family, such as providing emotional companionship and affordable elderly care. This perspective challenges conventional concerns, proposing that AI might redefine social structures in a way that makes declining birth rates less of a crisis by offering alternative forms of support.</p>

          <p>In what was dubbed the "shortest call" in his show's history, personal finance host Dave Ramsey gave immediate and direct advice to a long-time listener. The caller, who had $211,000 in cash and a $95,000 mortgage, was told without hesitation, "Good Lord. Pay it off today." The moment exemplified Ramsey's core philosophy of eliminating debt to achieve financial and emotional freedom. While financial experts might debate the mathematical returns of investing versus paying off a low-interest mortgage, the advice was classic Ramsey. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's fast-bowling consultant, Tim Southee, defended his team's use of delay tactics during a dramatic end to day three of the Test match against India at Lord's. After Indian players reacted angrily to Zak Crawley repeatedly delaying the bowler to avoid facing a second over, Southee pointed to India's own time-wasting earlier in the match. He specifically cited Indian captain Shubman Gill receiving a lengthy massage on the field, suggesting both sides were employing gamesmanship in what he called an "exciting way to finish" the day's play.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is quietly pushing back against escalating criticism from the Trump administration by posting a new FAQ page on its website defending its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. This move follows a letter from OMB Director Russell Vought attacking the project as an "ostentatious overhaul" and a sign of mismanagement. The Fed's page clarifies that the project is not funded by taxpayers and directly refutes specific claims, such as the construction of new VIP dining rooms, signaling a defense against increasing political pressure.

          <p>Across the United Kingdom, 71 people have been arrested during protests against the government's decision to proscribe the group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The arrests in London, Cardiff, and Manchester were primarily for the new criminal offense of showing support for the banned group. Palestine Action has engaged in direct action, primarily targeting arms companies linked to Israel. The government's ban has been criticized by some as an authoritarian misuse of anti-terror legislation, creating tension between national security and the right to protest.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into the fatal Air India crash that killed 260 people revealed that the plane's engine fuel cutoff switches flipped, starving the engines of fuel shortly after takeoff. An aviation analyst, reviewing the findings, suggests that a known chip malfunction, rather than pilot error, is a plausible cause. This theory is based on a service bulletin from the engine manufacturer advising maintenance on a flawed chip to prevent signal loss, which could lead to the fuel being cut off, offering a potential technical explanation for the tragedy.</p>

While the plague was responsible for the "Black Death" in the 14th century, human cases are now very rare in the U.S. and can be treated with modern antibiotics.
