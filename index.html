          <p>A private survey revealed that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in May, marking its sharpest decline since September 2022, as new export orders experienced a significant drop due to U.S. tariffs. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell below 50, indicating contraction for the first time since September of the previous year. The decline in foreign demand accelerated, with new export orders reaching their lowest level since July 2023, while the job market also deteriorated, with employment shrinking at the fastest rate since January. Increased uncertainty in the external trade environment has added to domestic economic challenges, causing major macroeconomic indicators to weaken at the start of the second quarter.

          <p>Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene resigned after failing to secure enough support in a confidence vote, triggered by weeks of public protests against corruption, inequality, and rising living costs. Oyun-Erdene received only 44 votes in the 126-seat parliament, falling short of the 64 needed to remain in office. Prior to the vote, he warned that the motion could destabilize the country and threaten its democracy, which adopted democracy after the fall of the Soviet Union. Protests were fueled by reports of lavish spending by Oyun-Erdene's son and a decline in Mongolia's Corruption Perceptions Index since he took office in 2021.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's new portrait has been posted to the White House website, nearly six months into his second term. The portrait, taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, features Trump wearing a blue suit coat, white button-up shirt, and a red tie, with an American flag pinned to his coat. The unveiling comes days after Trump announced the termination of Kim Sajet, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, citing her support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Sajet's termination followed reports that she donated to Democratic campaigns and curated a photo of Trump with a caption referencing his impeachments and the January 6th Capitol attack.</p>

The funds have been frozen in a UK bank account since the sale, following sanctions against Abramovich after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A disagreement centers on Abramovich's desire to donate the funds to all victims of the war in Ukraine, including those in Russia, while the UK government insists the money should solely benefit humanitarian efforts within Ukraine.

          <p>President Trump is intensifying pressure on Senate Republicans to pass a massive tax bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which contains the core of their legislative agenda. The White House is planning an "all-out advocacy effort" involving administration officials lobbying senators and potentially traveling to states to secure support. Major sticking points include concerns about the bill's cost and potential cuts to Medicaid coverage, leading to a political balancing act within the narrow Republican majority. Trump is directly engaging with senators, emphasizing that there will be no Medicaid benefit cuts.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his government will accelerate legislation to fast-track ambitious national projects aimed at boosting Canada's economy in response to tariffs imposed by President Trump. The plan involves identifying key "nation-building" projects, such as pipelines, nuclear reactors, and trade corridors, and streamlining the approval process to under two years. The goal is to strengthen Canada's economy, autonomy, and resilience amidst trade threats from the U.S., which has imposed tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and its auto sector. Canada's minister for US-Canada trade will resume trade talks with the U.S.</p>

Glasnow's setback is only mildly surprising given his extensive injury history, and he remains frustrated with the non-linear progress of his recovery.
