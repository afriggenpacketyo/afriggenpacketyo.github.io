          <p>A 37-year-old cryptocurrency investor, John Woeltz, was arrested in Manhattan for allegedly kidnapping and torturing a man for three weeks to obtain his Bitcoin password. The victim, an Italian tourist, was reportedly beaten, shocked, and threatened with a gun. Woeltz and another individual, Beatrice Folchi, held the victim captive in a luxury townhouse, demanding the password to his cryptocurrency wallet. Police found Polaroid pictures of the victim bound and assaulted, along with a gun and torture devices.

          <p>Nearly a third of the 260 miners trapped underground at a Sibanye-Stillwater gold mine in South Africa were safely brought to the surface after an accident damaged the hoist system.

While there were no fatalities or injuries, concerns were raised about the miners' well-being during the 24-hour ordeal.

          <p>Scientists have released high-definition images of the USS F-1, a U.S. submarine that sank off the coast of San Diego in 1917, killing 19 crew members.

The USS F-1 collided with another submarine during training exercises and was lost for nearly 60 years until its rediscovery in 1972.

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, portrayed as neutral, originated in Israel and involves foreign contractors, sidelining experienced aid agencies like the United Nations.

The New York Times article details the plan's development by the Mikveh Yisrael Forum, a group of Israeli officials and business people, who proposed hiring private contractors to distribute food in Gaza.

          <p>President Trump is putting pressure on US universities, particularly Harvard, by threatening to block them from enrolling foreign students and cutting federal funding. The conflict stems from Trump's belief that Harvard's teaching and research are dominated by left-wing ideologies. The DW article highlights the legal battle between Harvard and the administration, as well as the potential consequences for international students and the university's financial stability. The US government is demanding sweeping reforms to counter perceived left-wing dominance at Harvard faculties.</p>

          <p>After more than two months of a total blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza, Israel is now allowing a very limited number of trucks in, which aid agencies say is not enough and warn of famine in the coming weeks. Israel is planning to work with private US security and logistics firms to set up what it calls "secure hubs" to help agencies distribute humanitarian aid supplies to Palestinians in Gaza. The DW article discusses the challenges in distributing aid, including security clearances, logistical problems, and the need for at least 500 trucks per day to meet the population's needs.</p>
