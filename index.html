        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Industry data reveals that UK food inflation has reached its highest point in a year, primarily due to increased beef and fresh produce prices. The British Retail Consortium reports a 2.8% increase in food prices compared to the previous year, with supermarkets passing on higher minimum wages and employer National Insurance contributions. The British Meat Processors Association notes record-level beef prices due to strong demand and lower supply, with government schemes favoring environmental projects over production support. This article highlights the struggle for the industry to meet beef demand amidst rising costs.</p>

          <p>Former Congolese President Joseph Kabila's return to the spotlight, particularly his presence in Goma, which is controlled by the M23 rebel alliance, has sparked debate and concern. Kabila, who previously criticized President Felix Tshisekedi's government, is now accused of plotting an insurrection with the M23, leading to the ban of his party and the removal of his immunity. While some experts suggest engaging Kabila in talks, others fear his involvement could jeopardize mediation efforts and further destabilize the region. The article explores Kabila's history, his relationship with Tshisekedi, and the potential implications of his re-emergence on Congolese politics.</p>

          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe experienced a significant decline of 49% in April, attributed to brand damage stemming from CEO Elon Musk's political involvement and increasing competition. Despite overall electric car sales rising in Europe, Tesla's sales have tanked nearly 40% over the January-April period. The company faces challenges from traditional automakers and aggressive Chinese players like BYD, which recently outsold Tesla in Europe for pure electric cars. European consumers are also showing a preference for hybrid vehicles, a market segment where Tesla currently does not compete.</p>

          <p>The European Union and the United Kingdom are pushing to lower the price cap on Russian oil, currently set at $60 per barrel, as part of an 18th package of sanctions against Russia. The aim is to reduce Moscow's revenue from oil sales, but the United States is reportedly hesitant, citing concerns about disrupting supply and driving up energy prices. Experts emphasize that better enforcement of the existing cap is crucial, addressing issues such as attestation fraud and the shadow fleet of tankers used to evade sanctions.

Osaka expressed her disappointment, citing the pressure of expectations and a feeling of letting down her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.

          <p>The new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, has been detected in the United States, with symptoms similar to previous strains, primarily respiratory issues like cough and sore throat.

The Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access to seniors and those with underlying conditions, requiring major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use, raising concerns about potential public health impacts.

          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the United States rose 76% in April year-on-year, as Apple accelerates its "made in India" plans to adapt to Washington's tariffs against China. The surge contrasts with a 76% drop in shipments from China over the same period. While the Trump administration exempted iPhones from reciprocal tariffs, Apple CEO Tim Cook reiterated plans for most iPhones sold in the US to be manufactured in India. Analysts predict that growth will plateau due to India's limited manufacturing capacity and potential protectionist measures from Washington and Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson indicated that the government is considering removing the two-child benefit cap, acknowledging its contribution to poverty. The policy prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Phillipson warned that unwinding the policy would be costly but emphasized that the "cost of inaction" is also high due to the impact on children's life chances. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, when it publishes its child poverty strategy.</p>
