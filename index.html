          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index achieved a new record high, closing at 45,754.93 for its sixth consecutive session of gains, while the Topix index also set a new benchmark. In contrast, other markets across the Asia-Pacific region showed mixed results, diverging from Wall Street trends as investors sold off technology stocks like Nvidia. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index experienced a slight decline, while mainland China's CSI 300 saw an advance. The varied performance reflects differing regional economic signals and investor responses to U.S. market movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has installed a new "Presidential Walk of Fame" at the White House, featuring portraits of past presidents but notably excluding a traditional portrait of Joe Biden. In its place, Trump has displayed a photo of an autopen signing Biden's name, a gesture referencing his claims about Biden's fitness for office. This act is the latest in a series of efforts by Trump to delegitimize his predecessor. The display is part of several aesthetic changes Trump has made to the White House since returning to office.</p>

          <p>Denmark's Defense Minister has labeled recent drone incursions over several Danish airports, including a military base in Aalborg, as a form of hybrid attack. The repeated sightings have caused significant disruptions, leading to flight suspensions for several hours. This follows a similar incident near Copenhagen Airport, which the Prime Minister described as the most serious attack on the country's critical infrastructure to date. The incidents suggest a coordinated effort by what officials are calling a "capable actor."</p>

          <p>The British government is exploring options to provide financial support to suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after a major cyberattack forced the carmaker to halt production. With JLR's factories suspended until at least October, there are growing concerns that smaller suppliers who depend on the company could face bankruptcy. Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans or the direct purchase of component parts to maintain cash flow for these firms. The incident highlights the widening economic impact of corporate cyberattacks.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are one win away from clinching the National League West division title after a 5-4 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks in 11 innings. The game was notable for the Dodgers' unconventional but effective use of their pitching staff to overcome a late-game collapse by their traditional bullpen. Starting pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw both made successful relief appearances, providing crucial scoreless innings that set the stage for Tommy Edman's game-winning RBI single in the 11th.</p>

The attack, which Qatar was unable to defend against, has shaken assumptions about security guarantees from the U.S. and is pushing Gulf states toward greater strategic autonomy. While a formal, binding pact like NATO is considered unlikely, experts believe the incident is accelerating intelligence sharing and defense coordination among the Gulf states, Egypt, and Turkey.</p>
