          <p>A teenage boy and a man have been arrested following a suspected arson attack at a restaurant in Gants Hill, east London, which left three people critically injured. The incident, which occurred on Friday evening, resulted in five individuals being transported to the hospital. According to the Metropolitan Police, a 15-year-old and a 54-year-old were arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government is set to overhaul the asylum appeals system in an effort to reduce delays and decrease the number of migrants housed in hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that a new independent body of adjudicators will be established to handle appeals more swiftly than the current court system, where cases average over a year to be heard. The move comes amid pressure to end the use of asylum hotels, which currently accommodate 32,000 people. Critics, such as the Refugee Council, argue that the focus should be on making correct initial decisions to reduce the number of appeals.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine celebrated its 34th Independence Day, Russia launched a significant overnight attack involving 72 drones and a ballistic missile across the country. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted or suppressed 48 of the drones, but the remaining munitions caused impacts in 10 locations. In response, Ukraine conducted its own long-range drone strikes on Russian territory, targeting facilities including an oil refinery and a gas terminal. The attacks led to temporary flight restrictions at 11 Russian airports and caused a fire at the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, though officials reported normal radiation levels.</p>

          <p>The FBI is alerting senior citizens about the 'Phantom Hacker Scam,' a multi-phase scheme that has resulted in over $1 billion in losses since 2024. The scam involves impostors posing as tech support, financial institution employees, and government officials to trick victims into transferring their life savings into fraudulent accounts. A cybersecurity expert noted that artificial intelligence is making these scams more sophisticated and devastating, as criminals use AI to profile and target potential victims with personalized tactics. Victims rarely recover their funds, highlighting the need for increased awareness and family discussions about such financial threats.</p>

          <p>Internal Jesuit correspondence reveals that high-ranking officials knew about priest Donald B. Dickerson's history of molesting children but allowed his ordination in 1980. A lawsuit alleges he sexually assaulted a student at Loyola University New Orleans in 1984. The documents show that Pedro Arrupe, the Jesuit superior general at the time, was aware of concerns but Dickerson was ordained anyway.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has adopted a more confrontational political style in response to President Donald Trump's actions against the state. Newsom has initiated a special election to vote on a redistricting plan aimed at giving Democrats up to five additional U.S. House seats, directly countering a Republican-led gerrymander in Texas. This move, along with aggressive social media use and lawsuits, marks a shift from his earlier peacemaking approach. While this 'fight fire with fire' strategy has energized many Democrats, it also risks alienating voters who prefer a less combative approach to politics and principled governance.</p>

          <p>Coyotes are increasingly adapting to urban environments across the United States, with a notable pair, nicknamed Romeo and Juliet, residing in New York's Central Park. Originally confined to the western U.S., coyotes have expanded eastward due to a decline in predators and landscape changes. Researchers estimate there are around 20 coyotes in New York City and up to 4,000 in the Chicago area. Local photographers and conservationists are documenting the Central Park pair to educate the public and promote coexistence, emphasizing that the animals are not a threat if given space and not fed by humans.</p>

          <p>A new uncrewed naval vessel with significant stealth features was spotted during a rehearsal for China's Victory Day military parade in Beijing. The drone boat, transported on a semi-trailer, displayed a faceted hull, angled surfaces, and a concealed superstructure designed to reduce its radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures. Painted in Chinese navy camouflage without a hull number, the vessel appears to be over 15 meters long and includes a cockpit with windows, suggesting it can also be operated by a crew. This development indicates China's continued advancement in autonomous military technology and naval capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new TikTok trend has emerged where Gen Z users hold public contests to find the best impersonation of a 'performative male.' This archetype is characterized as a man who adopts an alternative, intellectual, and 'soft' aesthetic—such as carrying tote bags, reading feminist literature, and listening to indie female artists—often to attract progressive women. While largely humorous, the trend also taps into a deeper suspicion that these behaviors might be a deceptive act rather than a genuine expression of personality. The phenomenon reflects ongoing cultural conversations about authenticity, gender performance, and the distrust present in modern dating dynamics.</p>

          <p>A more effective approach to implementing artificial intelligence is to design it as a collaborative tool that enhances human expertise, rather than one that aims for full, and often flawed, automation. Prematurely automating complex jobs can lead to significant errors, as seen when an AI diagnostic tool decreased radiologists' accuracy or when an autopilot failure contributed to a plane crash. Instead, AI should function like a 'heads-up display,' providing data and insights that augment a professional's judgment. This collaborative model leverages AI's ability to process vast data while retaining essential human skills like contextual understanding, ethical intuition, and creative problem-solving.</p>

          <p>Despite growing favorability for socialism among young Americans and Democrats, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) struggles to translate numbers into significant political power. The organization is fractured by a deep ideological divide between a pragmatic, mass-politics wing that seeks to win elections within the Democratic Party, and a sectarian, extremist wing with anti-democratic and revolutionary stances. This internal conflict was evident at its recent convention, where resolutions were passed that would alienate mainstream politicians like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This factionalism prevents a unified strategy, leaving American socialism as a fragmented and politically ineffective force.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a mother reflects on the profound impact of reading aloud to her children, starting from the moment her first child was born. The practice evolved from reading Romantic poetry in the hospital to sharing simple, wordless board books, which she believes helped teach her infant to discern patterns and make sense of the world. She argues that this shared activity is not just about instilling a love for literature but is also a powerful tool for parents to understand their children's developing minds. As her child learned to recognize objects and speak their names, she realized she was not just reading a book, but learning to read her child.</p>

The sport offers a full-body, aerobic workout that improves bone density and has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and a longer life expectancy. Unlike less demanding racket sports, tennis requires complex motor coordination, rapid decision-making, and spatial awareness, which can enhance brain function and help stave off cognitive decline. With its growing popularity and accessibility on public courts, tennis provides a fun, safe, and uniquely beneficial form of exercise for all ages.</p>

          <p>A new book proposes a novel climate solution: creating a system of community-based 'carbon banks' that would treat sequestered carbon like a valuable, hoarded commodity, similar to how the U.S. government treats its gold reserves. The concept involves converting organic waste into a stable carbon form called biochar, which depositors would exchange for a local digital currency. This grassroots approach would create a tangible value for carbon sequestration without relying on politicians or large corporations. The authors suggest this could start on a small scale, like at a college, and grow into a movement that incentivizes climate-positive actions.</p>

The 2005 disaster, which flooded 80% of the city, was a long-predicted catastrophe resulting from an overwhelmed and flawed levee system. The federal response, particularly from FEMA, was widely criticized as inadequate and disorganized, highlighting systemic failures in disaster preparedness. While the levee system has since been rebuilt at a cost of nearly $15 billion, concerns persist about whether the crucial lessons from the storm's tragic aftermath have been truly integrated into national disaster response policy.</p>

          <p>Parents are bracing for higher prices on school supplies this year as President Trump's latest tariffs on imported goods take effect. A National Retail Federation survey found that 72% of parents anticipate increased costs, with many starting their shopping earlier due to these concerns. Total spending is projected to reach $39.4 billion, with families budgeting an average of $874. While some retailers like Target have pledged to hold prices on certain items, economists predict that companies will eventually pass the tariff costs on to consumers, a trend already beginning to appear in inflation data.

          <p>President Trump and his allies are facing accusations of engaging in 'lawfare' by using allegations of mortgage fraud to target political opponents. The strategy, led by Federal Housing Finance Agency head Bill Pulte, has targeted New York Attorney General Letitia James, Senator Adam Schiff, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Pulte has publicly accused them of owner-occupancy fraud to obtain more favorable loan terms. Critics argue this represents a weaponization of the legal system to intimidate opponents, drawing comparisons to tactics used in authoritarian regimes, and is a concerning sign for American political norms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid push for partisan redistricting in both Texas and California reflects an intensifying political battle for congressional power, largely driven by the current presidential administration. President Trump pressured Texas to redraw its maps to secure more Republican seats, prompting California's Governor Newsom to counter with a Democratic-favoring plan of his own. This tit-for-tat escalation has moved past traditional political norms, raising concerns among experts about the future of fair representation and the potential for voters in minority parties to be disenfranchised. The fight highlights a new era of unapologetic, hardball politics that could further polarize the nation.</p>

          <p>Members of the citizen commission that drew California's current political boundaries are split over Governor Gavin Newsom's proposal to replace their congressional map with a partisan gerrymander. While some commissioners are proud of their non-partisan work and oppose the new measure on principle, others feel it is a necessary response to Republican gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas. Sara Sadhwani, a Democratic commissioner, called it an 'extraordinary measure for extraordinary times.' The debate highlights the tension between upholding principles of fair representation and engaging in partisan warfare in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to decide a crucial immigration case concerning whether federal agents in Los Angeles can stop, question, and arrest Latinos based on a 'reasonable suspicion' that they are in the country illegally. The Trump administration argues that factors like apparent ethnicity, speaking Spanish, and presence in certain locations or occupations are sufficient for such stops. A lower court judge issued an order limiting this authority, which the administration has appealed. The ruling could have far-reaching consequences, potentially granting broad powers to immigration enforcement and impacting millions of citizens and legal residents.</p>
