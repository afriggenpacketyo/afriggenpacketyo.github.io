          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG pleaded guilty and will pay $511 million for conspiring to help wealthy American taxpayers hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. The Department of Justice stated that Credit Suisse AG Singapore held undeclared accounts for U.S. persons with over $2 billion in assets between 2014 and 2023. This criminal conspiracy allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations from 2010 through 2021, breaching a 2014 plea agreement where Credit Suisse paid $2.6 billion for similar offenses. The firm falsified bank records to conceal U.S. ownership and control of accounts, processing fictitious paperwork and maintaining accounts for undeclared clients.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA due to ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have caused hundreds of flight delays and cancellations. Schumer attributes the chaos to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, FAA cuts, outdated technology, and depleted federal funds. He also questions the FAA's decision to offer retention bonuses to air traffic controllers at some towers but not at Washington, Philadelphia, or New York. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights a day at Newark due to the disruptions, which are having ripple effects across major U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed uncertainty about upholding the Constitution, particularly regarding due process for undocumented immigrants, signaling a belief that the legal system should not impede immediate deportations. In an NBC News interview, Trump questioned whether everyone is entitled to due process, despite the Fifth Amendment's guarantee. He also cast doubt on due process in the Oval Office, suggesting it would hinder his mass deportation campaign. Trump has invoked the Alien Enemies Act to expedite deportations, though a federal judge barred its use, and has ignored a Supreme Court ruling to return a wrongly deported migrant.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order restricting federal funding for "gain-of-function" research, which involves experimenting with pathogens that could trigger a pandemic. The move comes amid controversy over the theory that COVID-19 originated from a Chinese lab, a theory refuted by many scientists. The order blocks U.S. funding for such research in "countries of concern" and prohibits U.S. dollars from contributing to foreign research likely to cause another pandemic. While some scientists support the restriction due to potential risks, others worry it could stifle research necessary to prevent future pandemics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it would cut off all new federal research grants to Harvard University, citing what it views as the school's "systemic pattern of violating federal law." Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused Harvard of ignoring antisemitism, engaging in discrimination, abandoning academic rigor, and disastrous mismanagement. The letter informs Harvard that it should no longer seek grants from the federal government, since none will be provided. This action does not affect federal student loan funding and Pell Grants. Harvard filed a lawsuit last month after the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts.</p>

While cardinals are officially banned from commenting, reporters are trying to uncover potential successors. The process aims to be guided by the Holy Spirit, but the election's outcome will have global implications, influencing everything from conflict resolution to sexual politics.

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel is "on the eve of a forceful entry to Gaza" after the security cabinet approved a new plan for additional soldiers to seize and hold territory and relocate Palestinians to the south.

Critics argue the expanded military campaign will endanger remaining hostages and won't fundamentally alter the conflict. The Israeli military says the operation will include moving most of Gaza’s population for their protection, but it is unclear if Israel plans to occupy all of Gaza.</p>

          <h2>American Support for Israel Declines, Polls Suggest</h2>

          <p>American support for Israel is dwindling, with a Gallup survey showing only 46% of Americans expressing support, the lowest level in 25 years. At the same time, 33% now sympathize with the Palestinians, the highest ever reading. While support for Israel is likely to continue long-term, these shifts raise questions over the practical extent and policy limits of US backing. The US has been Israel's most powerful ally since 1948. </p>

          <p>OpenAI, the parent of ChatGPT, has announced a new governance plan to remain under the control of its non-profit board, while becoming a public benefit corporation. The move comes after scrutiny of the startup's mission to create technology for the benefit of humanity. CEO Sam Altman said the non-profit will receive a stake in OpenAI's business arm, providing funds for its goals. The new plan will allow the organization to stop operating under its current complex governance structure, which had capped its profits.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that getting a shingles vaccine may lower the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, by 23% for up to 8 years. The protective effect was particularly prominent in men, people under 60, and those who smoke, drink, or aren't active. Researchers suggest that preventing shingles may lower the risks of blood vessel damage, inflammation, and clot formation that can lead to heart disease. This isn't the first time a shingles vaccine has been shown to have other possible health benefits.</p>

It also contains graphic footage of the damage caused by bottom trawling, while it emphasizes the ocean's capacity to recover faster than imagined, particularly the recovery of whale populations.
