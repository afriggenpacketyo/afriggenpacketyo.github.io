          <p>Houthi-run media reports that a US air strike on a detention center in Saada, Yemen, has killed at least 68 African migrants and injured 47 more. The center, reportedly holding 115 migrants, was struck multiple times, with graphic footage showing bodies amidst the rubble. While the US military has not commented, the strike occurred after intensified air campaigns against the Houthis. The Houthi-run interior ministry condemned the bombing as a war crime, while the UN's International Organisation for Migration expressed deep sadness and called for civilian protection.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Peru have discovered the 5,000-year-old remains of an "elite woman" at the sacred city of Caral, revealing the important role women played in the ancient civilization.

Her funerary trousseau included a toucan's beak, a stone bowl, and a straw basket, indicating her high social status and challenging the notion that only men held prominent roles in Caral society.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is increasing its reliance on domestically assembled drones as a key component of its defense strategy.

This shift comes as President Putin announced a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine, adding uncertainty to the ongoing conflict.

          <p>China is increasing its soybean imports from Brazil as trade tensions with the US escalate. An estimated 40 ships carrying Brazilian soybeans are expected to arrive at Ningbo Zhoushan Port this month, marking a 48% year-on-year increase. This shift is part of a broader trend of China reducing its reliance on US agricultural imports, highlighted by recent cancellations of American pork orders. The US has imposed tariffs totaling 145% on Chinese imports, while Beijing's levies on US goods have risen to 125%.</p>

The fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to poor decision-making, highlighting the need for caution and thorough due diligence before investing in private equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A national network of neofascist fight clubs is endorsing youth-oriented offshoots aimed at recruiting young men and boys into racist activism. These "active clubs" combine fitness and mixed martial arts with neo-Nazi and fascist ideologies. They are openly drawing inspiration from the Third Reich's obsession with machismo. The clubs are encouraging a seemingly mainstream version of masculinity, layered with ideologies promoting a US race war and using the popularity of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) as a gateway to recruiting.</p>

          <p>New York City has introduced its first new subway map in nearly 50 years, aiming to simplify navigation while maintaining essential information. The new design simplifies the boroughs' outlines, transforming Central Park into a green square, and uses bolder lines to distinguish between train routes. The map seeks to balance legibility with an accurate representation of the city, drawing inspiration from the divisive 1972 Unimark map. The changes reflect evolving navigation habits, as many now rely on digital maps above ground.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to reclassify civil servants, making them easier to fire, is facing strong opposition and potential legal challenges. The plan, known as Schedule F, aims to convert an estimated 50,000 government employees to at-will hires, raising concerns about political influence and the quality of government advice. Critics argue that the plan prioritizes personal fealty over expertise and could undermine the nonpartisan nature of the civil service. While there are legitimate concerns about accountability within the bureaucracy, replacing career employees with political hires may not solve the underlying issues.</p>

This situation challenges the long-standing union argument that tariffs would benefit American workers.
