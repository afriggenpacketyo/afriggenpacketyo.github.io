        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As autumn approaches, health officials are anticipating a seasonal increase in both influenza and COVID-19 cases, prompting public guidance on distinguishing between the two illnesses. While both viruses share symptoms like fever and fatigue, flu often presents more suddenly with body aches, whereas COVID-19's latest variants frequently include a hoarse throat and cold-like symptoms. Experts emphasize that vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe illness from either virus, particularly for vulnerable populations, helping to reduce hospitalizations and strain on healthcare systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new class of highly effective weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, is creating a significant divide between those who can afford them privately and those reliant on public health systems. In the UK, the National Health Service has strict eligibility criteria, leading to what some call a "postcode lottery" for access, while a booming private market serves wealthier individuals. This dynamic raises concerns that obesity, which is more prevalent in deprived areas, is becoming an issue of wealth, potentially worsening existing health inequalities as costs for private treatment remain high.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is set to announce a new immigration policy requiring migrants to actively earn their right to permanent settlement. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will outline proposals where legal migrants must demonstrate societal contribution, such as learning English to a high standard, maintaining a clean criminal record, and volunteering, to qualify for indefinite leave to remain. The plan aims to draw a clear distinction from the rival Reform UK party's more hardline stance, which seeks to abolish the status altogether, framing Labour's approach as one of "fair migration."</p>

          <h2>Chinese EV Manufacturer BYD Initiates Price War in Japan to Stimulate Low Demand</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD is resorting to significant price cuts in Japan in an effort to boost its sluggish sales in a market dominated by domestic brands. Despite expanding its sales network, BYD has struggled to attract Japanese consumers, who show strong loyalty to local automakers like Toyota. The company is now offering substantial discounts, which, combined with government subsidies, can slash vehicle prices by as much as half.

          <p>The UK's Labour government is working to mend its relationship with the business community, which has reportedly soured since the last budget announcement. Despite a pre-election charm offensive that won endorsements from prominent business leaders, post-election policies like a major rise in employers' National Insurance have led to what one tycoon called a "desperate loss of faith." While the government highlights major inward investments in the tech sector, many smaller businesses feel forgotten, burdened by rising costs. The challenge for the government is to reverse this sentiment and prove its pro-business promises were sincere.</p>

          <p>West Ham has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as its new manager, a move seen as a return to a more pragmatic, counter-attacking style of football. After previous attempts to implement a possession-based approach under other managers failed, Nuno's philosophy aligns more closely with the successful tenure of David Moyes. His tactical approach, which emphasizes a solid defensive structure and quick transitions, is expected to better suit the strengths of the current squad, particularly players like Jarrod Bowen. Beyond tactics, Nuno's reputation for strong interpersonal skills may also be crucial in revitalizing a team environment that had reportedly soured.</p>

          <p>A review of Kamala Harris's new election memoir, "107 Days," suggests the book reveals a politician overly focused on the spectacle and machinery of politics rather than substantive policy or a distinct vision. The article argues that the memoir portrays a candidate who valued celebrity endorsements and positive media coverage while failing to connect with voters outside her bubble. According to the review, the book shows little evidence of a unique agenda that would have meaningfully diverged from the Biden administration's policies. It ultimately paints a picture of a campaign that was hindered by a lack of self-awareness and an inability to build a broad, convincing coalition.</p>

          <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs suggest that China's central bank is increasingly likely to ease its monetary policy in the fourth quarter to support slowing economic growth. The forecast includes a potential 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. This projection follows a recent central bank meeting where officials maintained a dovish stance but offered few new signals. The bank's analysts noted a subtle shift in the official description of the economy, suggesting a more cautious outlook as policymakers aim to keep full-year growth on track for the "around 5 percent" target.

          <p>Denmark has temporarily banned all civilian drone flights across the country as a security measure for an upcoming European Union summit in Copenhagen. The decision follows a series of recent "drone incidents," including sightings over Danish military sites, which have heightened security concerns. The transport ministry stated the ban was necessary to simplify police work and prevent foreign drones from creating uncertainty. This move comes as several other European nations, including Norway and Romania, have also reported unidentified drone activity, prompting a wider regional response to what some officials are calling a "hybrid attack."</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced he is ending his bid for reelection, citing an inability to raise sufficient funds for a competitive campaign. His decision comes amid ongoing media speculation about his political future and a decision by the Campaign Finance Board to withhold millions of dollars in matching funds. Adams' withdrawal reshapes the race, which now primarily features Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. In his announcement, Adams defended his record and maintained that he was "wrongfully charged" in a federal corruption case that has shadowed his administration.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed a new mobile air defense system, the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC), to one of its bases in South Korea for the first time. The system is designed to counter threats such as cruise missiles, drones, rockets, and mortars, functioning similarly to Israel's Iron Dome. This deployment is seen as a strategic response to the evolving military capabilities of both North Korea and China. The move follows reports earlier this year that the U.S. Army was considering sending prototype missile defense technologies to global hotspots to enhance the protection of its forces and allies in strategically important regions.</p>

          <p>The ongoing decline of American shopping malls is creating new opportunities for small and local businesses to secure prime commercial real estate that was previously unaffordable. With national vacancy rates in shopping centers rising, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms, lower rents, and other incentives to fill empty storefronts. This trend is allowing a diverse range of entrepreneurs, from wellness practitioners to gourmet food sellers, to establish a physical presence in high-traffic areas. While the opportunities vary by region, the overall softening of the commercial rental market is enabling a revitalization of some retail spaces with unique, local businesses.</p>

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally this year, with the CSI 300 index climbing about 16%, fueled by optimism in the technology and AI sectors. However, the surge, largely driven by retail investors shifting savings into equities, is raising concerns about a potential bubble, as it appears disconnected from slowing macroeconomic fundamentals. While some analysts see policy support and potential for further retail investment, others warn of excessive leverage and overheating in specific sectors. The market's momentum is currently based more on expectations for future structural improvements rather than on current economic performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Typhoon Bualoi struck Vietnam with winds exceeding 130 kilometers per hour, leading to at least one death, flooding, and the evacuation of thousands of residents. The storm, which had already caused fatalities in the Philippines, made landfall sooner than predicted, forcing the closure of four airports in the country's central region and causing hundreds of flight cancellations. Authorities have issued warnings for flash floods and landslides as the typhoon is expected to move slowly over land, bringing extended periods of heavy rain.
