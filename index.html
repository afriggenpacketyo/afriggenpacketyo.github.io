          <p>The UK chancellor announced that changes to winter fuel payments, allowing more people to receive them, will be implemented this year.  This follows criticism of the previous system, which limited eligibility to pension credit recipients, impacting 10 million pensioners.  While the chancellor stated that the means test will be broadened, specific details remain unclear until the autumn budget. The previous system was deemed unfair due to millionaires receiving the payment.</p>
