          <p>Former President Donald Trump has declared a new 25% tariff on Indian goods, scheduled to begin on August 1. This measure is accompanied by an unspecified "penalty" due to India's trade practices and its significant military and energy purchases from Russia. Trump criticized India for what he described as some of the world's highest tariffs and obstructive trade barriers. The move is part of his broader strategy to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, though economists question the effectiveness and potential consequences of such protectionist policies.

          <p>Senator Tom Cotton is urging the Justice Department to investigate former Special Counsel Jack Smith for allegedly attempting to unlawfully influence the 2024 election. In a letter, Cotton accuses Smith of using his position to take politically motivated actions against Donald Trump, such as fast-tracking trial dates and violating the DOJ's "60-day rule" before an election. The senator claims these actions lacked legitimate purpose beyond affecting the election's outcome and is calling for the Office of Special Counsel to determine if Smith or his team broke federal law.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old student, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, has been found guilty of assaulting two female police officers during a violent altercation at Manchester Airport in July of last year. The incident, which was captured on mobile phones and widely shared, resulted in one officer suffering a broken nose. Amaaz was convicted of assault causing actual bodily harm and assault on an emergency worker, though the jury could not reach a verdict on another assault charge involving him and his brother. Prosecutors are now seeking a retrial for the undecided counts.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether seniors who receive Social Security benefits should also consider purchasing annuities to supplement their retirement income. While both provide a steady income stream, annuities can offer an additional layer of financial security and diversify income sources, which is valuable given that Social Security was not designed to be a sole retirement fund. However, the decision depends on individual circumstances, such as life expectancy, risk tolerance, and the need for liquidity, as annuities typically require a significant upfront investment. The article advises careful consideration and consultation with a financial advisor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of Senate Democrats, led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, is invoking a little-known federal law to compel the Justice Department to release investigative files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Citing a statute that allows five members of the Senate Governmental Affairs panel to request information, they have set an August 15 deadline. The senators argue the Trump administration has failed to follow through on previous promises to declassify the documents, creating a need for this formal demand to ensure full transparency.</p>

This oversupply is most pronounced in formerly booming markets in the South and Mountain West, such as Austin, Texas, which has seen the steepest rent declines.

While consumer spending also accelerated, a key underlying measure of private domestic demand showed much weaker growth of only 1.2%, suggesting that the economy's strength may be overstated by the headline number.

While not intending to disrupt the Lions' traditional tours to the Southern Hemisphere, the FFR sees opportunities within the new global calendar.

          <p>A new frontier in renewable energy, known as "superhot" geothermal, is being developed to meet the world's growing power demands, particularly for AI data centers. This technology involves drilling miles deep to access extremely hot rocks, which can generate five to ten times more energy per well than conventional geothermal methods. Startups like Quaise Energy are pioneering techniques to vaporize rock and reach these depths, with plans to build the first superhot geothermal power plant by 2028. The approach is seen as a promising way to provide a consistent, powerful source of clean energy.</p>

          <p>As more Americans, including high-income earners, struggle with debt, this article outlines six practical methods for getting finances under control. The strategies include negotiating lower interest rates with creditors, consolidating multiple debts into a single loan, and using a 0% APR balance transfer card to pause interest accrual. For more structured approaches, the "debt snowball" or "debt avalanche" methods are recommended to systematically pay down balances. As a last resort for those with overwhelming debt, the article also discusses debt settlement and bankruptcy as potential, albeit serious, options for a financial reset. (not investment advice)</p>
