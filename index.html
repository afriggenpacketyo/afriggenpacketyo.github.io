            <h2>Judge Temporarily Halts Trump's Order Targeting Law Firm Representing Dominion</h2>

            <p>A federal judge blocked President Trump's executive order against Susman Godfrey, a law firm representing Dominion Voting Systems. The order aimed to restrict the firm's access to government buildings and contracts, stemming from their representation of Dominion in election fraud claims against Fox News, which resulted in a large settlement. Judge AliKhan strongly criticized the order as a "shocking abuse of power" based on a personal vendetta, arguing it chills the firm's speech and advocacy. The ruling prevents enforcement for 14 days and requires the government to rescind related memos. (not investment advice)</p>

The email asks about impacts on sourcing, pricing, logistics, and warehousing. The tariffs, especially those on goods from China, could significantly burden these sellers, who account for 60% of Amazon's products. While some sellers plan to maintain prices, the tariffs could force others out of business, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy suggests costs may ultimately pass to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is reviewing Trump v. Wilcox, a case concerning the "unitary executive" theory, which could grant the president greater control over federal agencies. The case questions the independence of agencies like the Federal Reserve and whether the President can fire officials at will. A ruling favoring Trump could unravel civil service protections and anti-corruption reforms, potentially impacting the Fed's independence and leading to economic instability. The decision could significantly expand presidential powers.</p>

If Abrego Garcia returns, DHS intends to detain him due to alleged MS-13 membership and potentially remove him to a third country or El Salvador.

            <p>U.S. stocks closed down slightly on Tuesday due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all experienced minor declines. The market is reacting to mixed signals from the White House, with Trump signaling both a willingness to ease some tariffs and impose new ones. European markets, however, traded higher following the European Commission's pause on planned tariff countermeasures. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Mario Vargas Llosa, who passed away at 89, was a novelist known for his lifelong obsession with Peru and his evolving political views. Starting as a Marxist, he later became a proponent of free speech and market economies. His novels, such as "Conversation in the Cathedral" and "The War of the End of the World," explored political corruption and the excesses of power. The author's shift from the left to the right reflected the complexities of his thinking and his courage to challenge prevailing ideologies.</p>

The squid, measuring about one foot in length, was captured on camera by an underwater vehicle operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute. Researchers believe the squid's sensitive eyes likely cause them to avoid research equipment. The footage allows scientists to gather more information about their behavior during the early stages of life.</p>
