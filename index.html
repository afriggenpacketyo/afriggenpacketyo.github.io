          <p>Senate Republicans have released the final text of a massive budget reconciliation bill, a key part of President Trump's agenda. The legislation, which combines proposals from ten committees, faces significant hurdles due to internal party disagreements over provisions like state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps and Medicaid funding. Despite the infighting and a tight timeline to get the bill to the president's desk by July 4, leadership remains publicly confident. The bill's passage is uncertain, with procedural votes and a potential "vote-a-rama" of amendments still to come. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marius Borg Hoiby, the 28-year-old son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has been formally charged with multiple counts of sexual assault and bodily harm following a ten-month investigation. Prosecutors state the charges involve a "double-digit" number of victims and include one case of sexual assault involving intercourse. Hoiby, who does not hold a royal title, has previously admitted to violence under the influence of drugs and alcohol. His defense attorney stated that Hoiby takes the accusations seriously but denies wrongdoing in most cases, particularly those involving sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>The NHL's first non-pandemic decentralized draft drew criticism for its awkward and impersonal format, with team representatives making selections from their home cities rather than a central venue. Kings GM Ken Holland was among those who preferred the old system, which fostered excitement and a shared experience for players and their families. The new format was plagued by technical glitches, such as audio issues during virtual calls between draftees and team management, creating a disjointed atmosphere. Despite the logistical issues, the draft proceeded with top prospects being selected as expected by teams like the Islanders and Ducks.</p>

The meeting occurred as the Trump administration hints at extending a 90-day pause on certain "reciprocal tariffs" beyond its early July expiration. President Trump has maintained a hardline stance, suggesting he could impose a 25% tariff on all trading partners, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope that trade deals with key partners could be finalized by September.

          <p>A team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted via blood vessels, a less invasive alternative to open-skull surgery. The procedure involved inserting a stent electrode into a patient's intracranial vasculature through a neck vein. This allowed a 67-year-old patient, paralyzed on one side from a stroke, to regain some limb movement. This minimally invasive approach, which contrasts with methods like Elon Musk's Neuralink, aims to reduce surgical risks and shorten patient recovery times.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have charged 11 individuals in connection with a Russia-based scheme that allegedly defrauded the Medicare program of $10.6 billion. The indictment claims the "transnational criminal organization" purchased legitimate medical equipment companies to submit fraudulent claims for equipment that was never provided. The personal information of over a million Medicare recipients was reportedly stolen and used in the scheme, which ran from 2022 to 2024. The organization, allegedly led by a Russia-based individual, laundered the proceeds through shell companies and cryptocurrency.</p>

          <p>A 6-3 Supreme Court decision affirmed the right of parents to opt their children out of public school lessons that conflict with their religious beliefs, specifically targeting a curriculum in Montgomery County, Md., that included LGBTQ+ themed storybooks. The ruling brings nine specific picture books, such as "Uncle Bobby's Wedding" and "Pride Puppy," into the legal spotlight. The majority opinion argued that the books promote messages contrary to some parents' religious principles, while the dissent, which reproduced one book in its entirety, argued that excluding such books fails to acknowledge the reality that LGBTQ+ people exist in society.</p>

          <p>Canadian businesses are struggling with the economic uncertainty caused by the ongoing, unpredictable tariff war with the United States, their largest trading partner. Business owners express frustration over the shifting rules, which make future planning nearly impossible and have led to significant, unexpected costs. The tit-for-tat tariffs have slowed Canada's economy, and recent trade talks were abruptly terminated by President Trump. While some business owners remain resilient, they emphasize the critical need for a stable set of trade rules to operate effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court decision limiting nationwide injunctions has cleared a path for the Trump administration to begin implementing its executive order to end birthright citizenship, though the order's constitutionality remains undecided. The ruling means lower courts must narrow their injunctions, potentially allowing the policy to take effect in 28 states that did not sue. Many practical questions about implementation, such as how citizenship will be verified at birth, remain unanswered by the White House. Legal challenges to the order's core constitutionality will continue, and new class-action lawsuits are already being filed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted 53-47 against a resolution that would have required President Trump to seek congressional approval before taking further military action against Iran. The vote came amid Democratic frustration over a lack of transparency regarding recent U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. Some Democrats have questioned the administration's claims about the extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear program, suggesting the public was misled. Despite the failure of this resolution, the debate highlights the ongoing constitutional tensions between presidential war powers and congressional oversight.</p>

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' concrete flood wall system, reinforced after Hurricane Katrina, are sinking at an alarming rate, in some areas nearly two inches per year. This subsidence is occurring faster than sea levels are rising, potentially degrading the city's flood protection. The research, which used satellite radar data, identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites and new developments, likely due to soil compression and groundwater withdrawal. The findings serve as a wake-up call for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to protect the low-lying city.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has significantly limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. In a 6-3 decision related to President Trump's birthright citizenship order, the court ruled that such sweeping orders likely exceed the authority granted to federal courts. The ruling allows the Trump administration to narrow existing injunctions against its policies, though it does not rule on the constitutionality of the policies themselves. The decision is a major victory for the executive branch, curbing a key tool used to challenge its actions.</p>

The bill's proposed work requirements for Medicaid recipients are a primary concern, as Newsom estimates millions in the state would struggle with the verification process and lose coverage.

The institute noted that specific foods in the diet, such as those rich in folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to this effect by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters and providing anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour government's sudden U-turn on planned welfare reforms has raised significant questions about its day-to-day management and overall long-term strategy. The government reversed course on tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (Pip) to avoid a major rebellion from its own MPs. This analysis suggests the initial cuts were a short-term, cost-cutting exercise to meet borrowing rules rather than a well-thought-out reform. The reversal leaves a multi-billion-pound hole in the budget and casts doubt on the government's ability to enact its plans and tackle structural economic issues. (not investment advice)</p>
