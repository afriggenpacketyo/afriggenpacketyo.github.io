          <p>A popular Mexican band, Los Tucanes de Tijuana, was fined over $36,000 for performing songs that glorified drug cartels during a concert in Chihuahua. City officials stated that nearly a third of their songs, known as "narcocorridos," promoted illegal activities and their perpetrators. Restrictions on this subgenre of regional music are increasing across Mexico, sometimes leading to unrest. The United States has also revoked visas for musicians showing support for wanted drug lords, highlighting the consequences of expressing support for criminals through artistic expression. This issue underscores the intersection of freedom of expression and its potential impact on society, especially among young people.</p>

          <p>Amazon is expanding its Amazon One palm scanning service to various locations, including NYU Langone Health facilities, raising privacy concerns. The technology, which verifies identity by scanning a person's palm, is being marketed as an alternative to traditional methods like fobs and codes. While Amazon states that palm data is separate from Amazon.com profiles and not shared with advertisers, privacy watchdogs caution that the vast amount of data Amazon collects across its various businesses could potentially be combined to infer sensitive information. The convenience of biometric scanning is weighed against the potential risks of data breaches and the long-term implications of tech companies controlling digital identities.</p>

This follows the company's previous failed attempt, which ended in a crash landing, and aims to deploy a mini rover named Tenacious to gather lunar soil. The mission seeks to scout the area with a high-definition camera and conduct experiments related to lunar infrastructure development, including electrolysis and food production. The CEO considers this mission a stepping stone towards establishing a permanent human presence on the moon, as other companies also plan lunar landings this year.</p>

          <p>A review of Caroline Fraser's "Murderland" chronicles the serial-killer epidemic in the U.S. during the 1970s and '80s, focusing on Seattle and Tacoma. The book links the killers to the American Smelting and Refining Co. (ASARCO), which released toxins into the air. Fraser explores the uncanny pattern of polluting smelters and the men brought up in their shadows, prone to mood swings and erratic tantrums, and laments the lack of accountability that the wealthy Guggenheim family has faced for operating a company that spewed toxins in Tacoma air for decades. The book is a vivisection of our darkest urges.</p>

          <h2>Algae Bloom Ends, Marine Mammals Still at Risk</h2>

          <p>A lethal algae bloom in Southern California has ended, but marine mammals are still at risk due to neurotoxin poisoning. The bloom was one of the largest and longest in the region's history, killing hundreds of dolphins and sea lions. Scientists are investigating whether runoff from January's firestorms contributed to the bloom's intensity. The outbreak was particularly deadly for breeding females, and researchers are grappling with the catastrophe's full impact on marine mammal species.</p>

          <p>Six California gubernatorial candidates, four Democrats and two Republicans, participated in a bipartisan forum to discuss the state's affordability crisis. The candidates agreed that the high cost of living is a pressing issue, but their strategies for improving the state's economy diverged along party lines. The candidates discussed housing costs, high-speed rail, tariffs, climate change, and homelessness, with Democrats emphasizing the need for higher wages and Republicans advocating for reduced regulations. The event marked the first time Democratic and Republican candidates have shared a stage in the 2026 governor race.</p>

          <p>The Glendale City Jail is housing immigrants detained by ICE under a longstanding contract, making it an outlier in California due to sanctuary laws. The city defends the detentions, stating that the contract is compliant with state law, but advocates fear it exploits a loophole and goes against the principles of separating local resources from federal immigration enforcement. The arrangement raises questions amid increased enforcement efforts by the Trump administration, and advocates are urging the city to abandon the contract.</p>

While some residents resist outside investors, about 145 lots have sold, and roughly 100 are listed. Locals fear new builds won’t match Altadena's charm and could bring gentrification, while nonprofits try to buy lots to resell below market value to displaced locals. Real estate agents say rebuilding is complex, and professionals are more equipped to handle the bureaucratic process of building in L.A.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger routinely deletes her text messages, similar to Mayor Karen Bass, raising concerns about transparency. Barger's office provided no written communications in response to a public records request for her communications with Bass during the January firestorms. Other supervisors do not use the auto-delete function on their phones, and county policy states that electronic communications on county devices are the property of the county. This practice has raised questions about compliance with record retention policies and transparency in government communications.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that the "China shock" narrative, which blames China's rise for the decline of American manufacturing, is not supported by rigorous evidence. The author cites research suggesting that the negative effects of trade with China have been exaggerated and that job losses in exposed areas were often offset by gains in other sectors. The author also notes that the decline in U.S. manufacturing employment began decades before China's WTO entry and that former manufacturing workers generally did not face permanent unemployment. The author concludes that the real shock America faces is from a resurgence of misguided protectionism based on a misdiagnosed problem. (not investment advice)</p>

The author criticizes the Trump administration for embodying this culture and promoting policies based on vengeance and violence, as well as the widespread availability and ownership of guns which inevitably leads to more death.
