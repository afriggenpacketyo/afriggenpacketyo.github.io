          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is facing federal arraignment on mortgage fraud charges in Virginia. The indictment was brought by a U.S. attorney appointed by President Trump, who had publicly called for James's prosecution. The charges allege James misrepresented a property as a second home to secure a better mortgage rate, while her defense claims the case is baseless political retribution for her legal actions against Trump. James's legal team is challenging the prosecutor's appointment and alleging improper leaks to the media.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines has resumed operations following a significant, system-wide IT outage that prompted a nationwide ground stop for both its and Horizon Air's flights. The disruption led to over 229 flight cancellations, with the airline warning that further delays are likely as they work to reposition aircraft and crews. The ground stop was lifted late Thursday evening, and the airline has implemented a flexible travel policy to assist affected passengers. The carrier has not specified the exact nature of the technical issue that caused the widespread halt.</p>

          <p>An inquest has revealed that Ian Watkins, the former singer of the band Lostprophets, died from a stab wound to the neck while imprisoned at HMP Wakefield. Watkins was serving a 29-year sentence for numerous child sex offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. The coroner's court has adjourned the inquest pending the outcome of a murder trial, for which two men have been charged. Watkins had previously been stabbed in a non-fatal attack in prison in 2023.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts on nuclear policy have analyzed the new film "A House of Dynamite," praising its authentic depiction of the U.S. command-and-control systems for nuclear response, such as the "doomsday" video conference and the presidential "football." However, they critique the film's premise of a single, out-of-the-blue missile strike as less realistic than an escalation from a conventional conflict. Specialists also noted that the U.S. doctrine would likely favor absorbing the initial attack to confirm the aggressor before launching a retaliatory second strike, a choice the film overlooks.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown has left approximately 1.4 million federal employees without pay, forcing many to rely on food banks and emergency loans to cover basic expenses. While some essential workers continue their duties unpaid, others are furloughed, creating widespread financial and mental stress. The shutdown's economic impact is beginning to affect local communities that depend on federal worker spending. Despite the hardship, the Trump administration has found ways to pay certain employees, particularly in defense and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that President Trump's pressure has successfully compelled NATO allies to meet their defense spending commitments, increasing from a few nations to nearly all members spending 5% of their GDP on defense. The author argues this same firm approach should be applied to ensure foreign governments, including allies, honor their commercial contracts and financial obligations to U.S. companies. The article cites alleged unpaid debts and disputes in countries like Mexico, Kuwait, and Honduras as examples where stronger U.S. diplomatic and economic pressure is needed to protect American business interests.</p>

Key topics of discussion include Shohei Ohtani's status as one of the greatest players ever and the strategies each team must employ to win. For the Blue Jays, success hinges on their powerful hitters, like Vladimir Guerrero Jr., pressuring the Dodgers' dominant starting pitchers. The Dodgers, meanwhile, are favored to win if their deep pitching rotation continues to perform and their star-studded lineup receives support from the bottom of the order. Most panelists predict a Dodgers victory.</p>

Critics argue the strikes may violate international law and constitute extrajudicial killings, as no public evidence has been provided to confirm the targets were cartel members.

The report notes that only 37% of child exploitation cases were correctly flagged on police systems, indicating that opportunities for intervention are still being missed.

          <p>A prominent Chinese scholar has called for both China and the United States to exercise self-restraint and stop the escalating weaponization of their economic relationship. Speaking at the Bund Summit in Shanghai, Da Wei of Tsinghua University urged both nations to cease finding new economic tools to use against each other. His comments come as officials from both countries prepare for a new round of trade negotiations in Malaysia, where China's recently expanded export controls on rare earth elements are expected to be a key point of discussion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis highlights the stunning collapse of support for the UK's two major parties in the Caerphilly by-election, where Labour and the Conservatives secured just 11% and 2% of the vote respectively. The commentary frames the victory for Plaid Cymru's Lindsay Whittle as a monumental event, ending over a century of Labour dominance and demonstrating a significant voter shift. The result poses serious questions for both Labour's hold on Wales and Reform UK's ability to convert insurgent energy into victories, particularly in regions with strong alternative parties.</p>

          <p>An extensive FBI investigation into illegal sports betting has resulted in the arrests of dozens of individuals, including Miami Heat player Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups. The crackdown involves two separate indictments: one concerning alleged betting irregularities and players faking injuries, and another involving rigged, high-stakes poker games linked to New York's major crime families. Prosecutors allege sophisticated schemes were used to defraud victims out of millions. Both Rozier and Billups have been placed on leave by the NBA and deny the allegations.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether Arsenal's exceptionally strong defense could be the key to winning the Premier League title, even with a less prolific attack compared to rivals. Having conceded only three goals in their first eight games, the team is on a historic defensive pace that could break the record set by Chelsea in 2004-05. While Arsenal's offense has been hampered by injuries, their defensive record is significantly improved from last season. The analysis explores historical precedents, noting that while rare, teams have won the title with the best defense but not the most goals.</p>

          <p>An analysis of NHS data reveals that the number of young adults in England aged 16-24 reporting symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has more than tripled over the past decade. OCD is now the second most common mental health disorder in this age group, behind generalized anxiety. Experts suggest that while increased awareness may play a role, societal pressures and social media are likely significant drivers of the rise. The report also highlights long waiting times for treatment and a shortage of specialist care, leaving many young people struggling.</p>

While external forensic experts state that full autopsies are needed for conclusive proof, the evidence has intensified allegations of widespread abuse of detainees in Israeli custody.

While a senior DOJ official reportedly wants to keep the case active, the prosecutor's assessment suggests it lacks legal merit.
