          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York mayoral primary, Republican leaders are using his self-described democratic socialist platform as a new line of attack. They aim to portray the entire Democratic party as extremist and out of touch with mainstream American values to energize their base ahead of elections. While some progressive Democrats have embraced Mamdani, moderates have been more hesitant, creating a complex dynamic as the party grapples with its internal ideological spectrum.</p>

          <p>As a record heatwave hits the U.S., child safety advocates are issuing urgent warnings about the lethal risk of leaving children in hot cars. A child's body temperature can rise three to five times faster than an adult's, and the inside of a vehicle can heat up by 20 degrees in just 10 minutes. Experts stress that this tragedy can happen to anyone due to distractions and recommend creating reminders, such as placing a purse or phone in the backseat, to ensure a child is never forgotten.</p>

The ruling, in a case involving a Trump-era birthright citizenship order, represents a significant shift in judicial power, hewing to a more traditional view of providing relief only to the parties in a lawsuit. While this curtails a tool used to challenge executive actions, the court left open other paths for broad relief, such as class-action lawsuits.</p>
