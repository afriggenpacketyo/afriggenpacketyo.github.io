Miran would fill the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler, serving out a term that expires in January 2026. The nomination is notable as Miran has been a past critic of the Fed's stimulus actions and is the author of a plan to devalue the dollar. His appointment, which requires Senate confirmation, could introduce a dissenting voice aligned with the White House's push for lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey is facing scrutiny for her administration's handling of migrant housing assistance. Critics, including the state's GOP chair and a former shelter director, argue that the state is shifting costs to the HomeBASE program, which provides eligible families with up to $30,000 in rental aid. They claim the program lacks oversight and has become a "revolving door" that fails to create long-term stability for migrants or taxpayers. This controversy arises as the governor announces the closure of remaining hotel shelters established during the recent migrant influx.</p>

          <p>Following a recent crime incident, President Trump has renewed his calls to exert federal control over Washington, D.C., citing public safety concerns. However, this article clarifies that the president lacks the unilateral authority to do so, as it would require an act of Congress to repeal the 1973 Home Rule Act. While the president commands the D.C. National Guard and can temporarily take over the police in an emergency, legal experts suggest such moves would face court challenges. The discussion comes as D.C. police data shows a significant year-over-year decrease in violent crime, contrasting with the president's portrayal of the city.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to review guidance on including alternative assets in 401(k) plans. This move could allow investments like private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies to become more common in Americans' defined contribution retirement accounts. Proponents in the alternative asset industry see this as a major victory, while some financial experts express concern about the potential risks for less sophisticated investors. The order signals a significant potential shift in retirement savings strategy, building on previous guidance that permitted such investments under certain conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rushanara Ali has resigned from her position as the UK's homelessness minister following accusations of hypocrisy regarding a property she owns. The controversy arose after it was reported that she ended her tenants' contract to sell the house, only to re-list it for rent at a higher price shortly after. This action appeared to contradict the spirit of the Renters' Rights Bill she was helping to advance, which aims to prevent such practices. In her resignation letter, Ali stated that she had followed all legal requirements but was stepping down to avoid becoming a distraction for the government.</p>

          <p>Florida's largest utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), is seeking regulatory approval for a rate hike of almost $10 billion to be phased in over the next four years. FPL argues the increase is necessary to ensure grid reliability and invest in solar generation, while keeping bills below the national average. However, environmental and consumer advocacy groups are pushing back, claiming it would be the largest utility hike in U.S. history and would cause significant financial strain on vulnerable households. Critics also allege the proposal is designed more to boost shareholder profits than to serve customers, a claim the company disputes.</p>

          <p>On his first day as the new head of Paramount, Skydance Media's David Ellison was questioned about a rumored deal with President Trump related to a settled lawsuit against CBS. Trump has claimed he was promised $20 million in free air time as part of a settlement that cleared the way for Skydance's $8 billion takeover. Ellison avoided directly answering, stating Skydance was not involved in the settlement handled by the previous Paramount leadership. He and his new executive team affirmed their support for the CBS News division and their commitment to defending their journalists from political pressure.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes which savings vehicle could currently earn more interest on a $20,000 deposit over three months: a 3-month CD or a money market account. While a money market account may offer a slightly higher interest rate at present, its rate is variable and likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. In contrast, a CD's rate is fixed for its term, guaranteeing the return. The analysis concludes that while the money market account could technically earn a few dollars more, a CD offers predictability and is more likely to achieve the goal of maximizing guaranteed interest.

          <p>OpenAI has launched GPT-5, the latest version of its widely used AI model, which the company claims is significantly smarter and more capable than its predecessors. Co-founder Sam Altman described the new model as having "PhD-level" expertise on any topic, with improved reasoning and the ability to create entire software programs. The release marks another major step in the competitive AI landscape, though some ethics experts express caution. They note the growing gap between AI capabilities and effective regulation, and question whether the launch is driven more by hype than a true breakthrough in reasoning ability.</p>

          <p>A U.S. envoy has publicly criticized the Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, and called for it to be replaced as an operator of key ports at the Panama Canal.

This statement comes as the company's 25-year concession renewal faces legal challenges in Panama's Supreme Court over alleged constitutional and financial irregularities.

          <p>A recent survey from the American Association of Individual Investors shows a significant spike in bearish sentiment, with 43.2% of investors now feeling negative about the stock market's six-month outlook. This 10-percentage-point jump in pessimism is the largest since February, a time that preceded a market downturn. However, some market strategists view this widespread uneasiness as a contrarian bullish indicator. The theory is that when most retail investors are bearish, they have likely already sold stocks and are holding cash, creating potential buying power to fuel a future rally.

          <p>This market analysis piece suggests that a recent plunge in cybersecurity stocks, triggered by a disappointing forecast from Fortinet, may be an overreaction. The article argues that the sell-off has unfairly dragged down other strong companies in the sector, like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, whose business models differ from Fortinet's. The author notes that the drop is largely due to automated, sector-based ETF trading rather than fundamental weaknesses in these other companies. The commentary indicates an interest in buying shares of these firms at their current lower prices, viewing the situation as a market inefficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Adidas shoe designed by Willy Chavarría, which blends a modern sneaker with the traditional weave of Mexican huaraches, has sparked a controversy over cultural appropriation. Critics on social media have called out the "Oaxaca Slip On" for using the name of the Mexican state and its Indigenous craft without crediting or collaborating with the artisan communities. The backlash intensified upon learning the shoes are manufactured in China, not Mexico. The government of Oaxaca is now reportedly preparing legal action, raising questions about who profits from cultural heritage in the global fashion industry.</p>

These foods, which include items like sweet bakery products, savory snacks, and burgers, are typically low in fiber and high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. The study found that consumption was even higher among young people, who get nearly 62% of their calories from these sources.
