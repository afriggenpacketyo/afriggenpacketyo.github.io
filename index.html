        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara has confirmed he will seek a fourth presidential term, a move the opposition deems unconstitutional. The 83-year-old former banker is credited with strong economic growth, with the IMF projecting 6.3% GDP growth this year. However, his decision raises concerns about democratic backsliding and potential election-related violence, as his previous re-election in 2020 was marred by unrest. Critics accuse him of tightening his grip on power and using legal means to exclude political rivals from the upcoming election, threatening the nation's stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent inter-communal violence in Syria, particularly between the Druze and Bedouin-Sunni communities, is fueling sectarian tensions within the Syrian diaspora in Germany. Syrians living in Germany report a rise in hate speech and division along sectarian lines, a shift from the unity felt in the early years of the revolution. While some isolated fights and inflammatory rhetoric at protests have occurred, human rights advocates believe fears of the Syrian war playing out on German streets are exaggerated. They emphasize that most refugees sought to escape violence, not recreate it, and call for more support for civil society groups working to heal divisions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 13:09:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill introduced by Republican Rep. Bob Onder proposes renaming the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., as the Donald J. Trump Center for the Performing Arts. The "Make Entertainment Great Again Act" argues that President Trump is a significant cultural icon who has worked to end "woke programming" at the venue. The move has drawn sharp criticism, including from John F. Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, who accused Trump of attempting to minimize historical heroes. The bill is expected to face significant opposition in Congress and may conflict with existing laws that prevent new memorials at the center.</p>

          <p>Kering, the parent company of Gucci, announced a significant 15% drop in second-quarter sales, falling short of analyst expectations amid persistent challenges. Sales for its flagship brand, Gucci, plummeted by 25%, with weaknesses observed across all major markets, particularly in China and the United States. Chairman François-Henri Pinault acknowledged the disappointing results but emphasized ongoing efforts to reposition the brand for long-term growth. The company faces a difficult environment, with analysts noting that reviving brand desirability is a more significant challenge than potential U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The largest rail workers' union in the U.S., SMART Transportation Division, plans to formally oppose the proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. The union cited deep concerns over Union Pacific's labor practices and what it calls a "troubling safety record," alleging the company prioritizes profits over worker and public safety. In contrast, the union noted that Norfolk Southern has adopted more progressive labor policies recently. Another major union, BLET, has also raised national security and job displacement concerns with President Trump regarding Union Pacific's plans to use Mexican train crews in the U.S.</p>

          <p>California-based startup Revoy has created an innovative solution to reduce emissions from long-haul diesel trucks without requiring a full vehicle replacement. The company developed an electric dolly, a self-powered axle with a large battery pack, that fits between the truck and its trailer. This device pushes the rig, reducing the diesel engine's workload and cutting fuel costs by up to five times. Instead of lengthy recharging, drivers can swap the dolly for a fresh one in about five minutes at designated stations. The system is leased on a per-mile basis, eliminating upfront capital costs for trucking companies.</p>

          <p>A UN-backed food security initiative has issued an alert stating that the "worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out" in the Gaza Strip. The report finds that thresholds for catastrophic food consumption and acute malnutrition have already been met in parts of the territory, with mounting evidence of hunger-related deaths. UN agencies blame the crisis on Israel's control over aid entry, which has created mass starvation despite recent announcements of "tactical pauses" in fighting. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called the situation an undeniable reality and demanded that a trickle of aid must become an ocean.</p>

          <p>A German court has convicted three men for the 2022 theft of 483 ancient Celtic gold coins from a museum in Manching, Bavaria. The defendants received prison sentences of up to 11 years for the meticulously planned heist, which took only nine minutes and involved cutting local communication cables to disable alarms. The stolen treasure, considered the largest find of Celtic gold in the 20th century, is still mostly missing. Investigators believe part of the collection was melted down, as lumps of gold were found on one of the suspects upon his arrest, confirming archaeologists' worst fears.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 12:22:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As famine grips regions like Gaza, medical experts explain the devastating physiological process of starvation. The body first consumes its carbohydrate stores, then fats, before it begins breaking down its own muscle and organ proteins for energy in a final, desperate phase. This protein breakdown weakens the heart, immune system, and other vital organs, often leading to death from infection or cardiac arrest. Children, pregnant people, and the elderly are most vulnerable, with children at risk of dying within a week without food. Experts emphasize that the treatment is simple—food and water—but access is the critical barrier in humanitarian crises.</p>

          <p>UCLA has agreed to a $6.45 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by Jewish students and a professor who alleged their civil rights were violated during a pro-Palestinian encampment in 2024. The plaintiffs claimed the university enabled an antisemitic environment and allowed a "Jew Exclusion Zone" that blocked their access to parts of campus. As part of the settlement, UCLA is prohibited for 15 years from facilitating the exclusion of Jewish individuals from campus areas, including based on their beliefs about Israel. The funds will be distributed among the plaintiffs, several Jewish community organizations, and a UCLA antisemitism initiative.</p>

The company also saw a rise in operating expenses and a significant drop in adjusted free cash flow.

The opposition, which boycotted the referendum, accuses the government of fraud and fears Touadéra could remain in power for life.

Zoo officials stated that their troop had grown to 40 in a space designed for 25, leading to increased conflict and injuries. The decision has sparked harsh criticism and legal threats from animal rights groups, who called the culling illegal and blamed it on the zoo's "irresponsible and unsustainable breeding policies." The zoo director acknowledged that culled animals are regularly fed to carnivores, but suggested the public reaction was stronger because baboons are primates.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent trip to Scotland, while ostensibly private, produced several significant political and diplomatic outcomes.
