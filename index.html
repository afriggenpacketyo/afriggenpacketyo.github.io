          <p>A man stabbed eleven individuals at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, before being apprehended by a sheriff's deputy and citizens. The attack, described as a "brutal act of violence," appears to have been random, with the 42-year-old suspect using a folding knife near the checkout area. Multiple victims are reported to be in serious or critical condition, prompting responses from state and federal law enforcement agencies. Walmart has condemned the violence and is cooperating with the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Actor and musician Johnny Depp made a surprise appearance at an Alice Cooper concert in London, joining the band to perform a tribute to the late Ozzy Osbourne. Depp played guitar on the Black Sabbath classic "Paranoid" just days after the iconic frontman's passing at age 76. Cooper, who dedicated the show to Osbourne, introduced Depp as a fellow member of their band, The Hollywood Vampires. The performance was part of a broader outpouring of respect from the rock community for Osbourne's legacy.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has intercepted the "Handala," a vessel operated by the pro-Palestinian Freedom Flotilla Coalition, in international waters as it attempted to deliver food aid to the Gaza Strip. The group stated that its crew of activists and journalists was "kidnapped," while Israel's foreign ministry confirmed the boat was stopped for attempting to breach the maritime blockade. The vessel, reportedly carrying baby formula, is being escorted to an Israeli port. This incident highlights the ongoing tensions and difficulties surrounding aid delivery to Gaza.</p>

          <p>Approximately 4,000 NASA employees, representing about 20% of the agency's workforce, have chosen to leave through a deferred resignation program initiated by the Trump administration. This reduction is part of a broader plan to shrink the federal workforce and will decrease NASA's staff from 18,000 to 14,000. The resignations come amid proposed budget cuts, although recent legislation has allocated additional long-term funding for key missions.

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is being held out of practice indefinitely due to a back problem, raising concerns despite coach Sean McVay's claims that he is not worried. The 37-year-old veteran has not practiced since training camp opened and will not participate in the upcoming week's sessions. This is the second time in four years a back issue has sidelined Stafford, who missed the end of the 2022 season with a spinal contusion. His status is being evaluated weekly, casting uncertainty over the team's prospects for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>A new American Eagle campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney has generated a mixed response online. The ads, which promote a line of jeans to raise money for a domestic violence charity, have been criticized by some as "tone-deaf" for what they see as an oversexualized tone. Conversely, other fans have praised Sweeney and the campaign for "killing woke advertising." Despite the controversy, the collaboration has been a success for the brand, boosting its stock price and being hailed by executives as their biggest partnership yet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A union representing 12,000 employees of Stater Bros. Markets in Southern California has voted to authorize a strike against the supermarket chain. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 135 accused the company of unfair labor practices, including illegal surveillance and discrimination against union members. While the vote does not trigger an immediate walkout, it empowers the union to call a strike if upcoming negotiations fail. The move follows the company's first-ever layoffs earlier this year, which it blamed on inflation and tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced it would begin airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza and establish corridors for UN convoys, following increased international pressure and reports of starvation-related deaths. The move comes after months of warnings about famine due to aid restrictions. However, the announcement was accompanied by deadly incidents, with Palestinian officials reporting dozens of people killed by Israeli fire while seeking aid. The UN and aid groups continue to warn that airdrops are insufficient to address the scale of the man-made hunger crisis.</p>

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan have survived a recall vote, allowing them to retain their controlling majority in the legislature and ensuring the continuation of the island's political gridlock. The recall campaign targeted 24 lawmakers accused of being "pro-China" and obstructing the agenda of President William Lai's Democratic Progressive Party. The opposition KMT party, which denies being pro-Beijing, argues it is providing necessary government oversight. The failure of the recall effort means President Lai will likely face a challenging legislative environment for his term.</p>
