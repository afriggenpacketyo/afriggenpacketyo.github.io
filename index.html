          <p>A New York man, Shane Daley, has been arrested on federal cyberstalking charges for allegedly leaving threatening and profane voicemails for Paulette Thompson, the widow of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The calls were made just hours after her husband was fatally shot in Manhattan in December. According to the FBI, Daley celebrated the killing, calling Thompson a "capitalist pig" and warning his widow that similar events would continue to happen. Daley admitted to the possibility of making the calls while drinking and faces up to five years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of cooperation with the Trump administration, Mexico has extradited 26 senior cartel figures to the United States to face charges. The group includes leaders from the notorious Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and Sinaloa cartels, such as Abigael González Valencia of "Los Cuinis." This move comes amid U.S. pressure on Mexico to intensify its efforts against drug trafficking and fentanyl production. Mexican officials stated the transfers were a sovereign decision aimed at dismantling criminal networks operating from within prisons.</p>

Lanez, who is currently serving a 10-year sentence, sought to present a new statement from a security guard and challenge the fact that his driver did not testify. His legal team claimed this new evidence would show he was not the shooter. This denial marks another failed attempt by Lanez to challenge his 2022 felony conviction for assault with a firearm.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has altered her public response to President Trump's federalization of the city's police force, now calling it an "intrusion on our autonomy" after an initially more measured reaction. During a town hall, she also downplayed the criminality of youth involved in "takeovers," suggesting they are "not criminals" but are causing destruction in large groups. The White House criticized her leadership, stating the federal intervention was necessary due to years of failed policies that led to surging crime, a claim Bowser disputes with city statistics.</p>

          <p>A severe hunger crisis is unfolding in el-Fasher, a city in Sudan's Darfur region, where the ongoing war between the army and the paramilitary RSF has led to a devastating blockade. Rare footage obtained by the BBC shows desperate conditions, with civilians forced to eat animal feed as food prices have skyrocketed and aid convoys are blocked. The situation is compounded by a cholera outbreak, and doctors report that malnourished children are dying daily with no access to therapeutic food or adequate medical supplies.</p>

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, is experiencing unprecedented flooding after a glacial-dammed basin released a massive volume of water, causing the Mendenhall River to crest at a record 16.65 feet.

While temporary barriers were installed to protect hundreds of homes, the recurring and worsening nature of the floods highlights the ongoing environmental challenges facing the region, with long-term solutions still years away.</p>

The decline could have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity in the tundra and the release of stored carbon from Arctic soils.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's public criticism of Goldman Sachs for predicting higher consumer inflation due to tariffs, many other Wall Street economists share the same outlook. The consensus view is that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted and higher duty rates take full effect, consumers will increasingly bear the cost. While no one is forecasting runaway inflation, a steady increase is expected, which could push the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure into the low- to mid-3% range. This potential rise in inflation is not expected to deter the Fed from cutting interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The article ironically points to convicted felons, individuals who defied court orders, and those who dismantled government departments as the "criminals" Miller is surrounded by. The piece uses sharp wit to critique what it portrays as lawlessness and a disregard for constitutional norms within the highest levels of government, contrasting it with street crime.</p>

          <p>Walmart, the largest private employer in the U.S., is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk, meat, and frozen foods. The move comes as rising tariffs fuel concerns about higher consumer prices, which Walmart's own CFO has stated the company cannot fully absorb. The expanded benefit, one of the most requested by staff, applies to 1.6 million U.S. employees. This could help retain workers and encourage them to spend more at Walmart, potentially offsetting some of the financial pressure on their families.</p>

The average homeowner now holds around $213,000 in accessible value, contributing to a total of $11.6 trillion in usable equity nationwide. Homeowners can access this wealth through financial products like home equity loans or HELOCs. Calculating available equity involves subtracting the current mortgage balance from the home's market value, though lenders typically cap borrowing at about 80% of the total equity.
