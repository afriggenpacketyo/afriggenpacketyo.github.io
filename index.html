          <p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index rose less than expected in September, with a monthly increase of 0.3% and an annual inflation rate of 3.0%. This data, which was the only official economic information released during the government shutdown, came in below economists' forecasts. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI also showed a smaller-than-predicted increase, suggesting a potential easing of inflationary pressures in the economy.

          <p>Since a 2018 Supreme Court decision struck down a federal ban, legalized sports betting has expanded to 38 states, transforming into a multi-billion dollar industry dominated by mobile apps. This rapid growth has renewed long-standing concerns about the integrity of professional sports, which were recently underscored by federal indictments of current and former NBA figures for involvement in betting schemes. The article argues that the proliferation of micro-betting and the leagues' financial embrace of the industry have created significant social costs and integrity risks. </p>

          <p>Newcastle United forward Anthony Gordon has been a standout performer in the Champions League, scoring in three consecutive games and earning praise from opposing managers like Jose Mourinho. However, his success in European competition has not translated to the domestic Premier League, where he has yet to score or provide an assist this season. The article explores this performance disparity, highlighting the challenge for both Gordon and the team to replicate their European form in domestic matches.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a termination of all trade negotiations with Canada, a decision he attributed to an anti-tariff advertising campaign from the province of Ontario. The ad featured archival audio of former President Ronald Reagan criticizing protectionist trade policies. This move further strains the already tense trade relationship between the two countries, which has been marked by U.S. tariffs and Canadian retaliatory measures over the past year. Canada is the United States' second-largest trading partner.</p>

          <p>New research challenges the long-held theory that dinosaurs were in decline before the asteroid strike that caused their extinction 66 million years ago. By analyzing fossils from the Kirtland Formation in New Mexico, scientists determined that diverse dinosaur communities, including colossal species like Alamosaurus, were flourishing just 400,000 years before the impact. While the findings provide a snapshot of a thriving ecosystem, some experts caution that it represents only one location and may not reflect the global state of dinosaur populations at the time.</p>

          <p>In a shocking development, 52-year-old Stephan Smerk of New York walked into a police station and confessed to the 1994 murder of Robin Warr Lawrence in Virginia, a cold case that had stumped investigators for three decades. Smerk claimed the killing was a random act driven by an uncontrollable compulsion, telling detectives he was a "serial killer who's only killed once." The confession came after police, using advanced genetic genealogy, had identified him as a potential suspect and collected a DNA sample.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece praises a recent robbery at the Louvre museum in Paris, where thieves made off with jewels valued at approximately $102 million from the Apollo Gallery. The author frames the non-violent crime as a thrilling and clever caper, arguing that such events are inherently democratic and make the stolen items more famous than they would be locked away in a display case. The article contrasts this with more violent robberies and criticizes the museum's decision to close for two days following the incident.</p>
