          <p>International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach expressed that Japan is welcome to bid for a future Summer or Winter Games after addressing corruption issues related to past events. Sapporo withdrew its bid for the 2030 Winter Games following scandals linked to the 2020 Tokyo Games, which were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bach emphasized the importance of ensuring such corruption is over and Japanese business practices are clarified and adapted. He also voiced support for his successor, Kirstie Coventry, and highlighted the success of the Paris Games in fulfilling the Olympic Agenda of sustainability and youth engagement.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Experts predict the spacecraft, which was intended to land on Venus but failed to leave Earth's orbit, could crash anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south. While the risk of it hitting someone is small, it cannot be completely excluded, as the 1,000-pound object was built to withstand a descent through a planet's atmosphere. Space debris crashing back to Earth could become a growing problem for aircraft, according to researchers.</p>

While the budget acknowledges federal sprawl and proposes defunding certain programs, it sustains a bloated government with discretionary spending remaining essentially unchanged at $1.6 trillion. The budget also increases defense spending by 13%, pushing it past $1 trillion. The contributor argues that without entitlement reform, no discretionary spending cuts can avert a debt crisis.</p>
