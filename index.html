        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's liquor industry is undergoing a transformation as younger generations shift away from traditional baijiu towards lighter, fruit-flavored beverages. In Baisha, farmers are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum, reflecting this change in consumer preference. Liquor brands are innovating to appeal to younger demographics, focusing on low-alcohol options and marketing drinking as a self-indulgent experience rather than a social ritual. Industry insiders believe this shift could disrupt the dominance of baijiu in the Chinese alcohol market, indicating a significant change in drinking culture.</p>

          <p>The Base, an international neo-Nazi terrorist organization, is reportedly growing its presence in the US and planning a paramilitary training event, according to online evidence. Despite previous efforts by the FBI to dismantle the group, it appears to be gaining momentum, with new cells emerging across Europe and a presence in Ukraine. The group's activities include soliciting crypto donations for a "White Defense Force" and posting images of armed members in the US. Experts note that the group's willingness to publicly advertise its training event suggests a growing sense of confidence and momentum, raising concerns about the threat of far-right extremism.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat explores the evolving political role of Elon Musk, particularly his shift from Obama-era liberalism to aligning with the online right. Douthat initially believed Musk's political interests were driven by cultural issues and his desire to advance space exploration. However, Musk's actions in the Trump administration, particularly his limited involvement in anti-woke initiatives and deregulation efforts, suggest a more complex set of motivations. The columnist questions whether Musk's primary goal is to advance his technological projects or if other factors are at play, leaving the specific reasons behind Musk's political choices shrouded in mystery.</p>

          <p>A report highlights the heightened surveillance and fear experienced by immigrants in New York City, particularly asylum seekers, due to increased enforcement by ICE. Many immigrants are enrolled in Alternatives to Detention programs, which involve electronic monitoring through ankle bracelets and mobile apps. This constant surveillance leads to stigma, anxiety, and instability, affecting their ability to work and live normal lives. The report also notes a drop in customers at local businesses in immigrant communities due to fear of deportation, and community groups are adapting by providing legal clinics and educating residents about their rights.</p>

          <p>The New York Times editorial board asserts that a culture of corruption is prevalent in the Trump administration, particularly within the cryptocurrency industry. They claim that Trump and his family benefit financially from the sale of their cryptocurrency, and government policies change to favor those who enrich the Trumps. The board argues that this behavior weakens American democracy and degrades the power of government. The editorial board emphasizes the lack of direct bribes but highlights the creation of avenues for personal enrichment influencing policy.

Patients without app access will receive text messages and letters as a last resort, freeing up NHS phone lines.

          <p>A recent poll indicates that nearly half of adult Gen Z members feel planning for the future is pointless, leading to a freewheeling attitude toward spending and a "YOLO mindset." Experts warn that this can be dangerous, potentially leading to high-interest debt and delayed milestones. Factors contributing to this disillusionment include a tough labor market, student debt concerns, and the rise of buy now, pay later lending. Despite these challenges, experts advise young adults to rewire their financial mindset and start investing early, even with small amounts, to take advantage of compound interest.

          <p>Taiwanese authorities are implementing stricter security protocols on cross-strait travel, expanding oversight to include public officials and DPP staff members. This move is prompted by concerns that mainland Chinese intelligence has infiltrated Taiwan's political system. A scandal involving a former DPP aide accused of leaking classified information using an encrypted messaging app has heightened these fears. The new measures aim to prevent the compromise of sensitive information and protect the security of Taiwanese officials.</p>

The dental facility where the surgery took place stated that the death was not due to dosage but rather the child's undiagnosed medical condition.

Critics argue that diverting aid to cover domestic costs is unsustainable and comes at the expense of vital programs tackling poverty and conflict.
