          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated he is confident in the company's aggressive expansion plans, even as other major carriers are scaling back growth due to an oversupply of flights. Kirby attributes United's success to attracting brand-loyal customers with improved products and technology, such as new cabin interiors and better onboard amenities. United's domestic capacity growth is set to significantly outpace its rivals this year. The CEO also reiterated his view that the ultra-discount airline model is failing, predicting the demise of struggling carriers like Spirit Airlines.</p>

          <p>As autumn begins, European Union gas reserves are currently just over 80% full, which is lower than the 90% cushion of the past few years but still considered a solid buffer for the upcoming winter. The bloc has significantly diversified its energy supplies away from Russia since 2022, relying more on liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the U.S., Norway, and Qatar. While analysts believe Europe is not in an acute energy crisis, it remains vulnerable to geopolitical shocks, such as potential U.S. tariffs on countries trading with Russia. The overall outlook is one of cautious stability.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Grassley disclosed that the FBI's "Arctic Frost" investigation, which targeted former President Donald Trump, also encompassed dozens of other Republican entities, including the late Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA. Grassley argued that the expansive scope of the probe indicates it was a partisan effort to improperly investigate the broader Republican political apparatus. The revelation connects the investigation into Trump's 2020 election activities with the organization founded by Kirk, who was recently assassinated. This adds another layer of political complexity to the aftermath of Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, appeared to confess to the shooting on the messaging platform Discord just hours before his arrest. A company spokesperson confirmed messages from an account allegedly belonging to Robinson, including one stating, "It was me at UVU yesterday." The FBI has stated it will investigate all members of the Discord group chat, which reportedly contained more than 20 people. This development adds a new digital dimension to the investigation into the high-profile assassination.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, several companies have fired employees for comments perceived as insensitive or celebratory, sparking a debate on free speech and workplace censorship. The article highlights the case of a Washington Post columnist who claims she was unfairly terminated for posts that condemned violence but did not mourn Kirk. This situation is contrasted with the reactions to a previous politically motivated attack on a Democratic official, suggesting a disparity in how such speech is treated. The piece argues that the private sector is increasingly policing expression in a politically charged environment.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has pushed back against criticism from pundits regarding the club's £450 million spending spree on eight new players during the summer transfer window. He emphasized that the club also recouped nearly £300 million from player sales, framing the high expenditure as a necessary investment to strengthen the squad. Slot defended the strategy of signing younger players, including record-breaking striker Alexander Isak, who is set to make his debut. The manager expressed confidence that the club conducted great business and should be praised for its forward-thinking approach.</p>

          <p>Many individuals may be unknowingly worsening their debt situation despite making regular payments, especially in a high-interest-rate environment. The article identifies three common pitfalls: paying only the minimum on credit cards, which primarily covers interest; overusing "buy now, pay later" plans, which can lead to an accumulation of hidden debt; and relying on balance transfers as a temporary fix without addressing underlying spending habits. These subtle mistakes can trap consumers in a long-term debt cycle. The piece advises paying more than the minimum and using promotional offers strategically.</p>

Some owners reported having to break a window to re-enter their vehicle.

          <h2>Analysis Explores the Cheapest Sources of Energy Amid Shifting US Policies</h2>

          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewables like onshore wind and utility-scale solar remain the most cost-competitive forms of energy, even before accounting for government subsidies. The report uses the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric, which shows these sources are cheaper to generate than coal, natural gas, or nuclear power. However, the landscape is being shaped by conflicting U.S. policies, with the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act promoting renewables while the Trump administration's new laws favor fossil fuels and impose tariffs that could raise costs for some green energy projects.

          <p>The 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City became a landmark case that transformed national awareness of missing children. After walking to his school bus stop alone for the first time, he was never seen again, and his case remained unsolved for decades. A breakthrough occurred in 2012 when a tip led police to Pedro Hernandez, a former convenience store worker who confessed to the crime. After a mistrial, Hernandez was convicted in a second trial in 2017, finally bringing a measure of justice to the Patz family.</p>

          <h2>Hopes for Zero-Tariff UK Steel Exports to the US Reportedly Put on Hold</h2>

          <p>A proposed deal to eliminate the 25% tariff on U.K. steel exports to the United States has reportedly been put on hold indefinitely, a setback for the British steel industry. The news comes as President Trump arrives for a state visit, during which trade was expected to be a key topic of discussion. While the U.K. still faces lower tariffs than some other nations, the failure to secure a zero-tariff agreement is a disappointment after a deal seemed close. U.S. officials reportedly raised questions about the production methods of the U.K.'s largest steel maker, complicating the negotiations.</p>

          <p>A framework agreement for TikTok's U.S. operations will reportedly involve new investors alongside existing ones from its parent company, ByteDance. According to sources, Oracle is set to maintain its role as the cloud and data security partner for the platform. The deal, expected to be finalized within 30 to 45 days, aims to resolve U.S. national security concerns about Chinese government access to American user data. This development follows years of negotiations and uncertainty after Congress passed a law requiring ByteDance to divest from its U.S. operations or face a ban.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen stated that his party must be willing to risk a government shutdown to fight for priorities like restoring Medicaid funding and extending Obamacare subsidies. He argues that Republicans would be blamed for any shutdown because they are refusing to negotiate and giving President Trump a "blank check." The senator also addressed the heightened political climate following Charlie Kirk's assassination, expressing alarm at President Trump's rhetoric blaming "the radical left" and vowing to investigate political opponents. Van Hollen believes Democrats need to more forcefully stand up to what he calls Trump's lawlessness.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey of economists, fund managers, and strategists indicates that President Trump's actions to limit the Federal Reserve's independence could lead to negative economic outcomes. A majority of respondents believe these efforts will result in higher inflation, weaker growth, and increased unemployment. 82% of those surveyed view the president's actions as an attempt to reduce or eliminate the central bank's independence to pressure it into cutting interest rates. The findings highlight concerns within the financial community that political interference in monetary policy could destabilize the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>
