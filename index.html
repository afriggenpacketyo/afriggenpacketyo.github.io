          <p>The House Oversight Committee has received documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, including a "birthday book" compiled for his 50th birthday. The book, reportedly organized by Ghislaine Maxwell, lists Donald Trump under the "Friends" section and contains a page with a letter and signature attributed to him. Trump and the White House have vehemently denied the letter's authenticity, calling it fake and part of a defamation campaign, while continuing litigation against media outlets that previously reported on it.</p>

While some initiatives like the "Green Apron Service" program have shown promise and improved sales in test locations, the company still faces shrinking traffic and same-store sales. Investors and some employees remain skeptical, as changes like reintroducing handwritten messages on cups have been criticized and the company's stock has fallen 7% during Niccol's tenure.</p>

          <p>France's political instability has intensified after Prime Minister Francois Bayrou and his government were ousted in a confidence vote on Monday. The collapse was triggered by a failure to secure support for the 2026 budget, which included significant spending cuts to reduce the nation's large deficit. President Emmanuel Macron must now appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years or risk calling another snap election, which could empower far-right or far-left parties and further complicate fiscal consolidation efforts.</p>

          <p>Following the dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo, Nottingham Forest is expected to appoint Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach. Nuno was sacked after a 3-0 defeat to West Ham, despite guiding the club to its highest league finish in decades last season. Postecoglou, who was recently let go by Tottenham after a difficult league season but a historic Europa League victory, is seen as a strong candidate, with his appointment potentially coming before the team's next match against Arsenal.</p>

          <p>New league tables rating the performance of NHS trusts in England have been released for the first time, with specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital ranking highest. The system scores trusts on seven metrics, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial health, sorting them into four performance "segments." Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the rankings aim to increase transparency and public choice, though some trusts have questioned the metrics, worrying it could lead to focusing on rankings over patient care.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai subsidiary of French fashion house Dior has been fined by Chinese authorities for transferring customer data overseas without conducting a required security assessment. According to state media, an investigation found that Dior transmitted personal data of Chinese customers to its headquarters in France without proper legal protocols, such as obtaining separate consent or implementing sufficient security measures like encryption. The administrative penalty highlights China's strict enforcement of its data protection and cross-border transfer laws.</p>

          <p>Paris-based AI firm Mistral AI has achieved a valuation of €11.7 billion (approximately $13.8 billion) in its latest Series C funding round. Dutch chip-equipment giant ASML was the lead investor, injecting €1.3 billion to secure an 11% stake in the company. This investment, which more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation, underscores the continued influx of capital into the AI sector and solidifies Mistral's position as a key European competitor to U.S. firms like OpenAI.

With several Indian automakers already reviewing these new designs, commercial production could begin much sooner than initially planned, marking a significant step toward supply chain independence.</p>

A recent HSBC survey confirmed this trend, finding that 44% of polled MNCs consider China a top target market, with many planning to expand their manufacturing there. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, announced after securing a trade deal with the United States that reduces tariffs on Japanese cars, opens a new chapter in Japan's foreign policy. While China's foreign ministry called the resignation an internal affair, analysts anticipate that Ishiba's successor will likely continue Tokyo's current stance of viewing Beijing as a key strategic competitor. The leadership change comes at a time of rocky relations between the two Asian powers, and the new prime minister will face this complex dynamic.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that populist right-wing movements in the U.S. and UK are actively trying to erase or rewrite national histories to advance their political agendas. It cites the Trump administration's efforts to remove "divisive" exhibits from Smithsonian museums and Reform UK's call for a more "patriotic" curriculum as examples of attempts to create narrower, nationalistic narratives. The author argues that this historical revisionism is a tactic used to justify eroding democratic norms and rolling back 20th-century civil rights advancements.</p>

This could lead Apple to implement its first major price hike in five years to protect its profit margins, even as the new phones are anticipated to offer only incremental updates.

Beyond the athletic achievement, the swim also served as a scientific expedition, as Edgley collected daily water samples to study marine biodiversity and the presence of microplastics in the region for the University of Iceland.</p>
