          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging an executive order that targets public broadcasting. The lawsuit alleges unlawful interference in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and violations of the First Amendment, including viewpoint discrimination and illegal retaliation. The executive order instructs the CPB to "cease direct funding to NPR and PBS" and prevents indirect funding by prohibiting local stations from using taxpayer dollars to support the organizations. Additionally, the order directs the FCC to investigate whether NPR and PBS have engaged in unlawful discrimination. The lawsuit aims to protect PBS's editorial independence and the autonomy of its member stations.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has passed away at the age of 87. Swit died at her home in New York City, reportedly from natural causes, and had a career spanning stage and screen, but is most remembered for her role on the long-running CBS series. The show, adapted from the 1970 film, followed a mobile Army surgical hospital during the Korean War, and Swit won two Emmys and was nominated for four Golden Globes for her performances. She aimed to portray Houlihan as a real person, even if it meant sacrificing some jokes, and felt her character was constantly developing throughout the show's run.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" report, which addresses chronic disease in children, has come under fire for citing studies that appear to be nonexistent. Seven of the cited studies could not be found, and an author of one study claimed her research was misinterpreted in the report, with concerns raised about children's screen time, medication use, and anxiety. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the report would be updated, but CBS News medical contributor Dr. CÃ©line Gounder criticized the errors as unethical and potentially linked to AI usage. Kennedy has emphasized "radical transparency" in public health, yet details about the report's authorship remain undisclosed.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has developed the "TACO trade" to profit from President Trump's tariff announcements, betting that he will "chicken out" and lower or delay the measures. This term, short for "Trump always chickens out," reflects the market's recognition that Trump often bluffs on tariffs, leading investors to buy the dip and profit from the subsequent rally. Trump has expressed anger at the expression, which some interpret as evidence that the traders are correct. While many industry leaders sought accommodation with Trump after disdaining him during his first term, the administration has announced, suspended, reduced, or threatened new tariffs on China, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union.</p>

Thousands have been forced to evacuate, and states of emergency have been declared in both provinces, with the entire town of Flin Flon in Manitoba emptied except for essential workers. Smoke from the fires has triggered air quality alerts in Canada and as far as Chicago, with advisories also in place in parts of the US Upper Midwest. International crews, including 125 firefighters from the US, are assisting in combating the fires, but the forecast indicates no immediate relief from the hot and dry conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" concludes. Trump credited Musk with overhauling the federal government and cutting wasteful spending, though DOGE's savings fell short of Musk's initial $1 trillion promise, with some estimates suggesting the initiative could cost the government $135 billion. Despite his departure, Trump indicated that Musk would remain involved, continuing to advise the administration, and Musk defended DOGE's work, expressing confidence that the $1 trillion goal would be achieved over time. Musk has publicly split from Trump over the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" which would increase the deficit, and Musk was wearing a DOGE baseball cap and "DOGEfather" t-shirt during his Oval Office appearance.</p>

The layoffs affected workers at LinkedIn's offices in San Francisco, Mountain View, Carpinteria, and Sunnyvale, with software engineers being heavily impacted. This move follows Microsoft's announcement of terminating 3% of its staff, and LinkedIn is among several major tech companies, including Meta and Google, that have slashed their workforce this year.

Israel has signed off on the proposal, which includes the release of hostages by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners by Israel, as well as the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. However, a senior Hamas official stated that the proposal does not meet their demands, particularly an end to the war and famine, though they are studying the response. President Trump will personally announce the ceasefire agreement if it is accepted, and a source familiar with the U.S. outreach to Hamas indicates that a deal is close.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst defended proposed cuts to Medicaid during a town hall meeting, stating that "we all are going to die" in response to concerns that the cuts would cause people to die. Ernst argued that the focus would be on those most vulnerable and that those who are not eligible for Medicaid should receive benefits elsewhere. The proposed cuts are part of a massive spending package being considered by Congress, and Ernst defended the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its efforts to right size the federal government. Despite her assertions, constituents expressed concerns that the cuts would affect health care in Iowa and that the bill would route money to the wealthy.</p>

Two cryptocurrency investors, John Woeltz and William Duplessie, have been charged with kidnapping, assault, and unlawful imprisonment, and the victim managed to escape after being held captive for over two weeks. During his captivity, the suspects allegedly shocked him with electric wires, hit him on the head with a gun, cut his leg with a saw, forced him to smoke crack cocaine, and urinated on him.

Raskin claims that the traditional system of applying for clemency has been replaced with "favors to the President's loyal followers and most generous donors." He is questioning the criteria and process used to vet recent pardons, noting that some recipients have expressed support for Trump and that the administration has stated some were unfairly targeted for being Trump supporters. Raskin's letter suggests that the new criteria for granting pardons include loyalty to Trump, financial contributions, and promotion of MAGA power.</p>

Trump credited Musk with leading the most sweeping government reform program in generations and said he will continue to be "back and forth" to the White House.
