          <p>President Trump's approval ratings are slipping as he nears his 100th day in office, with recent polls indicating that a majority of Americans disapprove of his performance. The polls, conducted by various news outlets, show approval ratings hovering between 39% and 45%, marking the lowest approval for a newly elected president at this milestone in over seven decades. This decline contrasts with an initial uptick in favorability upon his return to the White House in January, suggesting growing skepticism towards his administration's policies.

          <p>A BBC reporter witnessed Myanmar's military junta repeatedly violating a ceasefire agreed upon after a devastating earthquake. The violations included rocket and mortar attacks that resulted in civilian casualties and injuries. The reporter's investigation in rebel-held territory in the eastern Karenni state revealed that the army was attacking with soldiers on the ground, drones and jets. The UN has noted that the Myanmar military continued operations after the earthquake and beyond the ceasefire, and called for them to end.</p>

Netanyahu said Iran wanted to save Assad after seeing Hezbollah suffer heavy losses in fighting with Israel. He gave no further details. In fighting last fall, Israel detonated hundreds of booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah, days before assassinating the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

          <p>Survivors and families gathered at Bergen-Belsen to mark the 80th anniversary of the camp's liberation, remembering the horrors they endured. British and Canadian troops liberated the camp in April 1945, revealing a scene of mass death and suffering. The camp, unlike others destroyed by the Nazis, remained intact with evidence of the atrocities. Belsen's notoriety stemmed from chilling accounts by journalists, soldiers, and photographers, capturing the camp's grotesque reality.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple accused of being gang members, criticizing the government’s evidence in a scathing rebuke. Judge David Briones barred the administration from removing anyone under the Alien Enemies Act in the Western District of Texas without 21 days' notice. The couple, who entered the U.S. legally and were granted Temporary Protected Status, were arrested and had their status withdrawn due to alleged gang affiliation, but the judge found no meaningful evidence to support the claim.</p>
