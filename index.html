The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses allow users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals in the dark.

          <p>A new study has revealed that exercise can extend the lives of people with cancer, specifically those treated for colon cancer. The trial demonstrated that an exercise program lowered the risk of disease recurrence and death. These findings provide clear evidence of the benefits of physical activity for cancer patients. The results suggest that incorporating exercise into cancer treatment plans can significantly improve outcomes and overall survival rates.</p>
