          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, an L.A.-based company, has voluntarily recalled several premade food items from businesses in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington due to a listeria outbreak first identified in 2024.

While no illnesses have been directly linked to the recalled food, the company is taking precautionary measures.

          <p>President Trump announced he will sign an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for certain medications to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation" policy aims to lower healthcare costs for Americans, but it is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. A similar effort during Trump's first term was blocked by court orders citing procedural issues. The proposal would likely impact drugs administered in doctor's offices, such as infusions and injectables, and would not cover common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy.</p>

          <h2>Newark Liberty Airport Experiences Another System Outage, Causing Widespread Delays</h2>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its third system outage in less than two weeks, causing widespread delays on Sunday. The Federal Aviation Administration said the outage involved a momentary failure of a backup air traffic control system, prompting a 45-minute ground stop. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says a fix is on the way, but the number of flights will be temporarily cut. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the feds need to prioritize fixing the situation at Newark Liberty before the problems start popping up elsewhere.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has halted cattle imports from Mexico, citing fears of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins made the decision due to the northward spread of the screwworm, which has been detected in southern Mexico in the last year. The screwworms are fly larvae that burrow into wounds or mucous membranes of animals, feasting on their flesh and blood. The ban will continue on a "month-by-month basis, until a significant window of containment is achieved," according to the USDA.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 plane as a donation from the Qatari royal family, which will be upgraded to serve as Air Force One, which would make it one of the biggest foreign gifts ever received by the U.S. government. The plane would then be donated to President Trump‚Äôs presidential library when he leaves office. This raises substantial ethical issues, given the immense value of the lavishly appointed plane and that Mr. Trump intends to take ownership of it after he leaves office.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an executive order aimed at lowering some drug prices in the United States by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay. The proposal is a ‚Äúmost favored nation‚Äù pricing model. Any such plan will most likely be subject to challenges in court, and it is not clear whether it will pass legal muster, especially without action by Congress. The pharmaceutical industry bitterly opposes the idea, which would almost certainly cut into its profits, and has been lobbying against it as discussions of the policy have regained steam in Washington in recent weeks.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement and facilitate humanitarian aid to Gaza. The decision comes ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. Alexander, a 21-year-old serving in an elite infantry unit, was captured during the October 7 attack. President Trump confirmed Alexander's release, calling it "monumental news" and "a step taken in good faith." The release is intended as a goodwill gesture before Trump's arrival.</p>

The court has now transferred the boxes to a room equipped with extra security measures, and invited the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires to participate in their preservation and inventory.
