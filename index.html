          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, was convicted of depraved-heart murder after his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, died of a drug overdose; Harris had become addicted to drugs Ryan provided, including ketamine and propofol, which he took from his office. Harris's mother, Tina, suspected Ryan's involvement from the beginning, noting his inappropriate interest in Sarah since she was 14, and his controlling behavior. Sarah's sister, Rachel, uncovered incriminating texts between Sarah and Ryan, revealing his provision and even administration of the drugs. The prosecution successfully argued that Ryan's reckless disregard for Harris's life, given his medical knowledge, constituted murder, resulting in a 45-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. remained steady at 6.76%, close to the year's highest levels but lower than the previous year, as reported by Freddie Mac. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors like global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policies, and investor expectations about the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and increasing home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for prospective homebuyers, contributing to a sluggish start to the spring home-buying season. Sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. have declined, marking the largest monthly drop since November 2022.</p>

          <p>C.C. Opanowski, a survivor of a brutal attack by her ex-boyfriend Shawn Doyle, testified against him years later after he murdered Lori Leonard, a mother of two. Opanowski had been attacked by Doyle in 1996, but he only received probation; haunted by the prosecutor's warning that Doyle would re-offend, Opanowski agreed to testify in his 2006 murder trial. The testimony helped showcase Doyle's pattern of violence and control, contributing to his conviction for second-degree murder and a sentence of 25 years to life. The article highlights the importance of vigilance and speaking out against domestic violence, emphasizing that every case should be taken seriously to protect victims.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco's net profit for the first quarter decreased by 5% year-on-year, reaching $26 billion, due to reduced oil prices and production. The company's free cash flow also declined from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, reflecting ongoing financial pressures. Aramco announced a performance-linked dividend payout of $200 million for the quarter, while increasing its base dividend by 4.2% to $21.1 billion. These figures indicate continued strain on the Saudi state oil giant's balance sheet amid slowing global demand and trade pressures.</p>

          <p>The newly elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has appointed individuals from the business world to top cabinet positions, sparking criticism over potential conflicts of interest. Experts on lobbying regulation emphasize the importance of expertise but highlight the lack of effective rules to curtail conflicts of interest in Germany. The Lobby Register Act requires lobbyists to register, but there are exceptions, and enforcement relies heavily on public scandals. Anti-corruption groups are advocating for greater transparency and stricter regulations to prevent undue influence in political decision-making.</p>
