          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued a humorous apology after a significant geographical error was discovered on the finisher medals and T-shirts. The items, intended to depict an aerial view of Newcastle and the River Tyne, instead featured the rival city of Sunderland and the River Wear. Despite the mistake, which went unnoticed by many including the event's founder, the organizers have framed it as creating a unique historical keepsake for the 60,000 participants. They are also addressing complaints about a shortage of larger T-shirt sizes for some runners at the finish line.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the Department of Education will soon release new guidance aimed at protecting the right to prayer in public schools. Speaking at the Bible Museum, he framed the move as a necessary step to counter what he described as "anti-religious propaganda" and protect students' religious liberties. The announcement was made during a meeting of the Justice Department's Religious Liberty Commission, where the president emphasized his administration's commitment to religious conservatives. He did not provide specific details on what the new guidance would entail but highlighted its goal of providing "total protection" for prayer.</p>

          <p>Retired tennis superstar Serena Williams has invested in Unrivaled, a women's 3-on-3 basketball league, through her venture capital firm, Serena Ventures. She was joined in the latest investment round by soccer champion Alex Morgan, contributing to the league's new valuation of $340 million. The league, which was created to provide WNBA players with a high-paying offseason alternative to playing abroad, claims to offer the highest average salary in women's professional sports league history. Williams, a prolific early-stage investor since 2017, acknowledged the high-risk nature of venture capital but remains committed to supporting new businesses.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has granted an interim stay, allowing the Trump administration to proceed with the removal of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Kelly Slaughter for the time being. The decision puts a lower court's order to reinstate Slaughter on hold while the full Supreme Court considers the administration's emergency request. This case is part of a broader effort by President Trump to remove appointees from independent agencies, challenging long-standing for-cause removal protections. The administration argues the modern FTC wields significant executive power, potentially justifying the president's expanded removal authority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected President Trump's attempt to overturn the $83.3 million verdict in E. Jean Carroll's defamation lawsuit. The Second Circuit panel ruled that the jury's damage awards were "fair and reasonable" and found no grounds to reconsider Trump's claims of presidential immunity, even in light of a recent Supreme Court decision. The court affirmed that a previous jury's finding that Trump sexually abused Carroll was binding, meaning the truthfulness of his defamatory statements could not be relitigated. Carroll's lawyer celebrated the ruling, expressing a desire for the appellate process to conclude so justice can be served.</p>

Fine argued that judges are often protected from the consequences of their decisions, unlike the general public, and that those who released Brown should "have their day in court too."

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court, seeking permission to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid that has already been allocated by Congress. This move follows a lower court ruling that mandated the spending of the funds, an order which an appeals court refused to freeze. The administration argues that being forced to spend the money undermines the president's authority in foreign affairs and creates a separation of powers issue. President Trump has sought to cancel billions in foreign assistance, using a rarely invoked legislative tool to claw back funds he deems misaligned with his objectives.</p>

The contest was triggered by Rayner's departure over a breach of the ministerial code, sparking a major cabinet reshuffle.

          <p>China's export growth decelerated in August, rising 4.4% compared to the previous year, a significant drop from the 7.2% jump seen in July. This marks the slowest pace of export growth since the beginning of the year. The country's large trade surplus remains a point of contention with partners like the U.S. and E.U. Data shows that ongoing trade tensions and tariffs have impacted bilateral trade, with Chinese exports to the U.S. plunging by 33% in August. The slowdown reflects broader pressures on the global economy and ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six people were killed and several others wounded after two gunmen opened fire at a crowded bus stop at the Ramot Junction in north Jerusalem. According to police, the attackers were neutralized at the scene by a security officer and a civilian who returned fire. The militant group Hamas praised the shooting, calling it a "natural response" to Israel's actions in the ongoing war. The attack is one of the deadliest of its kind since the conflict began, and it comes as Hamas is reportedly reviewing a new U.S.-brokered ceasefire proposal which Israel has accepted.</p>

          <p>The new UK Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has stated that the government could suspend visas for countries that do not cooperate with deals to take back their own citizens who have no right to be in the UK. The comments were made during a meeting of the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance, where she emphasized that securing the UK's borders is her top priority. This potential "transactional" approach to visas is being considered as the government faces increasing pressure to reduce the number of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats. The total number of such arrivals has already surpassed 30,000 this year.</p>

          <p>A new mural attributed to the street artist Banksy has appeared on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in a wig and robe striking a protester on the ground, whose placard is splattered with blood. Banksy claimed the work on Instagram, and its appearance comes shortly after mass arrests at a protest in the city. The piece was quickly covered with plastic sheeting by authorities, and police are investigating it as an act of criminal damage. The mural is seen as a critique of the legal system and its handling of protests.</p>

          <p>The theatrical release of Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical "Hamilton" is being interpreted as a significant cultural and political statement in the current political climate. The article argues that the show's diverse casting and its celebration of an immigrant's story serve as a powerful rebuke to anti-immigrant and anti-DEI rhetoric. By telling the story of the nation's founding with a cast of color, "Hamilton" interrogates the traditional, whitewashed historical narrative and presents a vision of a more inclusive America. Its arrival on the big screen makes its message more accessible and amplifies its relevance amid contemporary debates over history and diversity.</p>

          <p>Russia has significantly intensified its aerial attacks on Ukraine, recently launching the largest single-day strike of the war with over 800 drones and 13 missiles. Analysts note that these assaults have accelerated since mid-2025, with Russia diversifying its "strike packages" to overwhelm air defenses and inflict greater psychological damage on the Ukrainian population. The strategy aims not only to destroy infrastructure but also to induce panic, disrupt military recruitment, and undermine morale. This escalation, which includes targeting military enlistment offices, suggests that Russia is not interested in a ceasefire and is committed to a prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>Anutin Charnivirakul, leader of the conservative Bhumjaithai Party, has been elected as Thailand's new prime minister following a special parliamentary session. His appointment comes after the previous premier was removed by a court ruling. Anutin, a 30-year political veteran and heir to a large construction firm, secured the position with support from the opposition People's Party on the condition that he dissolves parliament and holds new elections within four months. As he takes office, he faces urgent issues including a sluggish economy, rising cost of living, and border tensions with Cambodia.</p>

          <p>Following his dominant victory at the U.S. Open, his sixth Grand Slam title, 22-year-old Carlos Alcaraz is already being compared to the greatest players in tennis history. He is one of only four men ever to win a Grand Slam on all three surfaces (hard, grass, and clay), achieving the feat at a younger age than Novak Djokovic. Alcaraz also won his first six majors in just 19 tournaments, second only to Bjorn Borg's record of 18. His performance in New York was marked by a significantly improved and powerful serve, facing the fewest break points of any Grand Slam winner since 1991.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates a significant ideological shift among Democrats, who now view socialism more favorably than capitalism. While U.S. adults overall still prefer capitalism, 66% of Democrats hold a positive view of socialism compared to just 42% for capitalism. This trend, which has developed over the past 15 years, is particularly pronounced among Democrats under 50. In contrast, Republican views on socialism have become even more negative, widening the partisan divide on economic ideologies and presenting a strategic challenge for the Democratic party's national messaging.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has postponed the pretrial hearing for former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who faces charges of crimes against humanity. The delay was granted after the 80-year-old's lawyers argued he is not medically fit to stand trial. Duterte is accused of responsibility for thousands of extrajudicial killings during the violent anti-drug crackdown he oversaw as president. The hearing, originally set for September 23, is now postponed indefinitely while the court assesses his ability to participate in the proceedings, a decision that has disappointed the families of his alleged victims.</p>
