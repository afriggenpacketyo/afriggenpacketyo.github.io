          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that Ukraine will not cede any territory to Russia, dismissing a potential U.S.-Russia summit as a "dead decision" if conducted without Ukrainian participation. His comments follow President Trump's suggestion of a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where Trump hinted that a peace deal might involve a "swapping of territories." Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that any legitimate peace process must include Kyiv's voice to be effective and lasting. The article also notes a meeting between U.S. and European officials in the U.K. to discuss the path toward peace.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the transformation of Kashmir's depiction in India's Bollywood films, from a romantic paradise in the post-independence era to a conflict-ridden battleground. Initially serving as a scenic backdrop for love stories, the narrative shifted dramatically in the 1990s with the rise of anti-India militancy, portraying Kashmir as a site of nationalist struggle. More recent films, such as "Haider," have explored the region's psychological trauma and human rights issues. However, contemporary cinema is often described as aligning with government narratives, particularly after the 2019 abrogation of Article 370, reflecting the prevailing political sentiments in India.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, a potential sign of de-escalation. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers in a bid to ease tensions under the new administration of President Lee Jae Myung. The psychological warfare, which included blasting K-pop and anti-Pyongyang messages from both sides, had intensified in recent months. Despite this step, officials note that underlying tensions may rise again with upcoming annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has denied any conspiracy to ruin her predecessor and mentor, Alex Salmond. She claims Salmond was willing to destroy the Scottish National Party rather than see it succeed without him and showed no remorse for his inappropriate behavior towards women. Sturgeon recounts her shock upon learning of the allegations and her refusal to intervene in the investigation, which she says marked the end of their political partnership. She characterizes Salmond's claims of a conspiracy as a fabrication by a man unwilling to reflect on his own conduct.</p>

          <p>As a significant heat wave impacts Southern California, authorities have lifted the last evacuation orders for the Canyon fire, which has burned over 5,000 acres in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The fire, now 28% contained, showed minimal overnight activity, allowing crews to focus on securing the perimeter and addressing hot spots. The blaze, which started Thursday, was exacerbated by the region's high temperatures, with inland areas expecting triple-digit heat through the weekend. A battalion chief was seriously injured in a vehicle rollover while involved in the firefighting operations.</p>

          <p>Three Thai soldiers were wounded by a landmine near the border with Cambodia, with one sustaining a severe leg injury. The incident occurred just days after both nations agreed to extend a ceasefire that ended their deadliest clashes in decades over disputed border temples. The Thai army stated the explosion violates the Ottawa Convention and is an obstacle to peace, accusing Cambodia of laying new mines. Cambodia, a signatory to the mine-ban treaty, denied the accusation, stating the ordnance is likely a remnant from past conflicts.</p>

          <p>At least 365 people were arrested in London's Parliament Square during a demonstration supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds of individuals simultaneously display signs with messages like "I support Palestine Action," leading to mass arrests for supporting a banned organization. The UK government banned the group in July, making any form of support a criminal offense.

While New York police report historically low gun violence, the high-profile shooting is contrasted with Trump's rhetoric about crime being "totally out of control."

          <p>This article traces the history of modern partisan gerrymandering, focusing on the Republican's strategic 'Redmap' project following the 2010 census. This initiative targeted key state legislative races to gain control of the redistricting process, successfully locking in a significant advantage for the GOP in Congress and statehouses for a decade. The use of advanced mapping software and voter data allowed for the creation of extremely skewed districts, insulating conservative lawmakers from the ballot box. The piece argues that this practice has entrenched hard-right policies and fundamentally reshaped American politics by making district lines, rather than voters, the primary determinant of election outcomes.</p>

          <p>During a recent visit to Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous award to President Trump's special envoy, intended for the family of a senior CIA official whose son was killed fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The son, Michael Gloss, 21, was the child of CIA deputy director Juliane Gallina and had enlisted with Russian forces in 2023. The award, the Soviet-era Order of Lenin, was bestowed as confirmation emerged of a planned Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. The CIA has stated Gloss suffered from mental health issues and was never an agency employee.</p>

          <p>The New Orleans Roman Catholic archdiocese has detailed a proposed point-based system to distribute settlement funds to survivors of clergy abuse as part of its bankruptcy case. Under the plan, claims would be assigned points based on the severity of the abuse, with a sexual assault claim worth 75 points and being shown pornography worth 10. The total value of each point will depend on the final settlement amount, estimated between $180 million and $235 million. The proposal faces opposition from attorneys representing nearly 200 survivors, who are urging a "no" vote, potentially dismissing the bankruptcy case.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a press conference to address violent crime in Washington, D.C., following his administration's decision to increase the presence of federal law enforcement in the city. Trump has been critical of the Democratic-led city's leadership and threatened to federalize its police force. Local officials, including D.C.'s nonvoting delegate Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, have condemned the move as an offensive encroachment on the district's home rule. This action comes as data shows that overall violent crime in the nation's capital has been decreasing, reaching a 30-year low last year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James to testify about her civil fraud investigation into President Donald Trump.

Her office, which has also been subpoenaed regarding its investigation into the NRA, condemned the move as a political weaponization of the justice system. A lawyer for James described it as a blatant act of political retribution by the Trump administration, which has previously accused James of mortgage fraud without filing charges.</p>

          <p>Official documents reveal that radioactive water leaked from the Royal Navy's Coulport nuclear weapons depot into Loch Long in Scotland due to burst pipes. The files, obtained after a six-year freedom of information battle, show that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) attributed the leaks to poor maintenance of the base's pipe network. One incident in 2019 resulted in the release of low levels of tritium. While the Ministry of Defence insists no unsafe releases occurred, Sepa noted that its assessments found the environmental risk was of "no regulatory concern."</p>

          <p>The Democratic party is signaling a shift to a more aggressive, confrontational strategy in response to a new push for mid-decade gerrymandering by Republicans. Spurred by President Trump's call to redraw districts in states like Texas and Florida, Democratic leaders such as California Governor Gavin Newsom and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker are threatening to retaliate with their own partisan map-drawing. This marks a departure from the party's previous emphasis on nonpartisan reform, with prominent figures now arguing that they must fight fire with fire to counter what they describe as an authoritarian, anti-democracy effort.</p>

The project includes 62 affordable housing units available via a city lottery, alongside market-rate apartments.

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement savings withdrawals, now suggests that many retirees can safely spend more. In his new book, he argues that a more diversified portfolio, including small-company and international stocks, can support a higher withdrawal rate, potentially around 4.7% or even higher for current retirees. Bengen notes that inflation is the greatest threat to retirement portfolios and advises strategies like annual rebalancing and a rising equity glide path to maximize funds.

The meeting is proceeding without Ukrainian participation, effectively ending the previous administration's policy of "Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine." This development places Ukraine in a difficult position, as its future is being negotiated without its presence at the table. The panel discussed how this approach essentially undermines Ukrainian sovereignty for a second time, first by the war and now by the diplomatic process.</p>
