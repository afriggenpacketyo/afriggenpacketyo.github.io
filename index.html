          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon voiced skepticism regarding Harvard University President Alan Garber's decision to take a 25% pay cut, questioning its effectiveness in addressing antisemitism and racial discrimination on campus. McMahon highlighted concerns about ideological bias within Harvard's faculty, citing a report indicating a significant disparity in political representation. She also noted the Trump administration's ongoing investigation into Harvard's practices and its decision to freeze substantial funding due to the university's alleged failure to confront discrimination and harassment.

          <p>China is reorganizing its military education system by establishing new academies for its service branches, as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) aims to modernize. The Ministry of Defence announced the PLA Ground Force Service Academy in Hefei, the PLA Information Support Force Engineering University in Wuhan, and the PLA Joint Logistics Support Force Engineering University in Chongqing. These academies will recruit high school graduates, providing distinct channels for the Information Support Force (ISF) and Joint Logistics Support Force (JLSF) to strengthen their talent pools and train personnel for modern warfare. This initiative is part of a broader structural overhaul of the PLA since 2016, aimed at achieving a "world-class" military by 2049.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales are set to debate an assisted dying bill, marking the first discussion since major changes were introduced. The bill, which allows terminally ill adults to choose to end their lives, has undergone six months of scrutiny and amendments, including removing the need for a High Court judge's approval. The government has also revised its impact assessment, reducing the estimated number of assisted deaths in the first year. While opinions remain divided, the debate underscores the ongoing societal and ethical considerations surrounding end-of-life choices.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding the ability of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a check on presidential authority that President Trump is challenging. The cases involve Trump's executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship, which several federal courts deemed unconstitutional and blocked nationwide. The justices appear ideologically divided, with the outcome potentially resting on Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett. If nationwide injunctions are eliminated, challenges to government policies would need to be brought separately in each federal district, creating inconsistent laws until the Supreme Court resolves the issue for the entire country.</p>

The Department of Health and Human Services indicated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may require additional clinical evaluation, potentially including seasonal flu vaccines. Officials are also questioning the necessity of COVID vaccines for children under 12. Some experts fear these new limits could undermine the use of all vaccines, including those in the childhood immunization schedule, by raising safety doubts and making it difficult for companies to continue production.</p>

Richardson's backing of President Trump's plan to shrink FEMA and shift responsibilities to the states has raised concerns among staff.

After the scheme was uncovered, Nyangoro sent a message acknowledging their predicament. If convicted, the men face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for each count.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A committee of MPs is urging a one-year delay to proposed changes in farm inheritance tax, citing inadequate consultation and potential harm to small family businesses. The government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than Â£1 million at a rate of 20% starting in April 2026. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee's report recommends delaying implementation until April 2027 to allow farmers more time to seek professional advice. The committee also criticized the government's closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) environmental payments scheme, saying it has affected trust and left many farmers at risk.</p>

          <p>A brain-dead woman in Georgia has been kept on life support for three months to allow her fetus to develop, due to the state's restrictive abortion law. The hospital cited the law, which bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected, as the reason for not removing life-sustaining devices. The family is upset that they do not have a say in the matter, and that the fetus may have health issues. The situation highlights the complex legal and ethical questions surrounding abortion bans and the rights of brain-dead pregnant women.</p>

The judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prove harm or that the designation caused him to lose out on a desired position. While the federal claim was dismissed, state matters remain pending. The lawsuit stemmed from accusations that Villanueva harassed two officials, leading to the "do not rehire" designation.</p>

Ventura acknowledged her love for Combs but testified that she later witnessed a violent and coercive side of him.
