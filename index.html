          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 07:18:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's economy demonstrated resilience by growing at an annual rate of 7.4% in the March quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts despite global economic uncertainties. This growth marks the strongest quarterly performance in the fiscal year 2025, contributing to an overall expansion of 6.5% for the full fiscal year. The robust growth is attributed to strong domestic consumption and a relatively lower dependence on exports, which has helped cushion the impact of international trade policies. The nation is potentially poised to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S., following similar deals with China and the U.K. The Indian economy shows signs of stability, driven by internal demand and strategic trade positioning. The optimism score for this article is high, reflecting positive economic performance. </p>

          <p>Harvard University's lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over visa restrictions for foreign students has sparked debate about potential conflicts of interest for Supreme Court justices with Harvard affiliations. The lawsuit, alleging the Trump administration's actions are unconstitutional, could quickly reach the Supreme Court. Several justices have attended Harvard, raising questions about whether they should recuse themselves from the case, though previous affiliations alone do not typically warrant recusal.

          <p>The Republican nominee for Virginia governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, is attempting to distance herself from her past hardline anti-abortion record, declining to state whether she would support abortion restrictions if elected. Her previous statements include support for a 15-week abortion ban and a desire to make abortion illegal in most cases. This shift comes as polling shows her trailing the Democratic nominee, Abigail Spanberger, and as Virginia voters broadly support abortion rights. Earle-Sears' attempts to moderate her stance reflect the political challenges of running in a state with strong support for abortion access. </p>

          <p>Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize for his work on the accelerating expansion of the universe, now questions the standard model of cosmology, which includes the concept of dark energy. Riess's precise observations of distant galaxies led to the discovery of dark energy, a repulsive force driving the universe's expansion. However, recent data suggests a discrepancy in the expansion rate, known as the Hubble tension, leading Riess to believe the standard model may be flawed. The possibility of revising the standard model has created tension among cosmologists, with some skeptical of the need for such a drastic change. </p>

          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde suggests that geopolitical shifts are creating an opportunity for the euro to gain greater international prominence as uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies weakens confidence in the U.S. dollar. Lagarde outlined three key foundations for the euro to increase its global influence, including maintaining open trade, reinforcing Europe's economic foundation, and bolstering its legal framework. A stronger euro could bring benefits such as lower borrowing costs and protection from sanctions. Some market watchers agree that the euro could rise as investors seek to diversify away from the dollar (not investment advice).</p>
