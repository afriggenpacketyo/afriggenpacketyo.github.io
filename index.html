          <p>Following the collapse of a Bangkok high-rise during the March 28 earthquake in Myanmar, a construction magnate, along with builders, designers, and engineers, surrendered to police on criminal negligence charges. Premchai Karnasuta, president of Italian-Thai Development Co., and 16 others face felony charges for professional negligence causing death after 92 people died in the collapse of the State Audit Office building. Evidence suggests the building plan didn't meet standards, with reports highlighting structural flaws and substandard materials, and this article notes that Premchai previously served time for wildlife poaching.</p>

          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong growth in its Jewellery Maisons division, indicating that wealthy consumers continue to spend despite global economic uncertainties. Revenues rose 7% year-on-year, although sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. While Richemont faces headwinds like rising gold prices and foreign exchange fluctuations, analysts believe the company's pricing power could offset these challenges. The company's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would continue to require strong agility and discipline.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the likely election of George Simion, a far-right candidate, as Romania's next president, which is rooted in decades of economic failure, widespread insecurity, and mass emigration. The author, Vladimir Bortun, argues that Romania's free-market orthodoxy has led to poor social indicators despite respectable growth numbers. Both Simion and his opponent, Nicusor Dan, are criticized for their allegiance to the business class and lack of plans to alter the country's fundamental economic framework. The article suggests that Romania is falling into an abyss due to the absence of a political force that can offer a genuine alternative to the status quo.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations are urgently seeking talks with the United States Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer, to address concerns over impending tariffs. Many countries sent ministers to the APEC meeting in South Korea to push for meetings with Greer before the 90-day pause on tariffs expires in July. The tariffs, imposed by President Trump, affect numerous countries, including longtime allies like South Korea and Japan, and have led to a reduced economic outlook for the region. The article also notes that while many countries are seeking to negotiate with the White House, Britain is the only country to have reached an agreement with the Trump administration so far.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the upcoming peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Istanbul, the first direct talks since the beginning of the war. Expectations for significant results are low, but the meeting is seen as a win for President Putin, who refused a battlefield cease-fire as a precondition. President Zelensky has questioned Russia's seriousness but agreed to send a delegation out of respect for President Trump and Turkish President Erdogan. The article suggests that Putin may be using the talks to influence Trump's stance on the conflict, potentially at Ukraine's expense.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that the first statewide transit strike in New Jersey in over 40 years has begun, as 450 unionized locomotive engineers walked off their jobs due to a pay dispute. The strike has shut down NJ Transit’s rail network, impacting tens of thousands of commuters in the New York City metropolitan area. NJ Transit's bus system will continue to operate, and the agency has hired private buses to substitute for train service, but they can only accommodate about 20 percent of displaced riders. The strike comes after months of unsuccessful negotiations and federal interventions, with the union demanding pay parity with other regional railroads.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive genetic analysis by an international team has traced the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas, revealing that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. The study, led by researchers at the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, also found that early migrants to South America formed distinct groups that remained isolated due to environmental conditions. This work could provide insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted more than expected in the first quarter of 2025, with a 0.2% decline attributed to falling exports and stagnant consumption, according to official data. This contraction, steeper than the anticipated 0.2% fall, has been exacerbated by U.S. President Trump's tariff policies. Experts suggest the economic slowdown trend may become more pronounced, with the possibility of a recession depending on the impact of the tariffs. While the central bank had begun gradually hiking rates, it is now facing pressure to consider fiscal spending to stimulate growth.</p>

This trend was driven by institutional investors seeking haven assets amid concerns about the U.S. economy and trade tensions.

          <p>Europe has been warned to quickly reform or risk becoming a "shock absorber" in the US-China trade war, despite a recent easing of tensions following talks in Geneva. Economists suggest that without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe may struggle to assert itself as a "third pole" and could be forced to adapt to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes. The article emphasizes the need for Europe to proactively adapt to the changing global trade landscape.</p>

          <p>Nissan is open to sharing its global factories with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as part of a business shakeup, despite recent layoffs and factory closures. The struggling Japanese firm, which employs thousands in the UK, could bring Dongfeng "into the Nissan production eco-system globally." This move comes as Nissan faces weak sales in key markets and seeks cost-saving measures, with ongoing collaboration in building cars in Wuhan.</p>
