          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 95 fatalities, with dozens of people still unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose with shocking speed, catching many off guard, including those at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp that saw at least 27 deaths among campers and counselors. The disaster prompted a major federal disaster declaration, mobilizing extensive search and rescue operations involving state and federal agencies. Officials are continuing round-the-clock searches as the full scale of the tragedy, which impacted multiple counties, continues to unfold.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After five consecutive weeks of decline, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage now stands at 6.75%, offering a slight reprieve for potential homebuyers. This downward trend occurred despite the Federal Reserve maintaining its key interest rate, highlighting the influence of other factors like the 10-year Treasury yield. Experts are cautious about predicting whether this relief will continue into July, as future movements depend heavily on upcoming inflation data and signals from the Federal Reserve. Prospective buyers are advised to monitor the market closely for opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wage garnishment, a debt collection tactic where creditors take money directly from a paycheck, can often continue until the entire debt, including interest and fees, is fully paid. For consumer debts like credit cards or medical bills, federal law generally limits the amount to 25% of disposable income, but the duration can extend for years. Different rules apply to federal student loans and tax debts, which may not require a court order and can involve different garnishment percentages. Individuals facing garnishment have options such as challenging it in court or negotiating with creditors.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have officially concluded their investigation into long-standing rumors surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, finding no evidence of a so-called "client list" that could implicate high-profile individuals. The joint memo also reaffirms the official finding that Epstein's 2019 death in a New York prison was a suicide, contradicting widespread conspiracy theories suggesting he was murdered. This conclusion has been met with skepticism and frustration from some who believed the Trump administration would release files proving a wider conspiracy. The White House stated some files were withheld due to their graphic nature.</p>

While the law introduces an additional income-based deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors, it does not directly eliminate the tax on Social Security benefits. The new deduction may indirectly lower the tax liability for some middle-income seniors by reducing their adjusted gross income.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the UK Labour government must handle its planned reforms for Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) with care to avoid the calamitous rollout of past welfare changes. The education secretary's upcoming proposals have already caused anxiety, particularly concerning potential changes to Education, Health and care plans (EHCPs). The author urges the government to engage in genuine consultation with affected groups, avoid rushing the policy, and address the severe financial strain the current system places on local councils. A cross-party consensus is recommended to ensure stability for vulnerable children.</p>

          <h2>Satirical Column Lampoons Workplace Trend Pieces by Re-labeling Everyday Activities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 15:48:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic pokes fun at the media's obsession with inventing names for mundane workplace behaviors, particularly among Gen Z employees. The author humorously recounts a typical workday using the language of trend pieces, rebranding sleep as "Microdeath," commuting without internet as a "Tiny Detox," and using the restroom as a "Microspa." The piece critiques the alarmist tone of such articles by applying it to perfectly normal activities like breathing ("Lung Bathing") and talking to colleagues ("Voice Quitting"). The satire highlights the absurdity of pathologizing the routine actions of a younger generation of workers.</p>

          <p>At least 10 people have been killed and over 560 arrested during widespread anti-government protests in Kenya, according to official and human rights sources. The demonstrations, which took place in numerous counties, saw protesters demanding President William Ruto's resignation over issues including the high cost of living, alleged corruption, and police brutality. Authorities blocked roads into the capital, Nairobi, to prevent rallies, leading to clashes where police used tear gas and allegedly live rounds against protesters. The protests commemorated "Saba Saba," a historic pro-democracy movement.</p>

          <p>A new mural in North Hollywood by artist Louie Palsino honors Dodgers utility player Kiké Hernández for his public support of immigrants. The artwork was inspired by a recent social media post from Hernández, a native of Puerto Rico, in which he expressed his anger over the treatment of immigrants and stated that Los Angeles has adopted him as one of its own. The mural, which features Hernández's image alongside the words "Born X Raised" and "Los Angeles," celebrates his stand for "what is right." The artist has created other Dodgers-themed murals in the same location.</p>

His hitting numbers have seen a slight dip during this period, though he still leads the National League in home runs and maintains MVP-caliber statistics overall.

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut looking increasingly likely, homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) can take proactive steps now. This article advises prospective borrowers to first check their credit report and score, as a higher score will secure better rates and terms. Second, they should shop around and compare lenders beyond their current mortgage provider to establish a baseline of competitive offers. Finally, it is crucial to calculate potential repayment costs under various interest rate scenarios, as the variable rate on a HELOC can change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced its worst first-half performance since 1973, declining 10.7% against global currencies, and it may face continued pressure. Factors contributing to the weakness include U.S. policy volatility, growing national debt and deficits, and the prospect of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This trend has prompted some global central banks to increase gold purchases as an alternative safe-haven asset. While a weaker dollar can benefit U.S. exporters, some analysts worry about the potential erosion of the dollar's global dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

A draft proposal would strip eligibility from employers involved in "illegal activities," with definitions targeting immigration services, support for transgender youth, and groups labeled as terrorist organizations.
