          <p>An alligator attacked and killed a 61-year-old woman canoeing with her husband on Lake Kissimmee in central Florida. According to officials, the alligator thrashed, tipping the canoe over and biting the woman after the boat passed over it in shallow water. The husband attempted to intervene but was unsuccessful, and the woman was later declared dead. Nuisance alligator trappers recovered two alligators from the scene, one matching the description of the alligator involved in the incident, though officials did not say if either alligator would be euthanized.</p>

          <p>A county judge, two City Council members, and a former county election administrator were indicted in Texas on charges of illegal vote harvesting and evidence tampering. Attorney General Ken Paxton's office conducted raids on political operatives and voting organizers, leading to accusations of voter suppression targeting Latino Democrats. The indictments allege that officials provided monetary compensation for vote harvesting services, sparking concerns about the fairness and integrity of Texas elections.

This decision marks the third consecutive meeting without action, leaving the bank's key lending rate around 4.3%.

          <p>A congressional panel investigating antisemitism on US college campuses was accused of trying to chill free speech and likened to the House Un-American Activities Committee. David Cole, a professor at Georgetown University law centre, criticized the committee for "broad-based charges of antisemitism without any factual predicate". He added that the hearings were flawed on free speech grounds and for focusing on the 1964 Civil Rights Acts. He said that "Antisemitic speech, while lamentable, is constitutionally protected, just like racist speech, sexist speech and homophobic speech".</p>

          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, is accused of providing his much younger girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with habit-forming anesthesia drugs that ultimately led to her death. Prosecutors allege that Ryan, who had noticed Harris when she was only 14, used the drugs to control her. Ryan was charged with drug distribution, intent to distribute, and "depraved heart murder." A jury found him guilty on all charges, and he was sentenced to 45 years in prison.</p>

          <h2>Ultraprocessed Foods Linked to Early Parkinson's Symptoms in New Study</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 16:00:05 EDT</div>

          <p>A new study has found an association between consuming ultraprocessed foods and developing early symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Researchers reported that people who ate a lot of ultraprocessed foods were more likely to develop early signs of the disease than those who consumed less. While the study does not prove causation, experts believe it is a step toward understanding how food choices affect brain health. It suggests that consuming fewer ultraprocessed foods and more whole foods may benefit brain health.</p>
