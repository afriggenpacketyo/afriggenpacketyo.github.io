          <p>TeleMessage, a messaging app similar to Signal and used by former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, has temporarily suspended its services due to a potential security incident. Smarsh, the parent company of TeleMessage, is investigating the possible hack and has engaged a cybersecurity firm. The breach reportedly compromised messages sent through TeleMessage's versions of Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat. However, the article specifies that the hacker did not obtain messages from Mike Waltz during his tenure as National Security Advisor.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, ensuring that the nonprofit organization controlling it will remain its largest shareholder. This decision reverses a previous plan to shift control to investors and is seen as a victory for critics like Elon Musk, who argued the company was prioritizing profits over safety. CEO Sam Altman stated that this new structure provides a more understandable framework for the company's operations, as OpenAI continues negotiating the nonprofit's stake in the new corporation, and the nonprofit will choose the board members. SoftBank's $40 billion funding round is contingent on this restructuring being completed by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has announced he will not run for Senate in 2026, depriving Republicans of a strong challenger against Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. Kemp, a popular two-term governor, made his decision despite being heavily recruited by top Republicans. He cited family reasons and conveyed his commitment to helping the party find a strong nominee. Ossoff, who narrowly won election in 2020, has already raised $11 million for his re-election campaign and has been critical of President Trump, setting the stage for a potentially tough race.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are seeking revisions to cryptocurrency legislation due to growing concerns about the Trump family's involvement in the industry and potential conflicts of interest. The GENIUS Act, which aims to facilitate stablecoin transactions, is facing opposition after reports surfaced about a Trump-affiliated crypto firm securing a $2 billion deal with an Emirati venture fund. Senators are worried the bill could benefit the Trump family and lack sufficient protections against money laundering. Several Democrats have announced they will not support the bill without significant changes, potentially jeopardizing its passage.</p>

          <p>President Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, citing $1.98 a gallon in a Truth Social post while urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. According to AAA, the average U.S. gas price is actually $3.165 per gallon, about $1.18 more than Trump's claim. While RBOB gasoline futures did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, this contract represents wholesale, unfinished gasoline prices and does not include taxes, transportation costs, or other fees paid by consumers. Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy emphasizes that RBOB prices are irrelevant to consumers.</p>

          <p>Nineteen states and Washington, D.C., are suing the Trump administration over mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), arguing that the job cuts are dismantling the agency and disrupting essential services. The lawsuit claims that the layoffs disproportionately affect critical programs, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The states argue that the layoffs have cut them off from vital data and made it harder to access grants, while also forcing the closure of key disease testing labs.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett will retire at the end of the year as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway after six decades. In an age of insecurity, Mr. Buffett was an anchor of endurance. Since he took the helm of Berkshire — on May 10, 1965 — General Motors, then the largest American corporation, has greeted 11 new chief executives. Sears, Roebuck, the biggest retailer, has vanished from the scene. Eleven U.S. presidents have come and gone (two of them having survived impeachment and one forced to resign), and Coca-Cola changed its formula, but Mr. Buffett didn’t change his. He revered the institutions of capitalism; most especially, he treated the executive’s duty to shareholders as a sacred trust. (not investment advice)</p>

This change comes after the SSA had started recovering erroneous overpayments by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check. The SSA's inspector general found that 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations. Last year, the Biden administration capped the clawback rate at 10% after reports that some seniors and disabled beneficiaries had been forced into financial hardship.</p>
