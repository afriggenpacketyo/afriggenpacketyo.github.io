        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Early returns from the Czech Republic's parliamentary election indicate a victory for the right-wing populist ANO party, led by billionaire former Prime Minister Andrej Babis. Projections show ANO securing about 35.5% of the vote, significantly ahead of the ruling center-right Spolu coalition. Babis, who has campaigned on a "Czech first" platform and opposes continued military aid to Ukraine, may need to form a coalition with the far-right SPD party to govern. This potential political shift is causing concern in Brussels, as it could align the Czech Republic with Hungary and Slovakia in challenging EU policies and support for Kyiv.</p>

          <p>A new film from A24, "The Smashing Machine," features a nearly unrecognizable Dwayne Johnson in the role of pioneering UFC fighter Mark Kerr. The gritty biopic, directed by Benny Safdie, chronicles Kerr's career in the late 90s and his intense struggle with a near-fatal opioid addiction, supported by his then-girlfriend played by Emily Blunt. While the article praises Johnson's powerful and serious performance as a significant departure from his usual roles, potentially earning him Oscar consideration, it finds the overall film lacking in emotional investment. Johnson's portrayal is described as the movie's undeniable heartbeat, though the narrative itself may not be as compelling.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have deployed hundreds of additional officers to the city's streets to provide reassurance to communities following a deadly attack at a synagogue. Two men were killed when an attacker drove a car into people outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation before being shot dead by police. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes stated that officers are working extended shifts and that resources are in place to protect the city's Jewish population, especially with the Conservative Party Conference also taking place. Six individuals remain in custody on suspicion of terrorism offenses in connection with the attack.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Navy Chief of Staff Jon Harrison, an aide who was instrumental in the Trump administration's efforts to reshape the Pentagon. Harrison's dismissal follows reports that he and Navy Secretary John Phelan had sought to limit the influence of the newly confirmed Navy Under Secretary, Hung Cao. This move is part of a broader pattern of upheaval under Hegseth, who has overseen the firing of numerous top generals and ordered a significant reduction in the number of four-star officers. The Pentagon confirmed Harrison's departure but did not provide a reason for the sudden termination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FBI is reportedly considering a "showy" public arrest of its former director, James Comey, who was recently indicted on charges of lying to Congress. According to sources, FBI leadership discussed using "large, beefy" agents for the arrest, but a supervisory agent who refused to participate in the plan was suspended for insubordination. Comey was issued a summons to appear for his arraignment, and his lawyers had agreed to bring him to court, making the potential for a public perp walk highly unusual for a white-collar defendant. The situation underscores the escalating feud between former President Trump and Comey.</p>

          <p>China's military has revealed details of an encounter from last year where one of its J-16 fighter jets intercepted and expelled two foreign stealth fighter jets over its coastal waters. According to the pilot, the foreign aircraft were acting provocatively and heading directly for Chinese planes. In response, the pilot performed an aggressive barrel roll maneuver, flying inverted just meters above one of the foreign jets. After this action, the pilot successfully locked onto both aircraft with his targeting systems, prompting them to leave the area, showcasing escalating military tensions.</p>

          <p>Newly elected Democratic Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona was unable to be sworn into office this week by House Speaker Mike Johnson. Grijalva suspects the delay is politically motivated, as she intends to provide the 218th and final signature on a discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing files related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. This legislative maneuver is opposed by Speaker Johnson and former President Trump. A spokesperson for Johnson indicated Grijalva will be sworn in when the House returns to session, which is currently stalled due to a government funding dispute.</p>

          <p>According to new research from the advocacy group Pregnancy Justice, prosecutors in 16 states have charged 412 people with pregnancy-related crimes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The majority of these cases involve allegations of substance use during pregnancy and often utilize laws intended to protect children, not fetuses. This trend signals a growing acceptance of "fetal personhood," which grants legal rights to fetuses and could lead to increased surveillance and criminalization of pregnant individuals for a wide range of behaviors. The article warns this could push the U.S. toward a model similar to El Salvador, where pregnancy is aggressively policed.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has emerged as the court's most frequent dissenter, using her written opinions to issue stark warnings about threats to the rule of law in the United States. Legal scholars note her powerful language, such as describing a ruling that limited injunctions against the president as an "existential threat." In one notable footnote, she cited a book analyzing the legal structure of Nazi Germany to draw a parallel with unchecked executive power. Her dissents are seen as a direct message to the American public and lower courts about the current state of democracy under a conservative-majority court.</p>

Risher was convinced by founder Jeff Bezos's powerful vision and obsession with the customer experience.

          <p>After losing his Altadena home in the Eaton fire, Ted Koerner is on a mission to rebuild as quickly as possible, potentially becoming the first in his community to do so. His primary motivation is his 13-year-old golden retriever, Daisy, who is beyond the average life expectancy for her breed. Koerner, who credits Daisy with saving his life during bouts of depression, wants her to live out her remaining time in the comfort of their home. By liquidating retirement funds and relentlessly navigating bureaucracy, he has expedited the construction process, driven by his deep bond with his canine companion.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the profound legacy of primatologist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, arguing that her work fundamentally changed how humans perceive their place in the world. The article recalls the pivotal moment in 1960 when she observed a chimpanzee, whom she named David Greybeard, using a twig as a tool to eat termites. This discovery shattered the long-held belief that tool-making was exclusive to humans, forcing a redefinition of the species. Her ability to connect with chimpanzees without words demonstrated a shared language of gesture and reassurance, bridging the gap between humans and the animal kingdom.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on a passenger train in Shostka, in Ukraine's northern Sumy region, has injured at least 30 people in what President Zelenskyy called an act of "terrorism." In addition to the attack on civilians, overnight Russian drone attacks targeted energy infrastructure near Chernihiv, leaving approximately 50,000 households without power. In response, Ukraine launched its own drone attack, hitting the Kinef oil refinery outside St. Petersburg for the second time in recent weeks.

          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack on a synagogue in Manchester, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has publicly called on those planning pro-Palestinian protests to reconsider, stating it is "not a time to stoke tension." He urged demonstrators to "recognise and respect the grief of British Jews," emphasizing the distress the timing of the protests would cause. Police leaders in both London and Manchester have expressed concern that policing the marches will divert critical resources needed to protect Jewish communities. Despite these calls, protest organizers have stated their intention to proceed, arguing that cancelling peaceful protests lets terror win.</p>

          <p>Certified financial planners recommend that the fourth quarter is an ideal time for individuals to conduct a comprehensive review of their finances. With most of the year's actual income and spending data available, it becomes easier to make impactful decisions, especially regarding tax strategies that must be implemented before December 31. Experts also highlight the importance of creating a budget for the upcoming holiday season to prevent starting the new year with financial stress and debt. This year's planning is particularly crucial due to recent tax law changes that could affect deductions for state and local taxes and charitable donations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that her party will take the United Kingdom out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if it wins the next general election. This major policy shift follows a party-led legal review which concluded that remaining in the ECHR obstructs migration reform and other key conservative goals. The move is seen as a way to solidify the party's position on immigration and counter pressure from the right-wing Reform UK party, which has long advocated for leaving the treaty. The decision has been criticized by Labour as a sign of weakness and by Liberal Democrats as aligning the UK with Russia.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics and writers are increasingly exploring speculative and science fiction as a tool for soft power, aiming to challenge the dominance of Western, often dystopian, narratives about the future. According to scholars at a recent conference, this genre allows China to project alternative future scenarios that critique present-day neoliberal ideologies and offer different visions for society. By creating their own futuristic narratives, they aim to move beyond the traditionally bleak outlooks prevalent in Euro-American sci-fi. This represents a conscious effort to shape global conversations about the future through a cultural and ideological lens.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, many Black, brown, and queer college students are voicing concern over his sudden deification as a national hero. Interviews with students reveal a deep unease with the valorization of a figure they associate with hateful rhetoric against marginalized communities. They also fear that Kirk's death is being used to justify racist threats against historically Black colleges and universities, disciplinary actions against students of color, and broader attacks on free speech. Many feel that their communities are being unfairly blamed for his death while his controversial legacy is being ignored.</p>
