        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. engages in military action against Iran, China's support for Tehran appears to be restrained, balancing its economic interests and strategic calculations. China, a long-standing ally of Iran, has been cooperating on military exercises and economic partnerships. However, China's primary interest lies in its access to Iranian oil and the Strait of Hormuz, a critical route for global crude oil flows. Experts suggest that China's limited influence over Israel and its strategic considerations regarding Washington's involvement in the conflict will likely keep its involvement minimal, potentially benefiting from any chaos that destabilizes the U.S.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk is ending its partnership with Hims & Hers due to concerns about the telehealth company's sales and promotion of cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy.

The company's CEO, Andrew Dudum, stated that they believe it's important to maintain independence in treatment choices for patients.

          <p>ProCap Financial, led by Anthony Pompliano, has raised over $750 million and is going public through a SPAC, aiming to hold up to $1 billion in bitcoin. The firm intends to generate revenue through a bitcoin-denominated financial services platform, joining a growing trend of bitcoin-heavy ventures tapping into public markets through reverse mergers and blank-check vehicles. Pompliano acknowledges the rush into bitcoin treasuries resembles a bubble, driven by cheap capital and brand endorsements, but believes the trend is working.

          <p>A new report indicates that most Americans feel they need a higher income to live comfortably, with 45% requiring $100,000 or more annually. About 26% believe they need $150,000 or more, while 16% feel they need over $200,000, contrasting with the median household income of just over $80,000 in 2023. The share of Americans who do not feel financially comfortable has risen to 77% in 2025, up from 72% in 2023, due to high inflation and economic uncertainty. Stagnant wages, rising prices, political instability, and increasing expenses like child care and student loans contribute to this financial insecurity.</p>
