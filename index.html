The Chelan County Sheriff's Office had been searching for Decker since May 30, after his ex-wife reported their daughters missing. The bodies of the girls were discovered near Decker's abandoned vehicle in a campground, leading to a large-scale search involving multiple law enforcement agencies, including the Washington National Guard. Authorities consider Decker dangerous and are urging the public to report any sightings to 911, offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his arrest.</p>

This came after President Trump deployed Marines and National Guardsmen to LA, a move Johnson supports. Newsom responded on social media, accusing the GOP of wanting to bring the country back to the 18th Century. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump's actions, pointing out his refusal to send in the guard during the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's tax cuts bill, known as Section 899, could allow the federal government to tax foreign-parented companies and investors from countries judged to have "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. The Global Business Alliance warns that this measure could cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually in lost GDP over 10 years. While Republican Rep. Jason Smith defends the provision as protecting U.S. interests, critics argue it contradicts Trump's efforts to attract foreign investment and could harm states dependent on foreign companies.
