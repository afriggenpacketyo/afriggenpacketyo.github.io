          <h2>US and China Engage in High-Stakes Trade Negotiations in Geneva</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 01:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for a second day of negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from President Trump's trade war. Punitive tariffs imposed by both nations have disrupted global supply chains, prompting American companies to seek alternative sourcing and Chinese factories to explore new export routes. Economists warn that the trade dispute could slow global growth and fuel inflation, potentially leading to a recession in the United States. Despite initial positive remarks from Mr. Trump, skepticism remains about the likelihood of a quick deal, with analysts suggesting that any concessions made by China would be touted as a win for the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that the pursuit of perfect mothering is harmful, as children need to learn that flaws are acceptable. She notes that mothers are often blamed for their children's problems, a holdover from a time when the field of psychiatry was dominated by men. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and recognize that their imperfections are part of raising well-adjusted children. She also includes a humorous quiz to help mothers acknowledge their imperfections and embrace their good-enough status.</p>

          <p>Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, returned to Boston after being released from a Louisiana immigration detention center, where she was held for over six weeks following her arrest for political speech.

Öztürk said she would continue her case, expressing faith in the American justice system, while Senator Ed Markey praised her fight.

          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has reinstated Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party leadership had sought to replace Kim, believing Han had a better chance of winning the upcoming elections. Kim denounced the attempt as a political coup, and PPP members voted against the motion, reinstating him as the candidate. The PPP has been in turmoil since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, with the opposition Democratic Party's candidate currently leading in the polls.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to be held in Turkey on May 15, brushing aside demands from European leaders for a 30-day cease-fire. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, during their joint visit to Kyiv, had warned of new and massive sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors if Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional cease-fire. Putin said Russia was prepared for serious negotiations without preconditions, aiming to eliminate the root causes of the conflict, but authorities reported an attack by Russian exploding drones in several cities, including Kyiv, shortly after his announcement.</p>

The situation is further complicated by Prince Andrew's continued internal exile following scandals, thrusting Prince William into a more prominent public role as fears over the King's health increase.</p>

While Trump has the power to order changes to geographical names within the United States, other countries are not obligated to honor those changes, and the move could negatively impact ongoing Iran-U.S. nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>European officials are standing firm on their food safety standards, creating a potential sticking point in trade negotiations with the Trump administration, which wants Europe to import more American farm products. The EU's strict regulations, including a ban on hormones in beef, are deemed non-negotiable, with officials emphasizing that food, health, and safety standards are a red line. While the US already exports hormone-free beef to the EU without tariffs, further concessions on food standards are unlikely due to European concerns about food culture, smaller family farms, and consumer preferences.</p>

In retaliation to Trump's tariffs, China has applied duties on U.S. goods and restricted exports of critical minerals.

          <p>President Trump and New York City Mayor Eric Adams have presented differing accounts of their recent meeting at the White House. Adams described the discussion as focused on important issues for New York City and investments for manufacturing, while Trump stated that they discussed "almost nothing" and that Adams primarily came to thank him. The contrasting narratives highlight the complex relationship between the city and the federal government, with Trump deferring questions about Adams' compliance with immigration enforcement to border czar Tom Homan.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed a "total reset" in US-China trade relations following talks in Geneva aimed at de-escalating the trade war. The negotiations involved top officials from both countries and focused on reducing tariffs and increasing American business access to China. While Trump hailed the discussions as a positive step, neither side has released specific details or signaled progress towards reducing tariffs. The trade war has disrupted supply chains and unsettled financial markets, raising fears of a global economic downturn.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has shown that a new medication, zongertinib, is a safe and effective therapy for a hard-to-treat type of lung cancer. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the oral medication outperformed the standard treatment option for HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Zongertinib works by targeting the HER2 protein and blocking the activity of tyrosine kinase, which is responsible for signaling cell growth, offering a new benchmark for targeted therapy in this difficult-to-treat cancer.</p>

Inspired by New York City's High Line, the project aims to create a tourist attraction and address issues such as summer heat and structural weight.
