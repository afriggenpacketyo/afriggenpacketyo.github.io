          <p>Da Wei, director of Tsinghua University’s Centre for International Security and Strategy, critically assesses US policy in its competition with China, describing it as marked by "ignorance and neglect." He expresses cautious optimism regarding the ongoing China-US trade negotiations, suggesting a deal is likely by autumn, though success depends on defined criteria. The article highlights recent high-level trade talks and the 90-day extension of the tariff truce, reflecting a mutual desire for an agreement from both Beijing and Washington. Da Wei's research focuses on China-US relations and US security and foreign policy, lending significant weight to his analysis of the complex bilateral relationship and trade tensions on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs of the season against the Athletics, setting a new single-season record for catchers in Major League Baseball. This achievement surpassed Salvador Perez’s 2021 total and also marked Raleigh’s ninth multi-home run game, setting a new switch-hitter record for a season. The article details his impressive longballs, including a 448ft shot, and notes his journey as a first-time All-Star at age 28, fresh off a six-year, $105 million contract extension. His performance cements his rising prominence, making him a strong contender to lead the American League in home runs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy the National Guard to Baltimore to combat crime, intensifying a public clash with Maryland Governor Wes Moore, who had invited him for a "safety walk." Trump's social media comments, which also hinted at similar deployments in Chicago and New York, follow his recent militarization of Washington D.C. Democrats, including Moore, have fiercely condemned these actions as an "abuse of power" and "tone deaf," pointing to declining crime rates in cities like D.C. and Baltimore. The article details the escalating political debate over federal intervention in local law enforcement, noting that the Pentagon plans to mobilize up to 1,700 National Guardsmen in 19 states for various functions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Liverpool John Moores University reveals that insufficient hydration can significantly elevate stress hormone levels. Individuals drinking less than 1.5 liters of water daily exhibited a 50% higher cortisol response to stress compared to those meeting recommended intake. The article explains that exaggerated cortisol reactivity is linked to increased risks of heart disease, diabetes, and depression, as cortisol is the body's primary stress hormone. Experts, including Professor Neil Walsh, suggest keeping a water bottle nearby during stressful times and monitoring urine color as a simple hydration check, emphasizing potential long-term health benefits.</p>

          <p>Millions across the Western United States are under extreme heat warnings, with temperatures expected to exceed 100 degrees through Tuesday, offering little nighttime relief. This dangerous heatwave significantly elevates wildfire risks due to dry conditions, allowing any fires to spread rapidly. Wildfires are already blazing in California's Napa County and central Oregon, challenging firefighters and prompting evacuations. The article emphasizes the health dangers of extreme heat, especially without adequate cooling, and advises residents to stay hydrated, seek shade, and check on vulnerable individuals like children and older adults.</p>

          <p>Levi Kelly, a tiny homes expert, successfully built a 19-square-foot "closet-sized" livable house for approximately $5,000 in southern Ohio, demonstrating extreme minimalist living. Driven by an obsession with tiny spaces, Kelly repurposed an old utility trailer for the foundation, with most expenses going into lumber, insulation, solar, and electrical. Despite its minimal footprint, the house features essential amenities like a compact AC/heating unit, a tilting bed, a portable toilet, and an outdoor shower, all powered by solar panels. The article showcases the innovative design and cost-effective approach, with Kelly testing its resilience during a snowstorm and suggesting others can build smaller.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to overhaul its asylum appeals system by establishing a new body with independent adjudicators, aiming to reduce "unacceptable delays" and the number of migrants housed in hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that appeals currently average over a year for 51,000 cases, leading to failed asylum seekers being accommodated at taxpayer expense. The Refugee Council argues that reducing mistakes in initial decisions, where about half are overturned, is the fastest way to cut the appeals backlog. The article also notes recent protests across the UK regarding asylum hotel use and a High Court ruling against one such hotel, highlighting the ongoing public and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore criticized President Trump's rhetoric on crime as "purely performative" and refused to authorize the Maryland National Guard for federal deployment in Baltimore. Moore's comments came after Trump offered to send troops to the city, despite Baltimore seeing a 22% decrease in homicides this year, which the governor attributed to local investments. Moore invited Trump for a "public safety walk" to counter what he called "blissful ignorance" and "1980s scare tactics." The article highlights Moore's firm stance that such federal interventions are "unconstitutional" and not scalable or sustainable for major American cities, emphasizing the need for effective, not theatrical, solutions.</p>

          <p>Renewable energy executives are warning that President Donald Trump's opposition to solar and wind projects could lead to a power crunch and increased electricity prices for consumers. Trump's administration is reportedly blocking federal permits and ending key tax credits for renewables, causing market instability and rising costs due to tariffs. Companies like Engie North America are slashing US investments by 50%, while others foresee a significant downturn in new renewable power generation from 2026 to 2028.

          <p>A new survey by Schroders indicates that a significant 19% of American retirees describe their retirement as a "nightmare," contrasting sharply with the 5% who are "living the dream." This disparity highlights a critical shortfall in retirement savings, with the average 401(k) balance for those 70 and up being only $250,000, far below the $1.26 million perceived as comfortable. The article attributes retirees' struggles to pervasive concerns over inflation, rising healthcare costs, and uncertainty about how long their savings will last, with nearly half admitting their daily expenses have exceeded expectations.
