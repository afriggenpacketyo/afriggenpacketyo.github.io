          <h2>Druckenmiller Voices Opposition to Tariffs Exceeding 10 Percent</h2>

          <p>Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller reiterated his long-standing opposition to tariffs exceeding 10% in a recent social media post. He distanced himself from President Trump's sweeping tariff plan, which includes rates as high as 50%. Druckenmiller views tariffs broadly as a consumption tax, with foreigners paying for some of it. Stock prices have fallen sharply following Trump's tariff announcement, with markets experiencing losses not seen since the Covid-19 pandemic.

Other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Solana's token also suffered substantial losses. Bitcoin's decline triggered a wave of long liquidations, as traders betting on price increases were forced to sell assets to cover losses.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced the measures to protect and create jobs in the face of new US tariffs. The changes include relaxing mandates on car firms transitioning to electric vehicle production, allowing smaller firms to keep making petrol cars beyond 2030, and permitting some hybrid vehicles until 2035. These changes are intended to help the British car industry navigate challenges posed by President Trump's tariffs on imported cars. </p>

These methods, such as planting perennials and using cover crops, increase soil carbon and improve water retention. State programs supporting these practices are essential to help farmers cover initial costs. The legislature is urged to allocate 15% of the State Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to climate-smart agriculture programs, enabling farmers to lead in climate action. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered all national parks to remain open despite severe staffing shortages. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum's memo requires any closures or reduction in hours to be reviewed by the National Park Service director. Conservation groups express concern that this mandate sidelines the expertise of park staff and creates unnecessary bureaucracy during peak visitation season. The order follows President Trump's cuts to National Park Service workers, raising concerns about visitor services and park maintenance. </p>

          <p>U.S. stock futures opened sharply lower, signaling a continuation of the selloff triggered by the Trump administration's tariff announcement. Investors anticipate another turbulent week as global trading partners react to the tariffs. The S&P 500 experienced its biggest two-day loss since March 2020, prompting concerns about a potential bear market. Top economic advisors are attempting to portray the tariffs as a strategic repositioning, but some traders anticipate a possible, albeit unsustainable, market rebound.
