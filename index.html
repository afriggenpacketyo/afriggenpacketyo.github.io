          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently sold 100,000 shares of Nvidia stock, amounting to approximately $15 million based on Tuesday's opening price. This transaction marks the first sale under Huang's plan, announced in March, to sell up to 6 million shares by the end of 2025, potentially worth $873 million. Despite this sale, Huang still holds over 800 million Nvidia shares and maintains a net worth of around $126 billion, securing his position as the 12th richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Nvidia's stock has seen tremendous growth, increasing by over 800% since December 2022, driven by high demand for its GPUs in the artificial intelligence sector. The company continues to expand, although it faces export control challenges that could impact its international markets.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are scheduled to marry in a three-day celebration in Venice, Italy, this week, an event estimated to cost between $64 million and $76 million. The wedding will reportedly source 80% of its provisions from Venetian vendors, including pastries and Murano glass. Approximately 200 guests, including celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, and Ivanka Trump, are expected to attend, with numerous private planes requesting landing permission at Venice's Marco Polo airport. However, the wedding has sparked protests from local groups like "No Space for Bezos," who criticize the city for prioritizing wealthy tourists over residents' needs, highlighting broader issues of over-tourism and rising housing costs in Venice. Despite the protests, Venetian officials have defended the event, stating that it will not significantly disrupt daily life in the city.</p>

Bryant's words, taken from a Facebook post following his own Achilles tear, served as inspiration for Haliburton's recovery journey.

          <p>Four members of a family from northern California were among eight people killed when a boat capsized on Lake Tahoe during a sudden thunderstorm. The victims include Josh Pickles, a DoorDash executive, along with his parents and uncle. The incident occurred near DL Bliss State Park as a storm brought high winds and waves exceeding 8 feet. The National Weather Service indicated that the intensity of the storm was unexpected, with temperatures significantly below normal, which may have contributed to the unstable air mass. Boating accidents with multiple fatalities are rare on Lake Tahoe, though there are an average of six deaths on the lake each summer.</p>

He affirmed his commitment to being a friend to NATO leaders and helping them, but stopped short of a direct endorsement of the mutual defense clause.

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to clarify its order allowing migrants to be deported to third countries, following a federal judge's ruling that eight migrants in Djibouti are protected from immediate removal.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer criticized Judge Murphy's ruling as a "lawless act of defiance" and argued that it hinders the Executive's efforts to effectuate third-country removals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beginner gold investors should strategically consider several decisions before July 2025, as the price of gold could potentially surge to new records. Investors should contemplate whether to wait for a price drop, carefully considering market monitoring and the risk of being priced out. Deciding how much to invest is crucial, with the common threshold being around 10% of the overall portfolio, though this depends on individual goals and portfolio volatility. Assessing portfolio needs, such as diversification or hedging against inflation, is essential to determine if a gold investment aligns with long-term financial objectives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fired Department of Justice lawyer alleges that Emil Bove, a Trump nominee for a federal appeals court judge, instructed DOJ attorneys to consider defying court orders that barred the Trump administration from deporting immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act. The whistleblower, Erez Reuveni, claims Bove emphasized that planes carrying immigrants needed to take off "no matter what." This accusation comes before Bove's Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, raising concerns about his respect for the rule of law. Reuveni also alleges that DOJ officials undermined the rule of law by ignoring court orders and misrepresenting facts before courts.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended a NATO summit in the Netherlands, following his announcement of a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. Despite the ceasefire, Trump noted that both countries had violated the agreement.

The summit addressed the conflict in the Middle East and Russia's war on Ukraine, with discussions on how to best support Ukraine and deter further Russian aggression.

Auffray's family will receive compensation, marking the first time a French court has recognized the link between a person's death and the state's negligence in green algae cases.

          <p>Brian Beals, exonerated of a murder he did not commit after serving over 30 years in prison, has found a new role in theater. Beals, wrongfully convicted in 1988, was officially cleared by the same court that convicted him. After his release, he now directs young men and women on stage in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood, fulfilling a dream he cultivated while incarcerated. The Illinois Innocence Project helped overturn his conviction, and Beals now runs the Mud Theatre Project, providing a creative outlet for under-resourced communities.</p>
