          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country, asserting that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The court also blocked levies on China, Mexico, and Canada, imposed in response to drug and illegal immigrant flow. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, while the attorney general of New York welcomed the decision, stating that no president has the power to single-handedly raise taxes. This ruling is a major blow to Trump's economic policies.</p>

          <p>More than 17,000 people in Manitoba, Canada, are being evacuated due to raging wildfires, prompting a province-wide state of emergency and a request for military assistance from Prime Minister Mark Carney. The evacuations include the town of Flin Flon, and residents from remote towns and Indigenous communities are being transported to Winnipeg. Wildfires in Alberta have also caused temporary shutdowns of oil and gas production. This is the largest evacuation in Manitoba's recent history, following a devastating wildfire season in 2023 and recent fatalities in Lac du Bonnet.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields," revising visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. This move has sparked anxiety across university campuses in the United States, likely leading to reprisal from China. The definition of "critical fields" remains unclear, potentially affecting around 275,000 Chinese students in the US. This action coincides with heightened tensions between the United States and China over trade and technology.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade has blocked reciprocal tariffs imposed by President Trump, stating that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize a president to levy universal duties on imports. The ruling is a blow to Trump's economic agenda, with Dow futures jumping 500 points on the news, though the administration has appealed the decision. The court also blocked tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking, noting they do not address the threats set forth in those orders. The White House maintains that foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the United States has fueled America's historic and persistent trade deficits.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, due to the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The proposal, initially floated by a previous foreign secretary, has gained momentum after Britain joined France and Canada in condemning Israel's military operations in Gaza. However, the recent deadly shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington has caused some British officials to question the timing of the sanctions. Britain is likely to wait to see if Israel allows increased aid to Gaza before making a decision, amid mounting pressure from the Labour Party and human rights lawyers.</p>

          <p>Despite legal guarantees and pressure from civil society, racial segregation in schools remains a reality for Roma children in Slovakia, where over 60% attend schools with a Roma majority. Roma pupils are often separated into "Roma schools" or "Roma classes" with lower academic expectations and higher dropout rates, or placed in schools for children with mental disabilities. While the Slovak government has introduced reforms, these measures often reinforce segregation rather than eliminate it. The EU's goal to reduce segregation by only 50% by 2030 undermines the illegality of segregation and fails to address the systemic failure.</p>

CBS argues that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties, maintaining that it takes in up to 40% of the fees TV stations pay to carry the shows.

          <p>Los Angeles faces significant challenges in delivering on its promises for the 2028 Olympics, including recovering from recent fires, a projected budget deficit, and potential worker shortages. The city is also concerned about federal funding and the impact of immigration policies on ticket sales. While officials remain confident, they acknowledge the need to overcome these obstacles to ensure a successful Games. The mayor pointed to the 1984 Olympics as an example of the city's triumph over a severe recession, while acknowledging potential issues with federal support and immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Chinese airlines face a slowdown in growth due to trade-related tariffs and global supply chain constraints, according to analysts. Despite recent tariff cuts, remaining duties on imports from the US could force Chinese buyers of Boeing jets to pay millions more, leading to potential delivery delays and order cancellations. China's civil aviation passenger capacity is projected to grow by an average of 3.1% annually until 2028, significantly lower than the 15.4% average annual growth seen in the decade leading up to 2019. Some Chinese airlines have already refused to accept deliveries of Boeing planes.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. will "aggressively" revoke visas from Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or those studying in "critical fields," and enhance scrutiny for future applicants. This move could affect many of the approximately 280,000 Chinese students in the U.S., potentially straining the bilateral relationship. This action is another blow to the American higher education system, which has already faced funding cuts.

This memo has been submitted to a federal judge in Texas amid lawsuits over Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected gang members.

The White House confirmed Musk's "off-boarding" as a special government employee was in process. Musk's departure comes after he criticized Trump's spending plan, expressing frustration with the response to DOGE's efforts to restructure and shrink the federal government.</p>

          <p>The Latino community with permanent residency in the United States is increasingly seeking naturalization as a response to intensified immigration enforcement and deportations. The USCIS reported over 7.9 million naturalizations in the last decade, with numbers rising further under the Trump administration. Community organizations and legal offices report a surge in interest as immigrants seek protection against deportation and aim to promote civic participation in upcoming elections. Academics note this trend is not only for protection but also an opportunity to advance electoral participation, similar to the increase in Latino voting after Proposition 187 in California.</p>
