            <p>Economists are raising concerns about the potential for stagflation, characterized by rising inflation, slow economic growth, and high unemployment. Factors like tariff policies contribute to this risk, potentially impacting consumer confidence and corporate investment. While a severe recession like the 1970s is not expected, a shallow recession with inflation is predicted. Consumers are advised to prioritize paying down high-interest debt and building emergency funds to prepare for potential economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>
