          <h2>Global Military Spending Reaches Record High in 2024</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 19:14:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent SIPRI report reveals that global military expenditure reached a new high in 2024, exceeding $2.7 trillion, a 9.4% increase from 2023. This surge is the most rapid in a single year since the end of the Cold War, with over 100 countries increasing their military budgets. Germany now ranks fourth globally in military spending, driven by a €100 billion special fund for the Bundeswehr. The rise in defense spending across Europe is largely attributed to the war in Ukraine, with the US remaining the top military spender, focusing on modernizing its capabilities and nuclear arsenal.</p>

          <h2>Danish Slave Ships Wreckage Discovered Off Costa Rica</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shipwrecks discovered off the coast of Costa Rica, previously mistaken for pirate ships, have been identified as two Danish slave ships, Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, lost in 1710. Marine archaeologists from Denmark's National Museum confirmed the wrecks through analysis of ship timbers and cargo remains. The Fridericus Quartus was burned, while the Christianus Quintus was wrecked after its anchor line was cut, according to historical records. This discovery sheds light on Denmark's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, which the country banned in 1792 but did not abolish slavery until 1847.</p>

          <p>A report by a health think tank indicates that urgent and emergency care in England has significantly deteriorated compared to pre-pandemic levels. A&E waiting times have reached record highs, with over 60,000 people waiting 12 hours or more for admission in January. Delays in discharging patients who are fit to leave the hospital exacerbate bottlenecks in A&E and ambulance services. The report suggests the NHS should prepare for winters like this one and address underlying issues instead of blaming external factors like winter bugs.</p>

Missed opportunities and defensive lapses contributed to the loss, leaving the Lakers to fight off elimination in Game 5. The team's heavy reliance on their starters for extended minutes may have also played a role in their fatigue during crucial moments.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has halted funding for numerous federal grant programs, impacting services for victims of hate crimes, child abuse, and other forms of violence. The decision has disrupted programs aimed at reducing school shootings, combating domestic terror, and addressing cold cases. While some funding has been restored for certain organizations, many others face cancellations, leading to layoffs and service reductions. The Justice Department maintains that the cuts align with the administration's priorities and protect essential services for victims.</p>

          <p>Scott Kennedy, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, discusses the US-China trade war, stating that it is far from over. The Trump administration views the international trading system as unfair to the US and is using tariffs to force change. Kennedy suggests that the administration aims to negotiate reciprocal tariffs on a line-by-line basis. This approach reflects a shift from multilateral agreements to bilateral negotiations in an effort to address perceived imbalances in trade.</p>

          <p>Border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of a two-year-old US citizen to Honduras, arguing that "due process" was applied because the child's mother, who was also deported, had due process. Homan stated that the mother chose to take the child with her, absolving the government of responsibility. He disputed reports of other US citizen children being deported, claiming that the mothers chose to take their children with them. These actions have drawn criticism and raised questions about the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Germany's defence minister, Boris Pistorius, cautioned Ukraine against agreeing to sweeping territorial concessions in exchange for a ceasefire with Russia. Pistorius criticized a proposed deal by the American president, suggesting it would amount to a "capitulation". He indicated that while Kyiv may need to cede some territory, it should not accept the terms of the US proposal, which reportedly includes American acceptance of Russia's annexation of Crimea. Other reports suggest a counter-proposal from Europe and Ukraine exists, which proposes discussing the fate of occupied territories only after a ceasefire is in effect.</p>
