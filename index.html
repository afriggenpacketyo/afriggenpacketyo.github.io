          <p>This article recounts the case of Dana Chandler, who was convicted of the 2002 murders of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, and his girlfriend, Karen Harkness, after three trials. The article details the investigation, the initial trial which resulted in a guilty verdict that was later overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct, and the subsequent retrials. Chandler, who maintained her innocence throughout, represented herself in the third trial, but was again found guilty. The article includes interviews with family members, investigators, and legal experts, offering a comprehensive look at the evidence and legal proceedings surrounding the case. The focus is on the impact of the murders on the victims' families and the complexities of the legal battle to bring Chandler to justice.

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called on fellow Democrats to adopt a more forceful approach in opposing Donald Trump, whom he characterized as a bully and an existential threat. Speaking at a Democratic Party state convention in South Carolina, Walz encouraged Democrats to "bully the s--t out of him back." He criticized Trump's policies and leadership style, emphasizing the need for Democrats to stand firm against what he sees as cruelty and greed. Walz's remarks reflect a growing sentiment among some Democrats that a more aggressive stance is necessary to counter Trump's influence and policies.

          <p>A recent study indicates that parents in Europe generally find their lives more meaningful compared to those without children, but they also experience lower levels of life satisfaction. The study, based on data from the European Social Survey, highlights that this disparity is particularly pronounced for mothers. However, the degree of dissatisfaction varies significantly across countries, with Scandinavian nations showing smaller differences between parents and child-free individuals due to supportive family policies. Factors such as childcare availability, financial support, and gender equality play a crucial role in shaping parental satisfaction levels across different European contexts.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant increase in obesity rates, ranking first in Europe, with experts attributing the trend to factors like poverty, malnutrition, and the consumption of processed foods.

          <p>Poland's upcoming presidential runoff election presents a stark choice between a pro-European liberal, Rafal Trzaskowski, and a staunch nationalist, Karol Nawrocki. Trzaskowski, supported by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's party, advocates for LGBTQ rights and softening abortion laws. Nawrocki, endorsed by outgoing President Andrzej Duda, champions traditional Polish values and is skeptical of the EU. The outcome will significantly influence Poland's political direction, potentially enabling Tusk's reform agenda or bolstering the opposition Law and Justice party.

Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized that this investment signals Britain's readiness to fight if necessary and strengthens its industrial base.
