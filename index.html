          <p>The U.S. House has approved a presidential plan to rescind $9 billion in government funding, a measure that now awaits a signature. This package eliminates all federal support for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, a move critics warn will devastate local stations, particularly those serving rural and tribal communities. The legislation also cuts approximately $7 billion in foreign aid. The vote followed intense partisan debate, with public media advocates calling the decision a dismantling of vital civic and educational institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives has passed a $9 billion package to claw back foreign aid and public broadcasting funds, sending it to the president's desk just before a critical deadline. The vote was delayed for hours due to heated debates surrounding Democratic demands for the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Republicans ultimately advanced the spending cuts, which target about $8 billion in foreign assistance and $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The controversy over the Epstein files has divided the president's base and created a significant political challenge for the administration.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Trump has linked the tariffs to the ongoing legal case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, demanding charges be dropped. Lula described the threat as "unacceptable blackmail" and a grave attack on Brazil's national sovereignty and judicial independence. He also criticized Brazilian politicians who support Trump as "traitors to the homeland." The diplomatic feud escalates as Trump publicly expresses support for Bolsonaro, whom he views as a victim of an unjust political system.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has become an inventor, constructing his own seven-meter-long submarine from scratch. The man, identified only as Zhang, said he had been fascinated by machines since childhood and was inspired after seeing a submarine on a state television program in 2014. Using 5,000 yuan (about $700), he secretly purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine to begin his project. His creation has since been spotted slicing through a local river, drawing stares and admiration from fellow villagers for his ingenuity and determination to build a vessel that could travel underwater.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' will conclude its run in May 2025, a decision that host Stephen Colbert revealed to a surprised live audience. The network stated the move is a financial one and unrelated to the show's content or other matters at its parent company, Paramount Global. However, the announcement has drawn skepticism from fans and political figures, who question the timing given Colbert's frequent criticism of Donald Trump and a recent $16 million settlement Paramount paid to the president.

Researchers highlighted a need to reverse the trend of increased government intervention and resource allocation. The calls for reform aim to address economic imbalances and intense, unhealthy competition within various industries in the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old Canadian man has been charged with hijacking constituting terrorism after a security incident at Vancouver's airport.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated the suspect acted with an "ideological motive to disrupt airspace."

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a moderation in rice prices after the government released stockpiles, although inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Despite the cooling, economists note that persistent inflationary pressures and the risk of a weaker yen could still pose challenges.

          <p>The surprise cancellation of 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' is being questioned by critics who are skeptical of CBS's stated financial reasons. This article suggests the decision may be part of a larger pattern of the network's parent company, Paramount Global, capitulating to President Donald Trump, a frequent target of Colbert's satire. The move follows several other controversial decisions, including a major settlement paid to Trump over a '60 Minutes' interview and the departure of the show's chief. These events have led to concerns that the network is sacrificing its journalistic and editorial independence to secure federal approval for a pending merger.</p>

This article explains that the Federal Reserve operates independently to manage monetary policy, with a dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. Trump, who appointed Powell but now calls him a "stubborn mule," has pushed for immediate rate cuts to boost economic growth, a move that could also risk higher inflation. The conflict highlights the tension between a president's political goals and the Fed's long-term economic strategy, raising questions about the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol conducted raids at a Home Depot and other sites in Sacramento, an operation that appeared designed to challenge California's sanctuary policies. Following the enforcement action, a Border Patrol chief released a video in front of the state capitol, declaring there is "no such thing as a sanctuary state." The operation, which resulted in 11 arrests, drew immediate condemnation from Governor Gavin Newsom's office, which accused the agency of illegal racial profiling. The raids occurred shortly after a federal judge blocked agents from using such tactics, escalating tensions between state and federal authorities over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has authorized Juul to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the U.S. market. The decision reverses a 2022 order to ban the products, with the FDA now stating that Juul's studies show its devices are less harmful for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. The move is a significant milestone for the company, which was widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping crisis. Anti-tobacco advocates have condemned the decision, arguing that the product responsible for the public health crisis should not be authorized for sale.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna has stated his department has "no choice" but to comply with federal judicial warrants seeking the transfer of inmates to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Luna clarified that these are criminal warrants signed by a judge, which legally supersede state and local sanctuary policies. He distinguished these from civil ICE detainers, stating the department rejected 995 such requests in 2024. The sheriff reassured the community that his department does not assist in ICE street operations, seeking to allay fears amid heightened immigration enforcement in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola will switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar is being analyzed as a strategic political maneuver. The move, which has not yet been officially confirmed by the company, allows Trump to score points with his base and the "Make America healthy again" movement during a period of internal party turmoil. However, this article argues that the health benefits are negligible, as both sweeteners are metabolically similar. The change is seen as a symbolic gesture that generates positive headlines without addressing the larger public health concerns associated with high sugar consumption in sodas.</p>

          <p>A university in northeastern China has expelled a female student for "improper interactions with a foreigner that damage national dignity," sparking a heated debate on Chinese social media. The university's public announcement accused the student of "misbehaviors" that caused a "terrible negative impact" but did not provide specific details. Internet users have linked the case to videos posted by a professional Ukrainian gamer showing intimacy with an Asian woman. The expulsion has drawn widespread criticism, with many questioning the university's right to police a student's private life and others calling the decision a sign of misogyny and hyper-nationalism.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the rules on liquid sizes could be the next major policy change for air travelers. This follows her recent announcement that passengers no longer need to remove their shoes during standard security checks. Noem did not provide specific details on what the new liquid rules might be or a timeline for their implementation, but suggested a more streamlined screening process is the ultimate goal.</p>

The event, which sets aside political divisions, is a fundraiser for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults diagnosed with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the game has raised nearly $5 million to date.

          <p>A wave of relentless immigration raids under the Trump administration is profoundly altering life in Southern California, home to a large undocumented population. The crackdowns have forced many into hiding, disrupting businesses, schools, and community life, while sparking violent clashes and protests that have been met with National Guard and Marine deployments. One recent raid on cannabis farms resulted in the death of a worker and hundreds of arrests. While the administration highlights the capture of individuals with criminal records, including for sexual assault, critics argue the operations terrorize communities and indiscriminately target immigrants, creating a climate of pervasive fear.</p>

          <p>An ice core believed to be over 1.5 million years old, the planet's oldest, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey for analysis. Scientists will melt the ancient ice, drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, to study the trapped materials inside, including dust, volcanic ash, and ancient air bubbles. This research is expected to provide vital new information about Earth's climate history during a previously unknown period. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how our planet will respond to current levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
