          <h2>Hamas Signals Positive Stance on Latest Gaza Ceasefire Proposal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 14:21:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the most recent U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal aimed at ending the conflict with Israel. The group stated its readiness to enter negotiations to implement the framework, a development President Trump described as optimistic. An Israeli delegation is expected to travel to Qatar for further talks, although Israel has not yet formally committed to the terms. The proposal follows a nearly 21-month war that began with Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, and has resulted in over 57,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two American aid workers were injured in a grenade attack at a food distribution site in Khan Younis, an incident their organization attributed to Hamas. Concurrently, Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed 14 people across the Gaza Strip, including a doctor and his three children. Further reports from Gaza hospital officials indicated that at least 10 Palestinians were killed while trying to access humanitarian aid. This ongoing violence occurs as ceasefire negotiations show signs of progress, with Hamas responding positively to a new proposal but insisting on guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has formed approximately 150 miles off the coast of South Carolina, leading to tropical storm warnings for coastal areas of both North and South Carolina. The storm currently has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and is moving slowly, with forecasters expecting it to turn northeast and make landfall on Sunday. The National Weather Service anticipates some additional strengthening before it reaches the coast. Residents are being warned of potential heavy rainfall, which could total two to four inches with isolated amounts up to six inches, leading to risks of flash flooding through Monday.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in what officials are calling a "mass casualty event," with at least 27 fatalities, including nine children. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching residents and officials by surprise. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with a significant focus on finding 23 to 25 people still missing from Camp Mystic, a children's summer camp. Officials have conducted over 160 air rescues, and Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration to provide state resources for the affected counties.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri on his final qualifying lap. The session was intensely competitive, with McLaren's Lando Norris finishing third and Mercedes' George Russell fourth, all separated by fractions of a second. Lewis Hamilton placed fifth for Mercedes, expressing that a slight mistake in the final corner cost him a potential front-row start. The results set the stage for a highly anticipated race, with Verstappen noting the car's low-downforce setup made navigating Silverstone's high-speed corners particularly challenging but ultimately successful.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has defended his use of the word "shylock" during a rally, stating he was unaware of its antisemitic connotations and believed it simply meant a moneylender charging high rates. The term, originating from a villainous Jewish character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," is widely considered an offensive slur. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "troubling and irresponsible," while public figures like Rep. Jerry Nadler condemned it as dangerous. This incident occurs even as the Trump administration has emphasized its commitment to combating antisemitism, particularly on college campuses and through immigration policy.</p>

While some showed sympathy for the government's challenges, many were concerned by recent policy U-turns, viewing them as a sign of weakness and a lack of clear direction.

          <p>The increasing prevalence of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options has led to a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation," creating confusion and social pressure for consumers. Marketing professors note that while these systems can increase tip amounts, they often do so by making it socially awkward to opt out or choose a custom amount. This shift was accelerated by the pandemic's move toward contactless payments, with many businesses adopting systems where tip requests are a default setting. Experts suggest that customers feel pressured to tip in situations where they previously wouldn't, leading to irritation and what is sometimes called "guilt tipping."</p>

This development is likely to terminate any remaining possibility of denuclearization, pushing North Korea to further invest in mobile, dispersed, and resilient second-strike capabilities.

          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming the alcohol-free drink can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The beverage typically combines coconut water, orange juice, lemon, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients can reduce cortisol levels. Endocrinologists note that cortisol is a necessary hormone and that doctors rarely aim to lower it outside of specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, it is not a proven stress-reduction tool.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the MingKwai, a revolutionary Chinese typewriter invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s, has been discovered after being lost for decades. The machine is a crucial artifact in the history of modern Chinese computing, as its design principles prefigured key concepts used in digital input methods today. Instead of phonetics, the typewriter organizes thousands of Chinese characters by their component shapes, allowing a typist to find them via a "magic eye" screen. Now housed at Stanford University, the discovery highlights an early, globalist vision for integrating complex non-alphabetic languages into modern technology.</p>

The milestone follows a $1.5 billion cleanup project tied to the Olympics, which has successfully brought the river's water quality up to European standards on most days. On Saturday, Mayor Anne Hidalgo joined eager residents in taking a plunge in designated swimming areas near the Eiffel Tower. The event marks the fulfillment of a long-held dream for the city and offers a new way for people to cool off amid rising summer temperatures.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab are working to change the public's negative perception of sharks while studying their crucial role in marine ecosystems. The research team, led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, studies hundreds of sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay. By temporarily capturing sharks and examining their stomach contents, scientists can assess the animals' health, which serves as a key indicator of the overall health of the ocean. Despite the importance of this research, scientists say it has been challenging to secure financial support due to the persistent fear and misunderstanding surrounding these creatures.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has suggested that a new political party, which he has considered funding, could gain significant influence by focusing on a small number of key congressional races. He proposed targeting just two or three Senate seats and eight to ten House districts, which could be enough to act as a deciding vote in the narrowly divided Congress. This idea comes amid a public feud between Musk and President Trump over a major spending bill. In a poll on his social media platform X, Musk asked followers if he should create an "America Party" to challenge the two-party system, with a majority responding affirmatively.

The project, championed by leader Kim Jong Un, is part of an effort to boost the nation's sanctioned economy through tourism. However, despite its grand opening, the country's borders remain largely closed to foreign visitors, a policy that began with the COVID-19 pandemic. While a small number of Russian tourists may be allowed to visit soon due to strengthening ties between the two nations, it remains unclear when the resort will be accessible to a wider international audience.</p>

          <p>A doctor working in a public hospital argues that new congressional work requirements for Medicaid will create insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles for the most vulnerable patients. The physician recounts stories of patients who, due to homelessness, disability, or lack of resources, would struggle to provide the necessary documentation, even if they qualify for exemptions. Critics project that millions of Americans will lose insurance, not because they are ineligible, but because the system is engineered to be onerous. The author contends that this "time tax" will effectively disenfranchise people from care they are entitled to, with devastating consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" to better handle anger and stress. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule acknowledges that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a surge of cortisol, lasts about 90 seconds. After that, any continued feeling of anger is a choice sustained by replaying the negative thought. Gawdat advises allowing yourself that initial 90 seconds to feel the emotion, and then consciously choosing to shift your focus. This practice, he argues, empowers individuals to recover more quickly from life's upsets and regain control over their emotional state.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs's federal sex-trafficking trial demonstrates the legal system's inability to effectively handle complex cases of intimate partner violence and coercive control. While Combs was convicted on lesser charges, he was acquitted of the most serious ones, which the author suggests is because trafficking laws were used as an imperfect tool to prosecute abuse. The piece contends that existing domestic violence statutes are often inadequate for addressing the dynamics of power and control in abusive relationships, leading to outcomes that do not feel like true justice for survivors.</p>
