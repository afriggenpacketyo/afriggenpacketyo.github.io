          <p>Following a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs, the administration is exploring alternative legal avenues to enact similar measures. Goldman Sachs economists suggest the White House could utilize Section 122 of U.S. trade law, launch Section 301 investigations, or broaden Section 232 tariffs to other sectors. Michelle Schulz from Schulz Trade Law PLLC noted that previous tariffs required investigations, unlike those issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The article also mentions the possibility of the Supreme Court ultimately deciding on the matter, indicating the complexity and potential longevity of the trade dispute.</p>

CEO Tarang Amin, Rhode achieved $212 million in net sales within three years with only ten products, a disruption that caught E.l.f.'s attention. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of E.l.f.'s fiscal 2026, with plans to roll Rhode out into retail, including Sephora, to further support growth.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is under scrutiny from the Department of Homeland Security due to alleged "national security concerns" related to international students and accusations of allowing antisemitism on campus. The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a formal notice to Harvard, giving them 30 days to respond to the compliance issues identified during a records review. Sources suggest this letter is an attempt to provide a legal justification for the Trump administration's actions revoking the school's ability to enroll international students. This situation has emerged ahead of a federal hearing regarding Harvard's ability to enroll international students, raising questions about the university's future in global education. The tone of the article reflects the author's concern over the implications for international students and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>Lincoln Center has announced a $335 million renovation plan for Damrosch Park, aiming to upgrade the aging site and better integrate it with the surrounding neighborhood. The project, largely funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, includes repairing the leaky garage roof and constructing a new amphitheater to eliminate the costs of setting up a temporary stage each summer. The most significant aspect of the plan involves opening the park to the West Side community, addressing historical divisions created during urban renewal. The redesigned park will feature tiered gardens, a lawn, and a pool, reflecting community input and aiming to create a welcoming public space.</p>

          <p>China will send a delegation from the National Defence University to the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, instead of Defence Minister Dong Jun, foregoing an opportunity to meet with U.S. and Asian defense chiefs. The forum has historically provided a platform for China to counter Washington's narrative in the region and engage directly with other defense leaders. Observers suggest the decision may be influenced by ongoing U.S.-China tariff war talks, internal reshuffles, and a perceived Western-centric bias in the security dialogue. This move contrasts with the presence of defense chiefs and senior officials from numerous other countries, including the U.S., India, and several ASEAN members.</p>

With a significant percentage of STEM graduate students and the STEM workforce being foreign-born, restricting international students could severely impact American science and innovation.

          <p>Elon Musk is leaving his role as a "special government employee" in the Trump administration after serving for 130 days. Musk thanked President Trump on X, stating that his Department of Government Efficiency team will continue its work. As a special government employee, Musk's appointment was limited to 130 days, and the White House has begun the off-boarding process. During his time in the administration, Musk visited the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, discussing technological tools and public-private partnerships.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is stepping back from his White House role, leaving behind a mixed legacy marked by ambitious goals and limited achievements. Musk's "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE) aimed to cut $1 trillion in spending but fell far short of that target. His attempt to run the federal government like a Silicon Valley startup faced resistance from the Cabinet, leading to a reduction in his power. While some of DOGE's actions, such as dismantling USAID, will have lasting consequences, Musk's vision of a wholesale remaking of the federal government did not materialize.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have determined the purpose of a 1,500-year-old Byzantine Bromeswell bucket discovered at Sutton Hoo, England, revealing it was used to hold the cremated remains of an important person and their grave goods. Analysis of the bucket, which dates back to the 6th century, uncovered cremated human and animal bones, including parts of an ankle bone and skull fragments. The bucket, decorated with a hunting scene, is believed to have originated from Antioch in the Byzantine Empire. Researchers also found an unburned double-sided comb made from an antler, suggesting the Anglo-Saxons valued grooming.</p>

The plaintiffs, aged seven to 25, hail from states heavily impacted by climate change, such as Montana, Hawaii, and California.

          <p>A recent U.S. court ruling against President Trump's tariffs has limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US, as the ruling does not include tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are key UK exports. Although the UK has secured a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, this deal has not yet come into force. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods, such as salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>In an economy challenged by persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns exceeding the inflation rate. These accounts allow investors to lock in high rates for the CD's term and are generally insured by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000. While national average CD yields vary by term, online banks often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. Short-term CDs, particularly those with terms of six months to one year, currently offer higher interest rates than longer-term options due to the inverted yield curve.</p>

Strengthening your credit profile and shopping around for different lenders are crucial steps to securing a good rate.
