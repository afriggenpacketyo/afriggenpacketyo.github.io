          <p>E-cigarettes, initially designed to help smokers quit by delivering nicotine without harmful chemicals, have introduced a new set of health concerns, especially among young people who never smoked. While e-cigarettes have contributed to a decline in lung cancer rates, a significant number of teens are now vaping, ingesting nicotine in potentially damaging quantities, leading to addiction and possible long-term health risks. The debate continues among experts on whether vaping is a net improvement overall, with some advocating for stricter regulations and others emphasizing harm reduction strategies to convince smokers to switch to e-cigarettes while minimizing new users. Given the uncertainty and varying regulations, vaping presents a genuine public health conundrum, and further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects. The article examines the benefits and drawbacks of e-cigarettes, concluding that smokers may benefit from switching to e-cigarettes, but non-smokers should avoid vaping.</p>

          <p>Complaints regarding substandard living conditions in social housing in England have increased fivefold in the last five years, according to a recent report by the Housing Ombudsman. The report highlights issues such as asbestos, electrical and fire safety concerns, pest control problems, and leaks, damp, and mold, which are contributing to a breakdown in trust between tenants and landlords. The Housing Ombudsman is advocating for a transformative overhaul of the system, including an independent review of funding practices and the establishment of a national tenant body to strengthen tenant voice and landlord accountability. The article emphasizes the human cost of poor living conditions and warns of potential social unrest if changes are not implemented to address the historic underfunding and communication issues within social housing.</p>

The company's strong performance has been viewed by investors as a positive sign for the broader semiconductor industry and artificial intelligence-related stocks, leading to gains for companies like Tokyo Electron, SK Hynix, ASM International, and ASML. The article notes that the semiconductor industry has been navigating challenges related to tariff policy and export restrictions, but Nvidia's results have allayed fears about demand for its graphics processing units.

          <p>Democratic senators are calling for an investigation into potential ethics violations by employees of Elon Musk's "Doge" team, alleging that these employees hold significant stock in companies that stand to benefit directly from their efforts to cut wasteful spending and regulations within federal agencies. The senators claim that this poses a clear conflict of interest, as federal employees are prohibited from participating in matters in which they have a personal financial interest. Specific cases cited include a Treasury team leader holding stock in major financial institutions and tech giants, and a CFPB aide participating in mass layoffs while holding stock in companies subject to CFPB examination. The article suggests a widespread disregard for ethics rules within Doge, potentially undermining the integrity of government decision-making.</p>

          <p>Scientists are expressing concerns that potential budget cuts to NASA under the Trump administration could halt crucial space and Earth science missions, impeding the progress on solving some of the universe's greatest mysteries. The proposed cuts, which amount to a 24% reduction in NASA's overall budget, would particularly impact missions to Mars and Venus, as well as the development of the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope. Advocates argue that these cuts would not only abandon ongoing projects but also stifle future discoveries related to the habitability of other planets and the origins of the cosmos. The article suggests that prioritizing crewed spaceflight at the expense of un-crewed science could lead to a loss of US leadership in space exploration and a "brain drain" of top talent from NASA.</p>

          <p>A proposed House Republican budget bill seeks to increase the 'pass-through' business tax break, which allows certain businesses to report profits or losses on individual tax returns. This deduction applies to partnerships, S-corporations, and sole proprietors, but it has been controversial due to most of the benefits flowing to high-income taxpayers. The House bill would change the phaseout calculation, potentially providing a larger tax break for certain white-collar professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, and financial advisors, who are currently limited in claiming the QBI deduction once income exceeds certain limits. The article discusses the potential impact of the proposed changes and the ongoing debate surrounding the fairness and effectiveness of the QBI deduction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples, as part of a series of clemency actions. Hoover, who was serving multiple life sentences on conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges, still faces a 200-year jail term in Illinois for murder, making his release unlikely. The article details Hoover's history, including his leadership of the Gangster Disciples and his advocacy for criminal justice reform. The commutation of Hoover's sentence is part of a broader pattern of clemency actions by Trump, including pardons for individuals charged or convicted in connection with the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump should not abandon cease-fire talks with Ukraine, despite his frustrations with President Vladimir Putin and the ongoing human carnage of the war. While acknowledging Trump's valid points about the need for economic development and the unlikelihood of a military breakthrough, the board warns that an American withdrawal would only embolden Putin and encourage further aggression. Instead, the board suggests that Trump should increase pressure on both Russia and Ukraine to reach a deal, leveraging his position to promote a truce and end the gruesome war.

          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Ibram X. Kendi argues that the Trump administration's attacks on Black history are a betrayal of America and a threat to the nation's future. Kendi contends that the administration's efforts to purge Black historical content, remove Black history books, and defund historical institutions are reminiscent of past attempts to erase Black contributions and experiences. He draws parallels to the Atlanta Race Massacre of 1906 and the suppression of Black voices, highlighting the importance of preserving and accurately portraying Black history to understand racial inequity and injustice. The article serves as a call to action to resist the erasure of Black history and to recognize the enduring impact of anti-Black racism.</p>

Despite Budapest's outward appearance of a thriving democracy, OrbÃ¡n has remade the courts, financially starved independent press, and stifled civil society. This has made Hungary a pariah in the EU, yet the leader of this small central European country has captured the imagination of many U.S. conservatives who hold OrbÃ¡n's rule up as a model for conservative populist leadership in liberal Western democracies.
