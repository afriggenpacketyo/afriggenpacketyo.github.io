          <h2>Trump's Meeting with Zelensky Sparked Hope Among Ukrainians</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 13:48:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Zelensky has offered a glimmer of hope to Ukrainians, who were previously concerned about the U.S. pushing for a peace plan favorable to Russia. Trump questioned why Putin would continue attacking Ukraine while the U.S. is trying to broker peace. This statement has led Ukrainians to believe that Trump may not force Ukraine into a lopsided peace deal, especially after a recent Russian missile attack on Kyiv. This shift in tone has been seen as a victory for Zelensky and Ukraine, who have been resisting a U.S.-backed proposal that would require them to abandon NATO aspirations and recognize Crimea as Russian. </p>

          <p>Senator Jeanne Shaheen has publicly criticized Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, alleging that he has created chaos at the Pentagon through staffing shakeups and inappropriate handling of classified information. Shaheen pointed to Hegseth's use of the encrypted messaging app Signal to share details about U.S. airstrikes in Yemen with unauthorized individuals, including family members and a personal attorney. She also noted the recent resignations and firings of political appointees, leaving Hegseth without key staff. Shaheen argued that Hegseth's actions demonstrate his lack of qualification for the role and accused him of failing to take responsibility for his actions, further stating he is not the leader the military needs.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that President Trump's first 100 days in office have been marked by significant changes and persistent concerns over his economic policies. While he maintains support from his base, a growing number of Americans believe the administration is too focused on tariffs, leading to disapproval of his handling of the economy and inflation. The poll also reveals diverging opinions among different groups, with MAGA Republicans expressing a more positive outlook on the economy compared to independents and Democrats. Overall, the poll suggests that Trump's focus on tariffs is negatively impacting his approval ratings and raising concerns about the economy's future.</p>

However, Zelenskyy's positive comments about the meeting and Trump's more critical tone towards Putin have led Sullivan to believe that Trump may be reassessing his approach to the war in Ukraine.

          <p>The Kentucky Derby is back to normal. Saturday’s race could signal a resurgence of Southern California’s status as the training ground of Derby champions, the last coming in the screwed-up COVID-plagued year of 2020 when Authentic won the race in September. This year’s favorite is based at Santa Anita. The field is considered very competitive, although maybe not very strong at the top. And what about the horses coming from Japan and the Middle East? All these questions and more will be answered by 4:05 p.m. PDT on Saturday.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion at Iran's largest commercial port, Shahid Rajaee, has resulted in at least 40 deaths and over 1,000 injuries, leading to mourning and growing anger within the country. Fires continue to burn, and a cloud of toxic chemicals hangs over the area, prompting health advisories for nearby residents. Speculation surrounds the cause, with some suggesting it involved improperly handled rocket fuel imported from China, a claim denied by the army. Authorities are investigating, with concerns raised about the handling of flammable materials at the port and the potential economic impact.</p>

          <p>The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said “there is a path” to an agreement with China over tariffs after he had interactions with his Chinese counterparts last week in Washington. On Friday, Donald Trump asserted in an interview that tariff negotiations were under way with China, comments he repeated on his way to Rome to attend the funeral of Pope Francis, but were later denied by China’s foreign ministry, which said the US “should stop creating confusion”. But Bessent warned that “a trade deal can take months” and said negotiations with other significant US trading partners were progressing. (not investment advice)</p>
