        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, signaling persistent deflationary pressures as stimulus measures struggle to boost domestic consumption. The consumer price index decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, slightly better than estimates, while producer prices dropped by 3.3%, the steepest decline since July 2023. A price war in the automotive industry and falling property prices have contributed to the downward pressure on consumer prices, exacerbating concerns about weak domestic demand. Policymakers are being urged to implement more forceful and targeted stimulus measures to bolster consumption, as exports alone cannot combat deflation. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Almost 350,000 nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are voting on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, which the Royal College of Nursing has already criticized as inadequate. This vote follows a bitter pay dispute that led to nurses striking from late 2022 through the winter, and could result in another round of industrial action if rejected. The RCN argues that nursing has been undervalued, leading to pay erosion and increased numbers of nurses leaving the profession. The vote is considered the largest single vote by the profession in the UK, and its outcome could significantly impact the government's upcoming 10-year plan for the NHS in England.</p>

Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible damage to the oceans. The proposal would extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas and is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. The move follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the detrimental effects of bottom trawling on the seabed and marine life, aligning with international efforts to protect ocean biodiversity.</p>

          <p>Top officials from the U.S. and China are meeting in London to seek further progress in easing trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. The discussions aim to build on the preliminary agreement struck in Geneva, which reduced tariffs to allow for continued negotiations. Recent communications between President Trump and President Xi Jinping have set the stage for these talks, with hopes of resuming shipments of rare earth minerals and magnets to the U.S. Data indicates that the trade war has negatively impacted economic growth, with China's exports to the U.S. experiencing a significant decline.</p>

          <p>China is at the forefront of Egypt's New Administrative Capital project, a city designed to house over 6 million people and alleviate congestion in Cairo. The China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) serves as the primary contractor for the central business district, overseeing its operation and maintenance. This project, estimated at US$3.8 billion, includes a presidential palace, government buildings, and foreign embassies, with CSCEC responsible for property management and urban services. The partnership underscores China's growing influence in Egypt's infrastructure development, positioning Cairo as a key hub for the Belt and Road Initiative in Africa and the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The National Opera of Ukraine in Kyiv will stage Sir Frederick Ashton's "La Fille mal gardÃ©e," a celebrated English ballet, after boycotting classic Russian repertoire. This decision follows the Ukrainian government's request for cultural institutions to avoid productions by Russian composers and choreographers due to the ongoing conflict. Fundraising efforts in London, led by Ivan Putrov and Antony Gormley, made the production possible, with Jean-Pierre Gasquet waiving his fee. The performance aims to uplift spirits and showcase Ukraine's commitment to preserving its cultural identity amidst the war.</p>
