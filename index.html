          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The attack, described by officials as a targeted political assassination, occurred during an outdoor debate event hosted by Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA. Investigators used security footage, witness accounts, and forensic evidence, including DNA from a towel wrapped around the recovered rifle, to identify and locate the suspect. Robinson's father reportedly recognized his son from police photos and urged him to surrender, leading to his capture.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's NATO Letter on Russian Energy Unlikely to Alter European Policy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly urged NATO allies to cease all purchases of Russian oil and gas, vowing to impose sanctions on Russia only after they comply. However, policy experts believe this demand is unlikely to change Europe's course, as it sets an unrealistically high bar for U.S. action. The letter places pressure on EU members like Hungary and Slovakia, who remain reliant on Russian energy and are politically aligned with Trump, but analysts suggest it's a rhetorical move to shift blame for inaction onto European allies. The EU continues to pursue its own sanctions strategies, such as targeting Russia's 'shadow fleet' of oil tankers.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a number of individuals have been fired or disciplined by their employers for public comments about the event. Companies including MSNBC, United Airlines, and Nasdaq, along with Middle Tennessee State University, have taken action against employees whose remarks were deemed inappropriate or harmful to the organizations' reputations. Legal experts note that private employers generally have the right to terminate at-will employees for public speech that violates company policy or causes disruption. The incidents have ignited a debate over free speech, professional conduct, and the consequences of expressing political views in a polarized environment.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that a framework deal has been reached between private parties regarding the U.S. operations of TikTok, with commercial terms agreed upon. The deal, aimed at addressing national security concerns, will be finalized in a meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This development comes after months of negotiations and a looming deadline for parent company ByteDance to divest its U.S. business or face a shutdown. The agreement could lead to a U.S.-controlled ownership structure for the popular social media platform, averting a potential ban in the country.</p>

          <p>Actor Rainn Wilson, known for his role in "The Office," posted a video statement addressing the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, urging for unity despite political disagreements. Wilson described Kirk as a "courageous man" who was unafraid to speak his truth, and condemned the idea of political violence as "disgusting and dangerous." He called for people to build bridges of love and unity, particularly with those they disagree with, and to learn how to disagree better. Wilson's message joins those of other celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Josh Duhamel, who have also denounced the killing and called for an end to political madness.</p>

During the final stretch, Hocker, who was boxed in on the inside lane, pushed through a narrow gap, making physical contact with Germany's Robert Farken. Although Hocker finished second and initially appeared to qualify for the final, the contact was deemed to have given him an unfair advantage and disrupted his competitor.

Patel also revealed that investigators found forensic evidence of a destroyed note in which the suspect allegedly wrote about his opportunity to "take out" Kirk.

          <p>Despite geopolitical tensions and challenges like visa issues, there are signs that younger Europeans are once again exploring career and educational opportunities in China. More than two years after strict COVID-19 policies led to an exodus of foreigners, the country's rapid development in technology and entrepreneurship is attracting a new wave of interest. For some, China represents a dynamic environment for professional growth and a chance to be part of a fast-changing system. This perspective appears to be more common among younger generations who see significant potential in the country's future.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that pop star Sabrina Carpenter's album "Man's Best Friend" captures the growing exasperation among Gen Z women regarding dating and relationships. The authors, who are masculinity researchers, suggest her lyrics articulate a widespread withdrawal from dating due to the emotional immaturity and undue emotional labor often expected from male partners. This cultural trend is reflected in data showing that a majority of single young women are not actively looking to date. The article connects this phenomenon to the rise of the 'manosphere,' a decline in male friendships, and the growing popularity of AI girlfriend platforms.</p>

          <p>A behavioral psychology expert advises against using generic conversation starters like "How are you?" to build genuine connections, as they often lead to scripted, unmemorable responses. Instead, she recommends asking more engaging questions that prompt storytelling, such as "What's the highlight of your week?" or asking about fun weekend plans. The expert also emphasizes the importance of body language, like maintaining an open stance and mirroring gestures, to signal trustworthiness. Practicing these techniques in low-stakes daily interactions can help make them feel more natural and effective in building rapport.</p>

When a transfer occurs, loans are often placed in a temporary administrative forbearance, and making payments during this limbo period can be risky. Experts advise borrowers to save their payment amount and wait until the new account is fully active before submitting it. It is also crucial for borrowers to download their payment history from the old servicer and carefully verify that all account details, including payment plans and progress toward forgiveness, have been transferred correctly.</p>

          <p>The watermelon has become a prominent symbol of Palestinian solidarity, largely due to its colors—red, green, black, and white—which mirror the Palestinian flag. Its use as a political statement dates back to the 1980s, after Israel banned the public display of the Palestinian flag in the occupied territories. According to artist Sliman Mansour, an Israeli officer suggested that even painting a watermelon would be forbidden if it contained the flag's colors, inadvertently popularizing the fruit as a form of protest art. In the current conflict, the symbol has gained global recognition, used in demonstrations and on social media to represent Palestinian identity and resistance.</p>
