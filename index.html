          <p>Most teachers and doctors in England will receive a 4% pay rise following government acceptance of pay review body recommendations, exceeding the previously budgeted 2.8%. Education unions welcomed the decision but warned of potential budget cuts without additional funding. Health unions, however, reacted negatively to a smaller 3.6% rise for NHS staff, excluding doctors. The British Medical Association plans to ballot resident doctors regarding possible strike action, deeming the rise "woefully inadequate." The Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests the 4% offer for teachers is likely a small real-terms increase, considering inflation forecasts. Optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>Kid Cudi testified in Sean Combs's federal trial, recounting events following Combs's discovery of his relationship with Casandra Ventura. He described receiving a call from Ventura, learning Combs was at his house, and later finding his Porsche on fire due to a Molotov cocktail. Ventura had previously testified that Combs threatened to blow up Cudi's car. Prosecutors accuse Combs of running a criminal enterprise and his lawyers deny his involvement in the arson. The article also details testimony from George Kaplan, a former personal assistant to Combs, regarding alleged abusive behavior towards Ventura. Optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling illegal, setting up a legal battle. The waivers set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including a rule requiring all new vehicle sales in California to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, but Democrats argue such a vote is illegal. The California Air Resources Board claims the state has never had a waiver revoked in 50 years. Optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>A woman, identified as 27-year-old Monia Spadaro, was shot and wounded at CIA headquarters after crashing into a gate. Officials are investigating whether Spadaro was intoxicated during the incident. The shooting incident took place hours after officials said two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot and killed outside D.C.'s Capital Jewish Museum.
