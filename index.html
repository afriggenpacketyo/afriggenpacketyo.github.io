          <p>The Israeli Air Force conducted overnight strikes on multiple military targets in Iran, including an inactive nuclear reactor near Arak, following heightened tensions between the two nations. Israel stated that the strike on the Arak heavy water reactor aimed to prevent its future use in nuclear weapons production by hitting the structure that seals the reactor, which is a key component in plutonium production. Other targeted sites included a "nuclear weapons development" location in Natanz, alleging specialized equipment used for advancing nuclear weapons development was housed there. This action is part of Israel's broader campaign to dismantle Iran's nuclear capabilities, which it views as an existential threat. Optimism regarding the conflict is low due to the escalation of hostilities.</p>

          <p>Japan's new policy of making high school tuition virtually free, even for private institutions, is causing concern among educators and policy experts who fear it may lead to a decline in public school enrollment and exacerbate inequalities. While intended to alleviate financial burdens on households amid inflation, critics argue the policy lacks adequate support for struggling public schools already facing enrollment and budget challenges. Some public schools are adapting by offering unique courses and tailored education, but face challenges in attracting students compared to private schools that promote global education. The government's focus has been primarily on financial relief, with limited discussion on the policy's broader impact on the education system. The potential shift away from public schools has educators worried about the future of public education in Japan.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick, an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 storm, is approaching Mexico's Pacific coast, posing a threat of destructive winds, flash floods, and storm surge. The storm's projected path shifted south, bringing it closer to Puerto Escondido in Oaxaca state, prompting the suspension of activities and urging residents to seek shelter. Acapulco, still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Otis in 2023, is bracing for Erick's arrival with heightened preparation and trepidation. Forecasters predict heavy rainfall, with up to 16 inches possible in Oaxaca and Guerrero, raising concerns about flooding and mudslides. The Mexican government has issued warnings and prepared shelters, emphasizing the need for residents to heed instructions and prioritize safety.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions, Israel is reportedly seeking the United States' GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a 30,000-pound bunker buster bomb, to destroy Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, a facility deeply embedded within a mountain. The Fordow facility is believed to be 80-90 meters underground, making it difficult to reach with conventional weapons. The United States is the only country possessing these bombs, which are delivered by B-2 bombers, and their deployment would signify a major shift towards offensive strikes against Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the campaign as a mission to dismantle Iran's nuclear capabilities, framing them as an existential threat. The potential use of bunker busters raises concerns about radiological and chemical contamination.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded at the company's Starbase facility in Texas during preparations for an engine test firing, resulting in the destruction of the rocket. The explosion occurred as the Starship was being filled with liquid oxygen and methane fuel, sending debris across the test site. SpaceX confirmed the incident, stating that safety protocols were in place and all personnel are accounted for, and the company is working to secure the area. This setback will likely delay the next test flight of the Super Heavy-Starship vehicle, which NASA is relying on for its lunar landing program.

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents discovered and disabled a nearly 3,000-foot-long narcotics smuggling tunnel connecting Tijuana and San Diego. The tunnel, found during construction in early April, ran under the Otay Mesa Port of Entry with a projected exit near a commercial warehouse. Equipped with lighting, ventilation, and a track system, the tunnel reached depths of 50 feet. Authorities found the entrance in a Tijuana house, recently covered with new tile, and plan to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent its use by Foreign Terrorist Organizations. This discovery marks the decommissioning of over 95 tunnels in the San Diego area since 1993.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp.'s top executive, Eiji Hashimoto, expressed confidence that the U.S. government's oversight role in its $14.1 billion acquisition of United States Steel Corp. will not hinder the U.S. unit's business operations. Despite conditions such as an $11 billion investment in U.S. Steel and a golden share issued to the U.S. government, Hashimoto believes the deal is rational and ensures profitability for both companies. The acquisition makes Nippon Steel the world's fourth-largest steelmaker and aims to expand its global capacity, allowing it to tap into the growing U.S. demand for high-grade steel used in electric vehicles. Hashimoto emphasized that trade levies alone will not revive the U.S. manufacturing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The potential for regime change in Iran is being discussed, but experts caution against underestimating the complexities and potential consequences. While the current regime is oppressive and destabilizing, history suggests that regime change often leads to enduring troubles and miseries for ordinary people. The removal of the current regime could create a power vacuum, leading to civic instability and prolonged conflict, as there is no clear successor ready to govern. Despite the desire for a better future for Iran, caution is advised due to the potential for unintended and negative outcomes. The article emphasizes that the courage to seize the moment can be decisive.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is facing a demographic crisis as large numbers of young women are leaving the country due to the ongoing war, creating concerns about the nation's future. With young men restricted from leaving, the emigration of young women poses a brain drain and a demographic time bomb, raising questions about who will rebuild the country after the war. The allure of education and career opportunities in Europe, combined with the stress and uncertainty of life in Ukraine, is driving this trend. The Ukrainian government is investing in education and career opportunities to encourage young people to stay and rebuild the country.</p>

This statement comes as a recently agreed framework to ease trade tensions hangs in limbo. The U.S. has tightened restrictions on China's access to American technology, but agreed to ease some restrictions in exchange for increased exports of critical minerals from China.</p>

The comments were made after workers erected two 88-foot-tall flagpoles at Trump's direction, which he described as a gift to the White House.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly employing "tariff engineering" to legally skirt higher duties imposed by the U.S. government. This practice involves changing an item's materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into a different "harmonized system code" with lower tariff rates. Examples include manufacturers bundling steel and aluminum, or altering materials in clothing and footwear to qualify for lower duties. While not inherently illegal, companies must carefully balance product redesign with accurately representing product classifications to avoid fraudulent misrepresentation. This strategy allows companies to reduce their duty liability by leveraging strategic design choices.</p>

An olive green kitchen can increase the sale price by up to $1,600, while navy blue bedrooms can add an estimated $1,815 to the value. Staging a home and removing personal belongings can also benefit sellers by increasing sale prices and reducing the amount of time a listing sits on the market. By contrast, bright and playful colors can deter buyers and reduce a home's sale price.</p>
