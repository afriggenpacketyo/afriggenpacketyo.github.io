          <p>George Wendt, known for his iconic role as Norm Peterson on the sitcom "Cheers," has died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 76. A family representative confirmed that Wendt was a devoted family man and friend, having earned six Emmy nominations for his portrayal of the beer-loving barfly. Wendt began his comedy career at Chicago's The Second City theater, later appearing in shows like "M*A*S*H" and "Taxi" before landing his breakthrough role on "Cheers," where he starred in all 275 episodes. Wendt also made appearances on "Saturday Night Live" and in films such as "Fletch" and "Forever Young."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has outlined new regulatory guidance for future COVID-19 vaccine boosters, establishing stricter approval standards for healthy Americans. The agency will now require new clinical trials demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of COVID shots before approving them for healthy adults and children, a shift from previous approvals based on antibody response tests. This change aims to balance regulatory flexibility with robust scientific evidence, particularly for those at low risk of severe illness. The new guidelines may impact revenue for vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer and Moderna, but are viewed as fair and considerate of the benefits and risks associated with additional vaccinations.</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada have issued strong condemnations of Israel's recent military actions in Gaza, citing disproportionate force and the obstruction of humanitarian aid. Britain has suspended free-trade agreement talks with Israel, while the three nations jointly demanded a cessation of the renewed military offensive and the lifting of restrictions on humanitarian aid. The article notes that a senior U.N. official warned that thousands of babies in Gaza could die without immediate aid. Prime Minister Netanyahu defended Israel's actions, stating they are necessary for self-defense against Hamas barbarism, but the allied countries expressed that the high Palestinian death toll and humanitarian conditions are pushing their support to the limit.</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail, Sterling Williams, has been arrested and charged with assisting ten inmates in their escape. Williams allegedly shut off the water supply, allowing the inmates to remove a toilet and sink fixture from a cell wall, creating an opening to cut through steel bars. The inmates then exited through a loading dock and scaled a wall, using blankets to protect themselves from barbed wire. The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office is investigating the escape, noting that about a third of the jail's cameras were not working and that there were defective locks and doors.</p>

          <p>Michelle Renee, a bank manager, was forced to rob her own bank after masked gunmen kidnapped her and her seven-year-old daughter, Breea. The gunmen strapped fake dynamite to Renee and Breea, threatening to detonate it if Renee didn't comply with their demands. Renee successfully robbed the bank of $360,000 and returned home to find Breea safe. The suspects, Christopher Butler and Lisa Ramirez, were later apprehended, but Ramirez was acquitted in the initial trial after claiming Renee was complicit. Butler eventually admitted in 2020 that Renee was not involved, exonerating her after years of suspicion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As discussions progress between Iran and the United States, the potential for Washington's investment in Iran following the lifting of sanctions emerges as a key consideration. While Tehran is open to enticing US investors, its willingness is highly conditional, particularly tied to complete sanctions relief. Iran is wary of economic espionage and investment frameworks which could involve strategic concessions. If a nuclear framework stabilizes, phased US investment under regional mediation could emerge as a possibility. However, any substantial economic opening would require approval from the US Congress.</p>

          <p>President Trump appears to have abandoned efforts to impose new sanctions on Russia, signaling a shift toward prioritizing business opportunities between the U.S. and Moscow. This reversal comes after a phone call between Trump and Russian President Putin, where Trump suggested that Russia and Ukraine should resolve the conflict themselves. European allies, however, are proceeding with new sanctions despite the U.S. stance. Critics argue that Trump's policy puts pressure on Ukraine rather than Russia, while Trump administration officials maintain that existing sanctions remain in place and that the president seeks to end the costly war.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's recent diagnosis with advanced prostate cancer that has spread to his bones has sparked questions about screening practices and the disease's progression. Biden had not undergone prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup in February 2024, as guidelines do not routinely recommend screenings for men over 70. His spokesperson said his last PSA test was in 2014. Doctors suggest that the cancer's rapid spread indicates an aggressive form of the disease. Experts emphasize the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual, highlighting that Biden's new urinary symptoms prompted further evaluation leading to the diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Immigration attorneys have requested a federal judge in Massachusetts to block the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from deporting migrants to South Sudan or any country other than their origin. This action follows notices received by migrants from Myanmar, Vietnam, and other countries indicating their imminent deportation. The attorneys argue that these deportations violate a previous court order requiring adequate due process. Allegedly, one migrant from Myanmar has already been deported to South Sudan. The Trump administration has been negotiating with various countries to accept deportees, including controversial arrangements with El Salvador and attempted deals with Libya.</p>

          <p>The UK has escalated its response to the Gaza offensive by suspending trade deal talks with Israel, summoning the Israeli ambassador, and imposing sanctions on West Bank settlers. Foreign Secretary David Lammy described the military escalation as "morally unjustifiable," citing warnings of starvation in Gaza. The move follows a joint statement from the UK, Canada, and France demanding Israel end its military expansion and allow humanitarian aid. Israel's foreign spokesman responded defiantly, stating that external pressure will not deter Israel from defending itself. There were calls for the foreign secretary to go further, including from Labour backbenchers, who raised the possibility of a breach of international law.</p>

          <p>Banu Mushtaq’s “Heart Lamp,” a collection of stories about Indian Muslim women’s daily struggles, has won the International Booker Prize. Translated by Deepa Bhasthi from Kannada, it is the first story collection to win the prestigious award, which comes with a £50,000 prize to be split equally between the author and translator. The judges praised the collection’s extraordinary accounts of patriarchal systems and resistance, as well as Bhasthi’s unique translation style that incorporates Indian expressions and ways of talking, giving the stories a vibrant and distinct voice.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily restored Maine lawmaker Laurel Libby's right to vote after she was censured for a controversial social media post about a transgender student athlete. The court's order halts sanctions against Libby, who was barred from speaking on the chamber floor and voting due to the post. The decision drew a dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who criticized the court for intervening in an "intra-parliamentary dispute." The case highlights ongoing tensions surrounding transgender athletes and free speech within the political sphere.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued an order temporarily lifting sanctions against Maine Republican Rep. Laurel Libby, who was censured for posting an unblurred photo of a transgender high school athlete. The sanction effectively stripped Libby of her right to vote, depriving her constituents of representation. The court's decision, with Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissenting, is based on the First Amendment, which protects offensive speech. Justice Jackson criticized the Court for overusing its "shadow docket," but regardless, Libby's constituents have a right to representation, regardless what views their representative holds.</p>

Amid the stalled talks, the IDF announced a new "extensive ground operation" in Gaza, drawing condemnation from international leaders. The UK has suspended trade negotiations with Israel and imposed sanctions on West Bank settlers.

The State Department has said that Joseph St. Clair, whose release was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, was wrongfully detained.
