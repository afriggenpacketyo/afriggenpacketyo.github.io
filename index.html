          <p>Senior Pentagon officials have revealed details about Operation Midnight Hammer, a U.S. mission involving seven B-2 Spirit bombers striking Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The mission, described as the largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history, inflicted severe damage, with the planes flying from Missouri and using decoys to maintain surprise. Tomahawk cruise missiles were also launched from a U.S. submarine at the Isfahan site, and over 125 U.S. aircraft participated in the mission, utilizing more than 75 precision-guided weapons. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the attack an overwhelming success, emphasizing that it did not target Iranian troops or people, and warned Iran against retaliation. Optimism surrounding the event is tempered by the potential for escalation and further conflict in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Reem Raouda, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests using specific phrases to encourage cooperation from children instead of triggering their fight-or-flight responses. Traditional parenting phrases like "Because I said so" or threats can be counterproductive, but language that respects a child's autonomy and sets clear boundaries can lead to better outcomes. The recommended phrases focus on explaining reasons, giving children agency within limits, acknowledging their emotions, and inviting problem-solving instead of blame. By shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>

          <p>Severe weather swept through the upper Midwest, resulting in three deaths in North Dakota due to a tornado, while northern Minnesota experienced significant storm damage with wind gusts exceeding 100 mph.

Itasca State Park has closed due to the storm, and tens of thousands remain without power in the region.

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has stated that there is no allocated budget for an assisted dying service, despite recent parliamentary support for the measure. Streeting, who opposed the legislation, cited existing strains on end-of-life care and NHS finances as potential challenges. While he pledged to work constructively if the legislation becomes law, he expressed concerns that MPs had made the wrong choice given current financial constraints. An impact assessment suggests potential long-term savings to the NHS from assisted dying, but also acknowledges significant initial costs for staffing and training.</p>

          <p>The United States conducted a top-secret precision attack, code-named "Operation Midnight Hammer," on Iran's nuclear facilities, marking the largest strike using B2 bombers in history.

According to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated, and no other country could have executed such an operation. While the White House touted the mission as a success, an assessment is underway to determine the extent of the damage to the nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>NATO member countries have reportedly agreed to increase their defense spending to 5% of their respective GDPs, a target advocated by the U.S. for some time.

Formal adoption of the agreement is expected during the upcoming NATO meeting in The Hague, with all member nations except Spain having until 2035 to meet the 5% target. The spending will be divided, with at least 3.5% allocated to core military needs and an additional 1.5% for related expenditures.</p>

McKenzie notes that Iranian decision-making may be hampered by the loss of senior leaders and suggests that the U.S. remains vulnerable in Iraq and Syria, but is taking measures to harden against potential attacks.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, authorities report no signs of off-site radiation or contamination, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi stated that no health consequences for people or the environment outside the targeted sites are expected at this time. The three sites hit contained uranium enriched to different levels, but experts suggest that the materials involved pose a low hazard regarding radioactive materials. Neighboring countries, including Kuwait, have also reported no abnormal radiation levels.</p>

          <p>Representative Jim Himes, a ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has described President Trump's strikes against Iran as a "massive gamble," citing the lack of Congressional approval and historical precedents of U.S. military interventions in the Middle East. Himes expressed concern about the potential for unintended consequences and cautioned against premature optimism, referencing past conflicts in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan.

          <p>Owners of Maui short-term vacation rentals claim that local residents cannot afford the rent if 6,100 units are converted into long-term housing, but a University of Hawaii study suggests otherwise. The study indicates that over 11,600 Maui households already spend 30% of their income on housing and could afford to move into converted units. The analysis also reveals that converting vacation rentals would lower housing costs for residents due to declining property values and taxes. The Maui County Council's Housing and Land Use Committee will consider these competing claims as they continue hearings on the proposed bill.</p>
