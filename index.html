        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, at least 31 people died and over 200 sustained injuries when Israeli forces fired near an aid distribution site west of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that there were "no known casualties from IDF gunfire" within the site, and the matter is under investigation. Local witnesses reported the shooting occurred approximately 1,000 yards from the aid site, managed by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, but a GHF spokesperson denied any incident occurred during aid distribution. The conflicting reports highlight the complexities and sensitivities surrounding aid efforts in the region, especially as the area is currently war-torn. Optimism surrounding the event is understandably low, considering the circumstances.</p>

          <p>A Republican-led budget bill proposing restrictions on federal student loans for professional programs, such as medical school, is drawing criticism from doctorsâ€™ associations, medical schools, and student advocates who fear it could worsen a national doctor shortage. The proposal would limit federal student loans to $150,000 and eliminate a federal graduate loan program, potentially driving low-income students away from pursuing medicine. Experts warn that these changes could also exacerbate the flight of doctors from lower-paid specialties like family medicine and primary care.

          <p>A review of Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) records reveals that the department's response to the Palisades fire was not solely hampered by a lack of mechanics, but by the city's reliance on an aging fleet of fire engines. Well over half of the LAFDâ€™s fire engines and nearly half of its ladder trucks are operating beyond their recommended lifespans, leading to increased reliance on reserve vehicles. Long-term funding challenges and rising equipment costs have exacerbated the problem, making it difficult for the department to replace outdated vehicles.

          <p>North Carolina's existing housing crisis has been exacerbated by Hurricane Helene, which damaged or destroyed over 100,000 homes and caused dozens of fatalities due to flooding. Many residents in western North Carolina, who pride themselves on being tough and resilient, did not evacuate despite warnings, partly because the area hadn't experienced such a flood in over a century. Meteorologists are working to improve forecasting and warnings for freshwater flooding, the leading cause of hurricane deaths, as climate change contributes to bigger, wetter storms.

          <p>The White House is facing scrutiny for deporting individuals to countries other than their home countries, arguing that their home countries refuse to accept them due to criminal records. One case involves a man deported to South Sudan instead of Vietnam, sparking legal action from immigration lawyers who argue that deportees need sufficient time to contest their deportations to third countries. A federal judge ruled in their favor, stating that migrants should have a credible fear interview to express potential violence or persecution in the designated country. The article highlights the ethical and legal debates surrounding the administration's deportation practices and the rights of individuals facing removal.</p>

          <p>A political science paper titled "The Republicans Should Pray for Rain" has long been an axiom in American elections, suggesting that lower turnout benefits Republicans due to their affluent electorate's ability to vote despite inconveniences. However, recent trends indicate that stricter voting laws may no longer provide the same advantage to the Republican party. This article examines the changing dynamics of voter turnout and the evolving strategies of political parties in response to demographic and societal shifts. It suggests that traditional assumptions about voter behavior may need to be reevaluated in the current political climate.</p>
