          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order instructing the Interior Department to devise a strategy for increasing entrance and recreation pass fees for foreign visitors at U.S. national parks. This policy, framed as an "America first" initiative, is estimated by the administration to generate over $90 million in annual revenue for park improvements. The directive also mandates that U.S. residents receive preferential treatment in park access systems, such as lotteries or permitting rules. This action occurs alongside broader administration efforts to reduce National Park Service staff and reverse diversity and inclusion policies from the previous administration.</p>

          <p>The South Korean military has taken a person into custody who crossed the heavily fortified border from North Korea. The individual was identified and secured after crossing the Military Demarcation Line, which runs through the center of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Authorities have not released details about the person's identity or motive for crossing. The JCS confirmed the individual is now under investigation by relevant agencies and noted that no unusual military movements were detected from North Korea during the incident. Such crossings are rare due to the extensive fortifications, including landmines and armed troops, along the border.</p>

          <p>Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has condemned comments from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who described the agency as a "terrorist force" for its methods of detaining individuals. Lyons contrasted her statement with what he called her defense of an actual Antifa-affiliated individual who attacked an ICE facility in 2019. He argued that such rhetoric is dangerous, especially as assaults on ICE officers have reportedly increased by nearly 700%. Lyons asserted that the congresswoman should apologize to her constituents for prioritizing criminals over law enforcement officers who are upholding laws established by Congress.</p>

          <p>A strike by bin collectors in Birmingham has entered its sixth month, leaving residents to contend with overflowing rubbish and suspending recycling collections. The industrial action, initiated by the Unite union, began in response to council plans to downgrade some roles to address equal pay liabilities. Residents describe the situation as "apocalyptic," with piles of waste accumulating, particularly in student areas. Despite the city having one of the lowest recycling rates in the country, Birmingham City Council states it remains committed to resolving the dispute, though a deal has not yet been reached with the striking workers.</p>

          <p>An infant in Victorville, California, sustained head injuries after being dropped by their mother during a hazardous incident.

While attempting to park, the 12-year-old accidentally struck the mother with the car door, causing her to fall and drop the infant. The baby was subsequently airlifted to a medical center for treatment, and local authorities are now investigating the case as an incident of potential child cruelty, though no charges have been confirmed.</p>

          <p>Veterans, military family advocates, and legal experts are warning that the Trump administration's deployment of troops to Los Angeles to support ICE operations erodes democratic norms. They argue that using the military for civilian law enforcement, which is restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act, places unprepared troops in a difficult position against American citizens. Speakers at a virtual news conference highlighted the strain on military families and the potential for excessive force, recalling past incidents. Despite the administration's defense that the deployment is necessary for security, critics like retired Lt. Col. Dan Maurer describe it as "making America militarized again."</p>

          <p>New data from the Deportation Data Project reveals that immigrants with no criminal convictions are the fastest-growing group within the ICE detention population. This group now constitutes about half of the 56,000 people currently detained, with their numbers nearly doubling since May. According to UCLA Professor Graeme Blair, this trend contradicts the administration's stated focus on deporting violent criminals and reflects a broader push to detain anyone in the U.S. without legal status. The article highlights the case of a Guatemalan pastor with no criminal record who was recently deported after living and working in the U.S. for 30 years.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for and two others injured. The blasts, which began Tuesday evening, sparked multiple grass fires and prompted a one-mile evacuation zone that remains in effect. The facility, which was reportedly operating without local licenses for fireworks storage, is still considered an active scene with un-detonated explosives. Federal agencies, including the ATF, have joined the investigation as families await news of their missing loved ones, including three brothers who were working at the site.</p>

At Assateague Island National Seashore in Maryland, for example, lifeguard towers are shuttered, creating potential dangers for swimmers. The National Parks Conservation Association reports that the National Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff since President Trump took office, a result of layoffs and a federal hiring freeze. While the administration claims public-facing personnel are prioritized, critics argue the cuts are a symptom of chaos that jeopardizes visitor safety at popular destinations across the country.</p>

          <p>The iconic British band Oasis has kicked off its long-awaited reunion tour, playing their first show in 16 years at Cardiff's Principality Stadium. The tour, which sold around 900,000 tickets, was one of the biggest concert launches in UK history, attracting fans from around the world. The band, featuring brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, is expected to play a setlist of their greatest hits, including "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova." The reunion follows years of public feuding between the brothers, which led to the band's abrupt split in 2009 just minutes before a festival performance in Paris.</p>

          <p>The major tax and spending bill poised to become law represents a significant victory for conservative ideology, fundamentally reshaping the U.S. social safety net. By extending tax cuts and imposing new work requirements and funding cuts on programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the legislation fulfills decades of Republican ambitions. Experts warn the changes will have widespread effects, with millions projected to lose benefits. While the bill provides some tax relief for working-class voters, analyses suggest the largest benefits go to high earners, and the legislation is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national deficit.

          <p>This article examines the economic consequences of the Trump administration's recent tariff increases on goods from multiple countries, including China and the EU. While the stock market initially dropped, it has since rebounded, though shares of tariff-vulnerable companies remain affected. Economists note that while inflation has not yet spiked, it is likely premature to declare victory, as the costs will probably be passed on to consumers eventually. The article also points to early signs of a slowdown in consumer spending, creating uncertainty about whether the economy will face a significant slide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after Keir Starmer's Labour party won a majority, BBC correspondents have assessed the government's performance across key policy areas. On the economy, growth has been minimal, and new policies are weighing on business profits. Net migration has fallen due to prior government restrictions, but small boat crossings have increased. Diplomatically, the government has managed its relationship with the U.S. and reset ties with the EU, though critics call its foreign policy too cautious. Progress on domestic issues like teacher recruitment and cutting NHS waiting lists has been modest, with some major welfare reforms facing U-turns after internal pressure.</p>

          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can remove eight noncitizens who were being held at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. The ruling clears the way for their deportation to South Sudan, a country with which they have no ties. The men had previously been granted a temporary reprieve by a lower court judge who argued they needed more time to contest their removal. The Supreme Court's decision lifts that injunction, representing a victory for the administration's policy of deporting certain immigrants to third countries, with Justices Sotomayor and Kagan dissenting.</p>
