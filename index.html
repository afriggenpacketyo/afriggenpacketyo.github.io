          <p>Reform UK has gained a significant majority in Lancashire County Council, marking a shift from decades of Conservative and Labour dominance. The newly elected councillors, many of whom are new to political office, are attending induction days to understand their roles and council services. Councillor Stephen Atkinson, the council leader, stated the party intends to scrutinize every line in the budget to ensure it benefits residents, focusing on addressing legacy issues like special educational needs and adult social care. The party faces scrutiny as it aims to balance the budget and deliver on its promises, including challenging net zero initiatives. Protests occurred outside the council's first meeting, highlighting concerns about potential service cuts. The optimism score reflects the uncertainty surrounding the new leadership and potential changes to local services.</p>

          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are leaving Paul Weiss following the firm's controversial agreement with President Trump. The deal, which involved compromises on hiring practices and pro bono services, was struck to avoid federal targeting after Trump criticized the firm for employing individuals connected to investigations against him. The departures of Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jessica Phillips, and Jeannie Rhee have raised questions about the impact of the agreement on the firm's internal dynamics. Other law firms have challenged similar executive orders from Trump, with some successfully arguing their unconstitutionality.

          <p>Tra'Von Johnson, a 22-year-old inmate, was recaptured after escaping from the Tangipahoa Parish Jail in Louisiana for the second time in a year.

This incident prompted administrative leave for at least four individuals pending a full review. Johnson's previous escape in May 2024 involved breaking through the jail's perimeter fence during recreation time, highlighting ongoing security concerns at the facility.

          <p>A plane crash in a military housing neighborhood in San Diego resulted in the deaths of all six people on board, including three employees of Sound Talent Group, a music agency. The crash occurred near Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, damaging ten homes and displacing at least 100 residents. Investigators from the FAA and NTSB are examining the wreckage to determine the cause, noting a technical glitch at Montgomery-Gibbs that knocked out weather updates for pilots. The pilot did not report any problems before the crash.

          <p>China has greenlit the construction of a 767-kilometer canal to connect the resource-rich Jiangxi province with the wealthy coastal province of Zhejiang. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal, estimated to cost $44.4 billion, is part of a larger initiative to enhance inland water transport and reduce logistical expenses. Once completed, the canal will facilitate the transport of goods, particularly from Jiangxi's electric vehicle manufacturing hub, to Zhejiang's seaports. Designed as a Class III waterway, it will accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle approximately 25 million tonnes of cargo annually, integrating less-developed inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs.</p>

The Pentagon Press Association criticized the measures as an attack on the freedom of the press.

She was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was killed when Alec Baldwin discharged a prop gun loaded with a live round. Gutierrez-Reed was sentenced to 18 months in prison and has been paroled to her home in Arizona. Baldwin, who faced the same charge, had his case dismissed, and Rust has since finished filming and been released in theaters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is trimming and restructuring the National Security Council (NSC), with some staff members being reassigned within the administration. The changes come after Marco Rubio replaced Mike Waltz as national security adviser. Andy Baker, Vice President Vance's national security advisor, is taking a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security advisor. Approximately 20 people have been placed on administrative leave. The NSC's communications team is also being dissolved as part of the restructuring. Some former members of the NSC have expressed concerns about the impact of these cuts on the council's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Fears of a US-EU trade war have been reignited after Europe refused to back down in the face of fresh tariff threats from President Trump. Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the EU after claiming trade talks with Brussels were "going nowhere". EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said: "EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests." Major stock indices tumbled after Mr Trump's comments, which came as he also threatened to slap US tech giant Apple with a 25% tariff.</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced a downturn on Friday after President Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on Apple and the European Union. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all saw declines. Trump's threat of a 50% tariff against the EU and a 25% tariff on iPhones produced abroad created uncertainty in the markets. European markets also reacted negatively to the news. Analysts predict continued market volatility due to expected trade policy developments and concerns over rising debt. The bond market is particularly worried about persistent trade tensions and unsustainable fiscal trajectories.</p>

Trump stated that the partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the American economy. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel praised the decision. The move follows a review by a panel of federal agencies. The acquisition had previously faced opposition from President Biden and the United Steelworkers union. The potential acquisition by Nippon Steel, the world's fourth-largest producer, of the iconic but struggling American steelmaker was an issue during last year's U.S. presidential election.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to send hundreds of border agents to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in arresting unauthorized immigrants within the U.S. interior. Approximately 500 personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will be involved in the effort. CBP agents will support ICE's 25 field offices in immigration enforcement operations. The plan highlights the administration's focus on scaling up its crackdown on illegal immigration. The effort comes amid a historic drop in illegal crossings at the southern border. The administration has already tasked law enforcement personnel at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and other agencies like the Internal Revenue Service with helping ICE target and arrest unauthorized immigrants.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered significant cuts to the White House National Security Council (NSC), reducing the number of policy experts. The overhaul aims to eliminate bureaucracy and duplication, shifting responsibilities back to home departments and agencies. After the cuts, the NSC will be approximately the same size as it was at the end of Trump's first term. Trump has been relying more on cabinet members like Secretary of State Marco Rubio for foreign policy decisions, rather than recommendations from the NSC. This move is one of many taken by the president to consolidate power in his own office.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition cameras in the search for escaped inmates in New Orleans has sparked controversy, raising concerns about privacy and civil liberties. Authorities used cameras operated by Project N.O.L.A., a private organization, to recapture one of the fugitives, despite recent orders to pause automated alerts from the group. Critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, argue that the use of live facial recognition is a radical escalation of surveillance power. Project N.O.L.A. operates approximately 200 facial recognition cameras in New Orleans, scanning faces, clothing, vehicles, and license plates. The New Orleans police had appeared to distance themselves from Project N.O.L.A. before the manhunt.</p>
