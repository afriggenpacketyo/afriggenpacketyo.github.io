          <h2>German Finance Minister Expresses Confidence in U.S. Relations Amid Tariff Disputes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Finance Minister Joerg Kukies stated that the trust between Europe and the U.S. remains intact despite President Trump's tariff policies, expressing optimism that ongoing negotiations will resolve the differences. He advocates for a zero-for-zero tariff agreement, aligning with the European Commission's position, despite Trump's previous rejection of such a proposal. Germany's economy, heavily reliant on trade with the U.S., faces potential challenges due to the tariff turmoil, but Kukies believes the situation is far from a crisis. He emphasized that both parties need to understand one another's viewpoints to reach an agreement.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated following a militant attack in Kashmir that resulted in the deaths of 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists. Indian Prime Minister Modi vowed to retaliate against those responsible, blaming Pakistan for supporting the attackers, while Pakistan denied involvement. India has taken steps to pressure Pakistan, including suspending a water treaty, while Pakistan has banned Indian aircraft from its airspace and suspended trade. The situation remains volatile, with concerns about the potential impact on water resources and the possibility of further escalation, while analysts urge caution against armed conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump is asking the Supreme Court to allow his administration's policy prohibiting transgender individuals from serving in the military to take effect while legal challenges proceed. This request follows a lower court's order preventing the enforcement of the ban, which the administration argues undermines military readiness. The policy, which rescinds a previous one by President Biden, cites concerns about troop readiness, lethality, and cohesion, claiming that gender identity conflicts with military standards. Challenges to the ban argue it violates constitutional rights, while the Justice Department defends the policy as based on medical conditions and military judgment.</p>

          <p>An exploration of ancient attitudes toward death reveals a surprising consistency in human imagination across millennia. Despite cultural variations, the ancients grappled with mortality and the afterlife in ways that resonate with modern concerns. The high mortality rates of the ancient world fostered a deep awareness of death's omnipresence, shaping religious beliefs and funerary practices. From the Egyptian concept of judgment to the Greek vision of Hades, ancient cultures offered diverse yet limited perspectives on what awaits us beyond the veil, reflecting humanity's enduring quest to understand death.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren is launching an investigation into the Trump administration's efforts to close the Department of Education, seeking input from students, parents, teachers, and borrowers. Warren sent letters to education and civil rights groups to understand how abolishing the department would impact access to affordable and high-quality public education. She expressed concern about potential cuts to funding and services, particularly for students with disabilities and those relying on federal financial aid. Warren vowed to fight back against the administration's education policies through federal investigations, oversight, and lawsuits.</p>
