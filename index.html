          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos is facing sentencing on Long Island after pleading guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors are seeking 87 months in prison, citing Santos's lies, theft, and defrauding of voters and donors, while his lawyers are requesting 24 months.
