          <h2>Trump's Remittance Tax Could Negatively Impact African Economies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 00:48:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new tax bill from US President Donald Trump includes a 3.5% tax on remittances sent by non-US citizens, sparking concern among African economies. Remittances are a significant source of income for many African nations, often exceeding aid and foreign direct investment. Experts fear the tax could drive migrants to use unofficial channels to avoid it, negatively impacting lower-income families who rely on these funds for essential needs like food, healthcare, and education. While the tax won't affect all remittances, it is expected to significantly alter how people send money to their families back home. Optimism is low considering that there is a risk to the economies of African nations. </p>

The inquiry is also investigating whether Cauchi targeted specific individuals or groups, and examining the response of security, police, paramedics, and the media.
