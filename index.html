          <p>China's industrial profits rose by 3% in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite high U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. This cumulative profit increase follows a 1.4% year-on-year rise in the first four months of the year, reversing previous declines. Although U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods remain at 51.1% and China's levies on U.S. imports are at 32.6%, exports to Southeast Asian nations have surged, compensating for a 21% drop in exports to the U.S. Manufacturing activity in China fell more than expected in April, highlighting the ongoing supply-demand imbalance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half the tax write-off for intangible assets, such as player contracts and media rights, for future professional sports team owners. The tax break, which allows owners to deduct the full value of these assets over 15 years, has contributed to rising team values and has made teams into tax shelters. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams and potentially impact the value of current owners' investments. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the change would raise nearly $1 billion over 10 years, though team owners argue the figure is much higher. (not investment advice)</p>

Saporito points out that Walmart, known for its low-cost strategy, has little room to absorb a 30 percent tariff without raising prices, and he criticizes the Small Business Administration's claim that tariffs will free businesses from Chinese suppliers. He also notes that businesses are afraid to call tariffs what they areâ€”a tax on imported goodsâ€”and suggests that this self-satire will ultimately be self-defeating.</p>

The announcement follows previous actions to freeze or strip funding from Harvard, rooted in claims of antisemitism and promotion of liberal ideology. Trump gave no details on how the plan would work, but it appears to be a redistribution of already-frozen funds. Jason Altmire, head of an association of trade schools, applauded the suggestion, though he said reducing regulation would be more helpful.</p>

          <p>Japan's craft gin industry is experiencing a boom, with small-scale distillers using homegrown ingredients, including local specialties, to produce unique gins. Domestic shipments of gin have increased significantly since 2019, driven by the flexibility of gin production and the ability to utilize existing equipment for whiskey and shochu. Distillers are incorporating local ingredients like goya bitter gourd, burnt lacquer wood, and camellia flowers, and the rise of dedicated gin bars and e-commerce sites further fuels the industry's growth, with major manufacturers also entering the market.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, overtaken by Germany, despite an increase in its net external assets. Japan's gross external assets rose to a record high, partly due to a weaker yen, but remained below Germany's total. The yen's depreciation boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. The United States, in contrast, has a significant net external liability, meaning its foreign debts far exceed its overseas assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The government is shifting apprenticeship funding to prioritize training for under-21s in England, with controversial plans to scrap funding for postgraduate apprenticeships.

Critics argue that the decision to scrap higher apprenticeships will damage public services, particularly the NHS, while the government aims to push more money generated by the apprenticeship levy towards younger individuals.</p>
