          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder, gave his first network interview since being detained during a citizenship interview. Mahdawi, who helped lead Columbia's protests against the Israel-Hamas war, was detained under a rarely used law revoking visas for people the Secretary of State believes could pose "adverse foreign policy consequences." He addressed President Trump directly, stating he wouldn't be silenced and emphasized his role as a peacemaker. Mahdawi sued in federal court, arguing his First Amendment rights were violated, and was subsequently released by a judge who cited substantial claims of retaliation for protected speech.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to assist qualifying students with private school tuition. The bill allows most students attending accredited private schools to receive $10,000 annually, while students with disabilities can receive up to $30,000, and home-schooled students will get $2,000 a year. Democrats argue that the legislation will harm public schools by diverting funds to wealthier students already in private education. The bill's passage marks a significant victory for school choice advocates in Texas. Optimism Score: 60</p>

He also questioned why Newark was excluded from a recent bonus offered to air traffic controllers, despite facing significant shortages.

The report found that 31% of revenue agents, or about 3,600 auditors, have left the agency due to deferred resignation plans or firings. Experts warn that losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, especially from wealthy taxpayers and corporations.

          <p>The Trump administration has informed Harvard University that it will end billions of dollars in research grants unless the school meets a list of demands, effectively ceding control of the university to the government. The administration cited Harvard's rejection of demands from its antisemitism taskforce, prompted by campus protests against Israel, and accused the university of violating federal law. Harvard is suing the federal government over funding cuts, arguing they would have stark consequences for patients, students, and researchers. The administration's demands include auditing professors for plagiarism, reporting misconduct by international students, and ensuring viewpoint diversity. Optimism Score: 20</p>

          <p>A study led by Peking University has found that migratory pests from mainland Southeast Asia, thriving under El Niño conditions, are contributing to rice yield losses in southern China. The researchers found that warm, humid weather created favorable breeding conditions for the pests in their source region, while wind gusts facilitated their migration to southern China. The team emphasized the need for collaborative, international pest control strategies to ensure food security in the region. The study highlights the impact of continued global warming on crop pests and the challenges it poses to stabilizing food production. Optimism Score: 60</p>

President Dina Boluarte announced a curfew and suspended mining activity in the Pataz area for 30 days, pushing the military to restore order.
