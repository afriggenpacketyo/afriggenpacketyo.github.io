          <p>Two Israeli Embassy employees, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was apprehended by museum security after allegedly shouting "Free Palestine" during the attack. Law enforcement officials are investigating the shooting as a potential hate crime, with early indicators suggesting targeted violence. The victims were described as a young couple planning to get engaged, and their deaths have sparked condemnation from Israeli officials and world leaders who decried antisemitism. The suspect didn't pop up on an initial search of crime databases and wasn't on the radar of law enforcement agencies, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.</p>

Smith, who maintained his innocence, was convicted of the brutal slayings that involved slashing throats and multiple gunshot wounds. The execution was carried out by lethal injection after a temporary reprieve in 2022 due to concerns about the state's lethal injection protocols. The state's new protocol includes only one page outlining details for pentobarbital. Smith's lawyers filed a lawsuit along with eight other death row inmates challenge Tennessee’s new protocol, saying there is a high risk of torturous death.</p>
