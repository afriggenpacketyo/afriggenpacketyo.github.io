        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the United States is uniquely positioned to lead the global artificial intelligence revolution, contingent on leveraging its vast energy resources. The author emphasizes that AI's massive electricity demands require a pragmatic energy policy focused on abundant natural gas, rather than relying solely on less scalable renewables. The article highlights a $500 billion private sector AI investment announced by Donald Trump and suggests that co-locating dedicated, gas-powered generation with data centers will be crucial for maintaining America's economic and national security advantages in the global AI race.</p>

          <p>Niclas Kvarnström, the European Union's managing director for the Asia-Pacific region, is expected to leave his post following an upcoming summit with China, according to sources. A fluent Chinese speaker and respected diplomat, Kvarnström has been influential in shaping the EU's regional policy, including organizing the bloc's first Indo-Pacific summit in 2023. His departure is described as "quite sudden" and is anticipated to create a significant void within the EU's China policymaking apparatus, despite his relatively brief two-year tenure in the role.</p>

          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will update the relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) curriculum to address contemporary issues. The updated curriculum will include lessons on identifying misogyny, understanding the harm of AI-generated "deepfakes," and recognizing unhealthy attitudes regarding consent. While previous plans for strict age limits on topics have been dropped, the guidance will outline what should be taught in primary versus secondary school, with a new emphasis on proactively engaging parents and teaching pupils to identify positive male role models.</p>

          <p>A major abuse scandal at Muckamore Abbey Hospital in Northern Ireland was uncovered after CCTV cameras, mistakenly left running for six months, recorded 300,000 hours of footage. The recordings revealed horrific physical and emotional abuse of vulnerable, non-verbal patients by staff, triggering the UK's largest adult safeguarding investigation. Despite the discovery of an estimated 1,500 "crimes" on just one ward nearly eight years ago, no cases have yet gone to trial, and families have not been permitted to view the footage, causing immense frustration and calls for accountability.</p>

          <p>This article provides a behind-the-scenes look at the chaotic and protracted criminal trials of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, who were found guilty of the manslaughter of their newborn baby. The correspondent details the defendants' disruptive behavior, which included frequently changing legal teams, refusing to attend court, and showing contempt for the proceedings, leading the judge to accuse them of attempting to sabotage their own retrial. Despite their actions, the couple appeared deeply in love and united, creating an extraordinary and often "jaw-dropping" courtroom dynamic over the 18-month legal process.</p>

          <h2>Fire at Massachusetts Assisted Living Facility Kills Nine Residents</h2>

          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living home in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and left one other critically injured. Firefighters arriving at the scene on Sunday night were met with heavy flames and smoke, forcing them to rescue numerous residents from windows over ladders in a heroic effort. Authorities have called the event an "unfathomable tragedy," and an investigation into the cause of the fire is underway, though it is not currently considered suspicious, as questions arise about staffing and safety.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests Animals Can Hear and React to Sounds Made by Plants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 23:02:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered the first evidence that animals respond to sounds produced by plants, potentially revealing a previously unknown layer of ecosystem interaction. A study from Tel Aviv University found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting ultrasonic "screams" associated with dehydration or stress, suggesting the moths perceive them as unhealthy. This groundbreaking research indicates that many insects and some mammals can hear these plant-based sounds, opening up a new field of study into how this auditory information influences animal behaviors like pollination or foraging.</p>

          <p>A joint report from the WHO and UNICEF has revealed that more than 14 million children worldwide were completely unvaccinated in 2024, leaving them vulnerable to preventable diseases. The report highlights that childhood vaccination rates have stagnated or declined in regions like Europe, where cases of whooping cough and measles have surged dramatically. Officials attribute the widening coverage gaps to factors including widespread misinformation and cuts to international aid, with over half of the world's unvaccinated children located in just nine countries, primarily in Africa and Asia.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered the incineration of nearly 500 metric tons of high-energy biscuits intended for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to government sources. The emergency food, enough to feed 1.5 million children for a week, is set to expire after requests to ship it were reportedly ignored following a halt on foreign aid programs. The decision to destroy the rations at a cost of $130,000 comes as the World Food Programme faces a funding crisis, highlighting a significant and unprecedented breakdown in the distribution of U.S. humanitarian assistance.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts, including retired NASA veteran Peggy Whitson, have departed the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, concluding an 18-day mission. The flight, organized by private company Axiom Space, included crew members from India, Poland, and Hungary, who conducted numerous experiments in microgravity. This mission, Axiom-4, represents a growing trend in commercial spaceflight, providing opportunities for foreign governments and private entities to access low-Earth orbit as NASA plans for the eventual retirement of the ISS around 2030.</p>

          <p>A group of major landowners, including wealthy estates and charities, has initiated a High Court challenge against the UK's 2024 Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act. They argue that provisions designed to make it cheaper for leaseholders to extend their leases or buy their freeholds violate their human rights by infringing on their right to enjoy private property without adequate compensation. While the claimants fear significant financial losses, leasehold campaigners are concerned the legal battle will delay much-needed reforms and complain that their voices are not being represented in the proceedings.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a new plan to supply "top-of-the-line weapons" to Ukraine through NATO allies, who will foot the bill for the military aid. In a significant policy shift, Trump also issued an ultimatum to Russia, threatening to impose severe 100% secondary tariffs on its trade partners if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days. The move, made after a meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte, signals a tougher stance on Russia and a renewed commitment to arming Kyiv, which Trump said is intended to ensure Ukraine can defend itself effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC's annual report on star salaries often omits many of its highest-paid personalities, creating an incomplete picture of talent earnings. This is because the disclosure requirement only applies to stars directly employed by the BBC, not those paid through independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. Consequently, the earnings of major figures like Claudia Winkleman, Michael McIntyre, and the stars of hit shows like "Strictly Come Dancing" and "The Apprentice" are not publicly listed, a practice the corporation says is necessary to compete in the commercial market.</p>
