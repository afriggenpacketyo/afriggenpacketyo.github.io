          <p>A Michigan judge has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 Republicans who falsely presented themselves as official electors for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. The judge ruled that the defendants, who believed Trump's claims of voter fraud, did not possess the sophistication to fully comprehend the electoral process and were acting on a sincere, albeit mistaken, belief. This decision was met with disappointment from Michigan's Attorney General, who may appeal, while a defense lawyer praised it as a victory against a "politically motivated witch hunt."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a memorandum aimed at strengthening the enforcement of existing laws for pharmaceutical advertising, particularly on social media platforms. The action pressures companies to provide more transparent and accurate information about drug risks and side effects, rather than imposing an outright ban on such ads. As part of the initiative, officials plan to send hundreds of cease and desist letters and thousands of warnings to companies, including online pharmacies and social media influencers who may not be following regulatory guidelines.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles prosecutors have charged Rockim Prowell, a 34-year-old California man, with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in connection with attacks on men he met through a dating app. The alleged crimes, spanning from 2021 to 2023, involved luring victims to meetings that resulted in fatal shootings, disappearances, and a near-fatal beating. Prowell, who is also a suspect in numerous burglaries where he reportedly wore a realistic mask, faces a potential sentence of life in prison or the death penalty if convicted.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led Missouri House has advanced a new congressional map as part of a mid-decade redistricting effort encouraged by President Trump. The proposed map is designed to change the state's delegation from six Republicans and two Democrats to a seven-to-one Republican majority by breaking up a key Democratic district around Kansas City. This move follows similar Republican efforts in Texas and a counter-effort by Democrats in California, setting the stage for potential legal challenges and further politicizing the redistricting process ahead of the 2026 elections.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed eliminating the £100 cap on contactless card payments, which would allow banks and payment providers to set their own limits. This change would align card payments with the unlimited transactions already possible through digital wallets on smartphones. While the move aims to reduce payment friction and reflect rising prices, it has raised concerns about fraud, though the FCA insists that providers would be responsible for losses and would only permit higher-value payments for low-risk transactions.</p>

          <p>Apple's newly unveiled iPhone Air, which replaces physical SIM cards with eSIM technology, may experience a limited or staggered release in the major market of mainland China. This potential delay is due to regulatory uncertainties, as only one of the country's three main cellular carriers currently supports the eSIM standard. Chinese regulators are reportedly taking a cautious approach to approving widespread adoption, which analysts suggest could be to protect the business models of state-owned telecom companies by preventing subscribers from easily switching carriers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to hear its appeal regarding the legality of broad tariffs imposed on numerous countries under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The case, which consolidates two lower court rulings that found the tariffs illegal, will be heard on an expedited schedule in November. The administration argued for the fast-tracked timeline by warning that a delayed negative ruling could force the Treasury to refund up to $1 trillion in collected duties, creating significant financial instability.

          <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is facing growing criticism for what opponents describe as a systematic crackdown on dissent, weaponizing the courts to silence political rivals. The arrest of Istanbul's popular mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, on corruption charges has sparked widespread protests and is seen by many as a politically motivated move to eliminate a key challenger ahead of future presidential elections. Despite Erdoğan's claims of tackling corruption, critics argue he is transforming Turkey into an autocracy by dismantling human rights and suppressing opposition voices.</p>

          <p>A report from a coalition of civil society organizations has accused Germany's state-owned development bank, KfW, of financing overseas projects linked to human rights abuses and environmental harm. The report alleges that infrastructure projects backed by the world's largest development bank have led to forced relocations of Indigenous communities in countries like Indonesia and Kenya without proper consent or compensation. Critics also claim KfW's complaint mechanisms are opaque and inaccessible, and that its due diligence is failing to prevent harm in vulnerable communities.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Allows Trump Administration to Temporarily Withhold Foreign Aid Funds</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a lower court's order that would have forced the Trump administration to spend nearly $5 billion in foreign aid previously approved by Congress. Chief Justice John Roberts issued the stay, giving aid groups who sued the administration until Friday to respond. The legal battle stems from President Trump's decision to cancel the funding through a "pocket rescission," a move to prevent spending on programs he deemed wasteful just before the end of the fiscal year, effectively challenging Congress's power of appropriation.</p>

          <p>Australian regulators have approved a new vaccine developed to protect the nation's endangered koala population from a widespread chlamydia epidemic. The disease is a major cause of death and infertility among koalas, with infection rates reaching as high as 70 percent in some wild colonies. Developed over a decade by university scientists, the single-dose vaccine has been shown in trials to significantly reduce symptoms and mortality, offering a critical tool to help save the iconic species from the brink of extinction.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has informed government departments that access to the Treasury's emergency reserve funds will be restricted in the lead-up to her budget announcement in November. This move is intended to enforce fiscal discipline, reduce borrowing, and ensure spending stays within established limits as she prepares to outline the government's tax and spending plans. The decision comes amid pressure to stimulate economic growth while adhering to borrowing rules, signaling a period of tighter financial control across government ministries.

          <p>Researchers in Beijing have developed a new AI model, SpikingBrain 1.0, that mimics the human brain's efficiency by activating only necessary neurons for a given task. This design reportedly allows the model to run up to 100 times faster than conventional systems on certain long-text processing tasks while requiring significantly less training data. Notably, the system operates entirely on homegrown Chinese chips from MetaX, highlighting its strategic importance as the U.S. continues to restrict exports of advanced AI hardware like Nvidia's GPUs.</p>

          <p>Israel has confirmed it conducted a strike in Doha, Qatar, targeting senior Hamas leaders whom it holds responsible for the October 7 attacks. Hamas reported that members of its negotiating team survived, but six other individuals, including the son of a chief negotiator and a Qatari security officer, were killed. The attack, which involved multiple fighter jets, has drawn condemnation from Qatar for violating its sovereignty. The White House stated it was informed of the operation but emphasized it was an independent Israeli decision.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay on a lower court ruling, effectively allowing the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to withhold billions in congressionally approved foreign aid. This action is seen by critics as an early signal that the court may be receptive to the administration's expansion of presidential power over congressionally appropriated funds. The case centers on the president's use of a "pocket rescission" to cancel spending, a move the Government Accountability Office previously found to be illegal, setting up a major constitutional confrontation.</p>
