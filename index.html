          <p>A vehicle crashed into the YNOT After School Camp in Chatham, Illinois, resulting in the deaths of four people, including children, and injuries to several others. The vehicle struck multiple individuals outside the building before crashing through it and exiting on the opposite side. Illinois State Police are investigating the incident, stating that it does not appear to be a targeted attack, and the cause remains under investigation. The victims ranged in age from 7 to 18, leaving the small town and its officials devastated as law enforcement secured the area and helped victims and parents desperately looking for the whereabouts of their children.</p>

          <p>No criminal charges will be filed against the ice hockey player arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of Nottingham Panthers player Adam Johnson. Johnson died after a collision with Sheffield Steelers' Matt Petgrave during a match in October 2023, resulting in a neck injury from a skate. The Crown Prosecution Service, working with South Yorkshire Police, concluded that there was not a realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal offense. The incident prompted calls for mandatory neck guards in ice hockey, and the English Ice Hockey Association announced that neck guards would be mandatory from 2024 onwards.</p>

          <p>Patrick Vereb, a funeral home director in Pittsburgh, is facing charges for allegedly throwing out the bodies of thousands of pets and providing owners with the ashes of other animals. Vereb, owner of Vereb Funeral Home and Eternity Pet Memorial, is accused of stealing over $650,000 from more than 6,500 customers between 2021 and 2024. Instead of performing promised private cremations, investigators say Vereb discarded many of the pets at a landfill and gave customers the ashes of unknown animals.

          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced that the fintech bank will bring back cryptocurrency investing this year, citing a "fundamental shift" in the regulatory landscape under the Trump administration. SoFi had previously been forced to drop crypto investing as a condition of receiving a bank charter in 2023. The company plans to make a more comprehensive push into cryptocurrency, including providing crypto and blockchain capabilities across its product areas. The SoFi announcement is early proof that banks are looking to push further into crypto in the Trump era.</p>

          <p>A widespread power outage in Madrid left residents without light, power, phone signal, and even water in some buildings, revealing vulnerabilities in the city's infrastructure. While essential services like hospitals continued to operate on backup generators, the blackout exposed a lack of preparedness among citizens, with few having conventional radios or emergency supplies. The incident highlighted the need for better civil protection infrastructure and preparedness, as well as the potential risks of hybrid attacks targeting Europe's critical infrastructure. Within 12 hours, power had been restored to most of Spain, a remarkable turnaround given the severity of the outage.</p>

          <p>Northern Michigan is facing months, potentially years, of recovery following a severe ice storm that damaged an estimated 3 million acres of trees. The storm left thousands without electricity for weeks, and the cleanup effort is expected to take months. Climate experts suggest that the warming atmosphere could lead to more severe freezing rain and ice storms in the future, with a potential northward shift in affected areas. The 5-mile-long Mackinac Bridge that spans the Strait of Mackinac was closed following the storm for the longest period of time since it opened in the 1950s, due to huge slabs of ice falling from its upper structure and narrowly missing vehicles on the highway below.</p>

          <p>Maintaining sibling relationships in adulthood is a choice, with varying degrees of closeness influenced by affection, ambivalence, and ambiguity. While close sibling bonds can positively impact well-being, strained relationships stemming from parental favoritism or past conflicts can lead to negative outcomes. Experts suggest that it's not necessary to have a super close relationship with siblings, and maintaining functional and cordial interactions may be sufficient. Factors like birth order, cultural expectations, and family norms also play a significant role in shaping sibling relationships.</p>

Those savings will be reinvested into Pfizer's product pipeline.

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals are projected to form Canada's next government, marking an historic turnaround for a party that looked to be headed for collapse just months ago. But as results continue to be declared, the party has not secured a clear majority in parliament - meaning it may have to work to unite Canadians in the face of tariffs and threats from US President Donald Trump. "Who's ready to stand up for Canada with me?" Carney said in a victory speech early on Tuesday morning. The former banker - who had never held political office before replacing Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier this year - presented himself during the campaign as the most experienced leader in a time of crisis.</p>

          <p>Canadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre is projected to have lost his seat in the House of Commons, according to public broadcaster CBC. Liberal Party candidate Bruce Fanjoy is projected by CBC to win the Carleton seat that Poilievre held for two decades. In his seat, Poilievre also faced a challenge from local advocates wanting to change an electoral system. Earlier on Tuesday morning - while conceding the election as a whole to Carney - Poilievre described the nationwide results as a "virtual tie" and said he wanted Canadians to come together to "hold the government to account".</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola beat Wall Street's quarterly earnings and revenue estimates and largely reaffirmed its full-year outlook, stating that it expects the effects of global trade conflicts to be "manageable". Unlike rival PepsiCo, Coke did not trim its full-year forecast. Coke said its operations are "primarily local," although costs, like aluminum, could rise due to the trade wars sparked by President Donald Trump's tariffs. The beverage giant reported a 6% increase in organic revenue during the quarter, boosted by higher prices on its drinks.</p>

          <p>Economists are questioning President Trump's promises of an economic revival, citing concerns that his policies on trade, immigration, and government spending are failing to spark economic growth and may re-ignite inflation. The economy is showing signs of slowing, and businesses are expressing concerns about the impact of tariffs. While Trump's supporters remain confident, others believe his administration is too focused on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. The White House defends its economic record, stating that Trump's policies are delivering economic relief for everyday Americans.</p>

          <p>Chinese and American observers have found rare common ground over the chaos radiating from Washington, amid Donald Trump’s renewed trade war with China and his destabilising foreign policy. At a Hong Kong event last week, several prominent China watchers from across the Pacific voiced concern over tariffs, the political upheaval in the United States, and the spectre of global instability as the US-led liberal world order unravels. Despite their stark differences over America’s perceived decline and China’s role in bilateral tensions, observers largely agreed that the US leader’s unpredictability and his “America first” doctrine have intensified superpower rivalry and recent global market turmoil.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the dangers of following generic fitness advice found online, highlighting the trend of "bro-ification" of wellness. This approach often prioritizes performance and strict routines over individual needs and body awareness. Experts caution against the black-and-white thinking promoted by social media algorithms, emphasizing that fitness is highly individual and dependent on various physical and lifestyle factors. The article also touches on how the demands of these routines can be particularly challenging for women, who often face different expectations and responsibilities than men.</p>

Speaking on Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, Mr Cox said he'd be happy to meet with the band "if that was part of a genuine journey that they were going on to think about how they can retain their radicalism while keeping very, very clear lines about the unacceptability about political anti-democratic violence and violence that's directed at civilians".</p>
