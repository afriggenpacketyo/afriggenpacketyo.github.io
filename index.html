          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in UnitedHealth, purchasing over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. This investment comes as a surprise given the insurer's recent challenges, including a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook, which had caused its stock to decline significantly. The move, potentially orchestrated by Buffett's investment lieutenants, aligns with his history of value investing in embattled companies and prompted a notable surge in UnitedHealth's stock price following the disclosure. The article also notes other smaller Berkshire investments and a reduction in its Apple and Bank of America stakes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leaders of the UK's Alan Turing Institute have acknowledged recent challenges for staff following a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission regarding "serious and escalating concerns." The complaint alleges the institute is at risk of collapse after the government mandated a new focus on national defense, threatening to withdraw funding otherwise. In response, management confirmed a pivot to defense as a priority but stated that some work on healthcare and environmental issues will continue. Despite assurances of transparency and accountability, whistleblowers have described the leadership's response as purely performative, citing a toxic internal culture and ongoing senior staff departures.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has rescinded local directives in Washington, D.C., that limited cooperation between the Metropolitan Police Department and federal immigration agents. This action effectively reverses the city's "sanctuary" policies, aligning with President Trump's broader anti-crime initiative that has placed the D.C. police under temporary federal control. The order allows local police to assist with arrests based on administrative immigration warrants and share information with agencies like ICE. However, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the city's Attorney General have contested the legality of Bondi's directive, instructing local police to continue following their existing orders.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's bioethanol industry is facing imminent collapse after the government decided against providing a rescue package to its two main producers, Vivergo Fuels and Ensus. The companies warned they would be forced to close following a new trade deal that allows tariff-free imports of US ethanol, rendering their operations commercially unviable. The government stated that providing direct funding would not offer value to the taxpayer or solve the industry's long-term issues. The closures threaten hundreds of direct jobs and thousands more in the supply chain, impacting UK wheat farmers and the national supply of commercial carbon dioxide.</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca has launched an at-home delivery service for its FluMist nasal spray flu vaccine, making it more convenient for eligible individuals to get vaccinated. Previously only available in clinical settings, the needle-free option can now be ordered online and shipped directly to consumers for self-administration by adults or caregiver administration for children ages 2-17. The move follows FDA approval for self-administration in September 2024. The company hopes this increased accessibility will help boost vaccination rates, especially after last year saw the highest number of pediatric flu-related deaths in a non-pandemic year since 2009.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, China's official military newspaper, the PLA Daily, published a commentary warning that the "spectre of militarism has never left the Japanese archipelago." The article accused right-wing forces in Japan of never abandoning ambitions to become a major military power again. It specifically criticized visits by Japanese officials to the Yasukuni Shrine, which China views as a symbol of past aggression. The commentary also highlighted Japan's expanding defense partnerships with the U.S., Australia, Britain, and NATO as evidence of its military buildup under the guise of international cooperation.</p>

The fires have forced infrastructure closures, and EU data indicates Spain accounts for about a quarter of all land burned in the bloc this year.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged the strategic timing of the offensive and rejected any ceasefire proposal that would require Ukraine to withdraw from the territory.

Opposition to D.C.'s autonomy and statehood has often been rooted in partisan politics and racist notions that its majority-Black population is incapable of self-governance.

Environmental groups criticized the outcome, blaming the influence of fossil fuel interests for stalling progress on what they describe as a critical global crisis.</p>

          <p>A Labour councillor, Ricky Jones, has been found not guilty of encouraging violent disorder after he made inflammatory comments at an anti-racism rally in Walthamstow last year. During the protest, Jones called far-right demonstrators "disgusting Nazi fascists" and gestured cutting his throat while saying "we need to get rid of them all." Jones, who has been suspended by the Labour Party, told the court his remarks were not intended to incite violence but were a reference to reports of razor blades being hidden behind far-right stickers. The jury deliberated for just over 30 minutes before delivering the not guilty verdict.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer appoint members of his party to the House of Lords. In a letter, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is a "democratic disparity," as parties with fewer votes and MPs have representation while Reform UK, with four MPs and significant local council presence, has none. Political appointments to the Lords are at the prime minister's discretion, and while opposition leaders are often invited to nominate peers, there is no constitutional requirement to do so. A Downing Street spokesperson indicated that decisions would follow established conventions.</p>

The judge highlighted the incident as an "unsatisfactory" failure, emphasizing that the court's ability to rely on the accuracy of submissions is fundamental to justice.

          <p>Women who served in the Kosovo Liberation Army during the 1998-99 war are struggling for recognition despite their official veteran status. While over 3,600 women receive benefits, they report being largely ignored by government institutions and the public, unlike their male counterparts. Veterans like Albina Haradinaj and Nerxhivane Azizi describe a persistent discrimination where their contributions in roles from combat to medical support are undervalued. Sociologists attribute this to a prevailing patriarchal mentality in Kosovo, which has hindered women's participation in post-war public life and perpetuated social and economic inequality for female veterans.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Census Bureau report reveals a significant decline in the number of young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving traditional milestones such as getting married, having children, working full-time, or living independently. Compared to 50 years ago, when nearly half of this age group had met these four benchmarks, less than a quarter have done so today. Researchers attribute this shift primarily to economic pressures, including the rising cost of college, substantial student loan debt, and high housing costs. These financial burdens are forcing many millennials and Gen Z members to delay family formation and homeownership until they achieve greater financial stability.</p>

          <p>A looming mid-decade redistricting battle between Republicans and Democrats is raising concerns about the integrity of U.S. elections. Following a Republican plan in Texas to draw maps favoring their party, California's governor has proposed a retaliatory gerrymander to benefit Democrats. Experts warn that such actions, especially outside the normal decennial cycle, make elections seem secondary to the political maneuvers of legislators, promoting cynicism among voters. While some Democrats argue for fighting fire with fire to counter GOP efforts, critics caution that this race to the bottom further reduces the number of competitive districts and fundamentally undermines democratic legitimacy.</p>

          <p>Investment firms for the world's wealthiest families have dramatically increased their exposure to private markets, with the number of family offices allocating to these assets growing over 500% since 2016. This surge, outpacing that of other institutional investors, is driven by the ability of family offices to make long-term, illiquid investments in areas like private credit and infrastructure. With less need for immediate cash, these firms are drawn to the stable growth potential of private markets compared to more volatile public equities. Recent surveys indicate a continued trend, with many planning to further increase their private debt and infrastructure holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to export certain advanced AI chips, like Nvidia's H20, to China, but with a new 15% tax on the proceeds. This decision reverses a previous block on the H20 chip and has drawn criticism, with some officials reportedly considering resignation and legal experts questioning the constitutionality of the export tax. The debate centers on whether providing these powerful, albeit restricted, chips to China undermines U.S. efforts to maintain a competitive edge in AI development. Proponents argue it prevents Chinese firms from exclusively turning to domestic alternatives like Huawei, while critics fear it accelerates China's AI capabilities.</p>

Experts suggest that homeowners with mortgage rates above 6% or 7% should consider refinancing, provided they plan to stay in their homes long enough to offset the closing costs. The trend is attributed to weakening economic data, which has pushed down the 10-year Treasury yields that mortgage rates typically follow. (not investment advice)</p>

Rowling defended her actions, accusing Sturgeon of a "shameless denial of reality" and causing "real, lasting harm" with her push for gender self-identification legislation.

This shift could radicalize voters and require a fundamental rethinking of the government's role in society.

Mayors from cities like Chicago and New York have pushed back, citing local data showing sharp decreases in crime and arguing that federal intervention would be destabilizing.
