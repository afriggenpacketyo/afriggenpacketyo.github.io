          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant decline following Iran's missile strike on the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, as there were no reported casualties, fostering optimism for de-escalation. U.S. crude oil futures fell by over 7%, closing at $68.51 per barrel, while Brent also decreased by a similar percentage to $71.28. The strike was in retaliation for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, but Qatar confirmed its air defenses intercepted the missiles, preventing any casualties. Energy Secretary Chris Wright credited President Donald Trump's foreign policy for fostering a safer, more stable Middle East. Optimism for de-escalation in the Middle East conflict drove the price decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has prohibited its staff from using Meta's WhatsApp messaging app due to concerns about data privacy and security. The Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) instructed staff to remove the app from government devices, citing a lack of transparency in WhatsApp's data practices. Meta has responded, disagreeing with the CAO's characterization and emphasizing WhatsApp's encrypted nature provides a higher level of security than many approved apps. Acceptable alternatives to WhatsApp include Microsoft Teams, Signal, and Apple's iMessage, as the House prioritizes protecting sensitive data from potential cybersecurity risks.

          <p>Novo Nordisk has ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health, ceasing Wegovy sales on the platform due to concerns over "deceptive marketing" practices and the sale of potentially counterfeit versions of the drug. The pharmaceutical company stated that Hims & Hers failed to adhere to laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs under the guise of personalization, posing a risk to patient safety. This decision came shortly after the companies announced a collaboration to improve obesity treatment accessibility, causing Hims & Hers shares to plummet by roughly 31%. Novo Nordisk will continue to offer Wegovy through other telehealth platforms committed to patient safety, following FDA restrictions on compounding pharmacies selling copycat weight-loss drugs. The company's investigation revealed that ingredients in knock-off drugs are manufactured by foreign suppliers, raising safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company is recalling over 197,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles from model years 2021-2025 due to a door latch issue that could potentially trap passengers inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) indicated that if the car's battery level is low, the door latches may remain locked, preventing occupants from exiting, particularly children. Ford is also recalling 120,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles in markets outside the U.S. The company plans to address the issue with a software update and is unaware of any injuries or accidents related to the faulty latches, as letters notifying owners of the safety risk will be sent out. This action follows another recall from the automaker last month regarding a software glitch with the rearview camera.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about the potential impact on the oil and gas industry, with experts speculating on the possibility of higher energy prices for consumers. While oil prices initially jumped, they later retreated as analysts believe Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for global oil supply. However, ongoing tensions could disrupt the energy market, potentially driving up prices for gasoline and other products. Experts suggest that Israeli strikes on Iran's oil facilities or attacks by Iranian proxy groups could further disrupt the flow of oil, pushing Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel. The conflict introduces uncertainty into the energy market.</p>

          <p>This Fox News article compares the Bush administration's approach to the Middle East during the War on Terror with President Trump's recent actions against Iran. It highlights the shift from regime change and ground wars to a strategy focused on decisive force to prevent Iranian nuclear proliferation. Steve Yates, a former Bush administration advisor, notes the world has changed significantly in 20 years, with China's rise and a shift away from globalism influencing Trump's approach. Trump's strategy emphasizes allies taking on more responsibility and using American force only when necessary to achieve specific objectives. The article suggests Trump's approach is more targeted and less focused on long-term occupation or remaking Iran.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Summer 2025 presents homeowners with opportunities to leverage their home equity for various expenses, but it is important to do so strategically to avoid financial risks. Homeowners should understand the differences between a home equity loan and a HELOC, as loans offer a lump sum with fixed interest rates while HELOCs provide a revolving line of credit with variable rates. Shopping around for the best rates and terms is crucial, especially with potential rate cuts on the horizon. It's recommended to use home equity for financially sound purposes, such as paying off high-interest debt, rather than discretionary spending like vacations. Prudent use of home equity can improve long-term financial health.</p>

          <p>Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton sustained a torn Achilles tendon during Game 7 of the NBA Finals, potentially sidelining him for the upcoming season. The injury occurred in the first quarter, significantly impacting the Pacers' performance as they lost to Oklahoma City. Recovery time for this type of injury typically ranges from eight to ten months, casting doubt on Haliburton's availability for the next season. Other NBA stars, including Damian Lillard and Jayson Tatum, are also currently recovering from torn Achilles tendons. The injury is a significant blow to the Pacers.</p>

          <p>The Royal Air Force (RAF) has evacuated 63 British nationals and their dependents from Israel as the country continues to exchange fire with Iran. A British national was injured in Israel during an Iranian missile attack, according to Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Lammy reiterated his plea to Iran to return to negotiations following the U.S. strike on its nuclear program. The evacuation flight departed from Tel Aviv, transporting vulnerable Britons to Cyprus before their final destination in the UK. The UK government is urging British nationals still in Israel to register their presence, with further flights planned based on demand and the security situation.</p>

Mamdani's campaign is built on clear messaging, focusing on economic issues such as affordable housing, free childcare, and improved public transportation. The campaign's success is also attributed to its effective use of social media and a strong grassroots movement, demonstrating the potential for left-wing candidates to challenge establishment figures.

          <p>Jim Cramer suggests that Wall Street's positive response to the U.S. bombings in Iran indicates that the Middle Eastern state is not as influential on the stock market as it once was.

Cramer noted that the global energy market's transformation, with increased U.S. oil production, has contributed to this measured reaction.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran announced missile attacks against U.S. bases in the Middle East, specifically targeting the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Potential retaliation targets include U.S. military assets across the Middle East, the Strait of Hormuz, and asymmetric warfare tactics such as terror and cyber attacks. The U.S. operates numerous military bases in the region, including the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and Naval Support Activity Bahrain, housing thousands of service members. Experts suggest that Iran's short-range ballistic missiles make American military installations in the Gulf vulnerable, while the U.S. has naval assets and significant military presence in the region.

He faces up to 15 years in federal prison and a maximum fine of $250,000 if convicted. Millar was previously subject to a 2023 emergency conservatorship order in Rutherford County, Tennessee, which prohibited him from possessing firearms after finding he was "at risk of substantial harm to his health, safety, and welfare." Millar spat at protesters, yelled at them, and brandished a Sig Sauer 9mm pistol before being apprehended by Metropolitan Nashville Police Department officers, the DOJ said. Just three days after being released on bond, Millar was arrested again when Murfreesboro Police Department officers discovered another loaded 9mm firearm in his waistband, authorities said.</p>
