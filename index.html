          <p>Bitcoin's price has rebounded, surpassing $90,000 for the first time since March, as investors seek alternative assets amid stock market volatility and a weakening U.S. dollar. The cryptocurrency's recent gains coincide with increased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell from President Trump, who is advocating for immediate rate cuts. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin have seen significant inflows, indicating renewed investor interest, while bitcoin's correlation with equities has decreased, suggesting it's decoupling from risk assets. However, analysts note that low trading volumes may limit bitcoin's ability to break through resistance levels without a major catalyst. (not investment advice)</p>
