          <h2>Sam Mendes to Direct Four Beatles Biopics Featuring Rising Stars</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Sam Mendes is set to direct four biopics, each focusing on an individual member of The Beatles, with Paul Mescal, Harris Dickinson, Barry Keoghan, and Joseph Quinn cast as the Fab Four. The films, slated for release in 2028, aim to capture the distinct identities and histories of each member, offering a deeper understanding of their lives and intersecting stories. Sony executives hope this "bingeable theatrical experience" will draw younger audiences, leveraging the cast's popularity and social media engagement. The project marks the first time all four band members and their estates have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza has reportedly killed at least 31 Palestinians, including children, prompting condemnation from Hamas, who called it a "heinous massacre". The Israeli military claims the strike targeted a Hamas command and control center, while providing no immediate evidence to back up the claim. The attack occurred amidst escalating military actions and evacuation orders in northern Gaza, leading to further displacement of residents. This incident is part of a broader conflict that has resulted in a high number of Palestinian casualties, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>Nineteen states, including Michigan, have filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order on elections, arguing it unconstitutionally infringes on states' authority to manage their own elections. The lawsuit targets requirements for documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and mandates that all mail ballots be received by Election Day. State attorneys general assert that the President lacks the power to dictate state voting laws, many of which are enshrined in state constitutions. The order has drawn criticism for potentially disenfranchising voters and praise from some Republican officials who believe it could curb voter fraud.</p>

          <p>With tariffs expected to increase prices for everyday items, U.S. consumers are engaging in a shopping spree to buy goods before the price hikes take effect. While stocking up on some items now may make sense, experts caution consumers to buy only what they can afford and not go into debt to get ahead of the "tariff effect." Experts also don't anticipate any shortages, and they believe that the supply chain is in much better shape than it was during the pandemic. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>Experts are questioning President Trump's tariff formula, arguing that it misrepresents global trade economics. Trump claims the tariffs are "reciprocal," but the calculations, based on dividing the trade deficit by the value of imports, don't align with standard economic principles. Economists argue that trade deficits are influenced by financial markets, not solely import demand, and that the tariffs are unlikely to achieve the administration's goals. They warn that such policies could lead to trade wars, which historically have not benefited any of the parties involved. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>The K-beauty industry is facing uncertainty due to President Trump's new tariffs, which include a 25% hike on goods imported from South Korea. Beauty enthusiasts are rushing to stock up on their favorite products before prices increase, and the tariffs will test the strength of the K-beauty brand in the American market. While some major K-beauty manufacturers have opened factories in the United States to avoid the tariffs, others may wait to see how the market responds before relocating. The tariffs could also lead to changes in formulations, as brands may need to use FDA-approved ingredients for the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is temporarily halting shipments of its UK-made cars to the US to assess the impact of President Trump's new tariffs. The 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks took effect on April 3, prompting JLR to enact short-term actions while developing longer-term plans. The pause in shipments raises concerns about the impact of tariffs on Britain's car industry, which employs about 200,000 people in manufacturing.

Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic discussed what tanking financial markets could mean for the president’s administration. Adjustments to trade policy could be one way to address this, but Trump’s tariffs are "shambolic, they’re extremely high," and “no one knows whether he’s going to take them back the next day,” Leonhardt continued. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>The bankruptcy of 23andMe, a genetics-led consumer healthcare company, has raised concerns about the potential exploitation of its 15 million users' genetic data. As the company seeks to sell its assets, including this genetic information, there is a risk that it could fall into the hands of marketers, scammers, or even authoritarians. Genetic data is permanent, unique, and immutable, making it a valuable asset for various entities, including health insurance companies and pharmaceutical giants. Experts advise users to delete their data and revoke permission for its use to protect their privacy. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive desire to acquire Greenland is raising legal and military concerns. Experts argue that his actions likely contravene American and international law, undermining the peace and stability of an allied nation. If the U.S. military is given direct orders to seize Greenland, it would be an illegal act, violating treaty obligations and international prohibitions against unprovoked wars of aggression. Senior commanders would have a moral obligation to refuse such a command, potentially leading to a civil-military crisis.&#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>The son of a British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who have been detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nine weeks, is appealing to the US for assistance in securing their release. The couple, who have lived in Afghanistan for 18 years and ran education projects, were arrested on February 1. Their son, a US citizen, is calling on President Trump to intervene, particularly after the release of an American citizen who was detained alongside them. The Reynolds have not been formally charged with any crime, and their son believes their detention is a mistake.</p>

This marks the first public disclosure of China's land-based early warning radar capabilities and signals Beijing's growing confidence in its military technology.</p>

          <p>Inactive investors who adopt a "buy and hold" strategy, often referred to as "dead" investors, tend to outperform active traders. Active trading incurs higher costs and taxes and is often driven by emotional decision-making. Human behavior is the biggest threat to investor returns, as impulsive selling during downturns and buying during peaks lead to losses. A buy-and-hold strategy, while not entirely passive, generally yields better results for the average investor. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs, initially expected to be a manageable problem, have triggered economic and market mayhem. The plan to impose 10% tariffs on every U.S. trading partner, with individualized rates for 60 other countries, has been met with retaliation from China and potential countermeasures from the European Union. Economists are aghast at the rudimentary math behind the tariffs, and markets have responded by selling everything except bonds. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the tariffs would dent growth and boost inflation, further unsettling investors. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

She has also been asked to compile a list of State Department employees who are not MAGA loyalists. Loomer's power demonstrates how much further to the right Trump has moved since his first term, and how much further he may be open to going.</p>
