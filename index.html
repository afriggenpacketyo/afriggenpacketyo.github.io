          <p>Alaska Airlines temporarily grounded all its flights nationwide due to a significant IT outage, causing widespread operational disruptions. The airline confirmed an "IT outage affecting operations" and issued a temporary ground stop, though details on the outage's nature or duration remain unclear. This incident, impacting one of the largest U.S. carriers, follows recent air travel stresses linked to a government shutdown and air traffic controller shortages. The Federal Aviation Administration often issues such ground stops at airline requests, affecting 140 destinations globally.</p>

          <p>Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier were arrested in connection with two federal gambling probes, one involving Mafia crime families. Authorities allege high-tech cheating, including X-ray tables and tampered shuffling machines, was used to rig poker games, defrauding victims of millions. Both Billups and Rozier, along with former NBA player Damon Jones, have been placed on immediate leave by the NBA, which is cooperating with the ongoing investigations.

          <p>Mark Killick, a notorious UK 'cowboy builder' with fraud convictions dating back to 1995, defrauded 37 victims of over £1.25 million. He exploited loopholes, including legally changing his name twice, to continue operating in the building trade despite a lengthy criminal record. This case highlights systemic failures in regulating the construction industry and the absence of a central register for convicted fraudsters. Calls are growing for tighter rules to protect vulnerable homeowners, as many victims were misled by fake online reviews and professional websites.</p>

DHS confirmed Singh is an Indian national who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022, though federal authorities had approved his Employment Authorization Documents, allowing him a federal REAL ID. This incident fuels a broader debate on commercial driver's license eligibility for undocumented immigrants, with Florida suing California and Washington for allegedly failing to comply with federal safety and immigration requirements.

          <p>Anthony Boyd, convicted of a 1995 murder, was executed in Alabama using nitrogen gas, a method his defense lawyers argued constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The US Supreme Court denied Boyd's petition for a stay, despite dissenting opinions highlighting the method's potential for prolonged suffering. This marks Alabama's third execution by nitrogen, a procedure that has previously resulted in prisoners writhing and convulsing, raising significant concerns about its humaneness. Boyd maintained his innocence until his death, stating he did not participate in the killing.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Rinderknecht, accused of igniting the deadly Palisades fire that burned 23,400 acres and killed twelve people, pleaded not guilty in a Los Angeles federal courtroom. Prosecutors allege Rinderknecht maliciously started the Lachman fire, which later flared into the Palisades blaze, citing witness statements, phone data, and an AI-generated image of a burning city found on his iPhone. His attorney, Steve Haney, called the charges a "scapegoat" effort and asserted his client did not start the initial fire. Rinderknecht remains in custody with a jury trial set for December.</p>

Critics question the transparency and timing of the project, especially amidst an ongoing government shutdown that has affected federal agencies.

          <p>A cross-party committee of MPs has warned that planned airport expansions, which would lead to hundreds of thousands of additional flights, could undermine the UK government's net zero climate goals. The Environmental Audit Committee stated that the government has not demonstrated how the negative climate impact would be offset by economic growth. While the Department for Transport maintains that expansion will only proceed if it aligns with climate obligations, the committee noted the lack of commercially viable technological solutions for aviation decarbonization. Critics argue the government lacks evidence for the economic benefits and risks environmental commitments.</p>
