          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order seeks to prohibit federal agents from wearing masks, require them to display identification, and prevent the Chicago Police Department from being deputized for federal actions. This move, largely symbolic, is a direct response to the Trump administration's threats to send military or federal forces into the city, which the mayor's office has called an unconstitutional overreach.</p>

For decades, he meticulously documented the daily activities of U.S. presidents, from travel and speeches to vetoes and pardons, creating an invaluable public record. Colleagues remembered him not only for his encyclopedic knowledge and work ethic but also for his generosity in sharing his detailed statistics with fellow journalists, historians, and even White House aides.</p>

          <p>A family of showpeople who have lived on a yard in Govan, Glasgow, for over 40 years is facing an eviction case in Scotland's highest court. The Stringfellow family is being forced to vacate the land to make way for a major waterfront regeneration project by the Glasgow City Council. Their legal team is arguing that the eviction would breach the rights of a five-year-old child living on the site, marking a key test of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child since its incorporation into Scots law.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant shift in drinking habits, with traditional beer sales falling to their lowest level in over 30 years while non-alcoholic beer sales have more than doubled since 2013. According to the federal statistics office, beer sales dropped by 6.3% in the first half of 2025, reflecting a growing trend among younger Germans who are more health-conscious. Breweries are adapting by promoting alcohol-free options at sporting events as natural alternatives to energy drinks, though traditional beer remains a cultural staple. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A decade after the acrimonious split between creator Hideo Kojima and publisher Konami, the iconic Metal Gear Solid series is returning with a remake of its third installment. The original series was lauded for its cinematic storytelling and pioneering gameplay, but the franchise has been dormant since Kojima's departure in 2015, which was reportedly due to spiraling development costs. The remake, titled "Metal Gear Solid Delta," capitalizes on the lucrative trend of modernizing classic games and has been praised by fans for its faithful recreation of the original's story and atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers and their instructors across the UK are facing a rising tide of abuse, including tailgating, aggressive horn-honking, and even physical assault. Instructors report that such incidents are a near-daily occurrence, prompting many to install dashcams to capture evidence of inconsiderate driving, which is a punishable offense. Police officials confirm that impatience towards learners is growing and that they have the authority to issue warnings or even impound vehicles for repeat offenses, urging other drivers to show more empathy and patience on the roads.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new dating reality show, "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," which combines elements of survival and romance by pairing couples who are then isolated on a remote tropical island. Hosted by Davina McCall, the show tests whether love can blossom under harsh conditions, stripping away the superficial aspects of modern dating. Contestants, who are generally older than those on similar shows like "Love Island," praised the format's authenticity and its focus on building a genuine connection through shared adversity rather than pursuing influencer status.</p>

          <p>The planned loan of the nearly 1,000-year-old Bayeux Tapestry to the British Museum has sparked fierce opposition within the French art community. Experts fear the 70-meter-long embroidered cloth, which depicts the Norman conquest of England, is too fragile to withstand transportation across the English Channel and could suffer irreparable damage. Despite a petition with 60,000 signatures describing the move as a "cultural crime," the loan was announced by President Macron as an act of cultural diplomacy and is scheduled to begin next September.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are using an innovative combination of technology and nature to fight the invasive spruce bark beetle, which poses a multi-billion pound threat to the nation's forests. After discovering that the beetles were being carried by wind from continental Europe, where they have destroyed millions of trees, authorities deployed drones for aerial surveillance, sniffer dogs to detect beetle pheromones, and AI-powered cameras on traps. This comprehensive strategy has successfully eradicated the pest from controlled at-risk areas in England, though climate change could increase future threats.</p>

          <p>This article explores the idea that remembering the shared history of Sino-American cooperation during World War II could offer a foundation for improving today's strained bilateral ties. It highlights the forgotten stories of collaboration, such as the American airmen who were protected by Chinese villagers after the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, the piece suggests that focusing on this historical alliance against a common enemy could provide a positive narrative to help bridge current diplomatic divides from the ground up.</p>

          <p>A 45-year-old former soldier, Michael Paul Brown, is facing four counts of murder for allegedly shooting and killing a bartender and three patrons at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana. After the shooting, Brown evaded a massive week-long manhunt involving hundreds of law enforcement officers in the nearby mountains before being captured. Authorities have not released a motive for the killings, but relatives and local residents have indicated that Brown has a history of mental illness. He is currently being held on $2 million bail.</p>

          <p>Latvian tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has issued an apology for telling her opponent, American Taylor Townsend, that she had "no education" following their second-round match at the US Open. In an Instagram post, Ostapenko explained that English is not her first language and she was attempting to comment on what she perceived as poor tennis etiquette, not Townsend's intelligence. The initial confrontation, which occurred at the net, stemmed from Ostapenko's frustration over a net cord and drew criticism from other players and fans.</p>

          <p>The Irish government has formally expressed its concern to German authorities after a video showed Berlin police striking a 25-year-old Irish woman, Kitty O'Brien, during a protest. The demonstration was against the killing of journalists in Gaza. O'Brien was seen being hit in the face and later required surgery for a broken arm, according to an activist group. While Berlin police claim officers were compelled to use force after O'Brien resisted orders and was verbally abusive, the incident has sparked protests at the German Embassy in Dublin.</p>

          <p>A proposal to silence the 150-year-old town clock in Machynlleth, Wales, during overnight hours has been rejected by the town council. The request came from the owner of a nearby hotel, who cited regular complaints from guests about the clock chiming every fifteen minutes. However, councillors argued that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character and decided against the change. The hotel owner expressed disappointment with the decision and is considering gathering more opinions from local businesses and residents for a future proposal.</p>

          <p>A new investigation has implicated famed Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," in the 1967 murder of his wife, Pauline. For decades, her death was believed to be the result of an ambush intended for him. However, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found inconsistencies in Pusser's statements and new forensic evidence suggesting the crime scene was staged and that a gunshot wound he sustained was likely self-inflicted. If Pusser, who died in 1974, were alive today, prosecutors believe there would be enough evidence to indict him for murder.</p>

The article highlights a growing sentiment that the constant scrutiny and marginal offside rulings are detracting from the enjoyment of the game, with some calling for former players to be involved in the VAR process.</p>
