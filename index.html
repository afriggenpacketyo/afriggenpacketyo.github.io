          <p>A Russian drone struck a civilian bus in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of nine people and injuries to seven others, according to Ukrainian officials. President Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a deliberate killing of civilians, emphasizing that the Russians could not have been unaware of the vehicle's nature. This incident occurred shortly after unsuccessful peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Istanbul, where a prisoner swap agreement was reached but key conditions for a ceasefire remained unresolved. The attack underscores the ongoing violence and challenges in achieving a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as Zelenskyy continues to seek international support and sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Maureen Dowd pens an opinion piece reflecting on the tragic decline of Joe Biden, highlighting his loss of political acumen and empathy, exacerbated by personal and professional stresses. The article suggests Biden's hubris and detachment from reality, fueled by a close circle of aides, led to his downfall, culminating in a disastrous debate performance. Dowd criticizes the selective truth presented by Biden's team, likening it to Trump's "alternative facts," and laments the Democrats' delayed acknowledgment of Biden's decline. The piece paints a portrait of a leader clinging to power, ultimately harming his party and legacy.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced it is mobilizing forces to expand its ground campaign in Gaza, aiming to seize more territory and displace additional civilians. This escalation follows intense airstrikes on Gaza, resulting in numerous casualties and prompting some residents to flee. Despite ongoing efforts by mediators to broker a truce, Prime Minister Netanyahu has vowed to intensify military operations to force Hamas to surrender and release hostages. The conflict has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with the UN warning of a growing risk of famine due to an Israeli blockade on aid.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board expresses support for Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, as he confronts the rising popularity of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD, known for its extreme views and ties to Russia, poses a significant threat to German democracy, having gained alarming support in recent elections. Merz faces the daunting task of leading a broad coalition government and addressing critical issues like migration and economic stagnation, which have fueled the AfD's appeal. The editorial emphasizes the importance of Merz's success in demonstrating the ability of mainstream parties to counter extremism and deliver tangible results for German voters.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration intensifies efforts to collect on student loans, borrowers are urged to understand the difference between delinquency and default to avoid severe consequences such as wage garnishments. Delinquent borrowers should contact their loan servicer to request forbearance and enroll in affordable repayment plans, including income-driven repayment options. Borrowers in default can contact the government's Default Resolution Group to explore options like loan rehabilitation. With millions at risk of default, proactive measures are crucial to protect borrowers' credit scores and financial stability.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously overturned a federal appeals court ruling in *Barnes v. Felix*, a case involving police violence, criticizing the lower court's narrow focus on the moment of the threat rather than considering the totality of the circumstances. The case involves an officer who shot and killed a driver after jumping onto a moving vehicle. The Supreme Court's decision emphasizes that courts must consider the events leading up to a shooting to determine whether the use of force was justified from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, but the Supreme Court did not ultimately decide the case itself.</p>

          <p>Hollywood is experiencing a decline in film and TV production due to increasing global competition and financial incentives offered by other countries and states. Production has not rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023 strikes, leading to intensified competition for fewer projects. States like New York and New Jersey are increasing their production incentives to attract business, while California struggles to update its existing tax credit program. The situation is dire, with concerns that California could lose its status as the entertainment production capital if measures are not taken to improve incentives and support the industry.</p>

          <p>US cancer researchers are exploring the potential of fecal waste to uncover new ways to treat cancer patients, with the Mayo Clinic leading an effort to personalize medicine by understanding how the microbiome affects responses to cancer medications. The Mayo Clinic's biobank of stool samples is part of a broader scientific effort to understand how the gut microbiome may mediate cancer treatment outcomes. While the scientific community is under attack by the Trump administration, researchers are hopeful that their work will yield promising results.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing new fees on immigrants seeking to remain in the United States to fund President Trumpâ€™s immigration crackdown. These fees, which do not exist under current law, would be levied on asylum seekers, those caring for minors in government custody, and applicants for humanitarian parole. Critics argue these fees will create financial barriers for vulnerable immigrants and force them into exploitative work or leave the country. The bill is a top priority for Republicans, but its pathway to enactment is uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has faced setbacks in its efforts to deport international students over their pro-Palestinian speech, with federal judges ordering the release of several detainees. The administration is seeking to deport these students, claiming their presence harms U.S. foreign policy, sparking criticism of political repression on campuses. While legal challenges continue, the releases suggest the courts are skeptical of the government's authority to detain noncitizens for their political views, despite the chilling effect on free speech.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Original Sin," by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, portrays President Biden as experiencing cognitive decline, which was allegedly covered up by his inner circle. The book describes Biden's diminished capacities and a conspiracy to conceal his condition from the public and top Democrats. It also highlights instances of Biden's incoherence and the measures taken by his staff to protect him. The book suggests that the decision to run for reelection was the original sin, followed by efforts to hide his cognitive decline, ultimately gaslighting the American people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decline in German tourism to the United States is attributed to fears of harassment and detention by immigration authorities, spurred by reports of Germans facing scrutiny at the border. The drop in German visitors, particularly to California, has led to lowered tourism forecasts and reduced airfares. The German government issued a travel advisory, warning of potential issues at U.S. border controls. The trend reflects a shift from political protest to fear, as Germans, typically avid travelers, opt for destinations perceived as safer and less prone to unpredictable treatment.</p>

          <p>With the NBA draft approaching, a columnist argues that the Los Angeles Lakers should prioritize drafting a mature, experienced player who can handle the temptations of money and fame. The columnist points to economic shifts in the league, such as capped rookie contracts and the NCAA's NIL policy, which have changed the landscape for young players. The piece suggests that the Lakers should focus on drafting a 24-year-old college graduate with NIL money in the bank and a good head on his shoulders, rather than solely focusing on raw talent and potential.</p>
