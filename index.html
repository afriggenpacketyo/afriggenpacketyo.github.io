          <p>The UK government faces difficulties in passing an emergency law to overturn new sentencing guidelines before the Easter recess.  These guidelines, advising judges to consider the ethnic and other backgrounds of offenders, have sparked controversy, with critics claiming they create a two-tiered justice system. The government's efforts to swiftly pass legislation are hindered by parliamentary timelines and potential House of Lords opposition.</p>
