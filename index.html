            <h2>China Vows Retaliation Amid Escalating Tariff Threats from the U.S.</h2>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has strongly condemned U.S. President Trump's threat to impose an additional 50% tariff on U.S. imports from China, vowing to take countermeasures to protect its interests. This response follows Trump's warning that he would escalate tariffs if Beijing did not withdraw its 34% tariff on American products. The broadened tariff scope reflects Chinese leadership's diminished hopes for a trade deal with the U.S., and Beijing might resort to further retaliatory measures, such as stopping purchases of U.S. agricultural goods.

            <p>A CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concern over President Trump's sweeping tariffs, with 69% expecting a recession, the majority of which anticipate it hitting this year. Many CEOs expressed concerns ranging from sector-specific issues driving up costs to fears of boycotts against American brands and overall uncertainty. A little over one-third of CEO respondents (37%) said they do expect to cut jobs this year, with another 14% saying they have not made that decision, but it remains a consideration. Almost all CEOs whose companies sell goods and services said price hikes are coming, anywhere from 5% to 20%, and the vast majority (82%) expect "resurgent inflation." (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Global stock markets experienced significant volatility following President Trump's tariff rollout, with the president threatening additional tariffs on China unless it rescinds its retaliatory measures. The EU has said it offered the US a “zero-for-zero” tariff deal on cars and industrial goods weeks before Donald Trump launched his trade war, but that it would not wait to defend itself. Trump has defended his policies, stating that "sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something". The Supreme Court has allowed Trump to continue using a 1798 law to deport alleged gang members to Venezuela, however it will apply certain limits.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump can continue using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, but with the stipulation that deportees must be given a chance to challenge their removal. This decision vacates an earlier ruling that temporarily blocked the deportations. While the administration claims this as a win, the justices mandated that deportees must be given a chance to challenge their removal. Rights groups and some legal experts have called the invocation of the Act unprecedented, arguing it has only previously been used after the US officially declared a war.</p>

            <p>Numerous colleges and universities across the United States, including Harvard, UCLA, and Stanford, are reporting that their international students have had their visas revoked. These revocations are attributed to the Trump administration's crackdown on alleged violations of visa or green card conditions, ranging from minor legal infractions to participation in demonstrations. Since the beginning of Trump's second term, the State Department has revoked over 300 student visas nationwide. The reasons for the revocations are sometimes unknown or not provided by the administration, causing concern among higher education institutions.</p>

            <p>China’s top diplomat Wang Yi declared a milestone last month when announcing the completion of the third reading of the long-awaited Code of Conduct (COC) , adding to hopes that Malaysia’s Asean chairmanship this year could speed up the protracted negotiations ahead of a 2026 deadline. However, observers caution that diplomatic talk aside, there appears to have been few actual gains on contentious sticking points, with core disputes lingering over enforcement mechanisms, geographic scope, legal status and the role of external powers.</p>

            <p>Severe storms and relentless rain have resulted in at least 22 deaths across multiple states in the Midwestern and southern parts of the U.S. The fierce weather has caused rivers to swell, leading to major flooding and prompting evacuations in several cities. The National Weather Service warned that dozens of locations would reach "major flood stage" even as the rain slows down. The storms have left millions under flood watches and caused significant damage to infrastructure and homes.</p>

            <p>U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO's military committee, was fired over the weekend by the Trump administration. Although no reason was given, officials said it was apparently tied to comments she has made that supported diversity in the force. Trump and Hegseth have been vocal in their insistence that so-called woke policies are dead. There has been a vigorous campaign to remove leaders who promoted diversity, equity and inclusion, and to erase DEI programs and online content.</p>

Some nations are attempting to negotiate with the U.S. to avoid devastating consequences, while China is retaliating with its own tariffs. Trump's approach has been criticized by some allies in Congress and on Wall Street, who question whether he is going too far. The situation remains uncertain as Trump appears determined to restructure the global economy to favor the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration may use a wartime law to deport alleged members of a foreign crime gang, but only if they are given the right to challenge the government’s claim. By a 5-4 vote, the court set aside the orders of judges in Washington who said the Trump administration had overstepped its power. The court majority said a group of alleged Venezuelan gang members facing deportation to El Salvador may appeal, but only before a federal judge in Texas, where they are held.</p>
