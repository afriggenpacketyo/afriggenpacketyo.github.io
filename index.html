          <p>During a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, President Trump publicly dressed him down, asserting that white South Africans were being killed and their land seized, claims which are part of a fringe conspiracy theory. Trump presented news articles and a video to support his assertions, despite Ramaphosa's attempts to correct the record by stating that all South Africans, especially Black people, are victims of crime. Trump's actions demonstrate his views on race, portraying white people as victims and minorities as unfairly advantaged. This incident reflects Trump's ongoing efforts to purge anything he deems "woke" or promoting diversity.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have released a comprehensive bill that aims to advance much of President Trump's domestic agenda, including extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, and increasing the child tax credit. The bill also proposes changes to Medicaid, including work requirements for childless adults, and reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Additionally, the legislation seeks to lift the nation's debt ceiling by $4 trillion, which would allow the government to pay for programs already authorized by Congress. Democrats are expected to oppose the bill, making its passage in the Senate uncertain.</p>

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining traction as a "sell U.S." narrative emerges, fueled by Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America has touted emerging markets as "the next bull market," citing a weaker U.S. dollar, peak U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan has also upgraded emerging market equities, pointing to easing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. A decline in confidence in U.S. assets has further bolstered the outlook for emerging markets, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index outperforming the S&P 500 year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge ordered the government to retain custody of the would-be deportees and provide them with "reasonable fear" interviews.

The groups are seeking an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities, demanding sanctions for the "illegal" practices.

Despite attempts by successive governments to address public concerns, worries persist, and the Labour government is the latest to try to reduce migration.

          <p>Ford Motor Co. has filed a lawsuit against multiple Southern California law firms and attorneys, alleging a fraud scheme to collect at least $100 million in "phantom legal fees" under the state's Lemon Law. Ford claims the lawyers violated the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act by inflating billing hours and reporting impossible work schedules. The lawsuit alleges that Steve B. Mikhov and Knight Law Group orchestrated the scheme, with attorneys named in the lawsuit taking advantage of a statute designed to protect consumers from faulty products.</p>

          <p>The Senate is poised to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board claims the state has never had a waiver revoked and will sue if Congress proceeds. Sixteen additional states and D.C. have adopted California's vehicle standards.</p>
