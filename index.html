          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned six key leaders and affiliates of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, including its head, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores. This action aims to disrupt the gang's expanding criminal operations, which include human trafficking, extortion, and murder across the Western Hemisphere. The sanctions block all U.S.-based assets and transactions involving these individuals, reinforcing the administration's commitment to dismantling the organization. The State Department has also offered rewards for information leading to the arrest of the top leaders.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump underwent vascular testing due to mild swelling in his lower legs. According to the press secretary, the comprehensive examination revealed chronic venous insufficiency, which was described as a benign and common condition for his age. All test results, including an echocardiogram, were within normal limits, and there was no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis. The administration stated that the president remains in excellent health and attributed minor bruising on his hand to frequent handshaking.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that 23% of Americans over the age of 50 are delaying their retirement, a significant increase from 14% in the previous year. The primary drivers for this trend are financial uncertainty, economic volatility, and persistent concerns about inflation and potential recessions. Many respondents expressed worry about not having saved enough, with another study noting the median savings for a 55-year-old is just $50,000. This financial anxiety is forcing many older workers to remain in the workforce longer than they had originally planned.</p>

          <p>Following a presidential directive, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum visited Alcatraz to assess the feasibility of reopening the notorious prison. The visit is a step toward fulfilling President Trump's order to rebuild and operationalize the facility, which has been closed for over 60 years. The administration frames the move as a symbol of its commitment to law and order. However, the plan has drawn criticism from opponents who view it as a costly and impractical use of resources.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian parliament has approved Yulia Svyrydenko as the new prime minister, replacing Denys Shmyhal, who held the position for over five years.

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic legislators have introduced a bill aimed at making corporate price gouging illegal, citing concerns that companies are using President Trump's tariffs as a cover to excessively raise prices. The proposed legislation would empower the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to litigate against abusive pricing practices by large corporations. The bill would also mandate increased transparency in pricing for companies with over $100 million in revenue. The move comes as inflation shows signs of resurgence and companies increasingly cite tariffs for price hikes.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to lower the voting age to 16 has sparked a debate about its potential political consequences. While polls suggest younger voters lean left, favoring parties like Labour and the Greens, experts caution that the actual impact on a general election may be negligible. Sixteen and 17-year-olds represent a small fraction of the electorate, and their turnout is uncertain. Furthermore, with the political landscape fracturing, their votes could be split among various parties, ultimately having a minimal effect on the overall outcome, though it could be decisive in tightly contested constituencies.</p>

This stance mirrors the remarks that led to her previous year-long suspension in 2023. The move means she will now sit as an independent MP, and it underscores the ongoing tensions within the party regarding antisemitism and definitions of racism.</p>

While many prices remained stable, the hikes on certain imported goods align with warnings from retailers that they cannot absorb the full cost of the duties.

Potential financial losses can occur through several avenues, including high surrender charges for early withdrawals, which can erode returns. Variable annuities carry market risk, meaning their value can decrease if underlying investments perform poorly. Furthermore, the fixed payments from some annuities can lose purchasing power over time due to inflation, and there is a remote risk of insurer insolvency, making the provider's financial strength a critical factor.

          <p>Kenyan marathon world record holder Ruth Chepngetich has been provisionally suspended on suspicion of doping, according to the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU). The 30-year-old, who set a stunning world record in Chicago last year, tested positive for a banned diuretic in March. The substance is prohibited as it can be used to mask other performance-enhancing drugs. Chepngetich opted for a voluntary suspension in April while the investigation was ongoing, and she has the right to have her case heard by a disciplinary tribunal.</p>

The company, which uses AI and robotics to automate factories for machine parts, plans to use the capital to build a large new factory in Arizona and expand its California operations. Hadrian aims to disrupt the traditional defense contracting industry by supercharging American workers with technology, which it claims can make them ten times more productive.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has recommended a sentence of only one day in jail for Brett Hankison, the former police officer convicted of civil rights abuse during the raid that killed Breonna Taylor. Hankison was found guilty of firing blindly into Taylor's apartment, endangering her neighbors. In its sentencing memo, the DOJ argued that a prison sentence is not necessary for punishment or deterrence because Hankison did not hit anyone and will never serve as a police officer again. The recommendation has been met with criticism as being excessively lenient.</p>

While their chemical compositions are slightly different, with corn syrup having a higher fructose content, experts state that both have similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess. Some research suggests high-fructose corn syrup may be linked to higher levels of inflammation. Ultimately, dietitians emphasize that both are empty-calorie added sugars, and the key to good health is to limit the consumption of both.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent repeal of many green-energy subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act is a positive development for the economy. The author contends that such subsidies distort the tax code, misallocate capital, and favor established companies over new innovators, leading to cronyism rather than true energy abundance. While acknowledging that some fossil-fuel subsidies also exist and should be eliminated, the piece asserts that green-energy subsidies are vastly larger in scale. The partial rollback is presented as a significant victory against special-interest politics.</p>
