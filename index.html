          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted sex trafficker, met with the U.S. Deputy Attorney General for approximately nine hours after being granted a limited form of immunity. This protection, known as proffer immunity, allowed her to answer questions without her statements being used against her, a common step when prosecutors seek cooperation. The meetings occurred while Maxwell is appealing her 20-year prison sentence, and President Trump has stated he is not currently considering a pardon for her, though her lawyer expressed hope that he might. Victim advocates have expressed disappointment that the interviews are happening behind closed doors.</p>

          <p>A dedicated conservation effort is underway in Texas to save the state's desert bighorn sheep population, which has been reduced by 50% due to disease. Wildlife biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last remaining disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range. This relocation aims to establish a new, protected breeding population. Recent observations have confirmed the presence of newborn lambs, signaling that the herd is beginning to grow again in its new home.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is releasing approximately $6.8 billion in federal funding for K-12 education programs that had been previously frozen. The decision to withhold the congressionally approved funds had drawn a lawsuit from over 20 Democratic attorneys general and criticism from bipartisan governors. The Department of Education stated that the Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the funds, which support programs for low-income students and teacher training, and would begin dispersing them to states the following week.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has stalled, with the U.S. envoy recalling the negotiating team and stating Hamas showed a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire." The talks are deadlocked over Hamas's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal and Israel's insistence that Hamas disarm and relinquish power. This diplomatic failure comes as the United Nations warns that children in Gaza are starving to death, with aid agencies reporting that Israeli restrictions have left food supplies at just 6% of pre-war levels, causing a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Multiple former federal prosecutors have described the direct involvement of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in interviewing convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell as highly unorthodox and concerning. Experts told CBS News that such interviews are typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge to assess credibility, raising questions about the motives for such a high-level meeting. Critics suggest the interview is a political move to address public pressure regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, rather than a standard procedure for gathering credible new evidence for future prosecutions.</p>

Experts suggest that while these benchmarks are useful guidelines, they are not one-size-fits-all, and there is significant room for individual variation. The consensus is that consistency and a balanced approach are more important than fixating on specific numbers, and listening to one's body is often the best guide for maintaining well-being.</p>

An expert from the London School of Economics described the contents as providing a "full stomach but an empty diet," which could lead to diseases like anemia and scurvy over time.

          <p>After 25 years as a television staple, reality TV may have a more positive societal impact than its critics acknowledge, according to some experts. While often dismissed as superficial, the genre has historically been more demographically diverse than other media, offering viewers a glimpse into different social landscapes. Psychologists suggest that by featuring ordinary people and prompting national conversations on topics like disability, coercive control, and body image, reality TV can help build social understanding and make people feel less isolated.</p>

          <p>World darts champion Luke Littler has secured his place in the World Matchplay semi-finals after a hard-fought 16-14 victory over Andrew Gilding. Despite Gilding staging a late comeback, the 18-year-old phenom held his nerve to close out the quarter-final match at Blackpool's Winter Gardens. Littler will now face Northern Ireland's Josh Rock, who advanced after defeating 2023 runner-up Gerwyn Price in his own quarter-final match.</p>

          <p>Two high-ranking officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have been placed on administrative leave, fueling speculation of political retaliation from the Trump administration. The officials, Jeff Dillen and Stephen Volz, led the 2020 investigation into the "Sharpiegate" incident, which found that agency leaders had violated scientific integrity policies under political pressure. The move comes just before the confirmation hearing for Neil Jacobs, the former NOAA chief at the center of the scandal, to lead the agency once again.</p>

          <p>Bill Essayli, the interim U.S. attorney for the Los Angeles region, has faced significant criticism for what many see as a hyper-partisan approach that aligns with the Trump administration's agenda. His tenure has been marked by lawsuits challenging California's sanctuary and transgender athlete policies, as well as a focus on prosecuting pro-immigration protesters. This has reportedly led to mass departures of career prosecutors and low morale within one of the nation's busiest federal prosecutor's offices, raising concerns about the politicization of justice.</p>

          <p>The New Orleans jail, which has been under intense criticism following the escape of 10 inmates in May, has mistakenly released another detainee. Authorities reported that a 30-year-old man held on serious charges, including home invasion, was erroneously freed due to a clerical error involving a shared last name with another inmate. The local sheriff's office took full responsibility for the human error, which the district attorney's office called an "unacceptable lapse" that highlights ongoing systemic failures at the facility.</p>
