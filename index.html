          <p>Sir Tom Farmer, the Edinburgh-born entrepreneur who founded the Kwik Fit garage chain, has died peacefully at his home at the age of 84. Farmer established Kwik Fit in 1971 and grew it into the world's largest independent tire and automotive chain, eventually selling it to Ford for £1 billion in 1999. Beyond his business achievements, Sir Tom was also known for his philanthropy, public service, and dedication to the communities where he lived, including owning a majority stake in Hibernian FC for over two decades. His career significantly impacted both Scottish and UK life, and he was knighted in 1997.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have commenced high-level talks in Geneva, Switzerland, aimed at de-escalating trade tensions. This marks the first known in-person contact between the two largest economies since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on imports earlier this year. The negotiations include U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, who oversees economic matters. China faces tariffs of at least 145 percent on all exports to the United States, while Beijing has raised retaliatory duties on all American goods to 125 percent, with Trump signaling potential tariff reductions.</p>

          <p>With President Trump signaling a pullback in U.S. support for Ukraine, European leaders are concerned about their ability to supply Ukraine with the necessary weapons. A coalition of European nations backing Ukraine is struggling to get materiel to the battlefields, prompting Ukraine to seek deals that keep open the possibility of continued shipments of American arms. While European leaders and investors appear willing to invest more in weapons production, experts predict it will take a decade to ramp up assembly lines. Allies fear that Mr. Trump will pull Russian deterrents out of Europe, which eats into what other European countries might have given to Ukraine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's recent price cuts are creating significant ripples in the electric vehicle market, potentially accelerating EV adoption by making models like the Model Y more competitive with mid-level gas-powered SUVs. This shift is also impacting the used EV market, where prices are dropping, and putting pressure on traditional automakers to rethink their EV strategies. Tesla appears to be prioritizing market share over short-term profits, aligning with Elon Musk's long-term vision of making EVs accessible to a wider audience and building a larger ecosystem around software subscriptions and charging solutions. This strategy could lead to significant changes in the industry as other companies struggle to compete on price alone.</p>

          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other schedule I substances in the United States. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the bill, which would allow research to catch up with increasing cannabis consumption by repealing sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that restrict federal funding for research on schedule I substances. Experts suggest that the bill, if passed, could help policymakers craft more effective and informed legislation regarding cannabis, addressing questions about medical use, appropriate doses, and long-term impacts of different consumption methods.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his team have launched a relentless media offensive characterized by crass language, flashy tactics, and outrageous social media posts. The White House is functioning as a quasi-content provider, embracing viral far-right culture and nurturing a parallel information ecosystem through pro-Trump outlets. This approach has allowed the president to dominate the “attention economy” and reshape narratives around key issues, but it has also drawn criticism for undermining decency and accountability in presidential communications. The article points out specific examples of provocative content shared by the White House, illustrating the administration's departure from traditional norms.</p>

The deal seeks to align Britain with US requirements on steel and aluminum supply chains, potentially impacting Chinese ownership in the industry.

Two Berkshire-backed stocks, Amazon and BYD, are considered excellent buys due to their deep economic moats. Amazon's size creates a positive feedback loop, while BYD's edge comes from vertical integration, allowing it to control its supply chain and scale up production. While Amazon could face some challenges from the Trump administration's new tariffs on imported goods, its 3rd party business model can shift the impact mostly to sellers on the marketplace.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 on a failed mission to Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean. The spacecraft, a relic of the Cold War space race, had been orbiting Earth for 53 years after a rocket booster malfunctioned. Its return serves as a reminder of the Soviet Union's ambitious space program and its focus on Venus, while the United States focused on the moon and Mars. The article highlights the technological challenges of exploring Venus and the legacy of the Soviet Venera program, which achieved several firsts in planetary exploration.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva for critical negotiations aimed at resolving the trade war. The meetings are the first since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent, prompting retaliatory levies from China. While expectations for a significant breakthrough are low, the fact that the talks are taking place has raised hopes for de-escalation. The outcome of the negotiations could significantly impact the global economy, which has already been affected by the trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, according to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. Miller stated that the US Constitution allows for the suspension of this legal liberty during times of "rebellion or invasion." The administration's consideration comes amid legal challenges to recent detentions of undocumented migrants and dissenting foreign students. Legal experts have questioned the veracity of Miller's interpretation of US law, noting that Congress, not the president, holds the authority to suspend habeas corpus.</p>
