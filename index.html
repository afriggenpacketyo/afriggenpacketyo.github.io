The lawmakers, including Reps. Espaillat, Velazquez, and Goldman, were attempting to inspect the facility where immigrant detainees are being held. An immigration coalition stated that masked agents trapped the lawmakers between a fence and the building, an account partially confirmed by a representative who said they were locked in for about 30 minutes.</p>

          <p>Following the assault and attempted carjacking of a former Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) staffer in Washington D.C., President Trump has threatened to "federalize" the city's governance. The 19-year-old victim was allegedly attacked by a group of teenagers, leading to two arrests. Trump cited the incident as evidence of out-of-control crime and called for harsher prosecution of minors, threatening to revoke the city's home rule if local authorities do not act.</p>

          <p>The city of San Diego is quadrupling the hourly rate for street parking meters in a "special event zone" around Petco Park, home of the Padres. The rate will jump from $2.50 to $10 per hour starting two hours before games and concerts, making the cost of parking for an event comparable to the notoriously high prices at Dodger Stadium. The Padres organization has objected to the increase, stating it was implemented without sufficient input from the team.</p>

          <p>Housing affordability is expected to remain a significant concern for homebuyers this fall, according to lending experts. While a recent rise in for-sale inventory may provide more options, mortgage rates are predicted to remain high and stable, keeping pressure on buyers. Most forecasts anticipate that home prices will either hold steady or experience only modest declines in select markets, suggesting that significant relief for buyers is unlikely in the near term without a substantial drop in interest rates.

          <p>Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer plunged by 20% after the company released weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results and a disappointing forecast for the upcoming quarter.

The commemoration was tinged with a sense of urgency, as the number of living survivors dwindles and global nuclear arsenals persist, highlighting the critical need for the younger generation to carry forward the message of peace.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA estimates that the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles earlier this year resulted in approximately 440 more deaths than would have been expected, a figure far exceeding the official death toll of 31.

Starting in 2026, the events will move from Peacock to ESPN's new direct-to-consumer streaming service, which launches this month. The deal is a strategic move for ESPN to broaden its audience, as the WWE fanbase is typically younger, more diverse, and has a higher female viewership than many traditional sports.</p>
