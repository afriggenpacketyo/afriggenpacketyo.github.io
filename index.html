          <p>Hundreds of mourners, including Governor Tim Walz and former President Joe Biden, gathered for the funeral of Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. The couple was remembered for their deep commitment to public service, kindness, and community engagement. In his eulogy, Governor Walz described Hortman as the "most consequential speaker in Minnesota history" and urged attendees to honor their legacy by engaging in life with joy and respect. The service took place following a manhunt that led to the arrest of a suspect accused of killing the Hortmans and also shooting another political family.</p>

          <p>The wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has created a sharp divide in the city. While the event brought A-list celebrities and what the deputy mayor called "high-quality tourism," it also triggered protests from activists. Groups like Extinction Rebellion marched against the perceived excesses of capitalism and the environmental impact of such events. The article highlights the tension between Venetians who welcome the economic boost and those who feel the city is being treated as a playground for the ultra-wealthy, exacerbating issues of over-tourism.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is preparing for a critical test vote on a sweeping tax and spending package championed by President Trump, though its passage remains uncertain. The bill faces significant hurdles due to internal Republican disagreements over provisions such as Medicaid funding cuts, state and local tax deductions, and a debt ceiling increase. The White House is exerting strong pressure on Congress to pass the legislation by the Fourth of July, portraying it as a fundamental test of fulfilling campaign promises. This legislative push aims to fund administration priorities by making substantial cuts to social programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques a "Love is Love" concert organized by five Democratic senators at the Kennedy Center as a performative and insincere political stunt. The author argues the event, intended to protest alleged anti-LGBT bias, was a misuse of the term "guerrilla theater" by powerful elites, not a genuine grassroots action. The piece contends that such antics appear inauthentic to many Americans and show a Democratic party more focused on symbolic gestures than on addressing substantive policy issues like the budget or the border.</p>

          <p>Chrysler has issued a voluntary recall for over 250,000 Pacifica and Voyager vehicles from the 2022-2025 model years due to a potential defect with the side curtain airbags.

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the United States, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced it will cease its funding for Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. During a Gavi summit, Kennedy delivered a speech accusing the organization of disregarding vaccine safety, particularly concerning COVID-19 shots for pregnant women, and suppressing dissenting scientific views. This decision, which experts warn could jeopardize the vaccination of millions of children worldwide, represents a major infusion of the anti-vaccine agenda into U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Germany's former health minister, Jens Spahn, is facing a political and legal inquiry over his handling of face mask procurement during the COVID-19 pandemic. He is accused of ordering masks at inflated prices against the advice of his own departments and subsequently failing to pay for them, leaving the German government liable for potentially billions in lawsuits from manufacturers. The controversy has prompted calls for a formal parliamentary commission to investigate the government's overall pandemic response and work to restore public trust.</p>
