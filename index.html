          <p>President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have engaged in a public feud after Musk criticized Trump's budget bill. Trump responded by calling Musk "CRAZY" and threatening to cut government contracts with Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX. Musk promptly fired back, leading to a drop in Tesla's stock price. The dispute began after Musk voiced opposition to the bill's cuts to electric vehicle credits, which he claims will negatively impact Tesla, although Trump asserts Musk's opposition is a result of Trump nixing his pick to run NASA.</p>

While Musk has criticized the bill's impact on the national debt and its lack of support for clean energy initiatives, the conflict also involves personal grievances and business interests. Trump's decision to pull the nomination of Musk's ally to head NASA and Musk's unfulfilled promise of $100 million to Trump's political operation have fueled the animosity.

          <p>Experts suggest that President Trump's new travel ban has been designed to avoid the legal challenges faced by his previous attempts. The new ban, which targets 12 countries, is more legally robust due to its wider scope and clearly defined exemptions. Unlike the original ban, it does not explicitly target Muslim-majority countries, potentially increasing its chances of being upheld by the Supreme Court. The ban has been implemented following an attack in Boulder, Colorado, by an Egyptian national.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would repeal several taxes, including those on tips and overtime, gun silencers, and indoor tanning services. The bill would also make the 2017 tax cuts permanent and create "Trump savings accounts" for newborns. Additionally, it would raise the tax deduction limit for state and local taxes (SALT) and cut green energy incentives. The bill is currently in the Senate and faces opposition due to concerns about its impact on the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Free School Meal Rule Change to Benefit 500,000 More Pupils in England</h2>

          <p>The government has announced that any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals from September 2026, regardless of their income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, saving parents Â£500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The government has set aside Â£1bn to fund the change up to 2029 and will review standards to ensure school meals are healthy. The move has been welcomed by some, but others argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective.</p>
