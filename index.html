          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is forecasted to potentially strengthen again over the Atlantic. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its large size is increasing the risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast coast. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands and parts of the Bahamas, which are expected to experience heavy rain and potential flooding. The storm is undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, a process that could lead to re-intensification.</p>

Despite losing a play-off to Sebastian Munoz at the tournament in Indiana, Rahm's overall performance was sufficient to clinch the title ahead of competitor Joaquin Niemann. Munoz won the event with a birdie on the first extra hole after both players finished at 22 under par. The result also had implications for other players, as Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter secured their spots for the 2026 season.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson for the D.C. National Guard has stated that its members patrolling Washington, D.C. may be armed, a shift from previous announcements. This deployment is part of a federal plan to increase law enforcement presence in the city, a move that has drawn criticism from local officials and residents. While the Army had initially said Guard members would not carry weapons or make arrests, the new statement indicates they "may be armed consistent with their mission." The decision has sparked debate over federal overreach and the militarization of policing, with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser expressing concern over the challenge to the city's self-government.</p>

          <p>A JPMorgan Chase analysis reveals that while balances in traditional checking and savings accounts are declining, Americans' total cash reserves are growing due to a shift into higher-yield options. These alternatives include money market funds, brokerage accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs), with total reserves increasing by 3% to 5% annually. This trend is most pronounced among lower-income households and may explain the continued resilience of consumer spending despite persistent inflation. The article suggests this strategic reallocation of funds is helping households preserve and grow their capital in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an interview on "Face the Nation," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the path to ending the war in Ukraine, emphasizing that a peace deal will require concessions from both Russia and Ukraine. Following the Trump-Putin summit, Rubio stated that if one side gets everything it wants, it's called surrender, which is not the current situation. He outlined key areas for negotiation, including territorial lines, security guarantees for Ukraine, and reconstruction. Rubio confirmed that the U.S. and European allies will discuss the structure of potential "Article 5-like" security guarantees with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in Washington.</p>

          <p>An American psychologist, Dr. Colleen Crowley, and her family have reported a significant increase in happiness and quality of life since moving from Montecito, California, to San Sebastián, Spain. Seeking a different cultural experience and a less sheltered environment for their three children, the family made the move during the pandemic-driven shift to remote work. They have embraced an outdoor lifestyle, spending time hiking, surfing, and exploring, while living on about half of their previous budget. Despite challenges like bureaucracy and integrating into a close-knit culture, Crowley says the transformative experience and broadened worldview for her children have been monumental.</p>

          <p>Elmer Wayne Henley Jr., who at 15 became an accomplice to Houston serial killer Dean Corll, is speaking out in a new documentary. Now 69 and serving a life sentence, Henley describes how he was coerced into luring young boys for Corll, who tortured and killed at least 28 victims between 1970 and 1973. Forensic psychologist Katherine Ramsland, who interviewed Henley, states that he was initially tricked into participating and then blackmailed, assessing him as both a victim and a perpetrator. The reign of terror ended in 1973 when Henley shot and killed Corll to save himself and others.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As President Trump reportedly plans to press Ukraine to cede the Donbas region for peace, an analysis explores the profound implications of such a move. Surrendering the mineral-rich territory, for which tens of thousands of Ukrainians have died defending, is described as a "tragedy" that would displace millions and be seen as a betrayal. While polls show most Ukrainians oppose ceding land, the nation is deeply fatigued by the war, creating a difficult choice between territory and human lives. Any potential agreement would also be constitutionally complex and heavily dependent on robust, credible security guarantees from the West.</p>

          <p>Legendary investor Peter Lynch recently emphasized the importance of a long-term perspective for stock market investing, particularly for those planning for retirement. He stated that while the stock market has historically been the best place for wealth growth, individuals who need their money within one or two years should not be buying stocks. Lynch also shared his strategy of looking for excellent companies within struggling industries, as they often attract less competition and can yield better returns than popular stocks in booming sectors. His advice serves as a reminder of the value of patience and unconventional thinking in investing. (not investment advice)</p>

During a preseason game, Gabriel distinguished between "entertainers" and "competitors," leading to social media speculation that he was referring to the high-profile Sanders. Gabriel later clarified his remarks, stating he was referring to the media as entertainers and himself and his teammates as competitors. Both third-round pick Gabriel and fifth-round pick Sanders are competing for position on the team's quarterback depth chart this season.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has postponed its plans to resume flights after its striking flight attendants refused to comply with a government-issued back-to-work order. The strike, involving 10,000 workers, has stranded more than 100,000 travelers during the peak summer season. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) stated that demonstrations will continue, urging the airline to negotiate a fair contract rather than relying on government intervention. Key issues in the dispute remain pay and compensation for time flight attendants spend on the ground, with the union rejecting the airline's latest offer.</p>

          <p>Despite fielding an attack assembled for a combined £250 million, Chelsea was held to a 0-0 draw by Crystal Palace in their Premier League season opener. New signings like Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, and Estevao Willian were unable to break the deadlock at Stamford Bridge. While Chelsea generated a higher expected goals (xG) figure than their opponents, they managed only three shots on target, raising early questions about their creativity and finishing. The result is a disappointing start for a team with high expectations, though it is only the first match of a long season.</p>

The shot was allegedly made using a 14.5mm Snipex Alligator anti-materiel rifle in the eastern Donetsk region, an area seeing intense fighting. The feat, supported by drone and AI systems, surpasses the previous record also held by a Ukrainian sniper. This highlights Ukraine's innovative use of technology on the battlefield, pushing military hardware beyond its expected capabilities.</p>
