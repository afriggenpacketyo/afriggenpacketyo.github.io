        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second consecutive night of serious unrest, with petrol bombs, masonry, and fireworks directed at police, who responded with baton rounds, water cannon, and riot dogs. The violence follows a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault in the town, escalating into what police described as "racist thuggery." Several homes and businesses sustained damage, and a 29-year-old man has been charged in connection with the initial night's events. Politicians have traded accusations regarding the causes and handling of the situation, with tensions high over the area's demographics and integration of migrants. The events have raised concerns at both local and national levels. Optimism is low due to the ongoing violence and unresolved tensions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large international study involving nearly 300,000 children indicates a two-way relationship between screen time and socioemotional well-being. The research found that increased use of devices like TVs, tablets, and gaming consoles is associated with a higher risk of aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem in children. Conversely, children with pre-existing emotional or social challenges tend to spend more time on screens. The study suggests that limiting recreational screen time, particularly for children under 10, and encouraging alternative activities like interacting with friends and family, can mitigate these risks. The research emphasizes the importance of balance and moderation in screen use to promote healthy development.</p>

          <p>An urgent search is being conducted in the Scottish Highlands for Louie, a two-year-old golden retriever support dog who has been missing for two weeks. Louie is trained to alert 17-year-old Ellie Lynn's family when she is about to have an epileptic seizure. He disappeared near Steall Falls in Glen Nevis after slipping his lead during a family outing. The family and local volunteers have been searching extensively, leaving out food and clothing to attract Louie, and have installed wildlife cameras in hopes of spotting him. A tracker dog recently picked up Louie's scent, raising hopes that he is still alive.</p>

          <p>European Union officials are promoting the EU as a stable and predictable partner for Latin America, citing instability arising from the strategic competition between the United States and China. Speaking at a security conference in Brazil, EU representatives emphasized the bloc's commitment to a "green, digital and just transition," contrasting it with China's "export-led, fossil fuel-driven economy." The EU aims to build a development agenda with Latin America based on shared values and long-term cooperation, rather than resource extraction. This outreach is part of a broader effort by Brussels to strengthen ties with the region through increased financing and political collaboration.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem reportedly asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to authorize military forces deployed to Los Angeles protests to arrest civilians. This request would exceed the authority typically granted when deploying the National Guard, as defense personnel are generally prohibited from direct law enforcement activities. While troops can detain individuals temporarily to protect federal property, direct arrests are usually reserved for authorized law enforcement. Hegseth reportedly did not act on Noem's request, and the commandant of the Marine Corps reiterated that Marines sent to LA lack arrest authority and are there only to protect federal property and personnel. The situation highlights ongoing tensions and debates regarding the role of the military in domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a warning that protesters at his upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C., will be met with "heavy force." The parade, scheduled to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, is expected to draw counter-protests. Trump asserted that these protesters "hate our country" and would face significant repercussions. However, security officials and the Secret Service have indicated they are tracking approximately nine protests planned for the parade, but expect the number of protesters to be smaller than the number of attendees. The President's remarks have sparked controversy and raised concerns about the handling of dissent during public events.</p>

          <p>A Chicago Immigration Court judge ruled that Ramon Morales-Reyes, an undocumented Mexican immigrant framed for threatening President Donald Trump, can be released on a $7,500 bond. Judge Carla Espinoza stated that she does not believe Morales-Reyes poses a danger to the community. Despite multiple arrests since 1996, Morales-Reyes has only one conviction for disorderly conduct. The Department of Homeland Security did not oppose the bond request. While no longer under investigation for threats, DHS maintains he is in the country illegally and has a history of arrests. The Trump administration remains committed to deporting illegal aliens, but Morales-Reyes' family is hopeful for his release.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a federal judge to swiftly block President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles, citing concerns over state sovereignty and escalating tensions. Attorney General Rob Bonta argued that the deployments pose "imminent harm" and could exacerbate civil unrest. Newsom's lawsuit claims Trump federalized the California National Guard without proper consent and that the scale of protests does not warrant such action. Trump defended his decision, asserting it was necessary to prevent Los Angeles from "burning," while Newsom maintains the move is an overreach and akin to that of a tyrant.</p>

The flight, originating from Dallas, was part of a broader effort to protect American communities and enforce immigration laws. According to ICE, the individuals deported had been convicted of serious crimes, including murder, sexual assault, and drug trafficking. The operation reflects the Trump administration's firm stance on immigration and its relationship with China.

Weinstein's defense has emphasized Mann's continued contact with him, while Mann claims she "compartmentalized" the pain he caused.

          <p>Yale University is accelerating the sale of billions of dollars in its private equity investments. This decision comes as the private equity industry faces challenges and as President Trump targets Ivy League institutions. The article suggests that Yale's move could be a response to both market conditions and increased political pressure. The divestment strategy may reflect concerns about the future performance of private equity and the need to reallocate capital to other areas.</p>
