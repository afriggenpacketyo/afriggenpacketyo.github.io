          <p>A paramedic testified at the Old Bailey about the fear experienced when the defendant in the Hainault sword attack allegedly turned on the ambulance responding to the scene where 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin was killed. Marcus Monzo, 37, denies murdering Anjorin and attempting to kill four others during a series of attacks in April of last year. The paramedic described the "extremely terrifying" experience of Monzo attacking the ambulance with a sword, attempting to force it through the window. Footage was also shown of police confronting Monzo, and of him attacking PC Yasmin Mechem-Whitfield, who was slashed four times; Monzo admits to possessing the swords. Optimism is understandably low given the nature of the event.</p>

          <p>A school shooting in Graz, Austria, resulted in multiple fatalities, with police reporting that at least 10 people, including the suspected shooter, a 21-year-old former student, are dead. The shooter, who was not known to police, used a long gun and a handgun, later killing himself in a school toilet. Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker called the event a national tragedy and declared three days of national mourning. European leaders, including the German Chancellor and the President of the European Commission, expressed their condolences.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson responded to the LA protests by suggesting California Governor Gavin Newsom should be "tarred and feathered" for obstructing federal law enforcement efforts related to immigration. Johnson stated that Newsom was "standing in the way of the administration and the carrying out of federal law." Newsom responded on social media, criticizing Johnson's remarks as a fitting threat from a GOP that wants to bring the country back to the 18th Century. Johnson defended Trump's decision to send Marines and National Guardsmen to LA, asserting it was within his authority to maintain order. The political climate is heated.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that emperor penguin populations in Antarctica may be declining faster than previously feared, based on satellite images from 2009 to 2024. The study indicates a 22% decline in the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea, and Bellingshausen Sea, which house a third of the global emperor penguin population. Researchers attribute the losses to climate change, which is thinning and destabilizing the ice the penguins rely on for breeding. While further analysis is needed, the lead author suggests the decline is worse than the worst-case projections, stressing the need for action to reduce planet-heating emissions.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to dismiss all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has drawn criticism from health policy experts. They warn that this action undermines science, disrupts the regulatory process for vaccines, and could increase public distrust in vaccinations and federal health agencies. Experts fear Kennedy may appoint members sympathetic to his anti-vaccine views, leading to politicized recommendations. This move follows Kennedy's earlier decision to drop the CDC's recommendation for routine Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women, further fueling concerns in the medical and scientific community.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are contesting Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan's motion to dismiss an indictment against her, which alleges she assisted an illegal immigrant in evading ICE officers at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Dugan claims judicial immunity and argues that the federal government overstepped its authority. Prosecutors counter that judges are not immune from criminal liability, citing that Dugan allegedly escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican illegal immigrant and domestic battery suspect, out of the courthouse while ICE agents were attempting to serve a warrant. Surveillance footage appears to show Dugan confronting ICE agents before the alleged evasion. Dugan has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

Winfrey was surprised that the book focused on a male character, given Lamb's 20 years of work with women in prison.

While the government insists nuclear power can cut household energy bills, critics have raised concerns about the project's cost and environmental impact. The government hopes the investment will attract private funding, but negotiations with private investors are reportedly incomplete, leading to uncertainty about the project's final cost.</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedyâ€™s decision to dismiss all members of the CDC's advisory committee for immunization practices (ACIP) has sparked widespread concern among health experts. Many warn that the move will erode public trust in the US vaccine approval system. Kennedy's stated aim is to "re-establish public confidence" in vaccines, but critics argue his actions will undermine transparency and impartiality. Concerns are also rising about who will replace the current panel, with fears that Kennedy may appoint members sympathetic to anti-vaccine views, which could further damage public confidence in immunizations.</p>

          <p>FanDuel is introducing a 50-cent surcharge on all wagers in Illinois to offset the impact of new state taxes, which disproportionately affect the leading sportsbooks. The new tax applies to each wager, with 25 cents per bet for the first 20 million wagers and 50 cents per wager after that. DraftKings may follow suit, indicating they anticipate taking action soon. Analysts estimate the transaction fee will generate significant new revenue for both companies. Flutter Entertainment CEO Peter Jackson expressed disappointment, arguing the fee will disproportionately impact lower wagering and motivate gamblers to use unregulated operators.

          <p>Members of Parliament are scheduled to vote on decriminalizing abortion in England and Wales, a move that would allow women to terminate pregnancies without facing prosecution. Currently, abortion is illegal under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861, but is permitted under certain conditions outlined in the 1967 Abortion Act. The proposed amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill aims to decriminalize abortion at any stage, provided it's related to the woman's own pregnancy. The framework for accessing abortion would remain the same, requiring two doctors' approval for procedures in healthcare settings.</p>

          <p>This article compares debt forgiveness and debt consolidation as options for managing high credit card debt. Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into one loan, ideally at a lower interest rate, while debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to accept less than the full amount owed. Debt forgiveness can lead to greater upfront savings but damages credit, while debt consolidation can improve credit over time. The best option depends on individual circumstances, with debt consolidation being preferable for those who can manage monthly payments and debt forgiveness being a last resort for those facing bankruptcy.
