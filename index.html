          <p>The United States has lifted a ban on selling American jet engine parts and technology to China, a move expected to support the production of China's C919 aircraft. This bilateral agreement allows the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) to continue importing crucial components from a GE-invested joint venture, which is vital for fulfilling its hundreds of existing C919 orders. Analysts note that while this deal is important for Comac's immediate production and European market ambitions, previous US restrictions may have strengthened China's resolve to develop its own indigenous engine technology to ensure long-term self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to at least 81 fatalities, with more than 40 people, including children from a summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose to unprecedented levels, causing widespread destruction, particularly in Kerr County where a major disaster has been declared. Search and rescue operations are continuing around the clock, involving over 160 air rescues and hundreds of first responders. Officials have expressed that the true number of missing persons may be higher due to unrecorded campers in the area, highlighting the sudden and catastrophic nature of the event.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Threatens Additional 10% Tariff on Nations Aligning with BRICS Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 01:58:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced a new policy to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This threat followed a BRICS summit where leaders criticized unilateral protectionist measures, widely seen as a response to Trump's own tariff strategies. The announcement has created further uncertainty in global trade, as the administration is also preparing to send out letters detailing new country-specific tariff rates. The move is viewed as part of a broader strategy to challenge the growing influence of the BRICS bloc, which seeks to increase the role of Global South countries in international governance.

          <p>On the 20th anniversary of the 7/7 terrorist attacks in London, King Charles delivered a message urging people to stand united against division. He condemned the "senseless acts of evil" that killed 52 people in 2005 and praised the spirit of unity and compassion that emerged in the aftermath. Commemorative events, including a national service at St Paul's Cathedral, are being held to remember the victims and those whose lives were forever changed. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and other officials echoed the King's sentiment, emphasizing that the attackers' goal to divide the nation had failed.</p>

          <p>An Australian court has found Erin Patterson guilty of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by serving them a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. The jury also convicted her of the attempted murder of a fourth guest who survived the 2023 lunch. The nine-week trial, which captivated the nation, centered on whether Patterson intentionally poisoned her guests or if it was a tragic accident. The prosecution highlighted strained family relations but did not offer a specific motive for the killings. Patterson, who showed little emotion as the verdict was read, now faces a potential life sentence in prison.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk, stating he was "saddened" to see the tech billionaire go "completely 'off the rails'" after Musk announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party." The move signals a significant falling out between the two former allies, which began over disagreements on a recent tax and spending bill that ended EV tax credits. Trump dismissed the idea of a third party as a source of "disruption and chaos" and claimed Musk had previously been fine with ending the EV mandate. The feud marks a dramatic end to a political alliance that saw Musk heavily support Trump's re-election.</p>

          <p>A nine-week trial has concluded with Erin Patterson being found guilty of murdering three relatives with poisoned mushrooms, a case that has gripped Australia and the world. The prosecution presented evidence suggesting Patterson intentionally used death cap mushrooms in a beef Wellington meal, luring her victims with a false claim of having cancer. The defense argued it was a tragic foraging accident, but the jury was swayed by evidence of her lies to police and attempts to dispose of a food dehydrator. The trial meticulously examined every detail, from the different plates used at the meal to Patterson's internet search history and conflicting statements.</p>

The government denies the existence of a formal policy, arguing the case is based on a misunderstanding of First Amendment applications in an immigration context.

The recent 12-day war between Israel and Iran is seen by some analysts as having created a more favorable environment for a deal, potentially strengthening Netanyahu's position to agree to terms despite objections from his far-right coalition partners.

          <p>Across Europe, a severe housing crisis is becoming a major source of political disenfranchisement, as rising rents and unattainable home ownership push middle and working-class citizens to their limits. This article argues that the crisis has been exacerbated by the increasing "financialization" of housing, where institutional investors like private equity firms treat homes as a lucrative asset class. This has driven up prices, led to practices like "renoviction," and shifted power away from residents. While investors claim to increase housing supply, critics contend their business model relies on shortages to maximize profits, ultimately failing to provide affordable homes and creating a political timebomb.

Following the Israeli attacks, the Houthi military reported confronting the assault with surface-to-air missiles, and sirens were later triggered in Israel in response to incoming projectiles from Yemen.</p>

          <h2>Officials Face Questions Over Adequacy of Warnings Ahead of Deadly Texas Floods</h2>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly flash floods in central Texas, questions are being raised about whether officials provided adequate warnings to residents and campers. Local authorities in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, stated they had no reason to expect a deluge of such magnitude, describing the event as a "water wall of almost 30ft high." Challenges cited include a lack of cell phone coverage in some areas and the absence of a county-wide siren system due to cost. The National Weather Service defended its actions, stating it issued flood watches and warnings with several hours of lead time, highlighting the unprecedented and rapid escalation of the storm.</p>

          <p>Mexico has won its tenth Gold Cup title after defeating the United States 2-1 in a heated final in Houston, Texas. West Ham's Edson Álvarez scored the decisive goal in the second half, which was confirmed after a VAR review for a potential offside. The match was contentious, with U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino expressing frustration over a denied penalty call that he felt was influenced by the heavily pro-Mexico crowd. For the U.S., the loss concludes a tournament where a second-choice squad showed development but ultimately fell short in their last competitive match before hosting the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's announcement of forming a new "America Party" confronts a complex and challenging reality, even for the world's wealthiest person. This article explains that creating a new national political party is a daunting task due to a thicket of 50 different state laws governing ballot access, which are heavily biased toward the two major parties. The process involves collecting vast numbers of signatures, meeting voter registration thresholds, and facing intense, costly legal challenges from the Democratic and Republican establishments. Experts suggest that building a viable third party is a multi-year, multi-hundred-million-dollar project, making it an extremely difficult undertaking despite Musk's resources.</p>

          <p>The al-Qaeda-affiliated group JNIM has emerged as a primary driver of surging jihadist violence across West Africa, particularly in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Formed in 2017, the group has expanded its operations and significantly increased the frequency and scale of its attacks, claiming to have killed nearly 1,000 people since April. The report suggests that the group exploits local grievances for recruitment and funds its activities through cattle rustling and extortion. Despite international and local counter-insurgency efforts, the military juntas now ruling the Sahel nations have been unable to contain the threat, with some analysts arguing their actions have fueled further recruitment.</p>

          <p>At their summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaders of the BRICS nations issued a joint statement calling for the United Nations to take a leading role in setting global rules for artificial intelligence. The group described AI as a "unique opportunity" for growth but warned it could widen the digital divide without fair governance. They emphasized the need for technical standards developed with public sector and UN involvement to ensure trust, security, and reliability. The statement also called for equal access to AI technologies for developing nations and promoted open-source collaboration, aiming to prevent standard-setting from becoming a barrier for the Global South.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a long-standing Christian girls' camp on the Guadalupe River, has become the center of a national tragedy after a sudden, massive flood swept through its grounds. The camp, operated by the same family for generations and attended by girls from across Texas and the U.S., was inundated when the river rose 26 feet in 45 minutes. The deluge destroyed low-lying cabins, killed the camp's director and numerous young campers, and left others missing. Survivors describe horrific scenes of destruction, transforming a place of summer adventure into the site of a devastating and deadly natural disaster.</p>
