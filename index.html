            <p>Citigroup reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by robust revenue from fixed income and equities trading. The bank's profit increased by 21% to $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, fueled by higher revenues and reduced expenses compared to the previous year. Company-wide revenue rose by 3% to $21.60 billion, with gains across all five major divisions. However, Citigroup's shares have declined by 10% this year amidst a broader selloff in bank stocks linked to President Trump's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Owen Ray, an American college student arrested in Denmark over an alleged assault against an Uber driver, asserts his innocence after being detained for nearly two weeks. Ray claims that a dispute arose when he and his friend entered the wrong address, and the Uber driver allegedly refused to take them elsewhere. According to Ray, the driver later confronted them, leading to an altercation. Ray's attorney filed an appeal, resulting in his release, but his passport remains with Danish authorities, and he must check in with the police daily.</p>

            <p>Several French prisons were hit by a wave of overnight attacks, including vehicles being set alight and gunfire aimed at one facility. Justice Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin linked the attacks to the government's crackdown on drug trafficking, while the national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office launched an investigation. The prison guard union expressed deep concern and called for urgent government action to protect staff. No group has claimed responsibility, but anarchist slogans and inscriptions referencing "French prisoners' rights" were found at some sites, suggesting a coordinated effort linked to the government's anti-drug strategy.</p>

            <p>The availability of low-deposit mortgages in the UK has reached its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, offering a boost to first-time buyers. Moneyfacts data reveals a significant increase in deals requiring 5% or 10% deposits, although mortgage rates remain elevated. While securing a mortgage is one thing, buyers also need to act relatively quickly when it comes to finding a new home, data suggests. Homes in England and Wales spend an average of 36 days on the market before a sale is agreed, according to news figures from the property portal Zoopla.</p>

Farmers express concerns about being used as bargaining chips in trade wars and the impact of tariffs on their core markets. They fear that without a bailout, many could go under.</p>

The return of the firing squad undermines the narrative of capital punishment becoming more civilized through technological advancements.

            <p>The Trump administration's decision to cut funding to the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and reallocate it to build the National Garden of American Heroes signifies a shift from intellectual inquiry to mandated reverence.

Trump's vision, exemplified by the sculpture garden, demands reverence and codifies history, reminiscent of authoritarian regimes that prioritize ideological conformity over critical thought.

The luxury sector is facing headwinds from President Trump's trade policy. LVMH spent several years as Europe's most valuable company starting with 2021, as luxury stocks were buoyed by hopes of a post-Covid-19 pandemic boom.

Chinese experts believe Trump's policies signal a reordering of global influence, with the US potentially in decline and China on the rise. Xi's alignment with Putin in Moscow further emphasizes this shift. The unpredictable nature of US-China relations and evolving policies contribute to a sense of profound global transformation.</p>

            <h2>The Aims Behind Trump's Tariff Policies</h2>

            <p>President Trump's tariff policy, though seemingly chaotic, aims to revitalize US manufacturing, address national security concerns, boost exports, and potentially restructure the global currency system. Advisers hope tariffs will incentivize a manufacturing boom, create jobs, and reduce dependence on China. They also envision a global accord to weaken the dollar, making US exports more competitive. However, tariffs carry significant risks, potentially raising prices, chilling investment, and undermining confidence in the US economy.</p>

            <p>U.S. Treasury yields have been climbing as investors move away from government debt, reversing the typical safe-haven behavior during market volatility. This sell-off has fueled speculation about who is selling, with China, Japan's life insurers, and hedge funds being potential culprits. The unusual outflow has added to market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariff policies. Some analysts suggest China's selling is a form of weaponizing their Treasury holdings, while others point to Japan's life insurers reducing exposure due to policy uncertainty.
