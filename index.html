          <p>Meta's stock experienced a significant increase of over 5% after the company announced first-quarter revenue that surpassed expectations, accompanied by a positive outlook for the second quarter. The company's first-quarter sales increased by 16% year over year, and net income jumped by 35% to $16.64 billion, with Meta AI reaching nearly 1 billion monthly users. Despite these positive results, Meta cautioned that a recent decision by the European Commission could negatively impact its European business and revenue in the third quarter, while Snap and Google have warned of potential advertising headwinds due to macroeconomic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll reveals a wide range of American opinions on President Donald Trump's performance after his first 100 days in office, with responses ranging from "Savior" and "Patriotic" to "Disaster" and "Chaotic." The poll indicates Trump's job approval rating is at 39%, the lowest compared to previous presidents since 1945, with some respondents expressing feelings of fear, excitement, or confusion. Many highlighted concerns about Trump's authority and economic policies, while others praised his support for American interests and decisive actions.

          <p>Amazon announced plans to invest approximately $4 billion by the end of 2026 to expand its delivery network in rural towns across the U.S., aiming to cut delivery times in half and create around 170 jobs at each new site. The expansion will triple the size of Amazon's rural delivery network by adding over 200 delivery stations, signaling a commitment to serving rural customers despite the higher costs. This move comes as other logistics providers are pulling back from rural areas, and as Amazon is set to release its first-quarter earnings report. The company aims to speed up deliveries and rely less on traditional carriers like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service.</p>

          <p>An investigation by The New York Times reveals new details about the Trump administration's deportation deal with El Salvador, raising questions about due process and the assessment of deportees. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele sought assurances that deportees were gang members, leading U.S. officials to compile a scorecard based on affiliations and activities. The U.S. also agreed to send MS-13 leaders to El Salvador in exchange for housing Venezuelan migrants, raising concerns among law enforcement officials. The White House invoked the Alien Enemies Act to expedite deportations, leading to legal challenges and scrutiny over the use of wartime powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding Oklahoma's potential funding of the nation's first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, sparking debate over the separation of church and state. Justices appeared divided along ideological lines, with Republican appointees largely sympathetic to the school and Democratic ones wary, while Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself. The case raises questions about whether states can sponsor and finance religious charter schools and the extent of state involvement in such institutions. A ruling in favor of the school could affect laws in 46 other states and blur the line between government money for private schools and direct support for religious schools.</p>

The agreement involved El Salvador housing "convicted criminals" in exchange for financial support from the U.S., and Bukele also requested the return of MS-13 leaders from U.S. custody. The application of the Alien Enemies Act in these deportations has faced legal challenges, with the Supreme Court expected to weigh in on the matter.</p>

The court's liberal members argued that charter schools are public institutions and cannot advance a specific ideology with taxpayer funds, while conservatives viewed charter schools as contractors for a public service.

          <p>Despite promises to cut spending, President Trump's administration has overseen a $200 billion increase in federal spending during his first 100 days in office compared to the same period last year. The rise is attributed to big-ticket expenditures like military spending, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which the White House has limited control over. The national debt is growing, and interest payments are skyrocketing, while attempts at cost-cutting by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) face legal challenges and focus on smaller targets. Analysts suggest that meaningful spending cuts would require addressing the largest entitlement programs.</p>

Judge Geoffrey Crawford noted that Mahdawi had "made substantial claims that his detention is the result of retaliation for protected speech," comparing it to the Red Scare and McCarthyism.

The Littlejohns claim the school socially transitioned their daughter without their knowledge or consent, creating a wedge between them. The APC argues that social transitioning is the first step toward puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries, requiring parental involvement from the outset.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Stars FC terminated second-year head coach Lorne Donaldson following a 1-5-0 start to the season, naming Masaki Hemmi as interim head coach. Donaldson, hired in December 2023, was expected to turn around a franchise that has struggled since 2021, but the team's poor performance led to the change. The Stars have scored just three goals and conceded 14 in their first six games, placing them at the bottom of the league. The team will play their first game without Donaldson on the road against Gotham FC.</p>

Jax Ulbrich, 21, obtained Sanders' number from an open iPad belonging to his father and the team, and impersonated the New Orleans Saints general manager during a livestream event. The Falcons said they facilitated an apology from Jax Ulbrich to Sanders, and the team does not plan to pursue disciplinary actions against Jeff Ulbrich.</p>

          <p>Raging wildfires in Israel forced the government to close major roads, evacuate towns near Jerusalem, and request international assistance, disrupting the country's Memorial Day ceremonies. High winds and dry conditions exacerbated the blazes, with firefighting planes unable to function effectively. While there were no reported deaths, at least 19 people were treated for light injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attributed the fires to a "deadly combination" of strong wind and dryness, and the Palestinian Authority offered assistance. Climate change has been cited as a factor in the increasing intensity of Israel's wildfires.</p>

          <p>A controversial agreement between the IRS and ICE is causing fear among immigrants, as it allows the sharing of tax information with immigration authorities, potentially leading to deportation. Many immigrants, who have been encouraged to pay taxes using ITIN numbers, now fear that their compliance could make them targets. This has led to a decrease in tax filings and concerns about the economic impact, as undocumented immigrants contribute billions in taxes annually. Legal challenges and congressional pressure are mounting to block the agreement, which is seen as a betrayal of trust and a violation of privacy.</p>

This represents a reversal from 2015 when youth support helped elect Justin Trudeau, with recent polls indicating a significant lead for the Conservatives among 18 to 34-year-olds. While the Liberals gained seats in the election, the Conservatives also made significant gains, blocking the Liberals from forming a decisive majority government, and the key challenge for Carney will be winning back the confidence of younger voters.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the 2025 World Happiness Report reveals that relying solely on life evaluation scores, which correlate with gross domestic product, may not fully capture well-being. The authors propose a broader measure of flourishing, including relationships, community participation, health, emotions, and a sense of purpose. Findings from the Global Flourishing Study, which surveyed over 200,000 people across 22 countries, indicate that wealthier countries often report less meaning and fewer satisfying relationships compared to poorer counterparts. The study suggests that prioritizing economic growth may impose costs on developed nations, prompting a reflection on alternative paths to happier lives.</p>
