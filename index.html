          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending deportation protections for thousands of Afghans. The ruling provides a one-week pause on the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which was set to expire. Advocacy groups argue that Afghanistan remains unsafe for return, while the administration contends the country's security situation has improved. This decision allows time for legal arguments to be filed, offering a brief reprieve for families facing uncertainty about their futures.</p>

          <p>Intense storms on Monday night triggered flash flood warnings across the New York City region, causing significant disruptions and damage. Heavy rainfall led to flooded subway stations, severe transit delays, and submerged roadways in New York City, its northern suburbs, and parts of New Jersey. In response to the widespread flooding, New Jersey's governor declared a state of emergency. Emergency services conducted numerous rescues of individuals stranded in vehicles as some areas received over six inches of rain in a short period.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it will soon restart sales of its H20 AI chips to China, a significant development following a previous halt due to U.S. export controls. The company stated it received assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary licenses will be granted. This move comes after CEO Jensen Huang lobbied against the restrictions, arguing they hinder American tech leadership. The resumption of sales for these specialized chips is expected to reinforce Nvidia's market position in China and serve as a new growth catalyst. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Agricultural workers in California have called for a three-day strike, named "Huelga por la Dignidad," in response to recent immigration raids. The protest was sparked by the death of a 57-year-old farmworker, Jaime Alanís García, during an ICE operation at a farm in Camarillo. Organizers and activists are demanding an end to mass deportations in agricultural areas and a pathway to legal status for essential workers. The strike, scheduled for mid-July, aims to highlight the critical contributions and precarious conditions of the farmworker community, which is vital to the nation's food supply.</p>

          <p>The assisted-living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, where a fire killed nine people, was scheduled for a recertification and compliance review later this year. State officials noted that an onsite visit in October 2023 found the facility, Gabriel House, was not in compliance with some regulations, primarily related to documentation, and was required to submit a correction plan. A preliminary investigation into the fire suggests it was likely caused by an electrical or mechanical issue rather than being set intentionally. The distinction of the facility as an assisted-living residence means it is subject to different regulations than a nursing home.</p>

          <p>Parts of central North Carolina have been hit by what experts are calling a "500-year to 1,000-year flood" after Tropical Storm Chantal dropped up to 10 inches of rain in just a few hours. The extreme rainfall caused the Eno River to overflow, leading to widespread flooding that inundated communities and required the rescue of nearly 80 people in Durham County alone. The event highlights a concerning pattern of storms producing more intense rainfall in shorter periods, a phenomenon linked to rising global temperatures. Such extreme weather damages infrastructure, homes, and endangers lives, underscoring the growing climate risks.</p>

          <p>Former Major League Baseball pitcher Daniel Serafini has been found guilty of the first-degree murder of his father-in-law, Robert Gary Spohr, in a 2021 home invasion.

Serafini was also convicted of the attempted murder of Spohr's wife, who survived the initial attack but later died by suicide. The former pitcher, whose career ended in 2007, now faces a potential life sentence for the calculated and heinous crime.</p>

Becker completed the race with about three hours to spare, successfully settling a score after he narrowly missed the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022.

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record volume of shipping containers in June, an increase attributed to shippers racing to import goods before President Trump's tariff deadlines. Port officials described the surge as a "tariff whipsaw effect," with import volumes fluctuating based on shifting trade policy timelines. While the port saw its busiest June in history, executives anticipate a significant drop in cargo volume from August onward if new tariffs on Chinese goods are implemented. The uncertainty has created major challenges for importers, who face rising costs and complex decisions about their supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>
