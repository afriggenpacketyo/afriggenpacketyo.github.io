          <p>Jonathan Peter Brooks, a plastic surgeon, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 22 years for attempting to murder his colleague, Graeme Perks. Brooks broke into Perks's home armed with a crowbar, petrol, matches, and a knife, intending to set the house on fire. Perks sustained serious injuries from the attack but survived due to prompt medical intervention. The judge noted Brooks's lack of remorse and his fixation on employment difficulties as the motive for the crime, highlighting the surgeon's awareness of the pain caused by burns, making his actions particularly egregious. The event has left Perks and his family with lasting physical and emotional trauma, though Perks expressed no ill will towards Brooks. </p>

          <p>Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond announced that the state will retry Richard Glossip for the 1997 murder of Barry Van Treese, but will not seek the death penalty. Glossip, who has maintained his innocence for 27 years, was twice convicted based on the testimony of Justin Sneed, who confessed to the murder and claimed Glossip paid him to do it. The Supreme Court granted Glossip a new trial due to violations of his due process rights, specifically the withholding of information about Sneed's mental health treatment. Drummond stated that his office will pursue a life sentence for Glossip, citing Sneed's existing life sentence without parole, emphasizing the need for a fair trial based on facts and truthful testimony. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would support the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles. This statement came as Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced a lawsuit against Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for deploying National Guard troops to manage protests against these actions. Newsom criticized Trump's federalization of the National Guard as an unlawful overreach of power, while Bonta asserted there was no basis for such action. Trump's remarks followed threats from his border czar, Tom Homan, to arrest Newsom and other officials obstructing immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>The White House stated that President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles was intended as a deterrent to violence amid protests over immigration enforcement. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt argued that Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass have hindered the LAPD's ability to maintain order and enforce immigration laws. Leavitt suggested that Newsom could face arrest if he obstructs federal enforcement, and noted Trump's reference to some protesters as insurrectionists, potentially setting the stage for invoking the Insurrection Act. The deployment allows for 2,000 National Guardsmen to protect federal buildings for 60 days, with the operation continuing until the protests end. </p>

          <p>Former Orange County Supervisor Andrew Do has been sentenced to five years in federal prison for taking over $550,000 in bribes related to COVID-relief funds. Do admitted to funneling over $10 million in federal pandemic funds to a nonprofit that steered money to his daughters. The judge expressed displeasure that the law allowed him to sentence Do to only five years, emphasizing the seriousness of public corruption. The scandal was uncovered in 2023, revealing that Do approved contracts without disclosing his daughter's role in the nonprofit. </p>
