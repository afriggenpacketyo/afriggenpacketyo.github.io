          <p>The Trump administration is appealing to the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that deemed its tariffs illegal, arguing that the case addresses a significant economic and foreign policy initiative. The administration claims the tariffs promote peace and economic prosperity, while the appeals court decision undermines the president's ability to conduct diplomacy and protect national security. The ruling in question stated that Trump exceeded his authority by imposing tariffs on trading partners using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as the power to impose tariffs primarily lies with Congress, according to the US Constitution. The administration warns that denying tariff authority could lead to trade retaliation and economic catastrophe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major accident involving the Gloria funicular in Lisbon, Portugal, has resulted in 15 deaths and numerous injuries, prompting a day of national mourning. The 140-year-old funicular, a popular tourist attraction, derailed, leading to the tragic loss of life, including foreign nationals. Eyewitness accounts suggest a braking system failure caused the funicular to hurtle down a steep street and crash into a building, though authorities are still investigating the exact cause. The Lisbon public transport operator, Carris, stated that regular maintenance checks were carried out on the funicular, however, footage shared on social media showed the overturned and severely damaged carriage. The event is a tragic one for the city.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced gains following a tech-driven rally on Wall Street, boosting the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 both saw increases, with the latter supported by positive household spending data. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi index also traded higher, while global bond markets remained in focus due to pressure on long-dated borrowing costs. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield rose after a court ruling challenged the legality of Trump administration tariffs, raising questions about future tariff revenues. These positive market movements suggest a degree of investor confidence in the tech sector despite broader economic concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Restoration of America Foundation (ROAF) is urging the Senate Finance Committee to question Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about the removal of safety protocols for mifepristone, the abortion pill. ROAF argues that the Biden administration's rollback of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requirements endangers women by allowing abortion pills to be prescribed via telehealth and delivered by mail. The group claims that the removal of these safeguards, which were in place for over two decades, leaves women more vulnerable and shifts costs to taxpayers. The FDA originally required in-person dispensing of mifepristone to ensure women were screened for potential complications. </p>

Trump wants the Supreme Court to hear arguments in early November and issue a final decision soon afterward, rather than waiting until the following summer. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argues the appeals court ruling undermines the President's ability to conduct diplomacy and protect national security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A professor at Cal State Channel Islands, Jonathan Caravello, has been indicted on a felony count of assaulting U.S. Border Patrol agents with a canister of their own tear gas. The incident occurred during a protest against an immigration raid at a marijuana farm in Ventura County, where agents deployed tear gas for crowd control. Prosecutors allege that Caravello threw a tear gas canister back at the officers and resisted arrest when later identified. The immigration operation itself led to the arrests of over 300 undocumented workers, and one worker died attempting to flee federal agents. </p>

Supporters argue it enforces the state's abortion ban and protects women and fetuses, while opponents view it as an attempt to intimidate out-of-state providers and encourage vigilantism. Under the bill, Texas residents could sue those who manufacture, transport, or provide abortion-inducing drugs to anyone in Texas for up to $100,000, with certain restrictions and protections in place. The idea of using citizens to enforce abortion bans is not new in Texas, but this measure explicitly targets out-of-state providers. </p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that Americans continue to view the U.S. economy negatively, with most describing it as "uncertain" and "struggling." Positive views of the economy have remained relatively stable in the 30s throughout the year, with prices being a primary concern. The majority of Americans believe prices are still increasing and expect them to continue rising. Personal financial situations are somewhat connected to perceptions of price changes, with those who say prices are rising more likely to describe their situation as bad. The poll also indicates that a majority of Americans believe the economy is getting worse, with around a quarter expecting a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia has stated that it will not discuss any potential foreign military deployment in Ukraine, deeming it "unacceptable." This response follows remarks by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen regarding plans to send European troops to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. Germany has also rejected this proposal, with the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman emphasizing that any foreign intervention in Ukraine is fundamentally unacceptable. Von der Leyen had stated that Europe was developing "pretty precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment with the backing of U.S. capabilities. </p>

Tencent recently open-sourced its Youtu-Agent agentic framework, developed by its AI research department, Youtu Labs. This follows similar moves by ByteDance, which open-sourced its Coze Studio platform, and Alibaba, which open-sourced its Qwen-Agent framework. Agentic frameworks are software platforms that provide the tools and components necessary to build, deploy, and manage AI agents, which can autonomously perform complex tasks. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has dismissed the Jeffrey Epstein controversy as a "Democrat hoax" amid ongoing efforts to release all files related to the deceased sex offender. Trump stated that thousands of pages of documents have been released but claimed it is a distraction from his administration's success. His comments come as survivors joined House members in a push to compel the Justice Department to release withheld records. The president's remarks have drawn criticism from survivors and sparked a showdown with House Republican leadership, as some Republicans support the release of all files. </p>

Companies like Nio, Xpeng, and Zeekr have reported smaller losses in the second quarter, driven by discounts that attracted more buyers. However, analysts emphasize the need to cut losses further to avoid being forced out of the competitive market. To meet its break-even goal, Nio needs to deliver 50,000 EVs per month, doubling its second-quarter sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two showcased the country's growing power and offered an alternative to the American-backed order. The event coincided with concerns about Trump's trade policies, which have scrambled global economic and political alignments. Trump's "America first" outlook on global trade has led to a newfound rapport between China, Russia, and India, challenging the US-led international order. However, there are growing indications that Trump's trade regime could be dismantled by the US judiciary, adding to the risks of his strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent authorization of military strikes against drug smugglers in international waters marks an expansion of the counterterrorism campaign and a deeper involvement of the military in crime fighting. The decision to target suspected "narco-terrorists" in the Caribbean represents a shift away from the traditional role of the U.S. armed forces, which were intended to defend the country from external threats rather than enforce the law. Critics argue that such tactics raise concerns about the militarization of law enforcement and the potential for abuse of power. The deployment of the National Guard also faced legal challenges, with a judge ruling that the administration had illegally deployed National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, finding "no invasion or predatory incursion." The Trump administration had been deporting accused gang members using the 18th-century wartime law, but the court found that the situation with Tren de Aragua does not meet the definition of either an "invasion" or a "predatory incursion." The appellate judges granted a preliminary injunction blocking the use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove migrants who sued in the Northern District of Texas. The court said the government can still remove the migrants under other legal authorities. </p>
