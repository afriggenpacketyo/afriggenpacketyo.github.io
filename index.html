          <h2>Chinese-Led Study Advocates for Global Green Energy Network</h2>

          <p>A China-led study suggests that a global interconnected solar-wind energy network could satisfy the world's energy demands by 2050 at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The study, published in Nature Communications, explores creating a network that leverages regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents to areas with high demand. Researchers acknowledge that establishing such a system involves navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises, such as the Ukraine war. The study concludes that successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease decarbonization's economic burden, and bolster resilience against conflict and climate extremes. Optimizing solar and wind renewable energy deployment could create an international renewable energy market.</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo after a strong initial showing, although no candidate reached the 50% threshold to win outright. Cuomo conceded the primary and hinted at a possible independent run in November, following accusations of sexual harassment that led to his resignation in 2021. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, focused on a progressive platform including a rent freeze and fare-free buses, while Cuomo campaigned on his experience and past confrontations with Donald Trump. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, with final results expected in mid-July due to the time required to retrieve voting machine data.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that some sexcam studios in Colombia are recruiting schoolgirls, despite it being illegal to employ models under 18. Models recount how studios lure them with promises of easy money and then exploit them, sometimes pressuring them into performing sexual acts they find degrading. While major webcam platforms claim to have checks to prevent underage performers, models say these are easily bypassed using recycled accounts and fake IDs. The report highlights the booming sexcam industry in Colombia, where many models work due to poverty and lack of resources, and explores the ethical and legal challenges surrounding the industry's regulation.</p>

          <p>IVF patients are being cautioned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after Apricity Fertility, a popular online firm, went bankrupt, leaving clients without treatment or refunds. These clinics act as intermediaries between patients, donors, and doctors but are not regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The HFEA is calling for strengthened laws to protect patients, as these clinics do not provide IVF treatment directly. Several patients share their experiences of losing significant amounts of money and trust after Apricity's closure, highlighting the risks associated with these unregulated services.</p>

          <p>Australian journalist Antoinette Lattouf won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza. Lattouf claimed the ABC cut short her stint as a fill-in radio presenter in December 2023 due to her political views and lobbying from pro-Israel groups after she shared a Human Rights Watch post accusing Israel of war crimes. The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, awarding her damages of A$70,000. The ABC apologized to Lattouf, acknowledging it had "let down our staff and audiences" in its handling of the matter.</p>

          <p>California leaders have reached a tentative $321.1 billion budget agreement, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal demanded by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The budget addresses a $12 billion deficit through borrowing, tapping reserves, and shifting funds, reflecting resistance to Newsom's proposed cuts. A key element is a "poison pill" requiring legislators to pass a bill lessening environmental review requirements for building projects under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The deal also includes changes to Medi-Cal funding, such as reinstating asset limits and delaying full dental coverage for undocumented immigrants, while preserving funding for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention grants.</p>

The People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng discussed ways to "weaken excessive reliance on a single sovereign currency" and announced plans to establish a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai. Recent moves focus on expanding access to futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and exploring the use of foreign currencies as collateral for trades settled in yuan. While global finance institutions are interested in diversifying to China, strict capital controls and opacity have discouraged large-scale investment.</p>

          <p>In a significant political upset, Andrew Cuomo conceded to state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary. Cuomo, seeking a comeback after resigning in 2021 due to a sexual harassment scandal, acknowledged Mamdani's victory. Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, is poised to become the city's first Muslim and Indian American mayor if elected. The primary outcome is viewed as a litmus test for the Democratic Party, with Mamdani's win signaling a preference for progressive leaders during Donald Trump's presidency.</p>

Environmentalists and public land advocates celebrated the decision, while Lee indicated that he would continue to pursue the measure with revisions.
