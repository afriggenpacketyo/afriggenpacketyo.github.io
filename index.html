          <p>The United States is undertaking a partial evacuation of its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, citing heightened security risks amid escalating tensions with Iran. Non-essential staff and their families are being removed following reports that Israel was prepared to launch an operation into Iran, raising concerns about potential Iranian retaliation against US interests in Iraq. US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Muscat to discuss Iran's nuclear program. President Trump reiterated that the US will not allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons and has hoped to strike a deal to prevent this.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is under a second night of curfew after nearly a week of unrest sparked by US immigration raids, resulting in multiple arrests for curfew violations and other offenses. Approximately 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines have been deployed to help quell the protests, with some National Guard troops authorized to detain individuals until police can arrest them. Mayor Karen Bass has blamed President Trump's immigration policies for provoking residents and causing fear, accusing the federal government of overreach. Trump has vowed to "liberate" the city, leading to escalating tensions with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has criticized the troop deployment as an assault on democracy.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, Chinese companies are determined to expand their global presence, with the US remaining a key market.

Other companies, such as Hisense and Bc Babycare, are also expanding into the US, unfazed by geopolitical risks.

          <p>China is making strides in the production of high-performance photonic chips, which could lead to significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) has initiated production of 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips, utilizing light instead of electrical signals for data transmission. While Europe and the US are already established in this field, China's pilot production line is demonstrating gains in technical performance. TFLN's ultra-fast electro-optic effect, high bandwidth, and low power consumption make it an emerging high-performance optoelectronic material.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines in the UK present contrasting perspectives on the chancellor's Spending Review, with some describing it as "renewing Britain" while others label it a "reckless splurge." The NHS and defence are highlighted as major beneficiaries, but concerns are raised about potential tax increases and cuts to other departments. Some papers focus on the review's impact on policing and defence, while others emphasize the political motivations behind the spending plans. The headlines reflect a broader debate about the government's fiscal priorities and the long-term implications of the spending review.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended a performance of 'Les MisÃ©rables' at the Kennedy Center against the backdrop of ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles, creating a scene filled with irony and political theater. The choice of the musical, which tells the story of a rebellion against authoritarianism, was particularly striking given Trump's actions, such as sending troops to quell protests. Trump's appearance was met with a mix of cheers and boos, and several drag queens attended in response to his criticism of the venue for hosting drag shows. The event was intended to boost fundraising for the Kennedy Center, but it also highlighted the cultural divide in Washington.</p>

          <p>A former nuclear cruise missile launch site in Onna, Okinawa, has been reopened to the public, offering a glimpse into the island's dark Cold War history. The Mace B cruise missile launch site is the last remaining of four constructed during the US military occupation of Okinawa. The site, restored by Soka Gakkai, serves as a reminder of the US deployment of nuclear weapons on the island despite anti-nuclear sentiment in Japan. The missiles, with a range of over 2,000 kilometers, could strike China and parts of the Soviet Union and were reportedly made ready for war during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>

          <p>Despite promising to break the cycle of political retaliation, South Korea's new President Lee Jae-myung is facing criticism for initiating investigations into his predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, and his wife. Each of the previous six South Korean presidents has faced criminal investigations during or after leaving office, and Lee had vowed to end this pattern. However, he has approved special counsel investigations into Yoon's declaration of martial law and his wife's alleged corruption. Concerns are rising that Lee may be consolidating power and perpetuating a cycle of revenge rather than promoting reconciliation.</p>
