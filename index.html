            <p>Michael Tanzi is scheduled to be executed in Florida for the 2000 abduction and strangling of Janet Acosta, a production worker at The Miami Herald. Tanzi carjacked Acosta during her lunch break, drove her to the Florida Keys, and then murdered her. He confessed to the crime, stating he killed her to avoid being caught. The Florida Supreme Court rejected his appeals, including a claim that his obesity and sciatica would cause unconstitutional pain during the execution. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's new tariffs, dubbed 'Liberation Day,' could inadvertently open the door for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Trump's tariffs have shocked global markets and raised fears of a recession, prompting countries to seek alliances against the US. China applied to join the CPTPP in 2021, and its bid is currently pending. The CPTPP includes countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>As US President Donald Trump continues to instigate a global trade war, the level of engagement between Europe and China has only increased. A diverse range of people in diplomacy, business, academia, art and other professions are reaching out to us to understand life in Hong Kong, as a gateway between the world and mainland China. The reciprocal tariffs also go against the idea of comparative advantage in trade between countries. It seems we live in an era where political strategy eats economics for breakfast.

            <p>Defensive miscues cost the Dodgers two runs on Monday. Stellar defense from the Washington Nationals prevented two, if not more. In the Dodgers’ 6-4 loss at Nationals Park to open a three-game series, that proved to be the biggest difference. The Dodgers (9-3) have committed seven errors, all within the last six games. They have yielded 10 unearned runs, most in the majors. They have even struggled to slow the running game, giving up steals on all 12 attempts by their opponents so far, including three to the Nationals (4-6) on Monday.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has handed down a 5-4 decision tossing out a closely watched district court decision, which blocked President Donald Trump’s attempt to use a 227-year-old law — the Alien Enemies Act — to deport many individuals without due process. Though the Court’s decision in Trump v. J.G.G. is a win for Trump, it is not a total victory. The Court does not express an opinion on whether the Alien Enemies Act actually permits Trump to deport anyone. It also rules that, before anyone is deported under this law, that person must be given “notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.”</p>

He called Vietnam and other countries’ offer of 0% tariffs on U.S. imports “a small first start.” (not investment advice)</p>

Trump offered few details about the upcoming talks, only saying the meeting will be at "almost the highest level."

Trump said it would be in Tehran's best interests to make a deal with his administration. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Donald Trump may continue using a 1798 law to deport alleged gang members to Venezuela, the supreme court ruled on Monday, however it will apply certain limits. Any challenges to the wartime law, called the Alien Enemies Act, must take place in Texas, where the migrants were held, and not in Washington DC, the court said. The Alien Enemies Act authorizes the president to deport, detain or place restrictions on individuals whose primary allegiance is to a foreign power and who might pose a national security risk in wartime.</p>

His comments came during a press conference in Utah, which just became the first state to ban fluoride from drinking water systems. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, also in Utah with Kennedy on Monday, announced that the EPA, too, is reviewing "new science" on fluoride. The American Dental Association said fluoride in water was necessary for good oral health.</p>

However, observers caution that diplomatic talk aside, there appears to have been few actual gains on contentious sticking points, with core disputes lingering over enforcement mechanisms, geographic scope, legal status and the role of external powers. It came shortly after Wang labelled Manila’s frequent maritime frictions with Beijing “a shadow play” controlled by the US and other Western powers, and accused the US of stoking “big power rivalry” by meddling in Asia.</p>
