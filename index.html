          <p>A 26-year-old Brazilian tourist, Juliana Marins, died after falling nearly 2,000 feet from Mount Rinjani, an active volcano in Indonesia. Marins was hiking with a guide and other tourists when the accident occurred, prompting a four-day search and rescue operation. Indonesian authorities used a thermal drone to locate her body beside a crater, complicated by harsh terrain and weather conditions. The Brazilian Foreign Ministry confirmed her death and coordinated with the embassy in Jakarta, while Marins' family thanked Brazilians for their prayers. </p>

Mamdani, who would be the city's first Muslim mayor and youngest in a century, focused on a progressive platform, but the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count with final results expected on July 15. </p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang called on countries to collaborate on trade and avoid turning it into a political or security issue. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, Li emphasized that globalization is irreversible and that engaging in the international economy is a way of reshaping the rules and order. He did not directly address specific trade tensions or conflicts, but highlighted the importance of staying on the right path in international economic relations. Adam Tooze of Columbia University noted that this signals a pluralization of global economic rules. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's governing doctrine of unpredictability is causing tension with international allies, particularly at the NATO summit in The Hague. Trump's disdain for European democracies and resentment of their reliance on the U.S. for security create uncertainty, especially with the ongoing war in Ukraine and conflict between Israel and Iran. European leaders are striving to keep Trump onside while also planning for a potential abandonment, as his volatile style and focus on easy wins undermine coordinated defense efforts and diplomatic relations. Trump's actions are driven by personal motives rather than strategic calculus, leaving allies in a state of constant uncertainty. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is attending the NATO Summit in The Hague with a surprisingly cordial tone, after previously criticizing the alliance. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulated Trump for securing increased defense spending commitments from European members and for brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. While progress has been made on defense spending, Trump cast doubt on the U.S.'s commitment to Article 5, the mutual defense clause, despite assurances from U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker. Rutte urged partners to focus on strengthening their defenses rather than worrying about U.S. commitment. </p>

The study proposes creating a network that utilizes regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents. Researchers acknowledge that establishing such a system requires navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises, such as the Ukraine war. Successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease decarbonization, and enhance resilience against conflict and climate extremes. </p>

          <p>A preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment indicates that recent U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities may have set back the program by only a few months. The assessment, based on unnamed sources, contradicts President Trump's claim that the strikes "fully obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. The White House dismissed the report as "flat-out wrong," while Trump maintained that Iran's nuclear sites are now "completely destroyed." The extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities remains unclear. </p>
