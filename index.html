          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden's actions during his presidency, alleging a conspiracy to deceive the public about Biden's mental state. Trump is questioning the use of an autopen by Biden's aides to sign executive actions, suggesting the public was shielded from knowing who truly wielded executive power. Biden, who ended his re-election campaign due to health concerns, refuted Trump's claims, stating he made all decisions during his presidency. Scrutiny over Biden's mental and physical capacity intensified after a book alleged a cover-up of his physical deterioration during his campaign. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New Zealand Parliament has suspended three lawmakers from Te Pāti Māori for performing a haka in protest of a proposed law. Hana-Rāwhiti Maipi-Clarke received a seven-day ban, while Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi were barred for 21 days, the longest bans in the Parliament's history. The lawmakers performed the haka, a traditional Māori chanting dance of challenge, to oppose a bill they believed would reverse Indigenous rights. The suspensions were approved despite opposition proposals for lighter sanctions, sparking debate about the Parliament's attitude toward Māori culture.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson is accused of murdering relatives with a beef Wellington dish, and prosecutors allege she documented herself using kitchen scales to calculate a lethal dose of toxic mushrooms. Patterson has pleaded not guilty to killing three people and attempting to murder another at her home in regional Victoria in July 2023, claiming it was a tragic accident. During cross-examination, Patterson admitted to foraging for wild mushrooms before the lunch, contradicting her initial statements to the police. The court was shown images from Patterson's phone depicting mushrooms being weighed, which a fungi expert identified as being "highly consistent" with death caps.</p>

There are concerns that weight-loss injections may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill in overweight or obese women. The MHRA has received around 40 reports relating to pregnancy made to its Yellow Card scheme, including some unintended pregnancies.</p>

          <p>Susanna Rustin explores the generational divide in views on sex and gender in Britain, highlighting differing attitudes toward women’s and transgender rights. Recent polls show younger people are more likely to disagree with the legal definition of "woman" being based on biological sex. Rustin argues that valuing inclusion over bodily privacy and fairness is sexist, as women are more disadvantaged by these changes than men. She suggests that as people age, consciousness of sexual difference accumulates across the life-course, influencing their perspectives on gender issues.</p>

          <p>Russia is attempting to revive a strategic triangle with China and India to counterbalance the Western-led international order, despite existing distrust between the two Asian powers. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov criticized NATO's efforts to draw India into "anti-China" initiatives and reiterated Moscow's desire for India and China to restore a three-way mechanism. The border dispute between China and India largely froze bilateral ties until a disengagement agreement was reached in October of the previous year. Russia brokered high-level meetings between senior officials of China and India months after their countries’ border conflict broke out in 2020.</p>

Critics argue that Trump is bypassing the conventional distinction between the armed forces and domestic police.
