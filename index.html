          <p>The Department of Justice is set to investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook following a criminal referral from a Trump administration housing official. The referral, from FHFA Director Bill Pulte, alleges potential mortgage fraud, specifically that Cook claimed two different properties as her primary residence simultaneously. Despite calls for her removal from President Trump and his allies, Cook has stated she has no intention of being bullied into resigning and is gathering information to respond to the allegations. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell does not have the authority to fire a board member; only the U.S. President can, and even that power is limited.</p>

          <p>Fujifilm's new $3 billion biologics manufacturing plant in North Carolina illustrates the significant time and investment required for pharmaceutical companies to increase U.S.-based production. The facility, which has been in development for five years, is opening just as the Trump administration threatens tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing. However, the complexity and lengthy regulatory approval process, typically taking three to five years for a new plant, show that companies cannot quickly pivot their supply chains. Despite these challenges, companies like Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson are investing heavily in U.S. facilities, driven by both tariff concerns and favorable tax policies.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reassessing its transfer strategy after its target, England international Eberechi Eze, is reportedly set to join rival club Arsenal instead. This development has left Spurs searching for a high-quality attacking midfielder with less than two weeks remaining in the transfer window. The club had previously failed in a bid for Morgan Gibbs-White from Nottingham Forest. This article analyzes several potential alternative targets who could fit the team's needs, including Mikkel Damsgaard, Bilal El Khannouss, and Maghnes Akliouche, as fans express their frustration with the club's recent transfer market difficulties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store fell by approximately 10% after the company unveiled a new, simplified logo as part of a broader brand revitalization effort. The new design removes the iconic image of a man leaning on a barrel and the phrase "old country store," which has drawn sharp criticism from many customers and conservative commentators. Critics on social media have linked the change to an embrace of "woke" corporate culture and a move away from the brand's traditional American identity. The negative reaction highlights the risks companies face when updating beloved branding, especially when changes are perceived as politically motivated.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have argued against granting Sean "Diddy" Combs a new trial, stating there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction on two counts of transporting individuals for prostitution. Combs' defense team had filed a motion for acquittal or a new trial, claiming the law was misapplied and that evidence from his acquitted racketeering charges created unfair prejudice. Prosecutors countered that Combs knowingly transported and directed paid escorts across state lines to engage in sexual activity for his own gratification.

          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the massive monetary penalty, exceeding $500 million, imposed on former President Donald Trump and his company in a civil business fraud case. The court ruled that the fine violated the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition against "excessive fines." However, the ruling upheld the original finding that Trump and other defendants committed business fraud by inflating asset values to secure better financial terms. The non-monetary sanctions imposed by the initial judge, designed to curb the company's business practices, were also upheld by the appellate court.</p>

This consumer behavior coincides with major fast-food chains like McDonald's and Wendy's reporting slower sales, particularly among lower-income customers.

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 exchange is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated stocks. This method involves converting assets from a taxable account, like a separately managed account (SMA), into shares of a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches. The investor avoids an immediate tax bill, only paying capital gains when they eventually sell the ETF shares. However, the strategy has strict diversification requirements and high investment minimums, and it can limit an investor's flexibility once their assets are held within the specific ETF.

          <p>The Israeli military has warned medical officials and international aid organizations to prepare for a planned evacuation of Gaza City's one million residents. This move comes ahead of an anticipated ground offensive to occupy the territory's largest urban area. Israeli officials stated that hospitals in southern Gaza are being prepared to receive an influx of patients and that medical equipment is being increased. However, the UN, aid groups, and the Hamas-run health ministry have rejected the plan, warning it would collapse the remaining health system and endanger countless lives, vowing to remain in the city to help those who cannot leave.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive global study analyzing millions of birdsong recordings has found that artificial light pollution is significantly altering the daily routines of birds. Researchers discovered that for over 500 species, light pollution effectively lengthens their day by an average of 50 minutes, causing them to start singing earlier in the morning and stop later in the evening. Species with larger eyes relative to their body size, such as American Robins, were most affected. While it is unclear if this extended activity is beneficial or detrimental, the study provides unprecedented insight into the widespread impact of human-created light on wildlife.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic shift, high-level officials from Syria and Israel have held direct, U.S.-brokered talks in Paris, marking the first such meeting in 25 years. The discussions focused on de-escalating tensions, reactivating a 1974 disengagement agreement, and providing humanitarian aid to Syria's Druze minority. Tensions have been high since the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, with Israel conducting numerous strikes in Syria. The talks represent a potential pathway toward stabilizing the border region and could be a preliminary step toward future normalization, though observers believe that remains a long-term goal.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, is moving away from the North Carolina shoreline but continues to pose a significant threat along the U.S. East Coast. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for "life-threatening surf and rip currents" for most of the coastline, urging the public to avoid swimming. While the storm is not expected to make landfall, storm surge warnings remain in effect for parts of the Outer Banks, where some areas are under evacuation orders. The storm's large size is generating dangerous conditions far from its center, with some buoys recording wave heights of up to 45 feet.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he would personally go out to patrol Washington, D.C., on Thursday night alongside police and National Guard members. The statement comes as his administration has implemented a major anti-crime initiative, which has significantly increased the presence of federal law enforcement and military personnel throughout the city. The administration claims the surge has led to hundreds of arrests and a reduction in crime, although local police data shows violent crime had already been declining. The move is unusual for a sitting president and follows Trump's assertions that the city is now safer.</p>

The Labour government, which has pledged to clear the backlog by 2029, faces ongoing pressure over immigration as the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has risen slightly.</p>

          <p>This article presents an analysis suggesting that Stephen Miller's intense focus on mass deportations, while central to the Trump administration's identity, may be counterproductive to a broader authoritarian project. The author argues that the highly visible and aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, such as the militarized presence in Washington D.C., generate significant public resistance without effectively consolidating power. Unlike more subtle authoritarian methods, these actions are optically severe but lack true repressive capacity, potentially galvanizing opposition and harming the administration's political standing more than they advance its control over democratic institutions.</p>

The mistake, which resulted in profits being overstated, was related to logging income from supplier arrangements in the wrong financial year. The company has now launched an independent review led by Deloitte to investigate the issue. This news has significantly damaged investor confidence, wiping nearly £600 million off the company's market value and drawing comparisons to a previous accounting scandal at the supermarket chain Tesco.</p>

          <p>A record number of pupils aged 17 and older are resitting their GCSE exams in Maths and English, leading educationalists to warn of a "resit crisis." In England, nearly a quarter of all entries for these core subjects were from older students, who must continue studying them if they fail to achieve a passing grade at age 16. However, success rates for these resits are very low, with many pupils becoming stuck in a demoralizing cycle of retaking exams. Experts suggest the issue stems from an overly demanding curriculum and fundamental skills gaps that develop much earlier in a student's education.</p>
