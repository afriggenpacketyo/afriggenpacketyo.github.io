          <p>A Kenyan deputy police chief, Eliud Lagat, has resigned following protests sparked by the death of blogger Albert Ojwang while in police custody. Ojwang was arrested for social media posts accusing Lagat of corruption, and an autopsy revealed his death was due to assault, contradicting police claims. President William Ruto has pledged to protect citizens from rogue police officers and called for a thorough investigation. Lagat stated he would step aside to allow for investigations and provide any necessary support, as two officers have already been arrested in connection with the death. The outrage over Ojwang's death coincides with the anniversary of anti-government protests, highlighting ongoing tensions in Kenya.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a rise after President Donald Trump approved the company's merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent on a national security agreement. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over key decisions such as relocating headquarters, moving production or jobs outside the U.S., renaming the company, and idling plants prematurely. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick elaborated on the government's rights, while Trump described the deal as a "partnership," though U.S. Steel will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. All regulatory approvals have been secured, and the transaction is expected to close promptly.</p>

The venture capitalizes on the association with President Donald Trump, referencing his presidential terms in the plan's name and price, and the phone displays his campaign slogan, reflecting a licensing agreement similar to other Trump-branded products.

          <p>President Trump has instructed ICE to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities, aiming to implement the "single largest Mass Deportation Program in History." He alleges these cities use undocumented immigrants to expand their voter base and grow the welfare state, impacting American citizens' jobs and benefits. This directive follows increased enforcement efforts, with ICE officers expected to make 3,000 arrests daily, a significant increase from previous months. Simultaneously, the administration has paused arrests at farms, restaurants, and hotels due to concerns about labor shortages in key industries, which highlights the administration's conflicting interests.</p>

          <p>In the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial in New York City, a juror was dismissed and replaced with an alternate due to inconsistencies regarding his residency. The judge cited concerns about the juror's candor and potential bias. The dismissed juror, a 41-year-old Black man, was replaced by a 57-year-old white man from Westchester, leaving five alternate jurors remaining. The trial resumed with testimony from a paralegal detailing messages from Combs' assistant about setting up "hotel nights," as Combs faces charges of sex trafficking and racketeering and has pleaded not guilty, potentially facing a life sentence if convicted.</p>

          <p>France closed the stalls of Israeli defense firms at the Paris Air Show, citing a ban on "offensive weapons" displays amid the conflicts in Iran and Gaza, which Israel has condemned. The decision added to the event's tensions, already heightened by the recent Air India crash, with black walls installed around the stands of companies like Israel Aerospace Industries and Elbit. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou defended the decision, stating that while defensive weapons were acceptable, offensive weapons were not, considering the situation in Gaza.

Migrant smuggling is often linked to money laundering, corruption, human trafficking, and drug trafficking, which threatens community safety. Interior and security ministers are tasked with intensifying efforts to track smuggling groups' finances, enhance prevention in origin and transit countries, collaborate with social media companies, and engage with transport operators to prevent irregular migration. The use of sanctions will be considered in countries where smuggling and human trafficking originate, aligning with legal systems.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh is preparing for elections following the fall of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, with the interim government promising a credible poll, but concerns remain about law and order. Interim leader Muhammad Yunus met with BNP leader Tarique Rahman in London to discuss reforms needed before the elections, including constitutional and electoral process changes. The BNP wants elections by February, contingent on progress in reforms, but Tasnim Jara of the National Citizen Party notes uneven institutional readiness. Restoring law and order and ensuring justice for victims of last year's protests are priorities, with the military deployed to tackle lawlessness, though the Awami League's participation is uncertain due to alleged human rights violations.</p>

The summit aims to foster consensus on global challenges, but Trump's trade actions and potential for a global trade war are overshadowing the discussions.

          <p>Savings experts are weighing in on the most beneficial certificate of deposit (CD) term to consider ahead of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. While elevated rates have benefited savers, CD rates have recently inched downward, and further cuts may occur later in the year. Locking in the best CD rates now is crucial, but choosing the right CD term depends on individual circumstances. Short-term CDs may offer the highest interest rates currently, while long-term CDs provide longer-term security and predictability, and CD laddering offers a mix of both strategies, and this is not investment advice.</p>

          <p>At least 22 Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire near aid distribution sites operated by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The UN human rights chief Volker Turk accused Israel of weaponizing food and called for a full investigation into the attacks. The IDF stated it was examining the reports, while UN agencies have refused to work with the GHF, and many of those killed and injured at al-Alam were taken to Nasser hospital. Ahmed Alfara, a doctor at the hospital, reported that many of the casualties on Monday had suffered gunshot wounds, including to the head, and the distribution system had failed.</p>
