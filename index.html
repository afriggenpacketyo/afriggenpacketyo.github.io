          <h2>UK Economy Experiences Unexpected 0.1% Contraction in May</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of contraction and defying analyst expectations of slight growth. The decline was primarily driven by a drop in manufacturing output, weak retail sales, and reduced oil and gas extraction, according to the Office for National Statistics. This development presents a challenge to the government's key priority of boosting economic growth, with officials acknowledging the figures are disappointing but remaining determined to reverse the trend.</p>

          <p>The body of a teenage boy was discovered in Powell's Pool at Sutton Park, Birmingham, after he was reported missing in the water on Thursday evening. West Midlands Police stated that extensive search efforts were made by emergency services before the tragic discovery was made. The death is not being treated as suspicious, and the boy's family is receiving support from authorities during this difficult time. This incident follows a previous drowning in the same lake in 2001 and recent warnings about water safety.</p>

          <p>The European Union is preparing for an escalation in trade disputes following the U.S. announcement of a 35% tariff on Canadian goods, effective August 1. EU officials are concerned as President Trump has indicated that the bloc will also receive a letter outlining new tariffs, suggesting negotiations are not progressing well. This move has caused jitters in financial markets and puts pressure on the EU, which already faces significant U.S. duties on its steel, aluminum, and auto exports, to formulate a response.

          <p>Actor Ewan McGregor's application to replace the roof on his £2 million historic mansion in Scotland has been rejected by the Perth and Kinross Council.

          <p>Australian police have arrested and charged a 37-year-old man for allegedly sending racist messages on social media to a professional basketball player, widely reported to be American star Montrezl Harrell of the Adelaide 36ers. Basketball Australia described the arrest as a "landmark moment" in the fight against online abuse of athletes. The organization reinforced its zero-tolerance policy, stating that the action sends a clear message that such behavior is unlawful and will not be tolerated in the sport.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin layoffs that will reduce its domestic workforce by about 15%, affecting roughly 1,800 employees. The cuts are part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration aimed at streamlining what it calls a "bloated bureaucracy" and focusing on diplomatic priorities. The plan involves layoffs, voluntary departures, and the closure or merger of numerous U.S.-based offices, though critics argue the move could undermine American diplomatic effectiveness.

          <p>A report from the UK's National Audit Office (NAO) has found that the F-35 stealth jet program is being undermined by delays, infrastructure gaps, and personnel shortages. The public spending watchdog stated that while the aircraft is technologically superior, the £11 billion spent so far has yielded a "disappointing return" and that the UK's warfighting capability is being compromised. The NAO also estimated the program's full cost would be significantly higher than Ministry of Defence forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) reported to the UN Security Council that there are "reasonable grounds" to believe war crimes and crimes against humanity are currently being committed in Sudan's Darfur region. An ICC probe uncovered an "inescapable pattern of offending," including targeted sexual violence against women and girls of specific ethnicities, amid the devastating civil war between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The conflict has also caused an escalating famine and massive displacement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a civil lawsuit alleging that prominent Georgia Republican Brant Frost IV ran a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors of at least $140 million.

Frost is also alleged to have personally misappropriated over $19 million of investor money for personal expenses, including jewelry and political contributions. (not investment advice)</p>

As a result, energy analysts are revising down their forecasts for China's oil consumption and accelerating their predictions for when the country's overall oil demand will reach its peak.
