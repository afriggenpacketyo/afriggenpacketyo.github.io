            <p>Mexico is grappling with the issue of banning narcocorridos, a genre of music that glorifies drug trafficking. President Claudia Sheinbaum opposes a ban, advocating for social awareness to discourage the glorification of violence. However, voices within her own party support prohibition. Attempts to ban narcocorridos have existed since the late 20th century, with experts suggesting the new surge in prohibition responds to political demagoguery.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Commerce Department is conducting a national security investigation into imports of semiconductor technology and related downstream products. The probe will investigate the "feasibility of increasing domestic semiconductors capacity" in order to reduce reliance on imports and whether additional trade measures, including tariffs, are "necessary to protect national security." The investigation encompasses a wide range of items, including chip components such as silicon wafers, chipmaking equipment, and "downstream products that contain semiconductors."</p>

            <p>The FIA and F1 are debating the future of engines. A majority of engine manufacturers were opposed to a return to V10 naturally aspirated engines. Noise is one of the factors being considered, as a certain portion of the fanbase do romanticise the ear-piercing sound of the engines from the 1990s and early 2000s. However, it is not clear if that is the majority or not, and how important a consideration it should be.</p>
