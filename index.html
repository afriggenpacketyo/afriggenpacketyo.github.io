          <p>United Airlines issued a ground stop for its flights at multiple major U.S. airports, including Chicago, Denver, and San Francisco, due to a significant technology issue. The airline confirmed the problem was causing widespread departure holds to manage gate availability at destination airports, leading to extensive delays for passengers. While safety was cited as the top priority, the duration of the outage and the full extent of its impact on the evening's travel schedule were not immediately known. The ground stop only affected United flights, with other carriers operating normally.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has terminated approximately $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. The canceled projects, primarily focused on COVID-19 and flu vaccines, involved major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna. Kennedy stated that the department determined mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses, a claim that has drawn sharp criticism from numerous public health experts and scientists. Critics argue the decision is not based on scientific evidence and will hinder the nation's ability to respond to future pandemics and other diseases.</p>

          <p>An analysis in the UK reveals a significant and growing disparity in healthcare access, with patients waiting for mental health treatment facing far longer delays than those needing physical care. The data shows there are 12 times more patients waiting over 18 months for mental health services compared to physical ones, highlighting a systemic inequality. The article features the story of a young woman with complex PTSD who has been on a waiting list for a decade, illustrating the severe personal consequences of the backlog. While some innovative, community-based mental health hubs show promise, they are not yet widely available, leaving thousands without timely support.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his administration's plan to impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made computer chips and semiconductors in a move that could significantly raise the cost of numerous electronic goods. The policy includes a crucial exemption, stating that companies manufacturing their chips within the United States will not be subject to the import tax. The announcement was made during a meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, where the president framed the tariff as a strong incentive for domestic production. This approach marks a shift from prior strategies that used subsidies and tax credits to encourage reshoring of the semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

The mission was requested by the U.S. National Science Foundation after the staff members required medical care unavailable on-site. The operation was conducted in extreme mid-winter conditions, including total darkness and freezing temperatures, which required meticulous planning and analysis of weather and runway conditions. The U.S. Chargé d’Affaires praised the flawless execution of the mission, highlighting the skill and readiness of the New Zealand crew in one of the world's most unforgiving environments.</p>

          <p>Following discussions with President Trump, Apple has committed to investing an additional $100 billion in its U.S. manufacturing and supply chain over the next four years, bringing its total domestic investment pledge to $600 billion. The announcement comes as the company seeks to mitigate the impact of threatened tariffs on its products, which are largely assembled overseas. CEO Tim Cook noted that while final assembly will remain abroad for now, the investment will expand production of U.S.-made components like glass and semiconductors. The move was praised by the White House as a significant step toward bringing more high-tech manufacturing back to the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on India, citing the country's continued purchases of Russian oil. This move will raise the total tariff rate on Indian goods to 50%, one of the highest rates levied by the U.S. on any trading partner, and is set to take effect in 21 days. The White House justified the action by stating that India's imports undermine efforts to counter Russia's actions in Ukraine. India's foreign ministry responded by calling the tariff "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," setting the stage for a significant trade dispute between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

A major downward revision of over 800,000 jobs was actually announced in August 2024, months before the election.

Economists estimate that key export industries such as gems and jewelry, apparel, textiles, and chemicals are the most exposed to the increased duties. However, other major export sectors, including IT services and pharmaceuticals, are not targeted by the current tariffs on goods and are expected to be largely shielded from the direct impact. While the overall hit could be in the billions, the effect on India's benchmark stock index is predicted to be partially insulated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following an assault on a former administration staffer, President Trump stated he is considering taking federal control over Washington D.C.'s police force and potentially overturning the city's home rule. The president suggested bringing in the National Guard and said his lawyers are studying the legality of reversing the 1973 Home Rule Act, which grants D.C. limited self-government. This move represents a significant escalation of ongoing tensions between the White House and the overwhelmingly Democratic city. While Trump cannot unilaterally repeal home rule, it highlights his willingness to use federal power to intervene in local governance.</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Find Evidence of Reoccupation in Pompeii's Ruins After Eruption</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research confirms that some people returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii after the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Evidence suggests that survivors, and possibly others, established a precarious settlement among the ash-covered ruins, living without the infrastructure of a typical Roman city. Researchers believe these inhabitants lived in the upper floors of buried homes and may have scavenged for valuable objects. This discovery alters the historical understanding of the site's immediate aftermath, revealing a period of informal reoccupation that continued for centuries before the city was fully abandoned.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins has stepped down from his role as co-CEO and head of Paramount Pictures, a move that was anticipated ahead of the finalization of Skydance Media's takeover of Paramount Global. Robbins, who had led the film studio since 2021, was part of a three-person leadership team that steered the company through a tumultuous period of business pressures and ownership uncertainty. With the Skydance deal closing, a new senior management team is being installed, with only one of the former co-CEOs, George Cheeks, remaining in a senior role. Robbins' tenure included reinvigorating major franchises like "Top Gun" and "Mission: Impossible."</p>

          <p>Following a visit to Moscow by a U.S. envoy, President Trump has indicated there is a "good prospect" for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The discussions come as a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine approaches, with the threat of new sanctions looming. A White House official confirmed that Russia expressed a desire for a meeting and that Trump is open to it, provided Putin also meets with Zelenskyy. While Trump hailed "great progress" after the envoy's talks, the situation remains tense and the path to a diplomatic breakthrough is uncertain.</p>

          <p>In the escalating technology rivalry with the United States, China is strategically utilizing its dominant position in the global rare earths market. As the U.S. has imposed tariffs and export bans on semiconductor technology to slow Chinese progress, Beijing has retaliated with export controls on key rare earth elements, which are essential for a vast range of technologies. These materials are critical for everything from consumer electronics and electric vehicles to advanced defense systems. Since China controls most of the world's refining capacity, its actions create significant supply chain vulnerabilities for the U.S. and other nations.</p>

The company's strong public debut is another positive sign for the broader IPO market, which has seen a resurgence after a prolonged downturn. (not investment advice)</p>
