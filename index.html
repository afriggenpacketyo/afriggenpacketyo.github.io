          <p>The second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Barry, made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast, bringing maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. The system is expected to weaken as it moves inland but will continue to deliver heavy rainfall, with forecasts predicting three to six inches across several states. This precipitation poses a significant threat of flooding and mudslides in the region over the next couple of days. The National Hurricane Center had issued a tropical storm warning as the system developed, and it is now forecast to dissipate over Mexico. </p>

          <p>In cities like Dessau in eastern Germany, right-wing extremism and nationalist symbols are reportedly becoming a part of youth pop culture, a trend observed across the region. This phenomenon is occurring despite significant economic investment and Dessau's cultural heritage as the home of the Bauhaus movement. The article connects this trend to a history of economic decline post-reunification and a series of racially motivated violent incidents in the city. While many citizens and civic groups are actively opposing this shift, the far-right AfD party's growing political strength, including the election of a mayor with a neo-Nazi past, underscores the deep-seated challenges.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 49.7 in June, indicating a third straight month of contraction, though it was a slight improvement from May. While production and new orders showed minor growth, factory employment and inventory levels continued to fall, signaling persistent economic weakness. The data highlights ongoing struggles with a supply glut and weak consumer demand, compounded by a producer price deflation that has now lasted for over two years. Economists suggest that additional fiscal stimulus from Beijing will be crucial to boost domestic demand and stabilize the industrial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two firefighters were killed and another person was injured in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after being ambushed by a gunman while responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain. The attack triggered a large-scale, multi-agency manhunt for the shooter. Authorities later reported that a deceased male, believed to be the suspect, was found on the mountain with a firearm nearby, and a shelter-in-place order was subsequently lifted. Investigators are considering the possibility that the fire was intentionally set to lure first responders into the ambush, an act Idaho's governor called a "heinous direct assault."</p>

          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of Japanese seafood from certain regions, partially lifting a blanket ban that was imposed in 2023. The initial ban was a response to Japan's release of treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. However, the suspension remains in effect for ten Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. This move is seen as a potential step toward resetting diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries, which had been strained over the issue. The ban's extension last year had covered all aquatic products from Japan, impacting the industry significantly.</p>

However, the United States, historically a major contributor to international aid, has withdrawn its participation from the event and rejected the negotiated outcome document. The U.S. cited objections to proposals concerning the governance of financial institutions, tax policies, and the U.N.'s role in global debt architecture. The absence of the U.S. presents a significant challenge to the conference's goal of reversing escalating debt burdens and declining investment in developing countries.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large technology companies just one day before the first payments were due. The reversal came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade negotiations with Canada in response to the tax, which would have applied a 3% levy on firms like Amazon and Google. Canadian officials stated the move was made in anticipation of a new comprehensive trade agreement and would support a resumption of negotiations. The tax, which was to be applied retroactively to 2022, was designed to address a gap where tech giants earned significant revenue from Canadians without being taxed locally.

However, the agreement has drawn criticism from British farmers, who argue their sector was used as a bargaining chip to secure concessions for the auto industry.

The blockades followed a massive rally where an estimated 140,000 people demanded snap elections and the release of activists arrested in previous protests. The protest movement was initially sparked by a deadly train station roof collapse in November 2024, which critics blame on government corruption and negligence. President Vucic has rejected the demands for an early election, accusing the movement of causing "terror" and being fueled by foreign powers.</p>

The incident, which was broadcast live by the BBC, drew condemnation from festival organizers and the British prime minister, who called it "appalling hate speech." The BBC has since removed the performance from its on-demand service, and local police are reviewing the footage to determine if any criminal offenses were committed. In a statement, Glastonbury organizers said the chants "very much crossed a line" and that there is no place for antisemitism or incitement to violence at the festival.</p>

A fourth guest, an uncle, fell seriously ill but survived. The defense contends that the poisoning was a tragic accident and that Patterson panicked, leading her to lie to police.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Russia's passive response to the recent military conflict between its ally Iran and Israel demonstrates Moscow's declining credibility and power on the world stage. The author contends that Russia's deep involvement in the war in Ukraine has drained its military and economic resources, leaving it unable to effectively support its allies. Despite a strategic partnership with Iran, which has supplied Russia with drones and missiles, Moscow offered only platitudes and calls for mediation rather than tangible support when Iran was attacked. This inaction is presented as part of a broader pattern of strategic neglect, undermining Russia's image as a reliable global superpower.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, studies are revealing they are more likely to induce motion sickness than traditional combustion engine cars. Researchers attribute this to the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly the regenerative braking systems. This feature, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery, can cause low-frequency deceleration that provokes queasiness in passengers. According to Chinese researchers, this issue affects not only passenger comfort but also their health, as it can cause feelings of tension and fidgetiness during travel.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that came hours after President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. The threat was a response to Tillis's refusal to support the president's major tax and spending bill, citing concerns over its proposed Medicaid cuts. In his announcement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, stating that leaders with independent thinking are becoming an "endangered species." His retirement will open up a key Senate seat in a state that has reliably voted Republican in recent presidential elections.</p>

          <p>An attorney for the family of Oscar Omar Hernandez, the 13-year-old boy allegedly murdered by his soccer coach, has revealed that the cause of death was acute alcohol poisoning. This finding raises new questions about the circumstances leading to the seventh-grader's death while he was visiting his coach, Mario Edgardo Garcia Aquino. Garcia Aquino has been charged with murder with a special circumstance of committing the crime during lewd acts with a child. The case has also brought to light that Garcia Aquino was the subject of two previous investigations into alleged misconduct with children, though he was not charged in either case.</p>

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that recent U.S. airstrikes caused "severe damage" to Iran's nuclear facilities but did not completely destroy them. He cautioned that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to restart its program if it chooses to do so. His assessment appears to contradict more optimistic claims from U.S. officials that the program was obliterated, aligning more closely with a Defense Intelligence Agency report suggesting only a setback of several months. Grossi emphasized the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to verify the status of Iran's nuclear materials and facilities.</p>

          <p>The official UK Covid-19 inquiry is set to begin examining the pandemic's devastating impact on the social care sector, a phase long-awaited by bereaved families. The inquiry will investigate key government decisions, such as the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes in early 2020 without testing, which is blamed for seeding the virus among vulnerable residents. It will also scrutinize issues like the use of blanket "do not resuscitate" notices and restrictive visiting policies. Nearly 46,000 care home residents in England and Wales died with Covid, and families are seeking accountability for what they describe as one of the pandemic's clearest failures.</p>

He noted that while some players had minimal rest before the tournament, the entire squad will face a relentless calendar. Guardiola acknowledged the arguments made by others, like former Liverpool manager JÃ¼rgen Klopp, about the punishing nature of the tournament but stated his professional obligation to follow the rules set by FIFA and UEFA. He aims to remain relaxed and focus on the competition, but conceded he might feel differently about the exhaustion and its impact later in the season.</p>

The law has been used to suppress dissent and has led to the arrests of numerous activists and the dismantling of opposition groups.
