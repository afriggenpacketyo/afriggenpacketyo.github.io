        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by implementing reciprocal tariffs, a significant setback to his economic agenda. The court determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally impose sweeping duties. The ruling specifically addresses tariffs related to drug trafficking with Canada, Mexico, and China, deeming them invalid as they do not address the threats outlined in the orders. The court has ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs, but the Trump administration has swiftly appealed the decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. will "aggressively" revoke visas for Chinese students, particularly those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.

This move could affect many of the approximately 280,000 Chinese students in the U.S. and further strain the already tense bilateral relationship between the U.S. and China. The decision also poses a challenge to the American higher education system, which relies on international students for tuition revenue and research talent.</p>

His exit follows criticism of Trump's budget bill, which Musk believes undermines DOGE's efforts by increasing the federal deficit.

          <p>A panel of federal judges has blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs on China and other trading partners, ruling that federal law does not grant him the authority to tax imports from nearly every country. The U.S. Court of International Trade found that Trump's tariffs exceeded the authority granted by the emergency powers law. The ruling threatens to undercut the administration's efforts to reach trade agreements globally. The Trump administration has immediately filed plans to appeal.</p>
