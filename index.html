          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake was reported in the New York City metropolitan area on Saturday night. The U.S. Geological Survey identified the epicenter as being near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, at a depth of approximately 10 kilometers. While no significant damage was reported, residents in parts of the area experienced brief shaking from the seismic event. The occurrence was unexpected for the region, which does not typically experience notable earthquake activity, causing some surprise among the local population.</p>

          <p>Over three decades after four teenage girls were murdered in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, leaving a lasting scar on the community and the victims' families. The 1991 crime involved the brutal killing of Eliza Thomas, Jennifer and Sarah Harbison, and Amy Ayers, followed by the shop being set on fire. Despite multiple suspects, arrests, and even overturned convictions, investigators have never definitively identified the perpetrators. Advances in DNA technology offer a glimmer of hope, as a small sample of male DNA found on a victim could one day lead to a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a method for creating an "electromagnetic storm eye" in electronic warfare scenarios. The technology would utilize a swarm of drones to simultaneously jam enemy signals while creating a null-zone, or safe bubble, around friendly forces where communications remain clear. By precisely adjusting signal waveforms, the system could effectively neutralize interference for allied units. This represents a significant advancement over traditional omnidirectional jamming, which disrupts all signals within its range, including those of friendly forces.</p>

          <p>Musician Justin Timberlake announced that he has been diagnosed with Lyme disease, describing the illness as potentially "implacably debilitating." In an Instagram post, he shared that he considered ending his Forget Tomorrow tour upon diagnosis but chose to continue performing, citing the joy it brings him. Lyme disease, transmitted by ticks, can cause flu-like symptoms, joint pain, and neurological issues but is typically treatable with antibiotics. Timberlake expressed gratitude for his family's support and uncertainty about his future on stage, but said he would always treasure his performance experiences.</p>

          <p>Recent films depicting the Nanking massacre have renewed reflection in China, particularly among younger generations, about the historical trauma that continues to shape the nation's identity and foreign policy. For many Chinese citizens, the event is not just a historical tragedy but a profound moral wound that they feel has never been adequately acknowledged or atoned for by the Japanese government. The author notes that the brutal images and stories from the massacre are deeply ingrained in the collective memory. This shared trauma reinforces a sense of national history and influences contemporary perspectives on international relations.</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old man in Polk County, Tennessee, was arrested after police discovered 14 improvised explosive devices in his home. Officers were executing a warrant for Kevin Wade O'Neal, who had allegedly threatened to kill public officials and law enforcement personnel. During the arrest, police noticed a device smoldering in his bedroom, prompting an evacuation and the deployment of a bomb squad. O'Neal is now facing 11 counts of attempted first-degree murder, corresponding to the officers and other individuals present when he allegedly tried to detonate the explosives.</p>

The suspect, who was reportedly intoxicated, was recorded on video driving the cart through the airport's hallways. The footage shows the vehicle crushing metal and shattering glass as it was driven down the walkways, causing significant damage. The man was arrested and charged with criminal mischief, grand larceny, and criminal possession of stolen property, among other offenses.</p>

          <p>British comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather from cancer at age 54 was a key catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Hill explained that his stepfather's inability to enjoy retirement made him re-evaluate his own life path. The 60-year-old, who had qualified as a doctor, felt unsuited for the profession, recalling an instance of breaking bad news to a patient's family where he felt "completely out of my depth." This pivotal moment set him on a new, and ultimately successful, path in entertainment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for approximately £30 million, despite his recent statements expressing a desire to stay with the club. The potential sale is linked to the club's interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While United sources indicate they could sign a new player without first selling, an exit would likely be necessary to comply with the Premier League's profit and sustainability regulations. If Sesko were to arrive at Old Trafford, Hojlund's position in the team would likely become marginalized, prompting the club to consider a sale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a leading advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more "careful" with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts with China's vigorous embrace of open-source AI, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are rapidly releasing advanced models. According to Stanford adjunct professor Andrew Ng, China's competitive open-source ecosystem may be a path for it to surpass the U.S. in AI development.

          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia to the UK in 1943. The animal, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift during World War II, but it perished just days before arrival. While long-standing rumors blamed the trauma of a nearby German U-boat attack, new analysis of the attendant's logbook suggests a different cause. Records of water and air temperatures show the ship crossed the equator in conditions far too hot for the creature, leading researchers to conclude it likely died from heat stress.</p>

Schake warns that if the current international order collapses due to American choices, protecting U.S. interests will become far more costly and difficult.

          <p>In her new book, "From The Clinics To The Capitol," author Carol Mason argues that the American anti-abortion movement has become increasingly intertwined with far-right and white nationalist extremism. Mason traces the evolution of rhetoric from simply opposing abortion to ignoring the rule of law, a sentiment she sees as a precursor to the January 6 insurrection. She contends that shared conspiracy theories and a framework of protecting "Western Christian civilization" have created a bridge between these movements. The book suggests this convergence is pushing the anti-abortion movement toward more absolutist and theocratic goals.</p>

The proposed law, part of a broader immigration bill, could result in up to five years in prison for those creating online material that facilitates breaches of UK immigration law. According to the Home Office, a vast majority of migrants arriving by boat report using social media to contact people-smuggling gangs.
