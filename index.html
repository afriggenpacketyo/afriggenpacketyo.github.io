          <p>The Tennessee Supreme Court has set a 2026 execution date for Christa Gail Pike, who would be the first woman executed in the state in over 100 years. Convicted for a brutal 1995 murder when she was 18, Pike has been on death row for nearly three decades. Her attorneys have argued that her history of severe mental illness and childhood abuse was not adequately presented at her trial. They contend that modern juries would be unlikely to sentence someone with her background and young age at the time of the crime to death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of recent books, particularly Thea Riofrancos's "Extraction," highlights the significant paradox of the green energy transition: reducing fossil fuel reliance requires extensive mining for minerals like lithium and cobalt. This extraction often devastates local environments and disproportionately harms Indigenous and poor communities, leading to water contamination, displacement, and political upheaval. Riofrancos argues against this false choice, suggesting that reimagining societal structures, such as promoting mass transit over individual electric vehicles, could drastically reduce mineral demand and lead to a more just and sustainable future.</p>

          <p>Todd Arrington, the director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, has resigned under pressure after a conflict with the Trump administration. The dispute arose when Arrington resisted a request to give an original Eisenhower sword from the library's collection to King Charles III as a diplomatic gift. Arrington argued that the artifact was the property of the American people and instead helped procure a replica. He stated he was told to "resign — or be fired," believing he was no longer trusted with confidential information following the incident.</p>

          <p>A research team from Purdue University is preparing an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate a submerged object they believe is Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The "visual anomaly," identified in satellite imagery from a lagoon on Nikumaroro, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. The team plans to use sonar and magnetometers to scan the object before attempting to dredge it for identification. If confirmed, the discovery would solve one of aviation's greatest mysteries and fulfill Earhart's plan to return the plane to the university.</p>

          <p>A deadly terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur, which killed at least two people, has underscored the rising threat of antisemitism. Data shows a dramatic escalation in anti-Jewish incidents in both the U.K. and the U.S., particularly following the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Experts argue that the failure of political leaders to effectively counter extremist narratives on both the far-left and far-right has contributed to the normalization of antisemitic sentiment. The violence occurred as global efforts continue to secure the release of 46 Israeli hostages held by Hamas.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals AI Can Design Dangerous DNA Sequences That Evade Biosecurity Screening</h2>

          <p>A new study has demonstrated that artificial intelligence can be used to create DNA codes for toxic proteins that bypass existing biosecurity measures. Researchers used an AI program to generate thousands of variants of hazardous proteins, finding that the screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies failed to consistently flag them as dangerous. Although a software fix was quickly developed, it is not foolproof, highlighting a significant vulnerability as AI accelerates the potential for misuse of advanced biological tools. The findings raise urgent questions about regulating access to such powerful technology.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Reports 7% Rise in Q3 Deliveries Ahead of Expiring Federal EV Tax Credit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 13:53:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year, narrowly beating analyst expectations. The rise in deliveries was partly driven by a rush of U.S. buyers seeking to take advantage of a federal EV tax credit that expired at the end of the quarter. Despite the delivery beat, the company's vehicle production declined slightly year-over-year, and its stock dipped following the report. The results reflect a partial recovery from a sales slump in Europe and ongoing competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French authorities have charged the Chinese captain of the oil tanker Boracay, which is believed to be part of Russia's "shadow fleet" used to circumvent international sanctions. The vessel was boarded by the French navy because it was on an EU sanctions list for transporting Russian oil. The captain was charged with refusing to comply with naval orders after being unable to provide coherent information about the ship's flag. The incident highlights the ongoing efforts by Russia to use a covert network of tankers to continue its oil exports despite Western sanctions.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has responded to Donald Trump's recent characterization of Russia as a "paper tiger," asserting that his forces are advancing in Ukraine while fighting against nearly the entire NATO alliance. Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Group, Putin warned that any perceived provocation from Europe would be met with a swift response from Moscow. He dismissed concerns about a potential Russian attack on a NATO member as "impossible to believe" and advised the alliance to "cool down" and focus on its own domestic problems.</p>

          <p>At least eight people, including three police officers and five civilians, have been killed during violent protests in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The demonstrations, which began on Monday, were sparked by public anger over high costs and lucrative benefits for the political elite, such as free electricity. In response to the escalating unrest, authorities have blocked internet services and businesses have gone on strike. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has offered to form a committee to investigate the violence and engage in dialogue with protesters.</p>

          <h2>Polling Indicates Decline in Trump's Support Among Latino Voters Over Economic Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polling suggests that President Trump's support among Latino voters, a key demographic in his 2024 election victory, is waning primarily due to economic issues like high grocery and housing costs. A New York Times/Sienna poll found that 69% of Hispanics disapprove of his job performance, and a majority believe he has worsened the economy. However, this decline in approval for Trump has not translated into significant gains for Democrats, who are being advised to articulate a clear plan for how they will improve the lives of Latino families.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, President Trump has framed the situation as an opportunity to implement significant cuts to federal agencies, guided by his budget director, Russ Vought. Vought, a key architect of the conservative "Project 2025" plan, has already begun to act, canceling nearly $8 billion in climate-related funding and freezing $18 billion for infrastructure projects in New York. This aggressive approach, which includes plans for permanent reductions and employee firings, is being celebrated by the administration but is causing concern even among some Republicans.</p>

Occidental Petroleum plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO believes will stabilize the company's finances and allow for the resumption of stock buybacks.
