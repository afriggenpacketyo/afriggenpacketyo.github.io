          <p>The Trump administration has announced a proposal to increase the fee for H-1B visas, used by high-skill foreign professionals, to $100,000. This policy aims to encourage companies to hire American workers and generate revenue for tax cuts and debt reduction. However, economists like Britta Glennon from the Wharton School argue this move will harm the US economy by stifling innovation and driving companies to offshore jobs. The article suggests the fee would disproportionately hurt startups and universities, making the US less attractive to global talent, and proposes alternative reforms like raising the visa cap and implementing a salary-weighted lottery system instead.

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a major storm currently in the Atlantic, is being monitored for a potential interaction with a nearby developing weather system. This rare meteorological event, known as the Fujiwhara effect, occurs when two storms get close enough to orbit a common center or merge. According to meteorologists, the outcome depends on the storms' relative strengths; typically, a stronger storm absorbs a weaker one, though two storms of similar size might "dance" around each other before separating. While a merger is considered unlikely in this case, any interaction could slightly alter the forecasted paths of both systems.</p>

          <p>Actor Michael Richards, famous for his role as Kramer on "Seinfeld," has returned to the public stage for the first time in nearly 20 years. His career was derailed in 2006 after he was filmed making a racist outburst at a comedy club. In his new tour, Richards is candidly discussing the incident, explaining that he spent the subsequent 17 years in a self-imposed exile to reflect on his actions and find faith. During his hiatus, he turned down numerous acting offers to focus on personal growth, spending time in nature to find order within himself.</p>

          <p>A new book by Kamala Harris, titled "107 Days," is analyzed as a confirmation of the steep challenges she faced during the 2024 presidential campaign, which she entered after Joe Biden's withdrawal. The article argues the memoir details these difficulties without acknowledging her own strategic failures, such as her choice of Tim Walz as a running mate, whom she criticizes for a poor debate performance. The review portrays Harris as indecisive and timid, failing to connect with voters on key issues like immigration and inflation. It concludes that the book reveals a politician who struggled to articulate a compelling message and ultimately failed to win over the electorate.</p>

          <h2>Political and Religious Rhetoric Frames Charlie Kirk's Killing as 'Spiritual Warfare'</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, prominent allies of the Trump administration are framing the event not as a political or cultural issue, but as a "spiritual war." Figures like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and influencer Benny Johnson are using language associated with the New Apostolic Reformation, a charismatic Christian movement, to describe a cosmic battle against evil. This rhetoric casts political opponents as demonic forces and calls for followers to metaphorically put on the "full armor of God." The article suggests this framing is mobilizing a segment of the Christian right that views politics through a theological lens of divine conflict and dominion.</p>

          <p>An estimated 800 million children worldwide suffer from lead poisoning, with a primary and often overlooked source being the informal recycling of lead-acid batteries. In many low- and middle-income countries, used car batteries are broken open in unsafe conditions, releasing toxic lead dust that contaminates local communities and ecosystems. This neurotoxin causes irreversible harm, including impaired IQ and premature death, costing the global economy trillions annually. The article highlights that proven policy solutions exist, such as Brazil's model of removing taxes on scrap batteries and implementing "extended producer responsibility" laws, which shift the economic incentives toward safer, regulated recycling facilities.</p>

          <p>Denmark has reported multiple drone sightings over its military installations, including the major Karup airbase, prompting brief airspace closures and raising national security alarms. This follows a series of similar incidents at airports in Denmark, Norway, Germany, and Sweden, which Danish authorities have described as a potential "hybrid attack." While no direct evidence has been presented, there is growing suspicion that these coordinated incursions could be part of an indirect Russian strategy to pressure NATO states that support Ukraine. The incidents have heightened tensions across Europe, which is already on high alert due to recent Russian violations of Polish and Estonian airspace.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have resulted in at least 38 fatalities across Gaza, according to local health officials, as the conflict continues to exact a heavy toll on civilians. The attacks occurred shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the United Nations, stating that Israel "must finish the job" against Hamas, despite dozens of delegates walking out in protest. International pressure for a ceasefire is mounting, with the U.S. indicating that negotiations for a deal to release hostages and ease fighting are ongoing.

These communities, like the Michigan Rocky Horror Preservation Society, keep the film's interactive traditions alive through midnight screenings featuring shadow casts that mimic the on-screen action and audience members who shout callbacks. For many, the film and its surrounding culture have provided a safe space for self-expression, particularly for queer and neurodivergent individuals.

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has announced that Berlin is aiming to secure a deportation agreement with Syria by the end of the year. The proposed deal would initially target Syrian criminals and later expand to include rejected asylum seekers who are reliant on social benefits. This marks a significant policy shift, as Germany has not deported anyone to Syria since 2012. Dobrindt emphasized a distinction between well-integrated individuals and those without legal residency rights, instructing the migration office to resume reviewing paused asylum applications. The German government is also seeking to establish more systematic deportations to Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is championing an ambitious youth migration deal with the European Union, hoping it will improve the country's economic outlook ahead of the autumn Budget. The proposed scheme would allow individuals aged 18-30 to live and work in the UK for a few years, which Reeves argues would be beneficial for economic growth and business. She is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to incorporate the potential positive economic impact of this scheme into its official forecasts. This move could potentially reduce the need for significant spending cuts or tax increases to address a projected fiscal gap of £20-30 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration has launched a series of actions that critics describe as an unprecedented assault on free speech, creating a rift on the political right. These actions include pressuring a media company to suspend TV host Jimmy Kimmel, threatening networks with license revocation, and vowing to prosecute "hate speech," which is constitutionally protected. While most Republicans have supported these moves, some libertarians and conservatives are speaking out, arguing that the administration is abandoning long-held principles of free expression.

          <p>President Trump's tendency to brazenly publicize actions that past presidents would have concealed is reshaping the nature of political scandals, according to observers. By openly admitting to controversial behavior, such as pressuring the Justice Department to investigate rivals, he appears to desensitize the public and take the sting out of what would typically be career-ending revelations. This strategy, combined with the sheer volume of controversies, creates a constant state of background noise that diminishes the impact of any single event. Supporters perceive this as authenticity, while critics warn it normalizes corruption and erodes institutional norms by making blatant misconduct seem acceptable simply because it is not hidden.</p>

The impasse is caused by deep partisan divisions, with Democrats demanding extensions for healthcare subsidies and a rollback of Medicaid cuts in exchange for their votes.

Prominent Democrats are now using stronger language on social media and in public appearances, aiming to punch back harder against the administration's policies.

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's killing, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum directing federal law enforcement to focus on "domestic terrorism," a move critics fear is a blueprint for political vengeance. During the signing, Trump and his advisors broadly targeted the American left, referencing Black Lives Matter and suggesting professionally made protest signs were evidence of organized agitation. This has drawn comparisons to historical periods of political suppression like McCarthyism, with opponents arguing the administration is weaponizing a tragedy to suppress dissent. The White House has dismissed these concerns as hypocritical, asserting it is taking necessary action against radical left-wing violence.</p>

Both actors ultimately rejected the advice and went on to achieve massive success with their given names.

Independents also tend to oppose the use of troops, viewing it as an overreach of presidential authority. Despite official data showing a decrease in violent crime from pandemic highs, public perception remains that crime is unacceptably high, though this has not translated into widespread approval for military-style policing on American streets.</p>

          <p>A 53-year-old man from Albany, New York, has been charged with murdering his parents after confessing to the crime during a television interview with a local news station. Lorenz Kraus told the anchor that he had suffocated his parents, Franz and Theresia, eight years ago and buried their bodies in the backyard of their home, claiming it was a mercy killing because their health was declining. Police, who had been investigating the parents' disappearance in connection with financial crimes, discovered human remains on the property shortly before the interview aired. Kraus was arrested immediately after the on-air confession and has pleaded not guilty to murder and concealing a corpse.</p>

          <p>For the past ten years, Toledo tattoo artist Brian Finn has dedicated his days off to providing free or low-cost tattoos for people seeking to cover scars from traumatic experiences. His clients include survivors of domestic abuse, human trafficking, and self-harm, for whom the tattoos can be a powerful tool for healing and reclaiming their bodies. Finn explains that some people want to completely conceal their scars, while others choose designs that incorporate and transform them into meaningful art. After an initial NPR story in 2015 brought his work to national attention, he inspired a community of other artists worldwide to offer similar services, and he has no plans to stop.</p>

          <p>The American state fair, a beloved pastime contributing $30 billion annually to the economy, has evolved significantly since its origins in the 19th century. Initially established as agricultural competitions for showcasing livestock and farming techniques, modern fairs have transformed into large-scale events resembling pop-up theme parks. While the agricultural roots remain central, with animal exhibits and craft competitions for coveted ribbons, fairs now also feature live music from major stars, amusement rides, and a vast array of fried foods. This blend of tradition and entertainment has ensured the state fair's enduring popularity as a staple of American culture from summer through fall.</p>

          <p>Iran has summoned its ambassadors from Germany, France, and the United Kingdom for consultations ahead of the expected reimplementation of United Nations sanctions. The European nations initiated the "snapback" mechanism last month, accusing Tehran of failing to be transparent about its nuclear program. Barring a last-minute diplomatic breakthrough, the sanctions are scheduled to automatically come back into effect this weekend. The move signals a further deterioration in relations between Iran and the West, as talks held during the UN General Assembly in New York failed to resolve the stalemate over the country's nuclear activities.</p>

The All Blacks established an early lead with three tries in the first half, but the Wallabies fought back to trail by only three points at halftime. Despite Australia closing the gap to three points again late in the second half, a decisive try from scrum-half Cam Roigard sealed the win for New Zealand and placed them at the top of the Rugby Championship standings.</p>

          <p>The urban planning principles long championed by King Charles are significantly shaping the design of a new wave of towns set to be announced by the UK government. A housing ministry official confirmed that 12 new towns will be developed with an emphasis on walkability, environmental friendliness, and "gentle density" like terraced housing rather than high-rise buildings. These concepts align closely with the King's vision, as seen in his projects like Poundbury, which prioritize traditional building styles and community-focused public spaces. Once criticized by the architectural establishment, the King's views on creating harmonious and human-scale environments are now being embraced as part of mainstream design.</p>

          <p>A 100-year-old mystery has been solved with the identification of two Scottish soldiers killed during the World War One Battle of Loos. The remains were discovered on a construction site in France in 2021, and a painstaking investigation by the UK's "war detectives" unit followed. Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson was identified through tiny tramway buttons found with his remains, which linked him to his father's job in Newcastle, a detail confirmed by a DNA match with his great-nephews. Lieutenant James Grant Allan was identified after the team traced and tested the families of 14 missing officers from his regiment, finally bringing closure to both families after a century of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The cost of policing ongoing protests in Epping, Essex, is projected to reach £1.7 million by October, according to the local police, fire and crime commissioner. The demonstrations began after an asylum seeker staying at The Bell Hotel was charged and later jailed for sexual offenses in July. While most protests have been peaceful, some have resulted in disorder and injuries to officers, leading to 32 arrests. The commissioner noted that the significant police response has required a "substantial level" of resources, and the force will have to absorb the entire cost unless it exceeds the £4 million threshold for government assistance.</p>

The U.S. State Department condemned the remarks as "reckless and incendiary."

          <p>South Korea is facing a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate, one of the lowest in the world, threatens to undermine its economic growth. Projections from the Bank of Korea warn that the shrinking workforce could lead to a prolonged downturn and potentially an economic contraction by the 2040s. Despite the government spending over $270 billion on incentives to encourage childbirth, the fertility rate remains far below the replacement level of 2.1. This demographic cliff also poses significant challenges for the nation's pension system and military readiness, raising concerns that the "Miracle on the Han River" could be undone by a shrinking population.
