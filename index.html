        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, his previously stated strong support for the death penalty has gained renewed attention. In past public discussions, Kirk advocated for applying capital punishment in most murder cases, not just in extreme instances, arguing for a "blind justice" approach where taking one life is as morally significant as taking many. These resurfaced comments provide context to the current discourse, as Utah's governor and President Trump have both called for the death penalty for Kirk's suspected killer. Kirk had also publicly supported televising executions to potentially deter crime.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff commented on competitor Palantir, stating he is "so inspired" by the data analytics company, particularly its high market valuation relative to revenue. However, he also reiterated his critique of Palantir's pricing, calling it "the most expensive enterprise software I've ever seen" and joking that perhaps Salesforce isn't charging enough. The comments highlight the growing rivalry between the two companies, which compete for government and enterprise contracts. Despite Salesforce being much larger by revenue, Palantir has seen faster growth and has achieved a significantly higher market capitalization.</p>

          <p>Officials have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The arrest concluded a 33-hour manhunt, with the breakthrough coming after Robinson's family members reportedly recognized him from FBI images and urged him to surrender. Investigators found a rifle believed to be the murder weapon, along with bullet casings bearing anti-fascist and other messages. According to family members, Robinson had become more political recently and had expressed animosity towards Kirk's viewpoints, calling him a purveyor of hate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has placed an agent on administrative leave and revoked his security clearance after he made negative comments about the late Charlie Kirk on social media. The agent, Anthony Pough, wrote a Facebook post suggesting Kirk's rhetoric invited "karma." In an internal memo, Secret Service Director Sean Curran emphasized that agents must remain unbiased and avoid adding to the problem of rising politically motivated attacks. The agency stated it will not tolerate behavior that violates its code of conduct and has launched an investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>Stellantis's Ram brand has officially canceled its development of a fully electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, attributing the decision to slowing demand for battery electric vehicles in North America. The project had already faced multiple delays from its original 2024 launch target. Instead of the all-electric model, the company will focus on launching an extended-range electric truck, the Ram 1500 REV, which includes a gasoline engine that acts as a generator. This strategic shift reflects a broader reassessment of product strategy under new Stellantis leadership amid changing market conditions for EVs.</p>

          <p>A significant water supply failure at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, has forced the relocation of migrants and raised further doubts about the facility's capacity to handle large populations. The disruption, caused by structural damage to an underwater pipeline, affected the Migrant Operations Center, prompting officials to move detainees to a different part of the base. Critics argue this incident underscores that Guantánamo's infrastructure is inadequate for the administration's plan to house thousands of migrants there.

          <p>The state of Massachusetts has filed a lawsuit against the predictions market platform Kalshi, accusing it of operating as an illegal sports gambling business without the required state license.

The state is seeking a court order to halt Kalshi's sports-related offerings in Massachusetts while the case proceeds.

          <p>This article analyzes the political reactions to Charlie Kirk's assassination, noting that leading Democratic figures have unequivocally condemned the killing and all forms of political violence. It contrasts this unified condemnation with a narrative among some on the right who have sought to portray the left as celebrating the attack, often by highlighting comments from anonymous social media users. The author argues this reflects a structural difference between the parties, where the Democratic establishment marginalizes violent sentiment, while some Republican rhetoric aims to justify its own extremism by positing a violent left-wing threat.</p>

Kirk's mastery of social media and his focus on in-person debates created a powerful brand that resonated with young people's desire for open, and often controversial, discussion.

          <p>The White House's search for the next Federal Reserve chair has included a new candidate: Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income. Rieder recently interviewed with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the selection process for Jerome Powell's successor. The discussion reportedly covered monetary policy and structural reforms for the central bank. Rieder joins a list of candidates that includes former Fed governors and prominent economists as the administration considers new leadership ahead of the Fed's next meeting, where an interest rate cut is widely anticipated.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, alleging the company systematically violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The lawsuit claims Uber discriminates against passengers with disabilities by refusing rides to those with service animals, denying service to people with wheelchairs, and failing to properly train its drivers on ADA compliance. The DOJ asserts that these practices leave individuals with disabilities stranded and unable to access essential transportation. Uber has stated that it disagrees with the allegations and maintains a zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican-controlled legislature has passed a new congressional map designed to give the GOP an additional seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. The plan, which now awaits the governor's signature, redraws districts to dismantle a Kansas City-area seat currently held by Democrat Emanuel Cleaver. This mid-decade redistricting effort is part of a national strategy supported by Donald Trump to strengthen the narrow Republican majority in the House. Opponents have condemned the map as a partisan gerrymander and are planning to collect signatures to force a statewide referendum on the issue.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced that the EU will fast-track its review of the planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine cars. The decision comes in response to pressure from European automakers, who cite significant challenges including high manufacturing costs, lack of charging infrastructure, and intense competition from Chinese electric vehicles. Industry leaders, including Mercedes-Benz, have called the 2035 target "no longer feasible" and are pushing for a relaxation of the rules to allow for other low-emission technologies like hybrids. The review signals a potential shift in the EU's aggressive decarbonization strategy.</p>

The protests were initially sparked by a social media ban but grew into a wider movement against the political elite.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, market watchers are focused on the record $7.6 trillion held in high-yield money market funds. A prevalent theory suggests this "wall of cash" could flow into stocks and bonds as yields on cash-equivalent investments decline, potentially fueling a market rally. However, some experts are skeptical, arguing that a large portion of these funds belongs to institutional and corporate investors who are unlikely to shift into riskier assets. They contend that only a return to near-zero interest rates would prompt a significant outflow from these funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As mortgage rates fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year ahead of an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to act strategically. Experts suggest that timing is critical, as lenders often price in Fed moves in advance, meaning the best rates may appear before an official announcement. It is also crucial for buyers to improve their credit scores, as the lowest rates are reserved for the most qualified applicants. Finally, the article reminds buyers to secure pre-approval to make their offers more competitive and to prioritize finding the right home over waiting for the perfect rate.
