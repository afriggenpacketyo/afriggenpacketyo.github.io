          <p>The Senate GOP passed a budget resolution, a crucial step for President Trump's domestic agenda, including making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. The plan allows for over $5 trillion in tax cuts and $521 billion in spending for GOP priorities like border enforcement and defense. However, differences between the House and Senate versions, particularly on how to pay for the tax cuts, pose a significant challenge. The Senate plan also includes raising the debt limit by $5 trillion to avoid a potential financial default later in the year, with economists warning of global economic consequences if the U.S. defaults.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of 10% tariffs on all U.S. trading partners sent shockwaves through the stock market, resulting in a significant sell-off and plunging the Nasdaq into a bear market. The tariffs, intended to open foreign markets and reshape the U.S. economy, have been met with retaliatory measures from China and potential countermeasures from the European Union. Economists have criticized the rudimentary math behind the tariffs, warning of potential inflation and a slowdown in growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the tariffs would likely boost inflation, further dampening hopes for a market recovery. (not investment advice)

          <p>A study in Wales involving over 280,000 people suggests that older adults who received a shingles vaccine were 20% less likely to develop dementia over a seven-year period. The research leverages a "natural experiment" due to Welsh health policy, comparing individuals just eligible for the vaccine to those just outside the age range. Scientists theorize the protective effect could be related to the vaccine's impact on inflammation, a known factor in cognitive decline. This finding supports growing research that neurodegenerative diseases may be linked to viral infections, potentially revolutionizing dementia research and treatment.</p>

This move could lead to increased public exposure to chemicals linked to cancer, hormone disruption, and other health issues. The EPA's new risk evaluation process would make it more difficult for states to regulate these chemicals, potentially undermining existing protections.

          <p>Elon Musk's potential departure from his formal role in the White House does not signify a break from the Trump administration. While his official position as a "special government employee" may end, Musk is expected to remain a close advisor to the president. His influence extends beyond his government role, encompassing significant financial contributions, key positions held by his allies in federal agencies, and the use of his businesses to further government services. This enduring relationship ensures Musk's continued impact on US politics and policy.</p>

          <p>The increasing brightness of car headlights, particularly LEDs, is causing concern among drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists. While brighter headlights are intended to improve driver safety, they can also create dangerous glare and reduce visibility for others. Factors contributing to the problem include the color of LED lights, the intensity of headlights, and the lack of federal regulations limiting brightness. The article explores potential solutions, such as better headlight aim, adaptive beam technology, and civic action to advocate for change.</p>

The author explains that ULA, while intended to fund low-income housing, has depressed sales, reduced revenue, and slowed the production of market-rate and affordable apartments. The article suggests potential state-level solutions, including restricting the tax to single-family homes or adopting marginal rates, to mitigate the tax's adverse effects while preserving its revenue-generating goal.
