          <p>Ten candidates vying for California governor in 2026 offered their perspectives on Governor Gavin Newsom's tenure and outlined their own policy agendas. Democrats Toni Atkins, Xavier Becerra, Katie Porter, Tony Thurmond, Antonio Villaraigosa, and Betty Yee generally praised Newsom's actions like redrawing districts or investments in education, while also suggesting areas for improvement such as housing or fiscal accountability. Republicans Chad Bianco and Steve Hilton criticized Newsom, with Bianco calling his actions a White House bid, and Hilton focusing on housing costs. Other candidates like Stephen Cloobeck (Democrat) and Butch Ware (Green Party) also shared their views on Newsom's public engagement, immigration, and the homeless crisis, highlighting a diverse range of opinions on the state's direction.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Kirk, 31, was killed during an outdoor debate, in what officials described as a targeted attack. Robinson, who is not a student at the university, was identified through video footage and messages on Discord where he allegedly confessed. His father urged him to surrender. Investigators recovered a high-powered rifle and bullets with inscriptions, and DNA evidence is being processed. The motive remains unclear, but family members noted Robinson had become more political and expressed dislike for Kirk.</p>

          <p>President Trump initially claimed unfamiliarity with the assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman when questioned about why flags were not lowered for her, contrasting with his order for Charlie Kirk. He suggested he would have complied if the governor had asked, but previously called Governor Tim Walz "whacked out." Critics argue Trump and Republicans disproportionately blame the left for political violence while overlooking attacks on Democrats. This incident highlights perceived political bias in official responses to violence and a broader partisan divide in acknowledging such tragedies across the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>A mural honoring conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Pensacola's Graffiti Bridge was defaced with hateful messages like "a good Nazi is a dead Nazi" and "Free Palestine" after a community vigil. In response, a group of young supporters took it upon themselves to restore the mural, covering the vandalism with Bible verses and positive messages. They emphasized the importance of respect and open debate, contrasting Kirk's advocacy for free speech with the act of silencing through violence or hateful vandalism. This act of restoration reflects a community's effort to maintain a respectful tribute amidst political division.</p>

This surge followed President Donald Trump's positive remarks on US-China trade negotiations and a "framework" deal regarding TikTok's divestment. Other Asian markets, including South Korea's Kospi and Australia's ASX/S&P 200, also saw gains. In the US, major averages closed higher as investors anticipated a Federal Reserve meeting, reflecting global market optimism and pushing key indices to new record highs. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision is significant as Trump aims to reshape the Fed's board, and Cook's continued presence maintains a measure of independence against the president's aggressive rate-cut campaign.

          <p>Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger strongly criticized California's partisan effort to redraw congressional districts, which he views as undermining democratic principles. He urged students to vote against Proposition 50, a measure championed by Governor Gavin Newsom to boost Democratic representation. Schwarzenegger, a long-time advocate for independent redistricting, reflected on Charlie Kirk's assassination as a tragic consequence of extreme political polarization. He warned that the nation's political climate is spiraling towards a "cliff," blaming social media and political parties for dividing Americans. Schwarzenegger called for unity and respectful disagreement to preserve democracy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's upcoming state visit to the UK is fraught with potential controversies, echoing his contentious 2019 visit. Despite meticulous planning, diplomatic tensions, such as the dismissal of the UK ambassador to the US, and anticipated protests loom. The visit prioritizes ceremonial "optics" for the White House, focusing on royal pageantry and photo opportunities, rather than substantive policy discussions. While the UK government hopes to secure trade deals and influence US policy on Ukraine, profound differences on key global issues like NATO and the Middle East persist. This visit highlights the complex interplay of diplomacy, domestic politics, and international relations.</p>

          <p>A survey reveals that nearly a quarter of UK healthcare staff in NHS dementia services feel unable to provide optimal care, with fewer than a third deeming current diagnostic processes fit for purpose. Alzheimer’s Research UK warns that the system is failing to keep pace with the nearly one million people living with dementia, over a third of whom lack a formal diagnosis. Carers reported significant delays, with one in five waiting over two years for a diagnosis after visiting their GP. The charity advocates for specialist referrals within six weeks and comprehensive treatment plans within 18 weeks, highlighting an urgent public health priority.</p>

          <p>President Trump proposed that US companies switch from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a move he believes would save money and allow managers to focus on long-term strategy. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is actively reviewing this proposal. Trump previously raised the idea during his first term. Supporters argue quarterly reporting often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits, while critics contend it provides crucial transparency for investors. The change could be implemented by a majority SEC vote, potentially aligning US practices with those in the UK and EU. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers from UCLA and The Bay Foundation are releasing a temporary, non-toxic pink dye into Santa Monica Bay to study how ocean circulation affects its poor water quality. The project aims to understand the impact of the manmade breakwater, built in the 1930s, which is believed to hinder water flow and contribute to high levels of fecal bacteria near Santa Monica Pier. The dye, visible to beachgoers, will be tracked by fluorescent monitors and buoys to gather data.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China is gaining momentum to reshape the global order, a shift not seen since the Cold War. Examples include Kenya de-dollarizing its debt to yuan, Slovakia securing Chinese rare earths, and the advancement of the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline. The article highlights "holistic shifts" like the US giving Beijing a "hall pass" on Ukraine and a potential China-India reset. While China is winning across Eurasia, its export growth has slowed, and emerging markets cannot fully replace Western purchasing power. The crucial question remains what Beijing will do with this rising influence, given its own need for stable trade and development.</p>

          <p>Five women were awarded a combined $13.6 million by a Torrance jury, which found the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District negligent in preventing a longtime teacher and baseball coach, Garry Poe, from sexually assaulting teenagers.

Despite Poe's claims of consensual relationships post-graduation, the jury sided with the victims, who testified to lifelong trauma.

          <p>Tesla's board is proposing an almost trillion-dollar compensation package for Elon Musk, contingent on the company reaching an $8.5 trillion valuation and operational milestones. This move comes despite Musk's divided attention across multiple companies and his public political engagements. The board justifies the package by asserting Musk's presence is crucial for Tesla's valuation and future success, aiming to incentivize his dedication to the company. Critics, however, question the unprecedented amount and the board's "apostle-like" defense, especially given Musk's past controversies and the risks he poses to the brand. The proposal highlights unique corporate governance challenges at Tesla. (not investment advice)</p>
