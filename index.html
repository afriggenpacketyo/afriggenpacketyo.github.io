          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Michigan next Tuesday, marking his first visit since the 2024 election victory in the state. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the rally in Macomb County, celebrating the administration's first 100 days, though specifics of the discussion remain undisclosed. This visit mirrors Trump's tradition of campaigning in Michigan on the eve of past elections. Michigan's Governor Whitmer has recently engaged with Trump on economic matters, including tariffs impacting the auto industry, which are a significant concern for Michigan auto dealers and the state's economy.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of U.S. colleges and universities have jointly condemned President Trump's "political interference" in higher education, triggered by funding freezes and threats to suspend grants. Harvard University, among others, has sued the administration over demands to alter policies and leadership, including auditing for "viewpoint diversity". The universities assert their commitment to free exchange of ideas and oppose government intrusion and coercive use of research funding. The White House claims its actions are a reaction to antisemitism and a desire to reverse diversity programs, following campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that if the U.S. cannot reach deals with other countries in the next few weeks, he will impose tariffs. He mentioned ongoing direct contact with China to work out a deal but provided no specifics on progress. The markets rallied after Trump softened his stance on China and indicated he would not fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. This announcement comes amid existing trade tensions and market uncertainty, as Trump's administration continues to use tariffs as a negotiating tactic.</p>

          <p>President Trump's job approval rating has steadily declined during his first three months in office, dropping to around 45% according to a New York Times polling average. Disapproval of his performance has risen to about half of the country. While presidents typically see approval ratings wane over time, Trump's decline is occurring at a slightly faster pace than his predecessors. He began his term with the second-lowest approval rating for a president in modern history, only surpassing his initial approval rating during his first term.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that nearly half of U.S. residents live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution, particularly smog and soot, with climate change exacerbating the problem. While air quality improved significantly after the Clean Air Act, recent years have seen a resurgence in pollution due to wildfires and extreme heat. The EPA is considering rolling back environmental regulations, which could worsen air quality and impact public health. Black communities are disproportionately affected due to historical systemic racism and the placement of pollution sources in disadvantaged areas.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk indicated he would scale back his involvement with the federal government, though he would continue advocating for lower tariffs. This shift comes after a period where Musk wielded significant influence in Washington, driving changes across the government, particularly through his Department of Government Efficiency.

          <p>The FBI reported that online scams resulted in a record $16.6 billion in losses in 2024, a 33% increase from the previous year. Investment scams were the top cause of loss, followed by compromised business emails and tech support scams. Cryptocurrency was the primary method used by scammers, and older adults were disproportionately affected, losing an average of $83,000 each. These figures likely underestimate the true scope of the problem, as many incidents go unreported, indicating a growing challenge in cybersecurity and financial fraud.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea, claiming it hinders peace negotiations. Trump suggested a deal was close but Zelenskyy's stance prolongs the conflict. This follows Vice-President Vance's proposal to freeze territorial lines near their current positions, implying concessions from both sides. Ukraine has consistently rejected ceding Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Meanwhile, Russia intensified attacks on Ukraine, despite a brief lull over Easter, underscoring the ongoing conflict and challenges to achieving a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A dozen states have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the legality of its tariff policy. The states argue that the policy is unlawful, based on the president's whims, and has brought chaos to the American economy. The lawsuit challenges Trump's claim that he can arbitrarily impose tariffs and asks the court to block government agencies from enforcing them. The states claim that only Congress has the power to impose tariffs.</p>

          <p>Former England striker Eni Aluko says Ian Wright and other male broadcasters and presenters risk blocking female pundits getting opportunities in women's football. Aluko suggests Wright needs to be aware of how much he works in the women's game because there are a "finite amount of opportunities" for women. She highlights the limited spaces available and the need to ensure women are not being blocked from pathways into broadcasting in the women's game.</p>
