          <p>Top economic officials from the U.S. and China met in Geneva to discuss de-escalating the trade dispute marked by tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Vice Premier He Lifeng, with dim prospects for a major breakthrough. President Trump hinted at lowering tariffs to 80%, a move that would relieve financial markets. The article suggests that even a small reduction in tariffs would send a positive signal, emphasizing that the best outcome would be a mutual agreement to de-escalate the tariff war.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has been strategically positioning China to dominate global supplies and counter foreign pressures, particularly from the United States. Since 2020, Xi has focused on increasing exports and strengthening China's manufacturing base, leading to retaliatory measures such as export restrictions on critical minerals. This strategy aims to make adversaries think twice before imposing tariffs or cutting China off, but it also carries costs for China, including strained relationships with trading partners and potential economic imbalances. The article suggests this approach marks a significant shift in China's relationship with the world, challenging U.S. supremacy.</p>

          <p>The military conflict between India and Pakistan escalated significantly as Pakistan accused India of attacking its air bases, leading to retaliatory actions. The reported exchange of strikes marks a major escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbors, who have been engaged in armed conflict for several days. The international community, including the G7, has urged restraint, warning that further military escalation poses a serious threat to regional stability. The conflict began following an attack in Kashmir, with both sides using drones and exchanging gunfire.</p>
