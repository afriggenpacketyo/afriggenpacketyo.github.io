The new vaccine uses a lower dose and targets the immune system more precisely. The restrictions reflect concerns from Health Secretary Robert F.

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), one of the world's largest reforestation efforts, faces questions about its effectiveness due to satellite data and field reports. The article suggests that the program has struggled with resource plundering and the replacement of native forests with monoculture plantations. An analysis of satellite images indicates that deforestation occurs on some NGP lands, and investigators allege "greenwashing" tactics are used. Communities often lack long-term access to the land and are pushed to grow cash crops, undermining sustainable livelihoods. </p>
