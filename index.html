          <p>A sudden lightning strike at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey, resulted in one fatality and thirteen injuries. The incident occurred during a children's archery competition, with witnesses describing the earth exploding without any prior warning of a storm. The deceased was identified as Robert Montgomery, a 61-year-old volunteer club member who was praised for his charitable work with kids. The injured, including a 7-year-old, were transported to local hospitals for various injuries, prompting a message of prayer from Governor Phil Murphy for those affected by the tragic event.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, leading to a modest rise in its stock price. The company's net sales increased by 1% to $22.73 billion, driven by international performance, as it continues to face softer consumer demand in North America. Despite the positive results, overall worldwide volume for its food products declined and remained flat for beverages, indicating ongoing challenges. PepsiCo maintained its full-year forecast, anticipating low-single-digit organic revenue growth and largely unchanged core earnings per share from the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old Russian woman and her two young daughters, aged six and four, were found living in a cave within a remote, snake-infested forest in Karnataka, India. Police discovered the family during a routine patrol intended to warn tourists about potential hazards in the area. The woman, identified as Nina Kutina, had been meditating and living peacefully in the cave for over a week, telling authorities she was interested in worshiping God in the forest. She and her children are now in a detention facility for overstaying her visa and are awaiting repatriation to Russia.</p>

          <p>An Israeli raid in Gaza City has reportedly struck the Catholic Church of the Holy Family, resulting in multiple injuries, including the parish priest. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the attack on the church, which was sheltering approximately 500 displaced civilians, including both Christians and Muslims. The Israel Defense Forces acknowledged reports of the incident and stated that the circumstances are currently under review, reaffirming their efforts to mitigate harm to civilian structures. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem confirmed the damage and injuries but stated there were no confirmed fatalities from the raid on the religious site.</p>

          <p>Changes to the federal student loan system under the Trump administration are raising concerns that many borrowers will lose access to affordable payment plans. The "SAVE" plan, introduced by the Biden administration, is now defunct, and a new bill is set to phase out other income-driven repayment options for future borrowers. Advocates warn that the new "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP) will feature significantly higher monthly payments, potentially doubling the cost for some compared to the SAVE plan. This shift could increase the risk of loan defaults, leaving many borrowers without manageable options to handle their education debt. (not investment advice)</p>

This move highlights major challenges for Germany's goal to become carbon-neutral, including the high cost and insufficient supply of green hydrogen.

          <p>Weeks after being deployed by the Trump administration to counter protests against federal immigration raids, many National Guard troops and Marines in Los Angeles appear to have little to do. With protests having subsided, their duties have largely shifted to guarding federal buildings, leading to reports of tedium among the service members. California Governor Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass are now demanding the complete removal of the remaining troops, calling the deployment "political theater." An estimated 90% of the troops have not been on daily missions, raising questions about the necessity and purpose of their continued presence.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying the squirting cucumber, a toxic relative of the common cucumber, for its remarkable ability to ballistically disperse its seeds. When ripe, the fruit becomes pressurized with fluid and, upon the slightest touch, explodes to launch its seeds at speeds up to 30 miles per hour. Scientists used high-speed videography and CT scans to discover that the fruit ripens at a perfect ballistic angle of around 50 degrees for maximum distance. The seeds are also coated in a supremely sticky slime, which could inspire new bio-adhesives and materials for applications like soft robotics or drug delivery.</p>

Despite having previously apologized for the letter, she told the BBC she did not regret the incident.

These synthetic projects, created using platforms like Suno and Udio, can generate entire songs from simple prompts and are becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from human-made music. While some see AI as a creative tool, many artists and industry professionals view it as a threat that devalues human creativity and makes it harder for real musicians to gain traction and earn a living.

Some supporters are expressing frustration and impatience, demanding the release of a rumored "client list" associated with the disgraced financier. This has led to online turmoil and calls for the removal of top law enforcement officials. The Justice Department recently stated it found no evidence that such a list exists, a concession that has thrown some corners of the MAGA movement into chaos, even as other supporters remain confident that Trump will release information when ready.</p>

The government acknowledged the need for further economic improvement, while the opposition criticized the rising unemployment. Many economists suggest that April's increase in employer National Insurance contributions has discouraged hiring, contributing to the slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>
