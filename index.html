          <p>In the aftermath of deadly flash floods in Texas Hill Country, dozens of active and former Navy SEALs have volunteered to assist in search and recovery efforts. Leveraging their expertise in difficult terrain and diving, the SEALs are navigating the debris-filled Guadalupe River to locate victims and provide closure for families. The volunteers, working with the non-profit 300 Justice Road, described the devastation as unprecedented, with the emotional toll being particularly heavy when discovering children's belongings from a nearby camp. The community effort highlights a strong local response, with volunteers providing thousands of meals to support the ongoing recovery operations.</p>

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in Florida led investigators to a complex and volatile "throuple" relationship involving her boyfriend, Zach Abell, and his other partner, Christina Araujo. The investigation revealed a history of alcohol-fueled violence and jealousy within the trio, which culminated in Seiden's brutal death in a motel room. Araujo accepted a plea deal and testified against Abell, detailing a horrific assault. Abell was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison, while Araujo received a 25-year sentence for her role in the crime.</p>

          <h2>Federal Immigration Raids on California Cannabis Farms Result in Over 300 Arrests and One Fatality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 22:53:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal authorities arrested over 300 undocumented immigrants during raids on two California cannabis farms, an operation that also involved protests and clashes with agents. One farm worker died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof during one of the raids, though authorities state he was not being pursued by law enforcement at the time. The events prompted a tense standoff between demonstrators and federal agents, leading to several injuries and four arrests for assaulting officers. A federal judge has since temporarily halted similar immigration raids in Southern California following a lawsuit by civil rights groups.</p>

          <p>The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of a person who appeared to fire a handgun at federal law enforcement officers. The incident occurred during clashes between protesters and agents conducting immigration raids in Camarillo, California. U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli released images and video of the suspect, who was wearing a black t-shirt and a white medical mask. In response to the confrontations, President Trump stated he has authorized law enforcement to use necessary means to arrest anyone assaulting them, emphasizing a zero-tolerance approach to such actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly supported Attorney General Pam Bondi amid growing criticism from his supporters over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The administration's decision not to release more records, and its confirmation that a rumored "client list" never existed, has caused significant fallout, including a reported confrontation between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. Trump urged his base to remain unified and shift focus away from the Epstein case, which has failed to deliver the bombshell revelations many had anticipated.

          <p>This article explores the reasons behind Boeing's 2015 decision to cease production of its iconic C-17 Globemaster III military transport aircraft, despite its unique capabilities. The primary factors were a lack of new orders from the U.S. Air Force and significant defense budget cuts under the 2011 Budget Control Act. The high cost of purchasing and maintaining the C-17 also contributed to its discontinuation. Although the Long Beach factory that produced the jet is now closed, recent global conflicts have reportedly sparked renewed interest, leading to speculation about whether Boeing might consider resuming its production.</p>

While proponents tout health benefits like no cholesterol and less saturated fat, the industry faces challenges, including high costs, regulatory hurdles, and declining sales in the broader plant-based cheese market.

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to the vital Rubaya coltan mining site in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which is currently under the control of M23 rebels. The mine, which supplies a significant portion of the world's coltan for electronics, employs thousands of miners working in difficult conditions. An M23-appointed supervisor claims the rebel group has brought security and order to the site, which generates substantial revenue through taxation. The report comes after a US-brokered ceasefire deal between DR Congo and Rwanda, with speculation that US mineral rights were a key factor in the negotiations.</p>

          <p>After several years of declining viewership, the reality TV show Love Island is experiencing a resurgence, with its social media growth, particularly on TikTok, outpacing its television ratings. The show's official accounts have gained 1.8 million followers in 2025, with a million of those on TikTok alone. Content creators and former contestants note that short-form clips, recaps, and analysis make the show more accessible to busy viewers who may not commit to watching the full hour-long nightly episodes. This shift in consumption habits is fundamentally changing how audiences engage with the show and its contestants.</p>

Concurrently, smoke from widespread wildfires in Canada has drifted into the U.S., causing unhealthy air quality across much of the Upper Midwest, including Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Dakotas.

          <p>Devastating flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas resulted in at least 129 deaths over a holiday weekend, with dozens of people, including children at a summer camp, still missing.

          <p>Investigators have begun a two-year excavation at the site of a former church-run mother-and-baby home in Tuam, Ireland, where a mass grave is believed to contain the remains of 796 babies and young children. The St Mary's home, which operated from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children, who were often separated. The grave's existence was uncovered by an amateur historian, and a 2017 test dig confirmed "significant quantities of human remains." The complex and challenging excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a long-awaited and painful truth to light for survivors and relatives.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, mandating a halt to the "indiscriminately" detention of individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The ruling, which also bars officials from denying detainees access to lawyers, came in response to a lawsuit filed by immigrants and U.S. citizens who were unlawfully detained. Judge Maame Frimpong cited a "mountain of evidence" of unconstitutional "roving patrols" that targeted individuals based on race or language.

Although bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan was credited with the win, Ohtani's dominant start provided the momentum the team desperately needed.
