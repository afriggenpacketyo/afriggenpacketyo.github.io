          <h2>Study Finds Foreign-Owned Companies Contributed to 25% of China's Corporate Emissions Over Two Decades</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 00:00:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by Chinese and British universities found that multinational enterprises were responsible for a quarter of all corporate carbon emissions in China over a 20-year period. The research, published in Nature Communications, highlights that these emissions often create an imbalance, with wealthier coastal regions reaping economic benefits while inland areas bear a greater environmental burden. The findings raise new questions about how to assess carbon emission responsibilities for foreign firms operating within China, a factor the researchers say is often overlooked in climate discussions.</p>

          <p>The first direct air shipment of Cambodian durians has arrived in China, establishing a new four-hour cold chain logistics corridor for fresh fruit between the two nations. Durian is now the fifth Cambodian fruit approved for direct import into the Chinese market, a move that signifies deepening agricultural trade ties. While Cambodia's annual durian output exceeds 120,000 tonnes, some industry insiders express caution regarding the fruit's commercial competitiveness against established suppliers. This development is part of what some observers call China's "durian diplomacy."</p>

          <p>In a significant act of cooperation, Mexico has transferred 26 prominent cartel figures to U.S. custody to face charges for crimes including drug trafficking and murder. The extradited individuals include leaders from groups like "Los Cuinis," an affiliate of the CJNG cartel, and figures tied to the Sinaloa Cartel. This move follows a similar transfer in February and is part of a deal where the U.S. agreed not to seek the death penalty. The action underscores increased collaboration on security between the Trump and Sheinbaum administrations amid ongoing pressure to curb drug smuggling.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts jury has acquitted Karen Read of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, though she was convicted of driving under the influence. The verdict concludes a highly publicized retrial that captivated the public with its complex and contentious details. The defense successfully argued that Read was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, countering the prosecution's claim that she intentionally struck O'Keefe with her vehicle and left him to die in a snowstorm.</p>

The meeting, set to occur at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, follows a deadline Trump set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions. The White House has framed the summit as a "listening exercise" for Trump, who has been actively pushing for a resolution to the conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not expected to attend but will reportedly meet virtually with Trump and European leaders beforehand.</p>

While the White House stated the deployment is to pursue violent criminals, critics point to data showing a significant drop in violent crime in the city.</p>

          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested, becoming the first former first lady in the country's history to face such a measure. The charges against her include stock fraud, bribery, and influence peddling, which she has denied. Prosecutors sought the arrest warrant over fears she might destroy evidence related to allegations that she accepted luxury items as bribes and failed to disclose them. Her husband, Yoon, is also facing trial for insurrection after an alleged attempt to impose martial law.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate hundreds of National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants for UCLA that were abruptly frozen.

Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, argues that moving Chrome to an independent operator would benefit the public.

A study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that while 10-year survival for melanoma is now above 90%, it remains below 20% for lung, stomach, and esophageal cancers, and under 5% for pancreatic cancer. Researchers attribute the gap to difficulties in early detection and fewer treatment options.

The poll shows Mamdani with 44% of support among registered voters, followed by former Governor Andrew Cuomo at 25%, who is running as an independent. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, also running as an independent, polled at just 7%. While Mamdani has a strong lead with younger voters, Cuomo performs better with Black and Jewish voters, and leading centrist Democrats have not yet endorsed Mamdani.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has informed the Smithsonian Institution of its plan to conduct a wide-ranging review of its 19 museums to ensure exhibits are "patriotic" and free of "divisive or anti-American ideology." According to a White House letter, the review is intended to align the museum complex with a presidential directive ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. The initial review will focus on eight major museums, including the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, scrutinizing everything from exhibit text to curatorial processes.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced the rollout of ten new vans equipped with live facial recognition (LFR) technology to seven additional police forces in England. The technology, which scans faces in public and compares them against wanted lists, will be used to locate suspects for serious crimes like homicide and sexual offenses. The government cites the technology's success in London, where it led to 580 arrests in a year. However, civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch have condemned the move as an "alarming" expansion of the surveillance state without a proper legal framework.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to the car and motorcycle driving theory test starting in early 2026. The goal is to better equip the 2.4 million people who take the test each year with life-saving skills, as drivers are often the first to arrive at an emergency scene. Learning materials have been updated to include information on how to perform CPR and use a public defibrillator. Evidence suggests immediate CPR can increase cardiac arrest survival rates from under 10% to as high as 70%.</p>

This admission follows a 2022 historical report which found that French forces were responsible for mass displacements, internment camps, and supporting brutal militias, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths.

The data showed that July's inflation rate held steady at 2.7%, below economists' forecasts, fueling hopes that the Federal Reserve will have the justification to cut interest rates in September. Traders increased their bets on a rate cut, which would lower borrowing costs and stimulate the economy. The positive market movement also came after President Trump delayed some tariffs against China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peach harvests at some California farms are down by as much as 30% this year due to warmer winter weather, which has disrupted the essential "sleep" cycle of the fruit trees. Stone fruit trees require a certain number of hours below 45 degrees to regulate their nutrients and produce a full crop, a process interrupted by inconsistent cold. This reduction in supply is affecting consumers, who are now paying more per pound for peaches. One family farm found that its oldest groves, irrigated with traditional methods, were more resilient to the temperature swings.</p>
