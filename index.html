          <p>Ether and related crypto stocks experienced significant gains, with ether's price reaching its highest point since January. This surge coincided with the passage of the GENIUS Act, a major stablecoin regulation bill, which is now awaiting the president's signature. For the first time, daily inflows into ether-based ETFs surpassed those of bitcoin ETFs, signaling a potential shift in market leadership within the cryptocurrency space. Analysts suggest that Ethereum is showing strong momentum, potentially reversing its previous trend relative to Bitcoin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation found that TikTok's platform makes hundreds of videos promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery easily accessible to underage users, despite its own community guidelines prohibiting such content for those under 18. By creating an account for a hypothetical 15-year-old, researchers discovered that simple searches led to content idealizing dangerously low-calorie diets and thin body types. Once engaged, the algorithm recommended more of this harmful content, raising concerns among health experts and advocacy groups about the platform's effectiveness in protecting young users.</p>

          <p>Intense monsoon rains have caused devastating floods in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province, leading to the deaths of at least 63 people in recent days. The country has experienced significantly more rainfall this month compared to the previous year, with nearly 200 fatalities reported nationwide since late June. Authorities have issued warnings, advising against travel to affected areas and banning activities in swollen rivers and canals. With forecasts predicting more heavy rain, there are growing concerns of a repeat of the catastrophic 2022 floods.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess, a move that grants it access to significant oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting a claim from Exxon Mobil that it held a right of first refusal over Hess's assets. The outcome affirms the common industry practice that such rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. Chevron's CEO indicated that the integration of the two companies will likely result in some headcount reductions as part of ongoing efficiency efforts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order establishing "Schedule G," a new classification for federal employees in policy-related roles, making them at-will political appointees. This move is presented by the White House as a way to dismantle the "deep state" and improve government operations by streamlining appointments. Critics, however, argue that it is another attempt to politicize the nonpartisan civil service, similar to the controversial "Schedule F" proposal.

A DHS official accused the judge of promoting "gender ideology fanaticism" and ignoring the rule of law, stating the decision undermines policies designed to protect women in custody. The migrant, who is seeking asylum after allegedly being assaulted by cartel members in Mexico, was released after the judge ruled her detention lacked proper procedural safeguards.

          <p>A new book by author Philippa Langley challenges the long-held historical belief that the two young princes, Edward and Richard, were murdered in the Tower of London in the 15th century. Langley, who previously helped discover the remains of King Richard III, argues that her decade-long "Missing Princes Project" has uncovered significant evidence suggesting both princes survived. The research reframes the famous case as a missing persons investigation rather than a murder, pointing to documents that support a rebellion led by a surviving son of King Edward IV.

          <p>German farmers harvested the lowest quantity of strawberries and asparagus in recent memory this year, according to new data from the Federal Statistical Office. The decline is driven by a significant reduction in the land area dedicated to these crops, as many growers find them economically unviable due to rising labor and production costs. Consequently, these seasonal favorites are becoming luxury items for consumers, with prices for asparagus up 4% from last year. This trend is causing Germany's self-sufficiency in these products to fall, highlighting the economic pressures on the country's agricultural sector.</p>

          <p>Following his order to seek the release of grand jury materials related to Jeffrey Epstein, President Trump suggested that the files are unlikely to contain a "smoking gun." In a social media post, he questioned why Democrats hadn't used any incriminating information during their time in power if it existed, labeling the ongoing intrigue a "hoax." This move to manage expectations comes after a week of intense pressure from his supporters to release more information. The president's comments aim to quell the conspiracy theories that have long animated parts of his base regarding the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>The driver involved in the fatal crash at a Wimbledon preparatory school last year, which killed two eight-year-old girls, has been interviewed by police following her re-arrest.

The Crown Prosecution Service had previously indicated she may have suffered an epileptic seizure.

          <p>The United States government is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all visitors requiring a nonimmigrant visa. This fee, part of a recently enacted law, is in addition to existing visa application costs. The provision states that travelers may be reimbursed if they comply with all visa conditions, including not overstaying.

          <p>A "no tax on tips" provision included in President Trump's recent legislative package has been enacted, but its implementation details remain unclear. The law does not eliminate taxes on tips but creates a federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000, which is set to last from 2025 through 2028. Tips are still subject to payroll and state taxes. The IRS is expected to provide clarification in October on which specific occupations qualify for the deduction, leaving many tipped workers and tax professionals uncertain about eligibility and how to apply the new rule.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's long-standing strategy of exploiting conspiracy theories is now backfiring with the Jeffrey Epstein case. For years, Trump fueled and benefited from baseless narratives like QAnon, which often centered on powerful figures involved in pedophile rings. Now, as he tries to conclude the inquiry into Epstein, he faces a revolt from his own supporters who have been conditioned to distrust official narratives. The author suggests the situation is grimly ironic, as the post-truth world Trump helped create is now too unwieldy for him to control, particularly on a potent topic.</p>
