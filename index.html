          <p>Melissa Turner was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2019 stabbing death of her boyfriend, Matthew Trussler. While Turner claimed she acted in self-defense during a physical altercation, prosecutors presented crucial evidence from security cameras that undermined her account. Audio from a neighbor's camera captured her yelling threats, and video from an in-home camera showed her angrily following an unarmed Trussler just before the incident. This evidence was pivotal in the jury's decision to find her guilty, leading to a sentence of over 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A top White House economic advisor, Stephen Miran, downplayed the likelihood of President Trump's tariffs causing significant price increases for consumers. Speaking on CNBC, Miran compared the odds of such inflation to rare events like pandemics or meteor strikes, stating there is currently no evidence of it occurring. Economists, however, suggest that price hikes have been delayed due to the phased implementation of the tariffs and corporate stockpiling. They anticipate that as the most severe tariffs take effect, consumers will likely begin to see an impact on prices in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major wildfire, fanned by strong winds, has reached the edge of Marseille, France's second-largest city, prompting a massive emergency response. The blaze, which started near Pennes-Mirabeau, has burned approximately 700 hectares, with local authorities attributing its origin to a car fire on a motorway. The city's mayor described firefighters as waging a "guerrilla war" to defend the city, and residents have been urged to stay indoors. This event is part of a broader pattern of intense wildfires across southern Europe, including Spain and Greece, exacerbated by a recent heatwave and dry conditions.</p>

          <p>The first report from the official inquiry into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal has detailed the devastating human cost for hundreds of wrongly prosecuted sub-postmasters. Sir Wyn Williams' report revealed that the false accusations of theft, caused by faulty software, led to suicides, severe mental health crises, addiction, and divorces. The report makes urgent recommendations, including providing free legal advice and compensation for affected family members, and criticizes the Post Office for its adversarial approach to financial redress. The findings highlight systemic failures and the profound suffering endured by victims over many years.</p>

          <p>The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts that the annual cost of the state pension 'triple lock' policy will reach £15.5 billion by 2030, three times its original estimate. The triple lock guarantees the state pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR report highlights that this growing expense, combined with recent government U-turns on spending cuts, places the UK's public finances in a vulnerable position. This policy contributes to a long-term unsustainable trajectory for public spending, driven by an aging population and volatile inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Canada's decision to back down from its digital services tax after threats of retaliatory tariffs from the Trump administration represents a submission to brute force. The author, Joseph Stiglitz, contends that digital taxes are an efficient and fair way for countries to ensure tech giants pay their share, which they often avoid by shifting profits globally. The piece criticizes President Trump's actions as a violation of international norms and national sovereignty. It frames Canada's retreat as a blow to the rule of law, suggesting it reinforces a global dynamic where U.S. demands override negotiated international agreements.</p>

This article provides a fact-check, explaining that meteorological experts have unequivocally dismissed these claims as false. Scientists clarify that cloud seeding cannot create massive storm systems or generate the immense volume of water seen in the floods; it can only modestly enhance rainfall from pre-existing clouds. Any particles from recent seeding operations would have dispersed long before the storm, making it physically impossible for them to have caused the catastrophic event.</p>

          <p>Kenya is experiencing continued tension and sporadic unrest following deadly anti-government protests, with businesses remaining closed in many areas. The youth-led demonstrations, driven by frustration over economic hardship, corruption, and a lack of opportunities, have called for President William Ruto's resignation. The government's response has been criticized as authoritarian, with over 560 arrests made and multiple deaths reported in clashes with police. Analysts note the decentralized, leaderless nature of the protests makes the situation volatile, as the government has yet to engage in meaningful dialogue to address the protesters' grievances.</p>

          <p>American Taylor Fritz has advanced to his first-ever Wimbledon semifinal after a four-set victory over Karen Khachanov. Fritz dominated the first two sets with powerful serving but experienced a sudden dip in the third, allowing Khachanov to win it 6-1. The match also featured a brief delay due to a malfunction in the electronic line-calling system. Despite the setbacks and a strong fight from his opponent, Fritz regained his composure in the fourth set, winning a decisive tie-break to secure the match and a spot against either Carlos Alcaraz or Cameron Norrie.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of an August 1 deadline for new tariffs, U.S. trade partners are weighing their options. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan will continue negotiations to secure a deal that serves both nations' interests. Meanwhile, the European Union is aiming to finalize an agreement quickly to remove economic uncertainty, with a commissioner noting the new deadline provides slightly more time. The U.S. has threatened a 25% tariff on Japan and South Korea, with varying rates for over a dozen other countries if new trade deals are not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) stated that the group engaged in military-style training and stockpiled a significant cache of firearms, ammunition, and explosive devices. The arrests follow a police search in January 2024 and highlight ongoing concerns about extremism within Canada's military.

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country has climbed to at least 108, with dozens of people, including campers from Camp Mystic, still unaccounted for.

Governor Greg Abbott described the damage as horrendous and pledged that search and rescue operations would continue around the clock. The tragedy has drawn a massive response from state and federal agencies, including numerous air rescues conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>

          <p>A jury has found three men guilty of an aggravated arson attack on a Ukrainian-linked warehouse in London, which prosecutors stated was carried out on behalf of the Russian Wagner Group. The attack, orchestrated by two other men who had already pleaded guilty, caused around £1 million in damages to a facility that shipped humanitarian aid and satellite equipment to Ukraine. The case is a significant example of a foreign state-linked entity using local proxies for criminal activities in the UK.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged ten people with attempted murder for allegedly carrying out a planned ambush on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at a detention center in Alvarado, Texas. The assailants reportedly used fireworks to lure officers outside before opening fire, injuring a local police officer and firing 20-30 rounds at unarmed corrections officers. Authorities described the incident not as a protest but as a violent, premeditated attack intended to kill law enforcement. The suspects were apprehended nearby with tactical gear, weapons, and what officials termed "insurrectionist materials."</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has convicted Erin Patterson on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder for intentionally serving a meal containing toxic death cap mushrooms to her family members in 2023.

Death cap mushrooms contain a highly stable toxin that causes severe liver failure and can be fatal within 24 hours.

Sunak, who worked for the investment bank early in his career, will advise global clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. His appointment was delayed for a year following a review by a government watchdog to mitigate risks of unfair influence. For the next year, his role will be restricted to strategic matters that do not conflict with his time in government.

          <p>India's suspension of the 60-year-old Indus Waters Treaty has plunged Pakistan's already precarious water situation into deeper uncertainty. The treaty, which governs the sharing of the Indus River system, was suspended by India following a militant attack, a move Pakistan calls "weaponizing water." For Pakistan, a dry country heavily reliant on the Indus for agriculture, hydropower, and drinking water, the treaty is considered existential. While experts believe a full-scale water war is unlikely, India's move creates a potential flashpoint and highlights the growing water stress in the region, exacerbated by climate change.</p>

          <p>In a significant shift, the IRS has indicated in a federal court filing that churches can endorse political candidates to their congregations without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This move reinterprets the 1954 Johnson Amendment, which has long prohibited such political intervention by non-profits. The filing, part of a proposed settlement with religious groups, argues that political discussions during worship services are akin to internal family discussions and do not constitute formal campaign participation. The change is a major victory for religious conservative groups but has sparked outcry from non-profit watchdogs concerned about dark money in politics.</p>
