          <p>A zoo on the Isle of Wight is celebrating the birth of two red panda cubs, a significant event for the endangered species. The twins were born on June 17 to parents Xiao and Flint, who were paired as part of a breeding program earlier in 2024. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the red panda population is in decline due to threats like poaching and habitat loss from forest clearance. The zoo is closely monitoring the cubs, which will remain in their nest box for about three months, expressing cautious optimism for their survival and the program's success.</p>

          <h2>Fox News Analyst Assesses Likelihood of Criminal Charges Against Senator Adam Schiff</h2>

          <p>A legal analysis explores the criminal referral against Senator Adam Schiff concerning alleged mortgage fraud. The referral claims Schiff falsified records for a Maryland property by listing it as his primary residence to secure better loan terms, while simultaneously claiming a California property as his primary residence for tax benefits. The article suggests that a federal prosecution is unlikely due to several factors, including venue challenges with liberal jury pools and the statute of limitations for financial fraud. While the conduct is described as potentially 'sleazy,' the author concludes that formal criminal charges at either the federal or state level are improbable based on the currently available information.</p>

          <h2>Shares of Chinese Jeweler Laopu Gold Decline Despite Strong Profit Forecast</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 05:00:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Chinese jewelry company Laopu Gold experienced a significant drop, falling to their lowest point since May, despite the company forecasting a nearly 288% increase in net profit for the first half of the year. After an initial surge, the stock declined as investors engaged in profit-taking, influenced by concerns over rising gold prices and a market reset of high expectations. Despite the recent downturn, the company's stock has seen a dramatic rise of over 2,000% since its listing. Analysts note that Laopu's unique, culturally inspired designs make its earnings less dependent on gold price fluctuations compared to traditional jewelers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorneys for immigrant children report unsafe and unsanitary conditions in U.S. detention facilities, detailing instances of neglect and abuse. These allegations surface as the Trump administration seeks to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, a long-standing consent decree that mandates basic standards of care for detained minors. The administration argues the agreement encourages illegal immigration, while advocates fear its removal would eliminate crucial oversight and accountability, potentially worsening conditions for vulnerable children. The debate highlights a fundamental conflict over immigration policy and the humanitarian treatment of minors in government custody, with a federal judge expected to rule on the matter soon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, Pete Buttigieg cautioned the Democratic party against simply aiming to restore the political status quo that existed before the Trump administration. He argued that while the administration's actions are damaging to national institutions, it is also a mistake to believe those institutions were working perfectly for everyone beforehand. Buttigieg suggested that the party was 'too attached to a status quo that has been failing us,' which contributed to its 2024 defeat. He advocated for embracing significant change rather than just repairing what was broken, applying the slogan 'We're not going back' to the need for a forward-looking evolution of government and policy.</p>

          <p>Georgia's two-year-old experiment with mandating work requirements for Medicaid eligibility has been plagued by bureaucratic hurdles, technological glitches, and improper denials, raising concerns as similar rules are set to be implemented nationwide. The program, 'Pathways to Coverage,' requires low-income adults to report 80 hours of work, school, or volunteer activities monthly to maintain health coverage. However, participants and social workers report a dysfunctional online portal and a frustrating appeals process, with the state spending over $91 million on a system that has enrolled just over 8,000 people. Advocates argue the system creates barriers to care rather than promoting employment, a criticism echoed from a similar failed attempt in Arkansas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists and scientists are highlighting that some children possess a naturally stronger 'food reward drive,' making them more susceptible to overconsuming ultra-processed foods. These children often feel hungrier, eat faster, and struggle with satiety signals, which can lead to health issues in an environment where such foods are prevalent. Experts advise parents of these children to adopt specific strategies, such as limiting the variety of ultra-processed items in the home rather than trying to regulate portion sizes. They recommend creating a home environment based on whole or minimally processed foods while allowing for occasional consumption of ultra-processed items in social settings to foster a healthy, balanced relationship with food.</p>

          <p>A federally funded program in Oklahoma designed to train and place mental health counselors in underserved rural schools is facing an early termination due to budget cuts by the Trump administration. The PRIME program at the University of Oklahoma, funded by a $5.6 million grant from the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, will now end in December 2025, two years ahead of schedule. This has left current and prospective students in financial uncertainty and threatens to worsen the existing shortage of mental health professionals in Oklahoma's rural areas.

Zack Stephenson, aims to encourage more mindful online behavior, particularly among young people, and draws parallels to warnings on tobacco and alcohol.

          <p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered a complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian artifact while preparing for an exhibition. The print was found on the underside of a 'soul house,' a clay model of a building placed in tombs for the deceased's spirit, dating from 2055 to 1650 BC. Curators believe the handprint was left by the maker who moved the object to dry before it was fired in a kiln. The Fitzwilliam Museum described the find as 'rare and exciting,' offering a direct, personal connection to the ancient craftspeople who are often overlooked in history, unlike the famous rulers they served.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a framework deal on trade, establishing a new 15% tariff on many European exports to the US, including cars. This agreement averts the previously threatened 30% rate but is a significant climbdown for the EU, as it is higher than historical levels and the UK's 10% rate. In return, the EU will reportedly open its markets to American exports at zero tariff and has committed to purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars in US energy and arms. President Trump has hailed the deal as a major victory, with the US expecting to gain roughly $90 billion in annual tariff revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Hurricane Center has reported the formation of Tropical Storm Iona in the central Pacific Ocean. The storm, which is the first named storm of the season in that region, developed from a tropical depression approximately 960 miles southeast of Honolulu, Hawaii. Iona is currently moving westward over open waters with maximum sustained winds of about 40 mph. Forecasters expect the storm to strengthen in the coming days as it continues its path across the Pacific. At present, there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect, and the storm poses no threat to Hawaii or other land areas.</p>

Now 29, Hull first gained national attention as a nine-year-old prodigy and has since become a fixture on the professional tours and in Europe's Solheim Cup team. Known for her unconventional training and candid personality, she enters the tournament after a recent illness forced her to withdraw from the Evian Championship. Despite a disrupted preparation, Hull has a history of strong performances in major events, including a runner-up finish at the same championship in 2023, and hopes to finally claim a title.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland, President Donald Trump launched into a tirade against wind power, repeating several inaccurate claims. He asserted that wind turbines are 'killing' the American landscape, are the 'most expensive form of energy,' and are mostly made in China. This continues his long-standing opposition to wind energy, which reportedly began two decades ago when a wind farm was proposed near his Scottish golf resort. Critics and fact-checkers quickly pointed out the inaccuracies in his statements, noting that Germany derives a significant portion of its energy from wind and that turbine technology is far more durable and cost-effective than he claimed.</p>

The attackers also reportedly set fire to nearby houses and shops. The UN peacekeeping mission and the Congolese military condemned the attack on defenseless civilians, which marks a violent end to a period of relative calm in the conflict-ridden Ituri province, a region long plagued by numerous armed groups.</p>

          <p>A growing number of students in China are choosing to attend lower-ranked universities to pursue majors with strong job prospects, such as computer science, rather than prioritizing the prestige of an elite institution. This trend reflects increasing anxiety about a competitive job market and a focus on immediate employability. The rise of artificial intelligence has further fueled demand for technology-related fields, causing an influx of applicants that pushes some students toward less prestigious schools where they can still secure a spot in their desired program. This shift indicates a pragmatic change in educational priorities among Chinese youth, valuing practical career paths over traditional markers of academic success.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the new US-EU trade deal reveals several key takeaways, including remaining uncertainties and significant economic consequences. While the agreement sets a 15% tariff on many EU goods, averting a worse scenario, rates remain historically high and could be altered by President Trump if investment promises are not met. The deal creates a tariff disparity on the island of Ireland and has been met with disappointment by German industry, particularly the auto sector. While Brussels framed it as a stabilizing deal, it represents a significant compromise from its original goal of zero tariffs, with US consumers likely to bear the ultimate cost of the increased duties.

          <p>While a new US-Japan trade deal lowers tariffs on Japanese-made vehicles from 25% to 15%, analysts argue it provides little comfort to Japan's auto industry. The bigger threat, they contend, is the intensifying competition from lower-cost Chinese automakers who are rapidly gaining market share globally, including in Southeast Asia and Australia, which were once Japanese strongholds. The 15% tariff is still significantly higher than historical rates, adding pressure on an industry already dealing with domestic economic challenges. While the deal provides some pricing certainty, the long-term outlook for Japanese automakers is seen as very challenging as they face erosion of their global dominance. (not investment advice)</p>
