          <p>The UK government is preparing to take control of Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), the nation's third-largest steelworks, to protect 1,500 jobs amid severe financial turmoil. Owned by Liberty Steel, the South Yorkshire plant faces a winding-up order over large unpaid debts following the collapse of its main lender, Greensill Capital. The government's potential intervention offers reassurance to creditors but presents an unappealing choice between allowing the current owner to attempt a costly administration or taking on a loss-making plant. This situation mirrors a previous costly government takeover of British Steel, highlighting the precarious state and strategic importance of the UK steel industry.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Intel is reportedly in discussions with multiple large investors to secure a new equity infusion, likely at a discounted price, to bolster its financial position. This move follows a recent $2 billion capital injection from SoftBank and comes amid pressure from the U.S. government, which has indicated it expects an equity stake in exchange for CHIPS Act funding. The company is navigating a difficult turnaround, facing declining sales and shrinking market share while investing heavily in its manufacturing business. These efforts to raise capital are crucial for funding its ambitious expansion and competing in the advanced semiconductor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Polish authorities have identified the debris that crashed in an eastern village as a Russian-made drone, labeling the incident a deliberate "provocation" that violates their airspace. Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz stated the drone was an unarmed decoy fitted with a self-destruct warhead, intended to create tension. The explosion left a significant crater in a cornfield but thankfully caused no casualties. This event marks another incursion into the NATO member's territory since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, escalating regional tensions and prompting an official protest from the Polish Foreign Ministry.</p>

          <p>Following its recent bankruptcy filing, the tween jewelry and accessories retailer Claire's has agreed to sell the majority of its North American business to private equity firm Ames Watson. While the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, the move is a strategic effort to maximize the value of the company for its stakeholders during its restructuring. As part of the agreement, Claire's will pause the liquidation process at most of its stores, a decision expected to provide significant benefits. The company has been struggling under the weight of nearly $500 million in debt and an increasingly competitive retail environment.</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency appointed by President Trump, has called for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign or be fired over allegations of mortgage fraud. Pulte claims that Cook simultaneously declared two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence to secure more favorable loan terms, and he has asked the Department of Justice to investigate. President Trump amplified the call for her resignation, escalating his administration's pressure on the Federal Reserve. The Fed and DOJ have declined to comment on the allegations, which represent a significant politicization of the central bank.</p>

U.S. District Court Judge Fred Biery ruled that the law, Senate Bill 10, likely violates the First Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses, which mandate a separation of church and state. The lawsuit was filed by a diverse group of families who argued the mandate infringes on their right to direct their children's religious upbringing. While civil liberties groups praised the decision, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has vowed to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 30 major crypto firms, including Coinbase and Kraken, has called on the UK government to establish a proactive national strategy for stablecoins. In an open letter to the Finance Minister, they argue that the UK risks falling behind the U.S. and becoming a "rule-taker" if it doesn't embrace the technology responsibly. The firms contend that the current regulatory approach, which defines stablecoins as crypto-assets rather than focusing on their function, is limiting growth. They believe a coordinated strategy would bolster the UK's position as a global financial hub and support demand for government bonds. (not investment advice)</p>

These detailed conversations could be worth far more to advertisers than a simple click, transforming Google's revenue model.

          <p>Former Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley has filed a legal claim against the city, alleging Mayor Karen Bass orchestrated a campaign of defamation and retaliation to deflect blame for the handling of the catastrophic Palisades Fire. Crowley asserts she was made a scapegoat for the city's inadequate response, which she claims was caused by budget cuts made by the mayor's office. The claim alleges Bass knew of the severe fire danger but traveled abroad, then falsely blamed Crowley for the department's readiness. This legal action is a required precursor to a lawsuit and seeks unspecified damages for the alleged public smear campaign.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, announced that the company achieved its first $1 billion revenue month in July, signaling rapid and explosive growth since the launch of ChatGPT. Despite this significant financial milestone, Friar emphasized that the company is "constantly under compute," facing voracious demand for GPUs and processing power to train and run its advanced AI models. To address this critical bottleneck, OpenAI is pursuing major infrastructure projects like Stargate and diversifying its partnerships beyond Microsoft to include Oracle and Coreweave. The company's CEO recently stated they expect to spend trillions on datacenters to meet future demand. (not investment advice)</p>

He denies the charge, claiming the case is politically motivated and intended to silence the group's pro-Palestinian advocacy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Oxford have created a "superfood" supplement that could help save honeybees from existential threats like climate change and habitat loss. The specially formulated food provides all the essential nutrients bees need to survive, particularly when natural pollen is scarce. In trials, bee colonies that consumed the supplement produced up to 15 times more offspring that successfully reached adulthood. This breakthrough, which involved engineering a yeast to produce vital lipids called sterols, offers a promising way to bolster the health of bee populations, which are crucial for pollinating a majority of global food crops.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice alleges in a new court filing that executives from the voting machine company Smartmatic transferred money from a $282 million contract with Los Angeles County into slush funds. These funds were reportedly part of a long-standing scheme used to pay bribes to election officials in Venezuela and the Philippines. While prosecutors have not alleged that any LA County officials were bribed, the filing claims county money was co-mingled with funds used in the international bribery operation. The allegations arise from an ongoing corruption case against three Smartmatic executives, who are accused of conspiracy, bribery, and money laundering.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that daily reading for pleasure among American adults has dropped by over 40% in the last two decades. Researchers from the University of Florida and University College London analyzed data from 2003 to 2023, finding a steady and concerning decline despite increased access to books via e-readers and apps. The trend is attributed to the rise of other forms of digital media, a general decrease in leisure time, and uneven access to libraries. This decline is concerning to health experts, who note that reading is a beneficial behavior associated with relaxation, well-being, and overall mental health.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has blocked a hotel in Epping, UK, from being used to house asylum seekers, a decision that could set a precedent for other local councils seeking to do the same. The ruling was based on the council's argument that the hotel's change of use breached local planning controls and negatively impacted the community's character, citing fears of crime and the consequences of local protests. The judge clarified that the decision was based on evidence of harm to the local "amenity," not just the fear of protests. The ruling presents a new legal challenge for the Home Office as it seeks alternatives to hotel accommodation.</p>

          <p>Even as mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest point in ten months, many potential home buyers remain on the sidelines due to persistent and severe affordability issues. Record-high home prices and a limited inventory of available properties are the primary obstacles, particularly for first-time buyers, whose median age has risen to a historic high of 38. A recent survey found that a majority of prospective buyers are waiting for both prices and interest rates to fall further before entering the market. This "lock-in effect" continues to suppress housing market activity, as the recent rate dip has not been significant enough to offset the high cost of homes.</p>
