          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 19:18:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the rising cost of driving lessons in the UK and the struggles faced by learners, particularly those from low-income backgrounds. Many learners are finding it difficult to afford lessons, leading them to cut back on other essential expenses or take fewer lessons, prolonging the learning process. Driving instructors justify the price increases due to rising expenses such as fuel, insurance, and car maintenance. The backlog for practical driving tests also forces learners to take more lessons to maintain their skills, further exacerbating the financial burden.</p>

          <p>The article reports on the trial of Joel Le Scouarnec, a retired French surgeon who admitted to raping or sexually assaulting 299 people, mostly children, between 1998 and 2014. Victims are expressing frustration over the lack of public interest and mobilization surrounding the trial, contrasting it with the attention given to other abuse cases. They believe that France's 'systemic, organized silence' regarding child sexual assault, and a patriarchal society that protects men in respected positions, are contributing factors. Some victims have chosen to reveal their identities in an effort to raise awareness and encourage societal change.</p>

          <p>This article details Secretary of State Marco Rubio's concerns regarding a federal court order that requires the U.S. government to maintain custody of deportees meant for South Sudan. Rubio argues that the order is causing 'significant and irreparable harm' to U.S. foreign policy, complicating diplomatic efforts with Libya, South Sudan, and Djibouti. The administration has asked the court to reconsider its order, emphasizing the burden it places on the President's ability to conduct foreign policy and manage immigration authorities. The deportees, including dangerous criminals, are being temporarily held at a U.S. Naval base in Djibouti.</p>

The aim is to address the housing crisis by accelerating the construction of new homes, though critics worry that adding burdens on builders could hinder progress.</p>

          <p>A pediatrician in Gaza, Dr. Alaa al-Najjar, lost nine of her ten children after an Israeli airstrike hit their home near Khan Younis. Her husband, also a doctor, was severely wounded and is in intensive care, while their only surviving child was also injured. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that their aircraft struck suspects operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area and that the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review. The World Food Programme reports that aid trucks have been looted in southern Gaza, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>During the Cold War, the U.S. Army explored the concept of heavily armored helicopters, essentially flying armored fighting vehicles. Sikorsky developed dual-hardness steel armor and the Advancing Blade Concept (ABC) to create more survivable rotorcraft. The Aerial Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle (AARV) and the Aerial Armored Personnel Carrier (AAPC) were two projects that resulted from this, but neither progressed beyond the prototype stage. While these specific designs never materialized, the Advancing Blade Concept made a comeback in later designs, influencing projects like the X2 demonstrator and the S-97 Raider.</p>
