          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's economic policies, noting a chaotic start to his promised "golden age." The first quarter GDP figures revealed a contraction, which Trump blamed on his predecessor. The article points out the administration's inconsistent messaging, highlighting the impact of tariff-related trade distortions and consumer sentiment on economic activity. The article also notes that the confusion and uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policies are creating challenges for businesses, and rural and lower-income voters are expressing growing apprehension about the economy. Optimism for a quick turnaround is fading as the Biden "overhang" argument loses credibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amid concerns about inflation, housing affordability, and the impact of a volatile Washington. The article highlights that while security ties with the United States are crucial, Australia's prosperity depends on trade with China, creating a complex geopolitical situation. Voters are primarily focused on cost-of-living issues, and both major parties have offered limited solutions to alleviate economic pressures. The article also notes a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates, reflecting dissatisfaction with the traditional political landscape, and draws parallels between the opposition leader's rhetoric and that of Donald Trump, which may be negatively impacting his campaign.</p>

          <p>This article reports on the recent violence in Druze-majority areas of Syria, triggered by an audio recording deemed blasphemous. Unidentified armed groups attacked the town of Jaramana, leading to clashes that resulted in over 80 deaths. The situation has calmed after Druze leaders allowed Syrian government forces into their areas. The article also explains the complex relationship between the Druze community and the new Syrian government, the divisions within the Druze community, and Israel's intervention in the conflict, which experts say is further destabilizing the region.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snake species in animal tests. This could lead to a universal antivenom, addressing the current need for species-specific treatments. Friede's initial motivation was to protect himself, but he later aimed to develop better therapies for snakebite victims. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that target two classes of neurotoxins, creating an antivenom cocktail effective against multiple species.</p>

          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei is experiencing a significant drop in visitors due to strained relations between Taiwan and Beijing. The museum's director aims for 3.5 million visitors in 2025, but lawmaker Ko Chih-en questioned this target, citing a drastic decline in visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. The largest overseas visitor group now comes from South Korea, followed by Japan. Cross-strait relations have deteriorated since the Democratic Progressive Party took power in 2016, leading to travel restrictions.</p>

Local officials dispute Trump's claims, but the lawsuit seeks to invalidate state and city laws that restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

          <h2>End of Tariff Exemption Threatens Advertising Bonanza for Tech Giants</h2>

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods is impacting advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms. The loophole allowed low-cost online retailers like Temu and Shein to offer discounted goods from China, driving significant digital advertising spending. Now, with tariffs imposed, these companies are reducing their advertising, affecting tech giants' revenue. Temu has started adding "import charges" and transitioning to local fulfillment, while both Temu and Shein have reduced advertising on platforms like Google and social media. This shift has caused these apps to fall out of the top downloaded lists.</p>

          <p>Ghana's national cathedral project, designed by architect David Adjaye, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and a political battleground. The project, initiated by former President Nana Akufo-Addo to fulfill a personal pledge to God, has stalled due to financial difficulties and corruption accusations. The new government has halted funding and dissolved the agency managing the project, which has drawn criticism for its high cost and lack of broad support. The project, now a large hole in Accra, has become a target of an anti-corruption initiative.</p>

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially raising prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, intended to promote domestic manufacturing, follow earlier tariffs on imported cars. While parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt under certain conditions, the tariffs are expected to increase costs for automakers and consumers. Experts predict that this will lead to inflation and unpredictable side effects, including potential supplier bankruptcies and parts shortages. (not investment advice)</p>
