          <p>Following a terrorist attack outside a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur, police have revealed that one of the two deceased victims may have been killed by a police officer's gunshot. Greater Manchester Police stated that the suspect was not believed to be armed with a firearm, suggesting the fatal injury was a tragic consequence of officers' actions to stop the attack. Another non-fatally injured victim also sustained a gunshot wound during the incident, which involved a vehicle and stabbing assault by the suspect, who was shot and killed by police at the scene.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago infrastructure projects, the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization Project. The announcement by the Office of Management and Budget follows similar funding freezes for projects in other Democrat-led cities and states during the ongoing government shutdown. The administration cited a need to ensure funding does not flow through race-based contracting, a move seen by critics as part of a pattern of politically targeting Democratic areas.</p>

          <p>An immigration judge has denied a request to reopen the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported earlier this year and later returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. His lawyers sought to have his asylum proceedings reconsidered, but the judge found insufficient evidence that his removal to a third country was imminent. This decision is a significant setback in Abrego Garcia's complex legal battle to remain in the U.S., where he had lived for over a decade with his family.</p>

          <p>The police investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus in Oregon faced a major setback when a crucial piece of evidence, a minivan, was destroyed at a scrapyard. Investigators believe the killer, identified as Dr. Steven Milner, used the van as the primary crime scene to murder Fandrich, who was having an affair with Milner's former employee. Despite detectives racing to the scrapyard upon learning its location, they arrived just an hour too late and were shown a video of the van being crushed.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown has intensified the political battle over pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies, with Democrats accusing Republicans of causing millions to face higher insurance premiums. Democrats are demanding an extension of the enhanced tax credits, while some Republicans and conservative analysts argue the subsidies are fiscally irresponsible and contribute to inflation. This partisan conflict over healthcare funding has become a central sticking point in negotiations to reopen the government, with both sides blaming the other for the impasse.</p>

Despite this, Wallace believes the long-term investment case for climate tech remains strong due to local government initiatives and attractive company valuations. (not investment advice)</p>

Major transport hubs like Guangzhou South Station handled unprecedented numbers of passengers, indicating a strong start to a holiday period that Beijing hopes will stimulate consumer spending. In addition to rail, air and waterway passenger volumes also saw significant year-on-year increases, providing a positive signal for the country's domestic economy.</p>

          <p>Multiple federal agencies and their staff are facing accusations of violating the Hatch Act, a law that prohibits partisan political activity by federal employees. During the government shutdown, furloughed employees have reportedly been instructed to use automated messages and website banners that explicitly blame Democrats for the funding lapse. Constitutional law experts and Democratic representatives have called this a "naked violation" of the law, arguing it weaponizes government resources for political messaging.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the international call to boycott the Israeli film industry is a counterproductive form of protest. The author asserts that Israeli cinema, while often partially state-funded, serves as one of the country's most powerful platforms for internal critique, frequently exploring controversial topics like the military occupation and the costs of war. Instead of isolating these filmmakers, the international community should engage with them, as their work has the potential to change minds within Israel more effectively than a boycott.</p>

          <p>President Trump's newly announced TrumpRx website, which purports to offer discounted prescription drugs, is unlikely to provide significant savings for most Americans, according to health policy experts. The analysis suggests that the program offers little benefit to insured patients, who are better off using their coverage, and may not provide the best prices for the uninsured compared to existing services like GoodRx. A concurrent, confidential deal with Pfizer to lower Medicaid prices also lacks transparency, leading experts to view the announcements as more politically motivated than substantive.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) has quantified the "motherhood penalty," revealing that mothers in England face a significant and prolonged reduction in earnings after having children. The data shows that five years after the birth of a first child, a mother's monthly earnings are on average £1,051 lower than they were a year before the birth. Advocacy groups have called the findings "abhorrent," attributing the gap to systemic issues like unaffordable childcare, biased parental leave policies, and workplace discrimination.</p>
