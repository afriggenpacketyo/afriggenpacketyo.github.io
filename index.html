            <p>An Israeli air strike struck and significantly damaged the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, resulting in the destruction of the intensive care and surgery departments. The IDF claims the hospital housed a Hamas command center, but no casualties were reported initially. One child who had suffered a head injury died during the evacuation. The hospital, run by the Anglican Church in Jerusalem, was the last fully functional medical facility in Gaza City. The incident has drawn condemnation, with UK Foreign Minister David Lammy calling for an end to attacks on medical facilities. Optimism score: 10</p>

The tonka bean tree survives lightning strikes unscathed, while nearby lianas are wiped out and competing trees are damaged. Researchers found that tonka bean trees are struck by lightning more often than other trees, likely due to their height and wide crown. This defense mechanism gives tonka bean trees a significant reproductive advantage. Optimism score: 70</p>

            <p>Grandparents in America are increasingly providing significant child care support to their families, driven by economic pressures and cultural shifts. Many seniors are taking on co-parenting roles, balancing their own lives with the demands of raising grandchildren. This trend has both benefits and drawbacks, as it can strengthen family bonds but also lead to burnout and financial strain. The need for greater societal support for families is highlighted, as the burden of child care often falls disproportionately on grandparents. Optimism score: 55</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies are expected to disproportionately affect low-income Americans by raising prices on everyday goods. Tariffs act as a consumption tax, increasing the cost of living for all households, but the impact is greater on lower-income families. The tariffs could also contribute to a recession, which would further harm low-income individuals. While there are potential avenues for change, including congressional action and legal challenges, the most likely solution depends on Trump's decisions. Optimism score: 35</p>
