          <p>Despite showing little interest in peace talks, Russia's war economy is facing increasing pressure from sanctions, inflation, and high production costs. According to Jack Watling, Russia's military equipment stockpiles are dwindling, and further offensives into 2026 will require politically and economically challenging forced mobilization. The Russian economy is slowing, with GDP growth dropping sharply, surprising economists who now suggest a technical recession is possible. Declining oil prices and tighter sanctions on Russia's "shadow fleet" are also impacting revenues, potentially forcing Moscow to negotiate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK government borrowing in April was higher than anticipated, reaching £20.2 billion, a £1 billion increase from the previous year. This figure surpasses analysts' predictions of £17.9 billion and marks the fourth-highest April borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, according to the Office for National Statistics. This increase reflects the difference between government spending and tax income, highlighting potential challenges in managing the UK's finances.</p>

          <p>A review suggests releasing violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, after serving just a third of their sentence to alleviate prison overcrowding. Former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, who chaired the review, stressed the need for reforms to prevent emergency prisoner releases, noting that overcrowded prisons lead to dangerous conditions and high reoffending rates. The government is considering expanding a pilot program offering voluntary chemical castration to some sex offenders. Concerns have been raised by victims' advocates and probation officers, who fear increased pressure on an already strained system.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, hitting a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and institutional buyer interest. According to James Butterfill, this rise is occurring despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, with which Bitcoin typically correlates. This divergence may be due to investors seeking alternative stores of value, with concerns over U.S. sovereign debt adding to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability.

          <p>A new study indicates that climate change-driven wildfires contributed to thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in economic costs in the U.S. From 2006 to 2020, climate change was responsible for approximately 15,000 deaths due to exposure to fine particulate matter from wildfires, costing around $160 billion. Researchers focused on deaths linked to PM2.5, a major concern in wildfire smoke, which can cause both short-term and long-term health problems.

While the Black majority has seen improvements, South Africa remains one of the most unequal societies, with a small but vocal group of Afrikaners claiming institutional discrimination.

These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including a mandate for all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue they have the authority to overturn the waivers through the Congressional Review Act, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent.

          <p>Chronic water shortages in Gaza are intensifying due to Israel's military offensive, causing displacement and fuel shortages for desalination and hygiene plants. The UN warns that a complete shutdown of water and sanitation facilities is possible without immediate fuel deliveries. Parents report that children are accustomed to drinking salty water, leading to a rise in kidney complaints. The situation is further complicated by the ongoing blockade, which has restricted the entry of essential supplies, including fuel.</p>
