            <h2>Warren Calls for SEC Investigation into Trump's Tariff-Related Trading</h2>

            <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren is urging the SEC to investigate President Trump for potential insider trading and market manipulation following his tariff announcements and subsequent pause. Warren, along with other Senate Democrats, believes Trump's actions caused market instability and may have enriched administration insiders at the expense of the public. She suggests that Trump, his family, or inner circle could have traded on advance information, and that members of Congress should also be barred from trading individual stocks. The White House has dismissed these calls as partisan games, asserting Trump's responsibility to reassure markets and celebrate his actions against China.</p>

            <p>An Israeli airstrike has reportedly damaged the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, the last fully functional hospital in the area, destroying intensive care and surgery departments. The IDF claims it targeted the hospital due to a Hamas command center, issuing warnings and using precise munitions to mitigate harm. However, a child died during the rushed evacuation process, and surrounding buildings, including a church, were also damaged. International figures have condemned the attack, citing its impact on healthcare access in Gaza and calling for an end to such actions.</p>

            <p>Chinese officials are urging President Trump to completely cancel reciprocal tariffs, as tensions remain high in the trade war between the world's two largest economies. This week, Trump announced a 90-day pause for global tariffs but increased taxes on Chinese imports to 145%. China's commerce ministry called for the US to correct its mistakes and return to mutual respect, while acknowledging the US's exemptions on some technological products as a 'small step.' Despite these exemptions, there is no immediate prospect of a thaw in the protectionist posture of either nation.</p>

            <p>While some tech products received a tariff reprieve, the 145% tariffs imposed on Chinese imports are expected to cause 'irreversible' damage to many American businesses. Supply chain executives report canceled freight orders and abandoned freight from China as businesses halt container exports due to the tariffs. Economists warn that the high tariffs could effectively halt trade between the U.S. and China, with lower-margin goods being unsustainable to produce in China. Small businesses, in particular, are struggling to cope with the sudden policy changes and high tariff levels, leading to lost sales and product shortages.</p>

            <p>Amid recent stock market volatility and a surge in U.S. Treasury bond yields, investors are seeking strategies for income and stability. Experts suggest considering a bond ladder, which involves investing in a range of treasury maturities and holding them to maturity for regular income. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) offers a similar approach, investing in treasuries with maturities ranging from 30 days to 10 years, distributing monthly income through 2035.  While ultrashort fixed-income bond ETFs are popular, bond ladders can protect buying power and immunize against liabilities. A U.S. treasury default is the primary risk to this strategy.
