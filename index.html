          <p>New federal labor data indicates a cooling job market, with U.S. workers filing 263,000 claims for unemployment benefits last week, the highest since October 2021. The Department of Labor reported a significant jump of 27,000 claims from the previous week's revised level, signaling a rise in layoffs. Economists suggest this data, along with sluggish job growth in recent months, increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut rates at its upcoming meeting. Consumer prices also rose 2.9% in August, adding complexity to the economic outlook. The implications of these trends on future economic policy are closely monitored. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean nationals detained by ICE in Georgia for alleged visa violations at a Hyundai plant were released and are being flown back to South Korea. The detentions strained U.S.-South Korea relations, with South Korean officials expressing concern over the treatment of their citizens. President Lee Jae Myung pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investment, highlighting the importance of the economic partnership. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security stated that the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history, citing visa overstays and unauthorized labor. The situation presents an opportunity to improve visa policies and strengthen U.S.-Korea ties. </p>

          <h2>Australia to Deploy Underwater Attack Drones</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 09:43:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia will invest $1.1 billion in building locally developed underwater attack drones, known as "Ghost Sharks." The first of these stealthy, long-range drones will be delivered to the Australian navy in January next year. These autonomous underwater vehicles will significantly enhance Australia's undersea warfare capabilities, complementing its fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. The Ghost Sharks are designed for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike operations. This investment underscores Australia's commitment to maritime security and technological advancement. </p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) maintained interest rates due to ongoing economic uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariff agenda. The key deposit facility rate remains at 2%, and the ECB will adopt a data-dependent approach. Lingering economic uncertainty and concerns over the impact of tariffs on economic growth persist despite inflation hovering around the 2% target. The ECB has revised its economic growth forecast for 2025 upward to 1.2% but remains cautious about the volatile trade policy environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, matching economists' expectations and indicating a slight pickup in inflation. The increase is partly attributed to President Trump's tariffs, which are filtering through the economy. Some economists suggest the Federal Reserve is likely to proceed with a rate cut despite the rise in inflation due to concerns about the labor market.
