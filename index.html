          <p>An Austrian court has overturned Sebastian Kurz's conviction for giving false testimony to a parliamentary inquiry. Kurz, once a rising star among European conservatives, had previously received an eight-month suspended jail sentence. He resigned as chancellor in 2021 after heading governing coalitions with both the far-right Freedom Party and the environmentalist Greens. The three-member panel of judges stated, "Sebastian Kurz... is acquitted," marking the end of a legal battle that has shadowed his post-chancellor career. The article provides context on Kurz's political background and the circumstances leading to his resignation.</p>

Separately, a strike on a house in Jabalia resulted in 19 deaths, and the Red Cross reported the deaths of two staff members in Khan Younis.

Orszag suggests eliminating the debt limit, extending the maturity of Treasury debt, and pursuing fiscal savings in entitlement programs.

          <p>A federal court in Texas is considering the fate of a CFPB rule that would ban medical debt from credit reports, potentially benefiting millions. The CFPB, now under Trump-appointed leadership, has reversed its position and joined a lawsuit seeking to block the rule. Credit industry groups argue that medical debt information is important for lenders and borrowers, while consumer advocates contend that the rule would help those negatively impacted by medical debt. Several states have already begun regulating the effects of medical debt, creating a patchwork of differing laws.</p>

However, five BBC pundits, including Fara Williams, correctly identified the top four teams, with Williams also accurately placing Arsenal in second and Chelsea in fourth.
