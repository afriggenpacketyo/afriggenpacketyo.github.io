        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the US of "murder" after a strike on a suspected drug-carrying submarine, which President Donald Trump claimed was laden with fentanyl and other illegal narcotics. Petro stated the Colombian vessel was adrift with a distress signal due to engine failure when it was attacked, resulting in two fatalities, and is now demanding explanations from the US government. Trump defended the ongoing boat attacks as crucial for stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America, confirming the return of two survivors to Ecuador and Colombia for prosecution. This incident is at least the sixth US strike in the Caribbean in recent weeks, with prior attacks reportedly causing 27 deaths, prompting UN human rights experts to label them "extrajudicial executions."</p>

          <p>Thousands participated in "No Kings" protests across major US cities, including New York and Washington D.C., demonstrating against President Donald Trump's expanded presidential powers and perceived authoritarian actions. Protesters, holding signs like "Democracy not Monarchy," voiced concerns over executive orders, immigration crackdowns, and threats to American democracy, drawing comparisons to historical authoritarian regimes. Despite Trump allies accusing participants of being linked to far-left movements, organizers maintained the events were peaceful, with no protest-related arrests reported in New York City where over 100,000 gathered. Democratic politicians, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Bernie Sanders, joined the rallies, emphasizing the importance of preserving democratic principles against what they view as unconstitutional moves by the administration.</p>

          <p>China has accused the United States of conducting "long-term, highly covert, and state-level cyberespionage" attacks against its National Time Centre. This facility, affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is crucial for generating and distributing China’s standard time, supporting vital sectors like communications, finance, power, transport, mapping, and defence. The Chinese Ministry of State Security released a statement detailing these allegations, though the US embassy in China has not yet responded to the claims. This accusation highlights escalating cyber tensions between the two global powers, raising concerns about potential disruptions to critical national infrastructure and the broader implications for international relations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago issued an unusual warning to Americans, advising them to avoid US government facilities due to a heightened state of alert over the holiday weekend. This alert comes amidst growing tensions between the United States and Venezuela, following deadly US strikes in Caribbean waters targeting suspected drug traffickers. Trinidad and Tobago’s homeland security minister, Roger Alexander, confirmed the alert was based on threats directed at American citizens, potentially linked to the regional instability and the recent loss of local fishermen. Local authorities have implemented security measures as the situation remains tense, especially after six strikes have killed at least 29 people since early September.</p>

          <p>An Illinois State University graduate student and teaching assistant, Derek Lopez, was arrested after allegedly flipping a Turning Point USA student group's informational table and tearing down promotional flyers on campus. Video footage shows Lopez stating, "Jesus did it, so you know I gotta do it, right?" before overturning the table, and later sneering "Thanks guys, have a great day." He faces charges for disorderly conduct and criminal damage to property, with potential for further university disciplinary action. University Police Chief Aaron Woodruff emphasized the institution's commitment to protecting First Amendment rights and campus safety, encouraging constructive ways to respond when encountering speech with which one may disagree.</p>

          <p>Liverpool, despite significant summer reinforcements totaling £416.2m, is experiencing a downturn in form, losing three consecutive matches, with analysts attributing struggles to Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure to Real Madrid. The article highlights his crucial, often underrated, contributions to build-up play, particularly his two-footed passing ability and tactical positioning that facilitated bypassing high presses. His absence has notably impacted the team's short build-up and ability to execute long passes and switches of play, which were key to disrupting opposition defenses and creating space. Opponents like Manchester United are expected to exploit these new frailties by defending deeper and blocking the center, potentially forcing Liverpool's attacking midfielders into deeper roles and reducing their effectiveness in the final third.</p>

          <p>Large global companies are increasingly citing artificial intelligence as the reason for recent job cuts, sparking concerns among employees about widespread AI-driven unemployment. However, critics, including Oxford Internet Institute's Fabian Stephany, argue that AI is being used as a convenient "scapegoat" to mask other business challenges, such as overhiring during the Covid-19 pandemic. While companies like Salesforce and Klarna have linked AI to workforce reductions, research from Yale University and the New York Fed suggests AI has not yet caused mass job losses in the US. This article explores the debate, noting that some firms are retraining employees or even hiring more due to AI, rather than solely cutting jobs.</p>

          <p>Royal biographer Andrew Lownie has criticized Buckingham Palace's decision to allow Prince Andrew to stop using his royal titles as mere "window dressing," arguing it fails to address the full scope of the "Andrew problem." Lownie claims the King should have been firmer, completely removing his brother's titles and forcing him to cooperate with authorities regarding his links to Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex trafficker. He suggests the palace is merely attempting to satisfy public opinion under government pressure, without imposing any real penalty or eliciting an apology to the victims. This article presents a critical perspective on the royal family's handling of the ongoing scandal, asserting that Andrew continues to live as before with no true accountability.</p>

          <p>Experts explain that a decline in sexual desire after the initial stages of long-term relationships is normal, often linked to shifting hormone balances where bonding hormones like oxytocin become more prominent. Psychologist Andrea Seiferth emphasizes open communication about sexual needs and desires as crucial for couples to navigate these changes. Research by Meredith Chivers highlights differences in male and female sexuality, noting that women's physical and psychological arousal can be decoupled, influenced by societal factors and experiences of pain or sexual assault. The article underscores the importance of sexual satisfaction for relationship stability and suggests that consistent physical affection and making time for intimacy are vital, even when sex is not a "must."</p>

While US Marine officials stated the exercise was routine and traffic disruption unnecessary, the California Highway Patrol closed the freeway due to safety risks from live ammunition and potential driver distraction. The incident underscored growing tensions between Trump and Newsom, who urged peaceful participation in "No Kings" rallies against authoritarianism, further politicizing the military demonstration.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans across every state participated in "No Kings" protests, voicing concerns that the country is sliding into authoritarianism under the Trump administration. The rallies featured diverse and creative displays, including signs, marching bands, a massive banner of the US Constitution's preamble for public signing, and numerous inflatable costumes ranging from bananas to SpongeBob SquarePants. This widespread turnout marks a significant turnaround for Democrats, who previously seemed at a loss after national election losses, now demonstrating renewed resolve and public engagement. Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible, highlighted the importance of Democrats showing "some spine" and not surrendering in the face of current political challenges, indicating a vibrant opposition movement.</p>

          <p>A new Emerson College poll indicates a tight hypothetical 2028 presidential election race between Vice President JD Vance and California Governor Gavin Newsom, with 46% favoring Vance and 45% choosing Newsom. The poll, conducted among 1,000 registered voters, shows minimal change since August, suggesting a polarized electorate. Both are considered likely frontrunners as President Donald Trump cannot seek a third term. The article also notes a near-even split in voter intentions for next year's midterm elections, with 44% leaning Democrat and 43% Republican. Spencer Kimball of Emerson College Polling highlights the enduring polarization and the potential influence of issues like "threats to democracy" versus the economy.</p>

          <p>The US State Department has issued a warning, citing "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an "imminent" attack on Palestinian civilians in Gaza, which would constitute a grave violation of the ceasefire agreement. Washington informed other guarantors, including Egypt and Qatar, demanding Hamas uphold its terms and threatening protective measures for Gaza's people if the attack proceeds. This comes as the first phase of the ceasefire progresses, with hostages released and some remains returned, but Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu has linked the Rafah crossing's reopening to further Hamas compliance. Separately, an Israeli tank shell killed 11 members of a Palestinian family, marking the deadliest incident since the ceasefire began.</p>

          <p>AMIES Technology, a new Chinese lithography equipment manufacturer, is offering renewed optimism for China's goal of reducing its reliance on Dutch giant ASML for chipmaking machines. Founded in February as a spin-off from state-owned SMEE, AMIES aims to commercialize advanced lithography equipment more swiftly. China currently faces significant bottlenecks in advanced lithography due to US export controls restricting access to top DUV and EUV systems. While SMEE excels in back-end processes, AMIES's emergence represents a strategic effort to catch up in front-end wafer fabrication and overcome technological dependencies, although current production-grade tools remain less advanced than Western leaders.</p>

          <p>China's major airlines are increasingly offering free Wi-Fi on domestic flights to win back business travelers who have shifted to high-speed trains. China Eastern Airlines recently launched a free "basic" Wi-Fi service on all its widebody aircraft across 37 domestic routes, following positive customer feedback from tests. Competitors like Air China and China Southern Airlines already provide similar services on a smaller scale, intensifying the competition. This strategic move aims to enable "work from the air," making air travel more appealing and competitive against the convenience and efficiency of high-speed rail for inter-city business commutes, reflecting evolving travel preferences and market competition within the country.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen is intensifying the Formula 1 world championship fight, as McLaren boss Zak Brown anticipates a "brutal" climax to the season. Verstappen dominated the US Grand Prix sprint, gaining points on McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, who crashed out together early in a racing incident. Despite McLaren leading the constructors' championship, their recent form has dipped, with Verstappen eroding nearly half of Piastri's significant points advantage in just three races and a sprint. Brown expressed concern about Verstappen "getting in the middle of our fun" as the Red Bull driver consistently proves to be the fastest car, making McLaren's goal of a one-two finish in the drivers' championship increasingly challenging.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has warned that Hamas may be planning an attack on "Palestinian civilians" in the Gaza Strip, citing credible reports of an "imminent ceasefire violation." This would undermine the progress of the US-brokered peace agreement, which includes hostage releases and prisoner exchanges, and threaten the integrity of the ceasefire. The warning follows a CBS News video showing armed Hamas fighters executing Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel, a pattern described as punishment by an Israeli hostage negotiator. President Trump acknowledged Hamas's actions against "very bad gangs" but did not express concern, highlighting the complex and violent internal dynamics within Gaza amidst the fragile ceasefire.</p>
