          <p>The Trump administration is sending more defensive weapons to Ukraine, with the President issuing a sharp rebuke of Vladimir Putin for his actions in the ongoing war. This marks a shift, as Trump has previously sought to de-escalate the conflict and had scaled back aid provided by the prior administration. The move comes after Trump expressed frustration with Putin's lack of progress toward peace. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has instructed his officials to intensify contacts with the U.S. to secure the new aid, particularly air defense systems.</p>

          <p>Five men have been convicted in London for their roles in an arson attack on a warehouse, a plot orchestrated by Russia's Wagner Group. The attackers, hired for cash, set fire to a building containing vital communications equipment destined for Ukraine. The operation was managed via the Telegram app by a handler linked to Wagner, who tasked a UK-based drug dealer to recruit the arsonists. The plot was part of a broader Wagner strategy to sow chaos in the UK and target individuals and businesses aiding Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly told Wedbush analyst Dan Ives to "Shut up" on the social media platform X. The exchange occurred after Ives, a prominent Tesla bull, posted recommendations for the company's board, including creating a new pay package for Musk and establishing "guardrails" on his political activities. The analyst's advice followed a significant drop in Tesla's stock price and Musk's announcement of a new political party, which has concerned some investors. Other analysts have also expressed weariness with Musk's political distractions.</p>

The increased inventory and longer time on the market benefit cash-heavy investors who can bypass current financing challenges. The majority of these investors are smaller, "mom-and-pop" operations, rather than large institutional firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 200% on pharmaceutical products imported into the United States. The announcement, made during a cabinet meeting, suggests that drugmakers would be given a grace period of about a year and a half to move their production to the U.S. before the steep levies take effect. This is the most significant development on this front since the administration began a national security investigation into drug imports.

          <p>A new study reveals that non-native, feral honeybees are dominating ecosystems in Southern California, potentially harming native bee populations. Researchers found that these honeybees, descendants of European and African subspecies, now constitute about 90% of all bees in the San Diego area, a global biodiversity hotspot. The study highlights that these aggressive foragers can strip native plants of over 80% of their pollen in a single day, leaving little for native species. This competition raises concerns about the health of the broader plant community and the survival of endemic pollinators.</p>

          <h2>Intel Stock Rises Despite Announcing Layoffs at Oregon Hub</h2>

          <p>Intel has begun laying off 500 employees at its main fabrication hub in Oregon as part of a broader cost-cutting plan to reduce its global workforce by 20%. The company stated the move is necessary to become a "leaner, faster, and more efficient company" as it faces increasing competition. Intel's market share in chip shipments has fallen to its lowest level since 2002, ceding ground to rivals like AMD. Despite the news of the layoffs, Intel's stock price saw a significant jump, suggesting investors may view the cost-cutting measures positively. (not investment advice)</p>

Sabalenka showed significant grit to hang on and eventually win after nearly three hours on Centre Court. She will now face American Amanda Anisimova for a place in her first Wimbledon final.</p>

          <p>The "Big Beautiful Bill" recently signed into law by President Trump does not eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, despite some claims to the contrary. Instead, the legislation introduces a new $6,000 federal income tax deduction for Americans aged 65 and older. This deduction could effectively make a portion of some seniors' benefits tax-exempt, but it does not apply to all beneficiaries and phases out for higher earners. The White House estimates that 88% of seniors will not pay taxes on their benefits under the new law. (not investment advice)</p>

Stewart and guest Steve Kroft characterized the payment as a "shakedown" or "protection money" to ensure that a pending merger with Skydance Media would not be blocked by Trump's allies at the FCC. Trump had sued over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris, claiming it was unfairly edited.

          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer fears about inflation have subsided, returning to levels seen before the Trump administration's tariff announcements. In June, respondents anticipated an inflation rate of 3% over the next 12 months, down from a peak of 3.6% earlier in the year. This easing of expectations coincides with a more conciliatory approach to trade negotiations by the administration. While the overall inflation outlook has softened, consumers still expect significant price increases in specific areas like medical care and college education. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the IRS has stated in a federal court filing that churches and other houses of worship can endorse political candidates to their congregations without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This effectively upends a 70-year-old interpretation of the Johnson Amendment, which President Trump has long opposed. The statement was part of a proposed settlement in a lawsuit brought by the National Religious Broadcasters and two Texas churches. The filing argues such communications, when viewed through faith during services, do not constitute campaign intervention.</p>
