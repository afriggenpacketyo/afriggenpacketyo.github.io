            <p>In response to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, China has escalated the trade war by raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%. This move follows Trump's imposition of import duties on Chinese goods, now at a rate of 104%. China's actions signal a firm stance against backing down in the ongoing global trade dispute. The increased tariffs are expected to impact U.S. companies importing from China, potentially leading to higher prices for American consumers on a wide range of goods. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has implemented reciprocal tariffs on imports from numerous countries, describing the announcement as "Liberation Day." The tariffs, which vary by country, are intended to address trade deficits and boost domestic manufacturing. However, economists warn that these measures could lead to inflation and retaliatory tariffs from trade partners, potentially causing recessions. China has already responded with its own tariffs on American products, escalating trade tensions between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Rory McIlroy is preparing for his 17th attempt to win the Masters at Augusta, aiming to complete a career Grand Slam. Analysts suggest that McIlroy may be wanting the victory too much, creating added pressure. McIlroy has been working with a sports psychologist to manage the pressure and reaffirm positive memories. His current form is strong, but overcoming the mental burden of past failures will be crucial for success.</p>

            <p>The acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is resigning over the Treasury Department's plan to share immigrant tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The decision to share taxpayer data with the Department of Homeland Security has sparked controversy and led to additional resignations within the IRS. Critics argue that the data-sharing agreement violates privacy laws and diminishes the privacy of all Americans. Treasury officials maintain that the agreement is based on longstanding authorities and aims to protect law-abiding citizens while pursuing criminals.</p>

            <p>The future of British Steel, a Chinese-owned business, is uncertain as the government considers nationalization to prevent potential collapse. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated that a "commercial solution" is within reach for British Steel, which employs 2,700 people. The company faces financial challenges, including tariffs on exports to the U.S., and has rejected government support for a switch to electric arc furnaces. Union leaders and industry figures are advocating for government intervention, including nationalization, to secure the future of steelmaking in the UK.</p>

            <p>The bond market is experiencing significant volatility, with prices tumbling and yields spiking, causing concern on Wall Street. The 10-year Treasury yield has jumped, reaching its highest level since February, as investors move away from fixed income. This unusual action is occurring amidst growing fears of a recession, typically a time when bonds are seen as a safe haven. The bond market's behavior is attributed to concerns about President Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The editorial concludes that if the US does not nurture science, the lives of future Americans will be shorter, sicker, and poorer.</p>
