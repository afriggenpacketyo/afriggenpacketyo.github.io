          <h2>Starmer Reverses Course on Winter Fuel Payment Reductions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 14:34:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Keir Starmer has announced a U-turn on planned cuts to winter fuel payments following significant political pressure. The initial decision to means-test the payments had impacted over 10 million pensioners, leading to widespread criticism from unions and some Labour MPs. The policy change, expected at the autumn Budget, aims to adjust the eligibility threshold to include more pensioners, though the specifics remain unclear. The move has drawn mixed reactions, with calls for full reversal of the cuts and questions about the timing and financial implications, as the government seeks to balance affordability and pensioner support.</p>

          <p>Public companies are carefully navigating how to discuss the impact of tariffs on their financial results to avoid angering President Trump. Executives are using euphemisms and indirect language to describe the financial impacts of tariffs. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon acknowledged the retailer likely couldn't "absorb all the pressure" from tariffs, while Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz faced backlash after stating the company would raise prices due to tariffs. Advisers are suggesting companies focus on productivity increases and let CFOs handle tariff discussions to minimize potential conflict with the administration.</p>

          <p>Despite Israel's announcement of easing its blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza, urgently needed food, fuel, and medicine have been slow to reach Palestinians. The United Nations has faced delays in moving supplies from the Kerem Shalom crossing to warehouses within Gaza, exacerbating the dire situation. The Israeli blockade has left Gazans at "critical risk of famine," with tens of thousands of children potentially suffering from acute malnutrition. International criticism against Israel's campaign has grown, with Britain, France, and Canada denouncing the blockade and planned ground offensive.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" faces a challenge due to divisions over the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. Republicans are split between those from high-tax districts seeking SALT cap increases and fiscal conservatives opposing subsidizing blue states. Trump's shifting stance on the issue adds to the confusion. House members like Rep. Mike Lawler vow to oppose the bill without a SALT fix, while hardliners resist raising the cap amid concerns about national debt. Trump urges Republicans to not let SALT impede the bill, but a tentative deal to raise the cap to $30,000 faces opposition from fiscal conservatives.</p>

Jassy's remarks were made during Amazon's annual shareholder meeting, adding that they also haven't seen any meaningful average selling price increases. Amazon and other retailers are closely monitoring the impact of tariffs, with Walmart previously warning of potential price hikes for consumers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's criticism of South Africa's land seizures from white farmers is contrasted with his own administration's use of eminent domain to build the border wall. Trump has attacked South Africa's government for its policies aimed at addressing racial inequities, while his administration has seized private land in Texas for wall construction. This highlights a contradiction in Trump's stance on government-sanctioned land grabs. It also reminds me of a story I reported about six years ago, when I found myself face to face with a white farmer preparing for the government to take his land.</p>
