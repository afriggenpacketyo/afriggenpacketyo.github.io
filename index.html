          <p>A rare and intense dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, including Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first-ever dust storm warning for the city. The article reports that the storm, driven by winds up to 70 mph from thunderstorms near Bloomington, Illinois, created a dramatic scene as it moved into downtown Chicago, reducing visibility to a quarter-mile at Midway Airport. Meteorologists noted that the dry soil conditions, with moisture levels at a record low of 2 to 5 percent, contributed to the severity of the storm, reminiscent of the Dust Bowl era. This event follows a deadly 2023 dust storm in central Illinois that resulted in a major pileup.</p>

          <p>An explosion outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has been declared "an intentional act of terrorism" by the FBI, resulting in one death and at least four injuries. The article details how the blast, which occurred near a vehicle parked by the clinic, caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering windows across several blocks. Authorities have identified a person of interest but have not released their name, and they believe the clinic was specifically targeted. The American Reproductive Centers reported that none of its staff were harmed and that its lab materials were secure, while Planned Parenthood clinics in the area closed out of caution.</p>

          <p>FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino has publicly criticized former FBI Director James Comey for a controversial social media post interpreted as a threat against the 47th president. The article explains that Bongino accused Comey of bringing shame to the FBI and highlighted the ongoing efforts to reform the agency following Comey's leadership. The U.S. Secret Service interviewed Comey about the post, and Bongino emphasized the FBI's commitment to supporting federal law enforcement partners in investigating threats against public officials. Bongino stated that he and Director Kash Patel are working to fix the dysfunction inherited from Comey's leadership.</p>

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, placed 19th out of 26, marking another disappointing year for the country despite the group's strong vocals and harmonies. The article suggests that the song, "What The Hell Just Happened," a mix of musical styles, may have been too busy and lacked consistency. While the professional juries recognized the clever British touches in the song, it failed to resonate with the broader audience. Despite the loss, Remember Monday garnered almost double the score of the previous year, and members of the band have expressed a willingness to continue trying until they win.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Walmart for suggesting that tariffs on imported goods would lead to higher prices for consumers, urging the company to "eat the tariffs" instead. The article explains that Walmart CEO Doug McMillon warned of potential price increases on items ranging from bananas to car seats due to the tariffs. Trump's response reflects his administration's stance that foreign producers should bear the burden of import taxes, despite warnings from American companies about the negative impact on their businesses. Walmart maintains that it will continue to keep prices as low as possible, but there are limits to what retailers can absorb.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Conservative minister Michael Gove stated that a second Scottish independence referendum could occur if there is overwhelming public support for one, signaling a shift from previous government rejections. The article notes that Gove emphasized the need for politicians to continually demonstrate that the UK union is working and warned against complacency. He linked the likelihood of a second referendum to the SNP's ability to improve public services and secure "demonstrable support" for independence, similar to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament. Gove's comments align with SNP leader John Swinney's message that independence will move forward when public support demands it in greater numbers.</p>

He has also traveled to other parts of the UK to capture other extraordinary moments, including a fox family playing in Clapham, South London, and a pair of red squirrels on the Isle of Wight.
