          <h2>Women-Only Aid Distribution in Gaza Turns Deadly Amid Chaos</h2>

          <p>A humanitarian effort to provide a safer environment for aid distribution in Gaza by designating a "women only" day tragically resulted in chaos and death. Witnesses reported that crowds of women were met with pepper spray and stun grenades, leading to a stampede. Amid the turmoil, at least two women, including Mary Sheikh al-Eid, a mother of seven, were fatally shot. This event highlights the extreme dangers Palestinians face when attempting to access essential supplies, with the UN reporting over 1,000 deaths near aid sites since a new distribution system was implemented in May. The Israeli military stated it fired warning shots at suspects posing a threat.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An examination of the law enforcement response to the June 14 shootings targeting two Minnesota state lawmakers has revealed several concerning decisions. A report from the Minnesota Star Tribune highlights a significant delay, noting it took authorities 10 hours to alert other lawmakers to the targeted threat posed by the suspect, Vance Boelter. The investigation also points to a missed opportunity when an officer encountered the suspect but did not immediately report the interaction. Additionally, it is alleged that police witnessed the gunman shoot one of the victims at his home before engaging. Boelter has since been indicted on multiple federal charges for what prosecutors called a "night of terror."</p>

          <h2>India Shows Resilience Against England on Day Four of Fourth Test</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 13:56:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India mounted a determined resistance against England on the fourth day of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, ending the day at 165-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After losing two early wickets for no score, an unbroken partnership between KL Rahul (87 not out) and captain Shubman Gill (78 not out) frustrated the English attack. Earlier, England captain Ben Stokes scored his first Test century in over two years, a knock of 141 that helped his team post a massive total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's strong rearguard action has kept their hopes of securing a draw alive.</p>

The report, which examined over 150 incidents between October 2023 and May 2024, concluded that in most cases of lost aid, the perpetrator could not be identified. The findings contradict claims by the Trump administration and Israel, which have accused Hamas of regularly stealing aid to fund its militant activities. The State Department and the Israeli military have forcefully pushed back against the report, insisting that significant aid diversion by Hamas is occurring.</p>

          <p>Israel's offer to permit airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza is being characterized as an act of desperation that will not effectively address the region's severe hunger crisis. This analysis piece argues that while airdrops may appear to be a positive step, they are a crude and inefficient method of delivery compared to ground transport. Past examples from conflicts in Iraq and Bosnia show that airdropped aid can be dangerous, sometimes landing in minefields or on shelters, and often fails to reach those most in need. Professionals view it as a last resort, and with modern ports and land routes available, a sustained, unrestricted aid operation via lorry convoys is the only viable solution to prevent starvation.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan men who were expelled from the U.S. to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador have been repatriated, with their lawyers alleging they endured horrific conditions and "state-sanctioned torture." The men were part of a prisoner swap negotiated between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments. Upon their return, detainees have provided detailed testimonies of their time in the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (Cecot), describing repeated beatings with rubber bullets, humiliation by guards, and unsanitary living conditions with contaminated water. One man, José Manuel Ramos Bastidas, had been flagged as a potential gang member by U.S. authorities but was never convicted of a crime before being sent to the prison.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), a body established under the Trump administration, is reportedly using an artificial intelligence tool to identify and eliminate federal regulations. According to internal documents, the "Doge AI Deregulation Decision Tool" is analyzing approximately 200,000 government regulations to create a "delete list" of rules it deems obsolete. The goal is to cut 50% of these regulations within the first year of a potential second Trump term. The initiative aligns with President Trump's campaign promise for an aggressive reduction in government oversight. A White House spokesperson confirmed that various creative options are being explored to enhance government efficiency, but no single plan has been finalized.</p>

While acknowledging Netflix's recent strong earnings, Rogers pointed to a decline in viewing time per subscriber and the growing competition from free content on platforms like YouTube. He noted that engagement is the key driver for price increases and programming budgets. Rogers also predicted that artificial intelligence will be a "double-edged sword," helping Netflix with ad targeting but also empowering amateur creators on YouTube to produce professional-quality content, further intensifying the competition for viewers' attention.

In a letter, Reps. Ro Khanna and Robert Garcia stated the book, which the Wall Street Journal reported contains a letter from Donald Trump, is relevant to congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein case. The request comes as the House Oversight Committee pursues its own inquiry and has subpoenaed Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, for a deposition.

Tesla's recent earnings report revealed slumping vehicle sales, thinning profits, and a 22% stock decline this year. The company faces stiff competition from lower-cost EV makers and a potential loss of revenue from regulatory credits. While Musk touted the imminent arrival of autonomous technology, analysts and investors appeared more focused on the current profit and loss statement, with shares falling 8% after the report.

          <p>The ongoing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case continues to pose a significant political challenge for Donald Trump, as it strikes at the core of his populist appeal. This analysis suggests that Trump's difficulty in shaking the issue stems from the perception that he is defending powerful, secretive interests, which contradicts his base's anti-establishment sentiment. The case has evolved from a fringe conspiracy theory into a major political issue, consuming White House attention and creating a rare vulnerability for the former president. Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed how the narrative of powerful people acting behind closed doors now appears to involve Trump, undermining his image as a champion of the common person.</p>

          <p>A U.S. study has detected the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals," in many reusable period products. Researchers from the University of Notre Dame tested 59 items, including period underwear, menstrual cups, and reusable pads, finding that nearly a third contained PFAS. Some levels were high enough to suggest the chemicals were intentionally used in manufacturing for their water-repellent properties. PFAS are linked to serious health issues, including cancer and fertility problems, and persist indefinitely in the environment. The study's authors hope to raise consumer and industry awareness, noting that many similar products on the market are made without these toxic chemicals.</p>

A cheeseburger at 7th Street Burger costs $6.50, significantly less than the $9.89 for a similar item at Five Guys, despite both chains using fresh, never-frozen beef. By focusing on only three menu items and optimizing its operations, 7th Street Burger provides a compelling value proposition.

As his lung function deteriorated, he was placed on the transplant list at the Cleveland Clinic. After a month in the hospital and two false alarms, he successfully received a new pair of lungs.

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," has produced an unlikely song of the summer with its No. 2 hit, "Daisies." This analysis piece argues that the album's success stems from its departure from upbeat pop, instead offering a soothing, melancholic sound that resonates with the current cultural mood. The production is described as aqueous and gentle, influenced by indie artists Dijon and Mk.gee. The album's downtempo yet intricate songs, like "Daisies" and "All I Can Take," reflect a broader trend in popular music toward more reserved and simmering tracks. This contrasts with last year's hedonistic "Brat summer," suggesting a collective cultural hangover or malaise reflected in our listening habits.</p>
