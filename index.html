          <p>With U.S. college costs averaging over $38,000 annually, many students rely on federal loans. This article details the maximum borrowing amounts, which vary by dependency status, year in school, and degree level. For instance, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500, while the aggregate limit for graduate students is $138,500. Since these limits often don't cover the full cost of attendance, the article suggests exploring private student loans to bridge the financial gap after exhausting federal options.

          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share by attracting consumers seeking value amid economic pressures. CEO Russell Weiner stated that industry headwinds are creating opportunities for the company, which reported a 3.4% rise in U.S. same-store sales, exceeding estimates. The success is attributed to promotions like its $9.99 deal and new products, which have appealed to customers across all income levels. While facing challenges like competition from at-home dining, Domino's strategy parallels that of other brands successfully marketing value over fast-food rivals.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated he will not support a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in D.C. unless the team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins." In a series of social media posts, Trump called the "Commanders" moniker "ridiculous" and demanded the team restore its "heritage and prestige." The team dropped its old name in 2020 following years of criticism over its racist connotations. Native American advocacy groups have condemned Trump's remarks, calling them a political distraction that ignores the dehumanizing nature of such mascots.</p>

          <p>Popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be a breakthrough treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder affecting millions of women. Women with PCOS often suffer from insulin resistance, and studies suggest that losing as little as 5% of body weight can improve symptoms. Researchers like Dr. Melanie Cree are studying how GLP-1 drugs, which improve insulin sensitivity and aid weight loss, can also reduce PCOS symptoms like irregular periods and high testosterone levels. While early results are promising, cost and insurance coverage remain significant barriers for patients.</p>

          <p>This article details the long and complex relationship between Donald Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which spanned from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. The two frequently socialized in New York and Palm Beach, and Trump once described Epstein as a "terrific guy." A recent report about a 2003 birthday book for Epstein, allegedly containing an odd message from Trump about a shared "secret," has intensified scrutiny. While their friendship reportedly ended in a bitter dispute in 2004, their documented history continues to fuel questions, especially amid ongoing controversies surrounding the Epstein case.</p>
