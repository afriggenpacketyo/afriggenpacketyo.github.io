          <p>The Justice Department has released over 300 pages of transcripts from its two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate of Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence, denied witnessing inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or Bill Clinton and claimed no 'client list' exists. The Giuffre family expressed outrage, stating Maxwell was not challenged on her 'court-proven lies' and was given a platform to 'rewrite history'. This release follows pushback on the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein case fallout, with Maxwell seeking a Supreme Court review of her conviction.</p>

          <p>The Nigerian military announced that an air strike on Saturday killed more than 35 jihadists who had gathered near the border with Cameroon. This action by the Nigerian Air Force aimed to support ground forces and disrupt terrorist logistics in the northeastern region. The report comes amid a resurgence of violent attacks by Islamist groups like Boko Haram and ISWAP, which have intensified since the beginning of the year. Over 40,000 people have died and 2 million displaced since the insurgency began, with the government facing criticism for its handling of the ongoing security challenges.</p>

          <p>Rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders experienced a challenging final preseason game for the Cleveland Browns, netting negative yards and taking five sacks, which likely places him low on the depth chart. Despite an impressive first preseason outing, his recent performance led to widespread debate among fans and pundits, with many criticizing the Browns' coaching decisions for putting him in a difficult position with backup players. Former NFL quarterback Derek Carr and sports host Skip Bayless questioned why Sanders was pulled from the game's final drive, fueling speculation about intentional obstacles or a 'conspiracy' against the young player. However, others defended the coaching staff, attributing the poor showing to Sanders' own performance and the team's strategic play-calling.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are grappling with increased tariff costs, but have largely managed to avoid widespread price hikes by diversifying sourcing and negotiating with vendors. While consumer spending remains steady overall, lower-income households show greater sensitivity to price changes, prompting retailers to be strategic in their adjustments. Walmart noted some price increases but also expanded discounts, while luxury brands like Coach experienced strong sales. The trade uncertainty, especially regarding tariffs on China, continues to influence companies' financial outlooks and supply chain strategies, with some like Target providing wider earnings forecasts.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has formed in the Atlantic Ocean southeast of Bermuda, becoming the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Located about 405 miles south-southeast of Bermuda with 40 mph winds, Fernand is moving north and is forecast to strengthen over the weekend, potentially becoming a hurricane by Monday before weakening. The storm is expected to remain over open ocean, moving well east of Bermuda.

          <p>A recent YouGov survey in Germany reveals that one in three workers fears losing their jobs to artificial intelligence. The poll, which surveyed over two thousand eligible voters, found that urban workers and those with lower education levels reported the highest anxiety regarding AI's impact on employment. This concern aligns with a separate Ifo Institute survey from June, where more than a quarter of German companies anticipated job losses due to AI within the next five years. The widespread apprehension highlights a growing societal debate in Germany about the future of work in an increasingly automated landscape.</p>

          <p>Emine Erdogan, Turkey's first lady, has called on Melania Trump to speak out for children suffering in Gaza, where UN-backed experts have declared a famine affecting half a million people. In a letter, Erdogan praised Trump's support for Ukrainian children and urged her to extend that advocacy to Palestinians, describing Gaza as a 'children's cemetery.' The appeal comes after a damning report confirmed famine conditions in Gaza City, warning that 132,000 children's lives are threatened by malnutrition. Israel denies the famine claims, accusing experts of bias, as its military prepares for a new offensive in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating in Serbia as anti-corruption protests, sparked by a railway station canopy collapse, are met with police violence and arrests, including accusations of government-hired criminal gangs. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's hardline response is putting pressure on the European Union to act, given Serbia's candidate status for EU membership. While the EU has called for de-escalation and investigation into excessive force, critics argue its 'strategy of appeasement' has failed, urging a tougher stance. Concerns about Serbia's ties to Russia and economic interests, such as lithium reserves, complicate the EU's approach, potentially undermining trust in its commitment to fundamental values.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) is at the forefront of global efforts to save species from extinction, housing over 20 threatened species on its 32,000-acre Northern Virginia campus. Scientists at the institute study reproduction, ecology, and genetics, aiming to reintroduce animals like the Przewalski's horse and black-footed ferret back into their natural habitats. Despite the success in growing populations, conservation biologists express concern over the alarming rate of species disappearance, which can have cascading effects on entire ecosystems. The SCBI's work, including caring for 60 ferret kits to be released, underscores the critical role of every animal in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

          <p>Tottenham's new manager, Thomas Frank, is quickly winning over supporters after leading the team to a 2-0 victory over Manchester City, marking consecutive wins and clean sheets. Frank's impressive start comes amid fan discontent over the club's transfer window activity and chairman Daniel Levy. Despite limited new signings, Frank's tactical approach, emphasizing solid defense and attacking freedom, has transformed the team's performance, contrasting with their previous season's negative goal difference. Midfielder Joao Palhinha, a new loan signing, delivered a player-of-the-match performance, crediting Frank's vision for his return to the Premier League and immediate impact.</p>

          <p>Société Générale strategist Albert Edwards warns that a tech stock bubble is forming, with the sector now comprising 37% of the US stock market, surpassing the dot-com era peak. He notes that high valuations are evident in falling free cash flow yields, as tech firms heavily invest in AI development. Despite the tech rally, long-term government bond yields have surged, offering risk-free returns over 4%, a historical indicator that typically weighs on stock valuations. Edwards suggests that the current market, which has so far shrugged off rising bond yields, will eventually be impacted, challenging the 'There Is No Alternative' (TINA) argument that once justified high equity valuations.

          <p>The Ukraine war is profoundly altering geopolitical dynamics in former Soviet states, evident in a US-mediated peace treaty between Azerbaijan and Armenia, traditionally within Russia's sphere of influence. US President Donald Trump's direct involvement in securing a corridor agreement highlights Russia's waning regional power, despite official Russian statements welcoming the peace deal. Tensions between Russia and Azerbaijan have also risen following a plane crash incident and diplomatic disputes. Countries like Azerbaijan and Central Asian states are increasingly pursuing multi-vector foreign policies, seeking new alliances and leveraging Russia's preoccupation, with China also quietly expanding its influence by guaranteeing sovereignty and security.</p>

          <p>Five people have died after a tour bus carrying over 50 passengers lost control and rolled over on the New York State Thruway near Pembroke. The bus was returning to New York City from Niagara Falls when it veered into the median, over-corrected, and ended up in a ditch. State police identified the victims as Shankar Kumar Jha, Pinki Changrani, Xie Hongzhuo, Zhang Xiaolan, and Jian Mingli, with nationalities including Indian, Chinese, and Filipino. While mechanical failure and operator impairment have been ruled out, the cause of the accident remains under investigation.

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has declared that it will not defend a decades-old grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), asserting the funding is unconstitutional. The program, created in 1998 to address lower college attendance and graduation rates among Latino students, is being challenged in a lawsuit by Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action group. Citing the 2023 Supreme Court decision against affirmative action, the Justice Department argues the grants provide an unconstitutional advantage based on race or ethnicity. This stance contrasts with Trump's 2026 budget request, which preserved HSI grants, leading a national association of HSIs to intervene as a defendant in the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to experience a return of 30C heat on bank holiday Monday, marking one of the hottest summers on record, before the remnants of Hurricane Erin bring unsettled weather. Large crowds are expected at events like Notting Hill Carnival and Reading and Leeds festivals, enjoying warm and sunny conditions. However, travel disruptions are anticipated due to rail strikes and engineering works. This short burst of warmth will be followed by cooler, unsettled weather from Tuesday as Erin's tropical air pushes towards the British Isles, bringing persistent rain for the remainder of the week. The prolonged dry periods this summer have already led to hosepipe bans and concerns for the agricultural sector.</p>

Eze expressed his gratitude to Crystal Palace fans in an emotional social media post, acknowledging their support throughout his career.

The demonstrations follow a High Court ruling that blocked a hotel in Epping from accommodating asylum seekers, prompting other local authorities to consider legal challenges. While the government is committed to closing asylum hotels, the number of asylum seekers housed in them has increased, highlighting ongoing public and political debate surrounding migration policies and accommodation provision.</p>

President Donald Trump had publicly dismissed the assessment as 'flat out wrong,' claiming the nuclear sites were 'completely destroyed.' Senator Mark Warner warned that Kruse's sacking signals Trump's 'dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test,' echoing previous removals of officials whose analyses diverged from the president's narrative.</p>

Merz emphasized the need for both parties to collaborate on restructuring the social insurance system due to rising costs and budget deficits.
