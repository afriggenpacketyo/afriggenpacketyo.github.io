          <p>Mao Saigo shot a 6-under 66 to take the second-round lead at the US Women’s Open at Erin Hills, holding a three-stroke advantage over a group of six golfers including Nelly Korda. Saigo, who previously won the Chevron Championship, expressed her determination to perform her best without comparing her potential score to past tournaments at Erin Hills. Korda, who has had a complicated relationship with the US Women's Open, recorded her best round in the event with a 67. The article details Saigo's recovery from an unlucky break on the 14th hole and her subsequent strong performance. The event was temporarily suspended due to weather concerns, but Kim remains in contention despite a late bogey.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed tax on remittances from the US is projected to negatively impact African economies. The tax, included in a recent bill passed by the House of Representatives, levies a 3.5% tax on remittances sent by non-US citizens. Remittances represent a significant source of income for many African families, often exceeding aid and foreign direct investment. Experts predict that migrants will seek unofficial channels to avoid the tax, and the policy is criticized as a measure against illegal migration, potentially squeezing migrants and their families.

A cold front is expected to hit some parts of Saskatchewan, bringing with it some rain, but its current forecasted path narrowly misses the regions where the fires are burning.</p>
