          <p>Luxury department store Harrods has reported being the latest retailer targeted by a cyberattack, leading to restricted internet access across its sites as a proactive security measure. The company's IT security team took immediate steps to secure systems, ensuring the flagship store, H beauty stores, and airport locations remain open for customers. Shoppers can still make purchases through the Harrods website, and the retailer has not requested customers to alter their shopping habits. This incident follows similar attacks on Co-op and Marks & Spencer, highlighting the increasing vulnerability of retailers to cyber threats.</p>

          <p>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz is reportedly stepping down from his position in the Trump administration following a controversy surrounding his use of the Signal messaging app. Waltz had created a Signal group that inadvertently included The Atlantic Editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who subsequently reported on discussions of U.S. military plans. Deputy National Security Advisor Alex Wong is also expected to depart, marking the first major staff changes since the beginning of Trump's second term. The Signal group included other high-level officials, such as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>

The reporter questioned the accuracy of ICE deportations, prompting DeSantis to defend the operation and criticize the reporter's apparent lack of sympathy for victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. DeSantis emphasized his commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring the safety of Florida citizens, criticizing the federal government's immigration policies under President Biden.

The water, sourced from upstate reservoirs, undergoes testing for temperature, color, clarity, and levels of salt, chemicals, and coliform bacteria.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot use the Alien Enemies Act to detain or deport Venezuelan migrants in southern Texas. Judge Fernando Rodriguez determined that the president's invocation of the AEA exceeded the scope of the statute, which was enacted in 1798 and intended for wartime scenarios. The ruling is a setback for Trump's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, but the administration is likely to appeal. The judge clarified that the ruling does not prevent removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>

Some scientists warn that doing so in a way that delays approval of lifesaving shots could jeopardize public health.

          <p>With a large percentage of Americans struggling due to an uptick in financial pressure right now, it's important to understand the risks of defaulting on debt. Defaulting on debt means you've failed to meet your repayment obligations, which typically happens after 90 to 180 days of missed payments. Defaulting on debt can result in serious credit damage, legal action, and extra financial stress. There are structured debt relief options available, such as a debt consolidation loan, a debt management plan, debt forgiveness, or bankruptcy.</p>

The investment fund will be financed with revenues from new projects in critical minerals, oil and gas — and not from projects that are already operating.

          <p>Colleges are increasingly turning to consultants, owned by private equity firms, to find applicants and calculate scholarships, which significantly affects the price families pay. These firms gather extensive data on teenagers and their families, using algorithms to determine optimal discount rates. This practice, described as "financial aid optimization," has drawn scrutiny from politicians who suggest it could lead to algorithmic collusion. The article traces the evolution of this system and its impact on college affordability and accessibility.</p>

Despite this, the CNBC Investing Club remains optimistic, adding to their DuPont position and staying positive on Honeywell's turnaround. Both companies are set to release earnings, with investors closely monitoring updates on the spinoff plans and the potential impact of tariffs.</p>
