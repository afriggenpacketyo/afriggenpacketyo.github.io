          <h2>UK Retail Sales Experience Significant Growth After Four Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 04:05:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK retail sales experienced their most substantial increase in nearly four years, driven by favorable weather conditions in March that boosted sales across various sectors. The Office for National Statistics reported a 1.6% rise in sales volumes between January and March compared to the previous three months, marking the largest increase since July 2021. Garden centers benefited from the sunny weather, while clothing and DIY goods also saw increased demand; however, food sales, particularly in supermarkets, declined. Despite the positive figures, analysts caution that consumer confidence dipped in April, potentially leading to weaker sales in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Japanese court has ordered Amazon Japan to pay 35 million yen in damages for failing to prevent sellers from listing counterfeit products on its platform. The lawsuit was filed by medical equipment manufacturer Try and E Co. and its distributor Excel Plan Co., who claimed that their sales declined due to the availability of fake pulse oximeters. The court ruled that Amazon has an obligation to take effective measures against fake products, acknowledging that the company did not remove listings even after being notified of the counterfeit items. This ruling sets a precedent for online marketplaces to implement robust authentication systems to protect businesses and consumers from fraudulent activities.</p>

          <p>Konstantin Borisov, Ph.D., has controversially claimed that the biblical Garden of Eden was actually located near the Great Pyramid of Giza. Borisov cites biblical and medieval texts, arguing that the Gihon River mentioned in the Bible is actually the Nile and that the Great Pyramid was built near the Tree of Eternal Life. He supports this claim with a simulation showing how a blast inside the King's chamber could create an electric field resembling a tree. While most biblical scholars locate Eden in southern Iraq, Borisov asserts that the Great Pyramid fulfills the notion of immortality ascribed to Adam and aligns with ancient cultures' concept of a sacred mountain.</p>

Stein notes that China has been preparing for this situation since mid-2018 and does not see the need for a deal as urgently as the White House might believe. He also highlights that China does not want to be perceived as being bullied on the world stage. Stein suggests that the US's expectation that China would initiate contact after the first round of tariffs was a misjudgment, leading to an escalatory spiral.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have unearthed the 5,000-year-old remains of a noblewoman in Caral, Peru, indicating that women held valued positions in the ancient society. The woman's remains were carefully preserved in layers of fabric and included a mantle of macaw feathers. Preliminary findings suggest she was between 20-35 years old and about 5 feet tall. The discovery challenges the notion that rulers were exclusively male and highlights the importance of women in the Caral civilization, one of the oldest in South America.</p>
