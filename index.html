          <p>A third man has been arrested in connection with alleged arson attacks at properties linked to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command is leading the investigation into three separate incidents, including a vehicle fire, a fire at the prime minister's private home, and a fire at an address where he previously lived. Roman Lavrynovych has already been charged with arson in connection with the incidents and is being held in custody until his next court hearing. The investigation is ongoing, with police being granted additional time to question the man arrested at Luton Airport. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new 12-year deal between the UK and the EU on access to UK waters has sparked controversy in Scotland's fishing industry. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) has criticized the agreement, claiming it sacrifices the industry's interests, while Salmon Scotland welcomes the deal as a way to cut red tape and improve access to the EU market. The agreement extends existing access for EU boats in exchange for reduced checks on food exports, leading to concerns about future negotiating leverage for the UK. The UK government says the deal will benefit agricultural exporters and holidaymakers, but critics argue that the fishing industry has been "sold down the river."</p>

          <p>Portugal's ruling center-right Democratic Alliance, led by Prime Minister Luís Montenegro, is set to govern again in a minority government following a recent election. However, the election's most notable outcome was the surge of the hard-right Chega party, which secured over 22% of the vote and is poised to become a significant political force. Chega's rise, fueled by anti-immigrant sentiment and economic grievances, marks a shift in Portuguese politics, mirroring trends in other Western European countries where hard-right parties are gaining prominence. While Montenegro has ruled out allying with Chega, the party's increased influence is likely to pressure the government to adopt more right-leaning stances on issues like immigration.</p>

          <p>Israel is allowing more Palestinians to leave Gaza, despite a long-standing policy of tight border control. The change comes amid international criticism of the humanitarian situation in Gaza. While some Israeli officials suggest this aligns with plans for resettlement, others claim it's a response to foreign requests to help people reach safety. This shift is viewed with suspicion by many Palestinians, who fear it echoes historical dispossession. The opportunity to leave is fraught with echoes of historical dispossession of their lands.</p>

          <p>CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon is resigning, citing disagreements with the parent company over a potential settlement with President Donald Trump. The lawsuit stems from allegations that CBS edited an interview with Kamala Harris to benefit her campaign. McMahon, like "60 Minutes" executive producer Bill Owens, opposed settling the case. Paramount Global, CBS's parent company, is reportedly in settlement talks with Trump as it seeks approval for a merger with Skydance Media.</p>
