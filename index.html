          <p>Two separate bridge collapses in Russian regions bordering Ukraine have resulted in at least seven deaths and numerous injuries. In the Bryansk region, a road bridge collapsed onto a passenger train, causing significant casualties. Simultaneously, in the Zheleznogorsk district, another bridge collapsed, derailing a locomotive train and injuring the driver. Authorities are investigating the causes of the incidents, including potential "illegal interference" in the Bryansk collapse, but it is unclear if the events are related and Ukraine has not commented on the matter.</p>

          <p>A recent study across 30 European countries reveals that parents generally experience a greater sense of meaning in life compared to individuals without children, however, they also report lower levels of life satisfaction. This difference is particularly pronounced for mothers and varies significantly depending on the country's family policies and gender equality. Scandinavian countries, known for their robust childcare support and gender equality, show smaller differences in life satisfaction between parents and non-parents. The study highlights the importance of societal support in alleviating the challenges faced by parents and recognizing children as a shared responsibility.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a sharp rise in obesity rates, with experts attributing the trend to factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and the consumption of highly processed foods. A lack of regulation in the food industry and the use of toxic chemicals in food production also contribute to the problem. The Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to combat obesity, but it faces criticism for overlooking broader economic struggles and the inaccessibility of healthy foods for low-income households. There is a growing call for comprehensive measures, including free school meal programs and stricter regulations on unhealthy food marketing.</p>

Rather than pursuing outlandish bucket list activities, the author suggests that reflecting on mortality often leads people to seek a deeper connection with the ordinary aspects of life. This includes reconciling differences, strengthening relationships, and appreciating the intrinsic value of everyday moments. The author emphasizes the importance of living with an awareness of death to embrace the possibility of living freely.</p>

          <p>Skateboarding powerhouse Japan has expressed support for the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Despite the potential impact on medal prospects, Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa cited concerns about injuries among younger athletes as a reason for endorsing the change. While some of Japan's previous Olympic medalists would have been ineligible under the new rule, the country welcomes the restriction to protect the physical well-being of child athletes. The move aligns with the International Olympic Committee's efforts to tighten age restrictions following doping scandals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Penal Code has been amended to prioritize rehabilitation efforts in prisons, marking the first significant change to punishment methods in over a century. Imprisonment is no longer divided into categories based on labor, and prison work is no longer mandatory, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance and education. The revised law introduces tailored programs based on an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, including programs for elderly inmates and those with addiction issues. This shift aims to reduce recidivism and improve the reintegration of inmates into society.</p>

The two main candidates in the upcoming election have been mostly silent on gender equality, a topic that Yoon used to gain power by appealing to men who felt marginalized by feminist policies. A third candidate, known for his anti-feminist views, has gained popularity, symbolizing a new fight for many young women.
