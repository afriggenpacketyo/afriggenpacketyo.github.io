          <p>The Trump administration is escalating several initiatives, including preparing for increased immigration enforcement operations in Chicago and other cities. Concurrently, the Federal Housing Finance Agency has sent a second criminal referral against Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to the Department of Justice over alleged mortgage misrepresentations. In a separate move, President Trump has revoked the extended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, a decision that follows similar cancellations for other former officials and Biden family members. The administration has also deployed the D.C. National Guard for beautification and anti-crime efforts in the capital.</p>

          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, rose at an annual rate of 2.9% in July, its highest level since February. The overall PCE index, which includes the more volatile food and energy categories, held steady with a 2.6% annual increase, aligning with economists' forecasts. Despite inflation remaining above the Fed's 2% target, the report also showed a 0.5% increase in consumer spending, indicating continued economic strength. The data reinforces expectations that the central bank will proceed cautiously with any potential interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has removed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office for an ethics violation, creating political instability. The ruling stemmed from a leaked phone call in which she referred to Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen as "uncle" while discussing border tensions, leading to accusations that she undermined the Thai army. This decision marks the third time a member of the powerful Shinawatra family has been ousted from the premiership. Parliament will now select a new leader, with her party's former coalition partner having withdrawn its support following the controversy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's legal team has filed a motion asking a federal judge to deny Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order that would prevent her termination. The administration wants to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which were detailed in a second criminal referral filed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Cook's lawsuit contends her removal is illegal, naming Trump, the Fed Board, and Chairman Jerome Powell as defendants. The Federal Reserve has stated it will not argue the merits of the case but has requested a prompt ruling to resolve the dispute.</p>

          <p>A shooter, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, opened fire through the windows of Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass. The attack resulted in the deaths of 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski, with 18 other children and adults injured. Westman, who had legally purchased three firearms and previously attended the adjoining school, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Authorities are investigating the motive, noting the shooter had an obsession with past mass shootings and left behind anti-Catholic and other hateful writings.</p>

          <p>An executive order from President Trump has ended the 'de minimis' trade provision, which previously allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. The abrupt change has caused significant disruption for global retailers and small businesses, leading some international postal services to temporarily suspend U.S. shipments. Companies from Lululemon to small Etsy sellers, who built supply chains around this exemption, now face increased tariffs and operational challenges. This policy shift is expected to raise costs for consumers and could particularly impact low-income families who rely on cheaper imported goods. (not investment advice)</p>

While overall company revenues slightly missed forecasts, the performance of the cloud unit and continued recovery in e-commerce pushed its U.S.-listed stock up.

The governor's comments reflect escalating tensions, particularly after Trump federalized the California National Guard without Newsom's consent for deployment in Los Angeles. Newsom urged Republicans to recognize the danger and framed the current political climate as a critical moment in U.S. history.</p>

The Ministry of Local Government based its savings estimates on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN), which projected £2.9 billion in savings over five years. However, the CCN has since updated its analysis, now suggesting that some reorganization scenarios could result in no savings or even net costs. Critics argue that embarking on such a significant restructuring without independent, up-to-date evidence is irresponsible and could strain already pressured local services.</p>

They drew a parallel to the NFL attacker, who also left behind writings blaming the organization for issues related to CTE.

While oil flow has resumed, the incident highlights Hungary's significant dependence on Russian energy.

The expansion comes as the country faces new economic headwinds, including 50% U.S. tariffs on Indian imports that recently took effect, raising concerns about future growth prospects.

The backlash is being fueled by activists who frame the company's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies as discriminatory. This incident is presented as an example of a cynical strategy to impose authoritarian control over all aspects of American society, from museums to corporations.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming military parade will provide a rare glimpse into the current hierarchy of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), as personnel changes are not publicly announced. The prominence of certain generals in commanding the event will signal who is favored for senior promotions within the military's top ranks. Conversely, the absence of previously rising stars may indicate they have been targeted by President Xi Jinping's ongoing anti-corruption campaign. This campaign has already led to the removal of at least 16 military deputies from the National People's Congress since March 2023.</p>

          <p>The U.S. ambassador to China, David Perdue, is not expected to attend Beijing's large-scale military parade commemorating the end of World War II. According to sources, this move appears to be part of a coordinated decision by Western diplomatic missions to decline invitations to the event despite pressure from the Chinese government. The parade is a significant event for Beijing, intended to showcase its military strength and national pride on a major historical anniversary. It remains unclear whether the U.S. embassy will send a lower-level diplomat or a military attaché in the ambassador's place.</p>

          <p>An analysis of global pension systems reveals significant structural differences, with the U.S. receiving a C+ rating and ranking 29th out of 48 countries. Unlike nations such as the Netherlands, which mandates retirement contributions, the U.S. system heavily relies on voluntary participation in 401(k)-style defined contribution plans. This voluntary nature creates a significant risk of inadequate coverage for the population. Experts suggest that making contributions mandatory, as seen in top-ranked systems, is a key factor in ensuring broader financial security for retirees and addressing challenges like increased longevity.

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has dropped Trent Alexander-Arnold from the latest national squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia.

In his place, the squad includes first-time call-ups for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson and Tottenham full-back Djed Spence. The omission raises questions about Alexander-Arnold's international future as he adapts to his new club environment ahead of the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>After being secretly filmed by a cyclist while jogging in Cologne, a woman named Yanni Gentsch confronted the man, forced him to delete the footage, and recorded the encounter. Her video went viral and highlighted a gap in German law, which does not criminalize filming clothed body parts for sexual purposes unless private areas are exposed. In response, Gentsch launched a petition demanding that any secret, sexually motivated recording be made a criminal offense. The petition has garnered over 125,000 signatures and has initiated a national conversation about sexual harassment and victim protection.</p>

          <p>The annual arrival of pumpkin spice season faces a new economic challenge this year due to the Trump administration's 50 percent tariffs on imports from India. India is a major exporter of key spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, which are essential components of the popular fall flavor. While current product prices may not be immediately affected due to existing inventory, spice importers anticipate future price hikes. The tariffs could test the limits of America's deep-seated affection for pumpkin spice, a flavor that has evolved from a seasonal trend into a massive, omnipresent cultural and commercial phenomenon.

The U.S. has not made any public threat of invasion but continues to exert pressure on Maduro's government, which it accuses of heading a cocaine trafficking cartel.
