          <p>President Trump was reportedly overheard on a hot mic discussing business matters with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, raising ethical concerns. The conversation, which appeared to involve Trump's son Eric and a Trump Organization real estate venture in Indonesia, occurred shortly after Trump addressed world leaders. Critics argue this blurs the line between his official duties and personal financial interests, despite White House claims of a firewall. The incident highlights ongoing scrutiny over the president's potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Samuel Lee Smithers, 72, was executed in Florida, marking the state's 14th execution this year, a new record. Smithers was convicted in 1999 for the 1996 murders of Christy Cowan and Denise Roach, whose bodies were found in a pond after he met them for sex. His appeal, arguing age-based ineligibility for execution, was denied by the Florida and U.S. Supreme Courts. This execution highlights Florida's active use of the death penalty, with two more scheduled soon, including individuals convicted of sexual assault and murder.</p>

This announcement follows the arrest of a suspected Latin Kings leader in Chicago accused of offering such payments.

          <p>The Republic of Ireland secured a vital 1-0 victory over Armenia in a World Cup qualifier, propelled by Evan Ferguson's goal. The game's turning point came when Armenia captain Tigran Barseghyan was dismissed for headbutting Ireland midfielder Finn Azaz, giving Ireland a numerical advantage. Azaz commented that Barseghyan "lost his head" during the physical encounter. This win moves Ireland to third in Group F, keeping their World Cup play-off hopes alive with two games remaining.</p>

          <p>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is experiencing its lowest morale in decades following recent layoffs affecting 550 employees, reducing its headcount by over 10%. These cuts are part of a reorganization and are attributed to ongoing budgetary challenges, including massive federal cuts to the Mars Sample Return mission. The institution has seen staffing reduced by a third in two years, exacerbated by a proposed $6-billion cut to NASA's budget by the Trump administration. The uncertainty threatens American leadership in space exploration and scientific discovery.</p>

          <p>President Trump threatened China with a cooking oil embargo and other trade "retribution" after Beijing reportedly stopped buying U.S. soybeans. Trump accused China of an "Economically Hostile Act" for purposefully harming American soybean farmers. China, previously the top U.S. soybean buyer, has shifted to South American suppliers due to retaliatory tariffs. This move follows a series of critical remarks from Trump about China, causing market volatility and raising questions about ongoing trade talks, despite a recent softening of his stance.

Journalists view this as an attempt to control information and limit access to unnamed sources.
