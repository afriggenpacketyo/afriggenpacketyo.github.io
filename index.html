          <p>A federal judge has approved a landmark settlement in the House v. NCAA case, paving the way for college athletes to be directly compensated by their schools. The settlement allows NCAA Division I schools to pay athletes up to $20.5 million per school annually, starting this fall, and allocates $2.75 billion to compensate former athletes who were previously barred from earning money while in school. NCAA President Charlie Baker hailed the decision as a positive change, acknowledging the need for athletes to receive financial benefits. This settlement marks a significant shift from the amateurism model that has governed college sports for over a century, potentially reshaping recruitment and resource allocation within athletic programs. Optimism is present as the NCAA is taking a step towards providing fair compensation to athletes for their hard work and dedication. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chicago Police Officer Krystal Rivera was unintentionally shot and killed by a fellow officer during a chase in Chatham. Officers were attempting to conduct an investigatory stop when a suspect fled into an apartment building, leading to a confrontation where a second person pointed a rifle at them. During the encounter, an officer discharged a weapon, accidentally striking Rivera, who later died at the hospital after the vehicle transporting her caught fire due to a mechanical issue. Superintendent Larry Snelling honored Rivera's dedication to saving lives by joining a march to raise awareness of missing women, while a psychologist expressed concern for the mental well-being of fellow officers in the district. The incident remains under investigation by CPD and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, with no charges announced yet.</p>

          <p>Former Osceola County Sheriff Marcos Lopez has been arrested on racketeering and conspiracy charges for allegedly running an illegal gambling operation. Prosecutors allege Lopez pocketed around $700,000 from the operation, which included slot machines, a lottery, and a "gambling house" at the Fusion Social Club in Kissimmee. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has suspended Lopez, appointing Christopher Blackmon as interim sheriff. Lopez pleaded not guilty and was given a $1 million bond, with his next court appearance scheduled for June 30. The investigation indicates the illegal gambling operation generated over $21.6 million over the years.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been brought back to the U.S. to face federal human smuggling charges. The indictment includes one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia after being presented with an arrest warrant. Abrego Garcia's attorney argues that his client is being unfairly punished and that the charges are unsubstantiated.

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against Sonoma County, California, alleging the county is using government drones in a "runaway spying operation" to peek into backyards and enforce code violations without warrants. The ACLU claims the county has used drones with high-powered cameras over 700 times to find violations on private property. Residents say the drones have caused privacy concerns and a loss of enjoyment of their property. The lawsuit argues that the county's use of drones violates the California Constitution's right to privacy and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling over a dozen flights daily due to tariffs hindering its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft. The airline will delay accepting two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring tariff-related costs, impacting Horizon Air's operations. President Trump's tariff policies have disrupted supply chains, forcing companies to raise prices. Alaska Airlines is cutting routes with multiple flights to minimize disruption, re-accommodating affected passengers. Delta Air Lines previously avoided tariffs by having new Airbus A350 airlines delivered to Japan before bringing them to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly considered creating a new political party, potentially escalating his conflict with President Trump. Musk posted a poll on X, asking his followers if it's time to create a new political party representing the "80% in the middle." He later endorsed the name "America Party," reminiscent of his America PAC, which spent millions supporting Trump in 2024. Starting a new party presents challenges, including ballot access and contribution limits. This move could signal Musk's continued engagement in politics and an attempt to challenge Trump's influence, although he has also entertained the idea of reforming one of the main parties from within.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old from El Salvador who was mistakenly deported in March, has been returned to the US to face prosecution on two federal criminal charges. He has been accused of participating in a trafficking conspiracy over several years to move undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the country. El Salvador agreed to release Mr Ábrego García after the US presented it with an arrest warrant, Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Friday. His lawyer has called the charges "preposterous". The White House had been resisting a US Supreme Court order from April to "facilitate" his return after he was sent to a jail in El Salvador alongside more than 250 other deportees.</p>

She alleged that employees helped procure drugs for these encounters, known as "hotel nights," which caused her pain and infections. Prosecutors charged Combs with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, to which he pleaded not guilty. Jane testified about financial ties with Combs, including a "love contract" where he provided a monthly allowance, which she said he used as leverage to pressure her into participating in the encounters.
