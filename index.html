          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with official figures indicating a drop in vacancies and a slight decrease in payroll numbers. Job openings fell by 5.8% to 718,000 between May and July, reaching their lowest point since early 2021, primarily in the hospitality and retail sectors. Despite this slowdown, average wage growth remained steady at 5%, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%. Economists suggest this gradual cooling may be a sign that the economic pressures from increased business taxes and the minimum wage are beginning to stabilize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin set to meet, Ukraine has issued a stark warning that Moscow cannot be trusted and is preparing for new military offensives. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that intelligence indicates Russia is not preparing for a ceasefire but is instead repositioning troops for new attacks, aiming to use the summit as a personal victory for Putin. Sidelined from the talks, Ukrainian and European officials are concerned about potential deals made without their involvement, particularly regarding territorial concessions. European leaders are pushing for Ukraine's inclusion, emphasizing that any agreement about the country's future requires its participation.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Gaza City killed six Palestinian journalists, including Anas al-Sharif, a well-known correspondent for Al Jazeera. Israel's military confirmed the strike, claiming al-Sharif was a Hamas commander operating under the cover of a journalist, an allegation that press freedom groups have called unsubstantiated. The attack has been condemned by journalist organizations, who view it as part of a pattern to silence reporting from Gaza. This event adds to the record number of journalists killed in the conflict, highlighting the extreme dangers faced by media personnel covering the war.</p>

          <p>President Trump is preparing for a high-stakes summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, aiming to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, though he has described it as a "feel-out meeting." European allies and Ukraine are expressing significant concern, as Kyiv will not be present for the talks, raising fears of a deal being struck that forces Ukraine into unfavorable concessions, such as land swaps. Trump has indicated a potential for "swapping territories" but insists he will consult with allies afterward. Meanwhile, Russia views the summit as a diplomatic victory, potentially delaying further sanctions and leveraging its current battlefield advantage.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is actively exploring a potential deal to sign Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze. The move is part of an effort to strengthen their attacking options, especially after key midfielder James Maddison was sidelined with a long-term knee injury. Eze, who scored 14 goals for Palace last season and was part of England's Euro 2024 squad, has emerged as a primary target for the club. While Spurs are also in discussions for Manchester City's Savinho, sources indicate that interest in Eze is serious, though it remains unconfirmed if both players will be pursued.</p>

The 19-year-old was detained by Chilean authorities and accused of providing false flight plan information after illegally landing his plane in Chilean territory during a solo flight to all seven continents. A judge ordered him to pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation and banned him from re-entering Chile for three years. Guo, who was attempting to become the youngest person to complete the flight challenge for charity, is now awaiting approval to continue his mission.</p>

          <p>A severe and unusual frost in Turkey, the world's largest hazelnut producer, has significantly impacted the global supply, causing prices to jump over 35% since April. This shortage poses a major challenge for confectioners, particularly for brands like Ferrero, which uses about a quarter of the world's hazelnut supply for products like Nutella and Ferrero Rocher. The price surge could lead to recipe changes, smaller product sizes, or increased costs for consumers. The event highlights the vulnerability of crop-dependent industries to climate change, as unpredictable weather patterns threaten not just hazelnuts but other key agricultural commodities as well.</p>

          <p>The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) has released a satirical memo mocking House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats' "Project 2026" policy goals, labeling them as "wildly unpopular." The memo outlines what the NRCC claims are Democratic priorities, including wasteful spending, open borders, and "woke" policies, arguing these positions will lead to their defeat. In response, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) accused Republicans of attempting to distract from their own "failed leadership" and an agenda that favors billionaires over the middle class.

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The announcement came after Trump fired the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, following a jobs report that showed a slowdown in hiring, which he claimed without evidence was faked. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has been endorsed by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. The nomination has drawn sharp criticism from some economists who argue Antoni is an extreme partisan and lacks the necessary qualifications, raising concerns about the politicization of the independent statistical agency.

This will be her first new album since last year's "The Tortured Poets Department" and also her first since she successfully regained control over her entire music catalog by repurchasing her master recordings.</p>

          <p>Former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's new memoir, "Frankly," provides a candid look at the highs and lows of her career and personal life. She expresses regret over the handling of transgender rights legislation, admitting she should have "hit the pause button" to build consensus, and describes her own arrest during the SNP finance probe as the "worst day" of her life. The book also delves into her difficult relationship with her predecessor Alex Salmond, the mental toll of leading during the COVID-19 pandemic, and personal challenges including a miscarriage and her recent separation from her husband.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old mystery surrounding the disappearance of cyclist Tony Parsons was solved thanks to the quick thinking of his killer's girlfriend. After her boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, confessed to a fatal hit-and-run, he took her to the remote location where he and his brother had buried the body. The girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, secretly dropped a Red Bull can at the shallow grave to mark the spot and later alerted the police. This crucial clue led investigators to recover Parsons' body, bringing a long-awaited resolution to his family, who expressed immense gratitude for her actions.</p>

          <p>Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski has revealed that he agreed to join Manchester United back in 2012 and was keen to play for manager Sir Alex Ferguson. However, the move from Borussia Dortmund never materialized because the German club refused to sell him, believing they could earn more by keeping him for another couple of years. Despite missing the chance to play in the Premier League, Lewandowski expressed no major regrets, stating he is very happy with his decorated career at top European clubs. He also reflected on the influence of his former Dortmund manager, Jürgen Klopp, whom he described as a father-like figure.</p>

          <p>While protests in Israel against the government's handling of the Gaza war are growing, public opinion presents a complex picture. Recent polls show a strong majority of Israelis, around 74%, now support a deal with Hamas to free all hostages, even if it means ending the war. However, the same research indicates very little sympathy for the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza, with 79% of Jewish Israelis reporting they are not troubled by reports of famine. This disconnect highlights that the primary driver for ending the war among the Israeli public is the return of hostages and soldiers, not a broader desire for peace or concern for Palestinian lives.</p>

          <p>Thousands of North Koreans are being sent to work in Russia under "slave-like" conditions to address labor shortages exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, a BBC investigation has found. Interviews with escaped laborers reveal they are forced to work over 18 hours a day on construction sites with minimal pay, which is sent directly to the North Korean state. South Korean intelligence officials estimate over 10,000 workers were sent last year in violation of UN sanctions, with tens of thousands more expected. This arrangement provides Moscow with cheap labor while funneling cash to Kim Jong Un's regime, strengthening the wartime alliance between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Spain is creating friction with the Trump administration by pursuing an independent foreign policy, notably by renouncing U.S. aircraft purchases and resisting NATO's 5% defense spending target. The Spanish government has opted for European military aircraft and is simultaneously seeking closer economic ties with China, a move that has also drawn criticism. Analysts suggest Spain's minority leftist government may be using these high-profile foreign policy stances to distract from domestic issues. Despite threats from President Trump, Spain has been largely shielded from direct economic retaliation due to its membership in the European Union, which negotiates trade deals collectively.</p>

          <p>A specific model of the NexGen knee implant, used in thousands of UK operations, was known to have a concerningly high failure rate for eight years before it was withdrawn, a BBC investigation reveals. Patients have suffered severe pain, immobility, and addiction to painkillers after the implant component slipped out of place, requiring hundreds of corrective surgeries. Surgeons and internal documents suggest the manufacturer, Zimmer Biomet, was slow to acknowledge the problem, which was first flagged by the National Joint Registry in 2014.

          <p>Two anglers in Delaware have set new state records after catching exceptionally large specimens of two invasive fish species. One fisherman reeled in a 33-pound flathead catfish, while another landed a 15-pound northern snakehead. Both species, native to other regions, pose a significant threat to Delaware's native aquatic ecosystems by outcompeting local wildlife like largemouth bass. The state's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) is actively encouraging anglers to catch and kill these invasive fish as a method of population control to help protect and restore the natural balance of local waterways.</p>

          <p>In the trial for California's lawsuit against the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles, a commanding general testified he never heard the situation described as a "rebellion." The lawsuit questions whether the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars domestic military law enforcement. The Trump administration justified the action under a law allowing the president to use the Guard during a "rebellion." Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman's testimony challenges a key part of the federal government's legal argument, adding a significant development to the ongoing legal battle over presidential power and military deployment within the U.S.</p>

In an interview, Abbott defended the potential move by comparing it to what he described as gerrymandering in Democratic-controlled states like California and Illinois. The statement comes as Texas Democrats continue to break quorum in the state House to block a vote on the new maps. The governor has filed a lawsuit with the Texas Supreme Court to compel the Democrats' return, escalating the partisan battle over redistricting.</p>

This low-cost, $2,500 first-person-view (FPV) drone is specifically designed to chase down and destroy the Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munitions used by Russia. Speed is a critical factor for these interceptors, as they must catch the Shaheds, which fly at over 100 mph. Ukraine is increasingly relying on this innovative, low-cost technology to bolster its air defenses against Russia's large-scale drone attacks, with a national goal of building 1,000 such drones daily.</p>
