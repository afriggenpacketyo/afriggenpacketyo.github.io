          <p>Apollo, a U.S. asset management firm, is set to provide a Â£4.5 billion loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK, marking a significant private credit investment. The loan, reported by the Financial Times and confirmed by CNBC sources, will be an investment-grade debt financing package with an interest rate below 7%. The funds are believed to be earmarked for Hinkley Point C, a project facing delays and budget increases after China General Nuclear Power Corp halted funding. This deal highlights the growing role of private credit in funding large-scale infrastructure projects in Europe, as private markets capitalize on opportunities in energy, transport, and data centers.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank might consider lowering interest rates as early as July, contingent on inflation remaining under control. In a CNBC interview, Waller stated that policymakers should consider easing monetary policy to avoid a potential slowdown in the labor market. He emphasized a cautious approach, advocating for gradual rate reductions to avoid market surprises. Waller's comments reflect a divergence of views within the Federal Open Market Committee, as some officials prefer to wait for more data on the impact of tariffs and broader economic growth.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's commemoration of Chen Yun's 120th birth anniversary signals a shift towards emphasizing resilient governance over communist ideology. In contrast to a 2015 speech that emphasized Marxism and communism, Xi's recent remarks focused on development planning and political resilience. He portrayed Chen as a model of disciplined governance and praised his ability to balance state-led and market approaches to economic planning. This rhetorical shift reflects China's need to navigate a volatile world with policy logic and technocratic expertise.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has allowed Donald Trump to retain control over California's national guard while the state's governor pursues a lawsuit challenging the legality of the deployment. The court extended a pause on a ruling that deemed Trump's action unlawful, citing his failure to coordinate with the governor and the absence of conditions justifying federal control. This decision stems from protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids, prompting a national debate on the use of the military on U.S. soil.</p>

Opponents argue this decision lacks support, increases costs for ratepayers, and is ideologically driven, while the DoE claims it is about grid reliability.
