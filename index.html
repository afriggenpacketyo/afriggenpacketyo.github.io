        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data indicates that President Trump's trade tariffs have significantly impacted U.S. exports, particularly in the agricultural sector. Ports across the country are experiencing declines in exports, with the Port of Oregon seeing a 51% decrease. The slump is attributed to businesses canceling manufacturing orders and changes in global demand. Retailers are warning consumers to buy sooner rather than later due to potential supply disruptions and lean inventories in the coming months. Matson, a Hawaii-based freight liner, has lowered its 2025 outlook, citing tariffs and geopolitical issues, indicating that container volume has declined approximately 30% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>President William Ruto of Kenya narrowly avoided being hit by a shoe during a public rally, an incident viewed by analysts as a sign of growing desperation and frustration among citizens. The incident occurred amidst rising public anger over high inflation and recent tax hikes, which many Kenyans blame for worsening the cost of living. Three individuals have been arrested in connection with the incident, and investigations are underway. Critics argue that while the government touts the reforms as necessary for economic stability, the burden has fallen disproportionately on low- and middle-income households.</p>

The historically friendly relationship between the U.S. and Canada is now strained, and the meeting could either ease tariffs or further damage relations.</p>

          <p>Hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones forecasts that the stock market will reach new lows, even if President Trump reduces tariffs on China.

          <p>Microsoft has introduced next-generation Copilot+ PCs that can run artificial intelligence models without requiring an internet connection. The new models, including a Surface Pro convertible tablet and a Surface Laptop, are less expensive than previous versions. The lower price is significant as consumers face increasing costs due to President Trump's tariffs on imported goods. The new Surface Laptop starts at $899, while the base-model Surface Pro costs $799, with both containing an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus chip.</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a significant increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles. However, the company warned that U.S. tariffs on EU cars could negatively impact profitability this year. Ferrari's 2025 guidance includes net revenue of more than 7 billion euros, but the introduction of U.S. tariffs could reduce profitability percentage margins. The automaker had previously announced a 10% price increase on certain models in response to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Despite persistent inflation, consumers are seeing prices fall in some sectors of the U.S. economy, including airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline. However, economists caution that these lower prices may not last due to volatile categories and the potential impact of tariffs. President Trump's claim that gas prices have dipped to $1.98 per gallon is inaccurate, although prices have broadly declined in the past year. Consumers are advised to enjoy these lower prices while they last.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board warns that President Trump's continued mentions of serving a third term should be taken seriously. The editorial argues that Trump has a history of using outlandish speculation to test boundaries and normalize ideas he genuinely favors. It asserts that the 22nd Amendment clearly bars Trump from serving a third term and that the appropriate response from political leaders is to firmly state this fact. The board also notes that Trump's past actions demonstrate a disdain for constitutional checks on presidential power.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that Venezuela's Maduro regime controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which was his justification for deporting Venezuelans. The memo's release further undermines the Trump administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act and raises questions about its criticism of media coverage. The administration had sent planeloads of Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador without due process. The memo states that while some Venezuelan officials may profit from the gang's activities, there's no credible evidence that the Maduro regime directs or enables the gang's migration to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Despite growing calls within the Labour party, the UK government insists it will not reverse cuts to winter fuel payments. Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman stated the move to restrict eligibility was necessary to ensure economic stability. Labour Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan called on the UK government to rethink the policy, but Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the policy was not being formally reviewed. The winter fuel payment is a lump-sum payment for pensioners, but the government restricted the payments to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits last year.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the constitutional and Supreme Court rulings regarding 'due process' for deportees under the Trump administration. While the Constitution guarantees due process to all non-citizens on U.S. soil, the specifics of what that entails are contested. The Supreme Court has stated that detainees are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard, but the type of notice and hearing varies depending on an immigrant's status and circumstances. The article also notes that the Trump administration has not been invoking the expedited removal program in recent high-profile deportation cases.</p>

          <p>Several companies, including Coca-Cola and Constellation Brands, have reported a slowdown in North American sales from Hispanic shoppers, who are cutting back on grocery spending. Experts attribute this pullback to stricter immigration policies and broader economic concerns. While the Trump administration has deported fewer people than President Biden's administration during the year-ago period, Immigration and Customs Enforcement data shows it is holding 10% more detainees than it was under Biden. Constellation Brands cited both tariffs and diminished spending from Hispanic consumers as reasons for a weaker-than-expected outlook.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor beat Wall Street's first-quarter expectations but suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs.

Ford cited near-term risks, including potential industry-wide supply chain disruptions and increased tariffs, as reasons for pulling its guidance.
