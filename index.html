          <p>The Trump administration plans to add a significant $100,000 fee to H-1B visa applications, a program used by many companies, particularly in the tech sector, to hire highly skilled foreign workers. This move targets employers like Amazon and Google and aligns with criticism that the program disadvantages American workers by enabling companies to hire foreign talent at lower salaries. However, experts warn this policy could backfire by incentivizing companies to move specialized jobs overseas and discouraging international students from enrolling in U.S. universities, thereby impacting American innovation and education sectors.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have reportedly made significant progress toward a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, although a final agreement has not yet been signed. The discussions come as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a federal law requiring it to divest the app's U.S. business or face a ban due to national security concerns. Despite bipartisan support for the law, President Trump has repeatedly extended the divestment deadline, expressing a desire to keep the popular social media platform active in the country.</p>

          <p>Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, has publicly supported late-night host Jimmy Kimmel following his indefinite suspension by ABC, a Disney subsidiary. Eisner criticized Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr for what he described as "out-of-control intimidation" of both ABC and Disney, which preceded the network's decision to pull "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" from the air. In his statement, Eisner questioned the state of leadership and freedom of speech, while also praising Kimmel as a talented and funny entertainer, adding another layer to the ongoing debate.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the lengthy filing as "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the 85-page complaint for containing excessive praise for the president and superfluous allegations rather than focusing on the legal claims. While the suit was thrown out, the judge has allowed Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more concise, 40-page amended complaint that adheres to proper legal standards.</p>

This situation arises after a Trump ally referred James for federal prosecution, an action James described as a "revenge tour" following her successful civil fraud lawsuit against the Trump Organization.</p>

          <h2>CDC Advisory Panel Updates Recommendations for COVID and Measles Vaccines</h2>

          <p>A CDC advisory committee has voted on several key vaccine recommendations, notably shifting its guidance on COVID-19 shots for most Americans. The panel now advocates for "individual-based decision-making" in consultation with healthcare providers, rather than a broad recommendation for everyone. For measles, the committee now supports separate MMR and varicella shots for children under four to reduce the slight risk of fever-related seizures associated with the combined MMRV vaccine. The panel also unanimously supported testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B.</p>

          <p>A newly appointed vaccine advisory panel, selected by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has significantly weakened the national recommendation for COVID-19 shots. The committee now advises that all Americans consult a healthcare provider before getting the vaccine, a process termed "shared clinical decision-making," breaking from previous guidance that recommended the shot for everyone aged six months and older. This change, driven by a panel that includes vocal critics of mRNA vaccines, may create confusion and access barriers, despite studies showing the shots' effectiveness in preventing severe illness.</p>

NATO and Finnish jets were scrambled to intercept the Russian aircraft, which had their transponders off and no flight plans, escalating tensions along the alliance's eastern flank amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

While Walmart's e-commerce business has become profitable, this growth has come at the cost of consumer trust, with shoppers sometimes receiving unsafe items instead of the discounted brand-name products they expected.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased on Friday, with the 10-year note reaching its highest level in two weeks, a counterintuitive move following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. This rise in long-term yields suggests that investors are weighing factors beyond the Fed's immediate policy, such as expectations for economic growth, inflation, and the government's need to issue more debt. The market's reaction reflects a complex economic outlook, where calming data on jobless claims has eased some concerns about a slowing economy, influencing investor sentiment on longer-term bonds.

This comes after an ESPN sideline report during "Monday Night Football" suggested a much deeper, regular collaboration between the two.</p>

A financial analysis suggests that some of the cheapest ways to borrow money now include home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans, and personal loans, all of which currently offer lower average rates than credit cards. With HELOCs featuring variable rates, they may become even more affordable if the Fed continues to lower rates in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>
