          <p>Grandparents are playing a larger role in American children's lives due to demographic shifts like falling birth rates and longer life expectancies, leading to deeper intergenerational relationships. Grandparents provide numerous benefits, including improved educational and mental health outcomes for children. They offer a fresh perspective, sometimes providing more relaxed child care than parents. However, grandparents are also stepping in to fill gaps in the child care system, which can be challenging, highlighting the need for policies that support grandparents' involvement without placing undue burden on them.</p>

          <p>An economist describes the current job market as experiencing a "low firing, low hiring" trend, making it more challenging for job seekers to find new positions. Despite low unemployment rates, businesses are hiring at a slower pace, and long-term unemployment is on the rise. Experts recommend that job seekers adjust their strategies by focusing on networking, exploring internal opportunities, customizing applications, and upskilling to stand out in a competitive market. They suggest being creative with networking, attending industry events, and reconnecting with former colleagues to increase visibility.</p>

          <p>President Trump's conflicting promises during his 2024 campaign are now leading to disillusionment among his supporters. His pledges to lower prices and impose steep tariffs have proven incompatible, alienating business leaders and working-class voters alike. Similar contradictions in foreign policy, particularly regarding the Middle East, have upset both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian constituencies. Trump's transactional approach to politics is facing its limits as his actions inevitably betray the expectations of some of his most ardent backers.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's hard-line ideologues in his administration, certain establishment figures are gaining influence, winning internal battles and steering policies. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, has taken the lead in trade negotiations, sidelining hardliners. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, has taken on the role of interim national security adviser. These figures have learned to work within Trump's framework, convincing him to make choices they deem better, rather than openly defying him.
