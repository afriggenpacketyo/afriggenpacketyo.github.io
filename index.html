          <p>The opening T20 match between England and New Zealand in Christchurch was washed out by rain, preventing New Zealand from starting their chase. Before the weather interruption, England had posted a score of 153-6, recovering from a difficult position of 81-5 on a tricky pitch. All-rounder Sam Curran was instrumental in this recovery, scoring an unbeaten 49 from 35 balls to give his team a competitive total. The match offered a limited opportunity for players to make their case ahead of the upcoming T20 World Cup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Organizers of the "No Kings" movement are expecting millions to participate in nationwide protests against the policies of President Trump, whom they accuse of behaving more like a monarch than an elected official. The demonstrations follow a large mobilization in June and are driven by concerns over immigration enforcement, education cuts, and environmental policies. While organizers emphasize a commitment to peaceful protest, some Republican governors in states like Virginia and Texas have mobilized their National Guard units in preparation. The White House has responded to the planned events with dismissiveness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican leaders have strongly criticized the nationwide "No Kings" protests, labeling them as "Hate America" rallies organized by the far-left. House Speaker Mike Johnson and other GOP members suggest that Democratic leaders are refusing to negotiate an end to the government shutdown to avoid angering their activist base ahead of the demonstrations. They argue that Democrats are prioritizing the protest movement over governing and hope that a resolution can be reached after the weekend's events. Several prominent Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have confirmed they will attend the rallies.</p>

The comments were made during a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand in Beijing, which Wang described as a "fresh start" for the relationship. He stated that China is prepared to advance the settlement of legitimate concerns and return relations to a stable and sustainable path.

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have confirmed that remains recently returned from Gaza are those of Eliyahu Margalit, a 75-year-old hostage killed during the October 7th attack. His body was taken from the Nir Oz kibbutz, and his death was previously announced in December 2023. Margalit is the 10th deceased hostage to be repatriated, though many others remain, causing significant anger in Israel over Hamas's failure to return all bodies as per the ceasefire deal. Hamas has cited difficulties in locating remains amidst the destruction caused by Israeli strikes.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he is giving up his titles, including the Duke of York, following intense pressure over his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a personal statement, the prince maintained his denial of the accusations against him but stated the ongoing controversy distracts from the Royal Family's work. The decision was made in consultation with King Charles and the Prince of Wales, though he will remain a prince. This move further diminishes his public role, which was already reduced after he stepped back from official duties.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems, a company central to 2020 election conspiracy theories, has been sold to Scott Leiendecker, who is rebranding it as Liberty Vote.

However, private communications to county election officials have assured them of continuity, stating it's the "same team, same support, different name." This dual messaging has raised questions among election officials about whether the change is a genuine transformation or a strategic rebrand to appeal to conservative jurisdictions that were previously skeptical of Dominion.</p>

          <p>A woman from Newport, Wales, discovered she had a large, cancerous tumor on her kidney after a seemingly minor accident during a holiday weekend at Butlin's. Charlotte Morjaria, 31, sought emergency care for what she believed was a broken rib after a friend playfully lifted her over his shoulder. A CT scan to check for internal damage unexpectedly revealed the 7cm tumor, which had produced only subtle symptoms that were easily attributed to other causes. Following surgery to remove her kidney, she is now cancer-free but requires lifelong monitoring.</p>

          <p>A surge in overseas orders is fueling a competitive hunt for executive talent among Chinese energy storage companies, with firms offering high salaries to lead their international operations. In the first half of this year, Chinese firms secured nearly 200 overseas orders totaling 186 gigawatt-hours, a year-on-year increase of over 220%. The majority of these orders originate from the Middle East, Australia, and Europe, as the U.S. market remains constrained by tariffs. This rapid global expansion has created a boom in recruitment for experienced professionals to manage and grow these new international ventures.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing accusations of racism following comments he made suggesting that large-scale deportations are necessary to address a "problem in the cityscape." Critics from opposition parties, and even some within his own CDU party, argue the vague wording implies that the presence of immigrants in urban areas is the problem itself. Opposition politicians have demanded an apology for the remarks, which they called discriminatory and dangerous. Supporters, however, defend the Chancellor, stating he was referring to crime and the need to enforce laws for those required to leave the country.</p>

          <p>British triathlete Beth Potter is competing for her second world title at the final event of the season in Australia, entering the race as joint leader with France's Cassandre Beaugrand. The 33-year-old Scottish athlete says she has felt less pressure this year compared to the lead-up to the 2024 Paris Olympics, where she won a bronze medal. Potter has found renewed motivation following the recent death of a friend and fellow member of the triathlon community, Sam O'Shea. She feels she has recovered mentally and physically from the toll of the Olympic year and is enjoying her racing again.</p>

          <p>According to Finland's President Alexander Stubb, Donald Trump is the only leader who can compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Speaking to the BBC, Stubb argued that forcing Russia to the negotiating table requires "the stick" rather than "the carrot," a role he believes Trump is uniquely positioned to play. His comments came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Trump at the White House. Stubb also emphasized that Finland would never recognize Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territories and supports Ukraine's path to EU and NATO membership.</p>

          <p>After his father's death, Antony Easton discovered a suitcase revealing his family's hidden past as wealthy German Jews named Eisner whose fortune was stolen by the Nazis. The contents led him on a decade-long investigation, uncovering a multi-billion-pound steel empire, Hahn'sche Werke, that was forcibly sold at a low price to a Nazi-supporting conglomerate. Further research showed that a trusted family adviser, Martin Hartig, took control of the family's properties and never returned them. Easton has since begun the process of restituting stolen artworks, including one from a Berlin museum.</p>

          <p>Chen-ning Yang, a Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist often compared to Albert Einstein, has died in Beijing at the age of 103. Yang was renowned for co-authoring the Yang–Mills theory in 1954 with Robert Mills, a set of equations that proved fundamental to modern physics. This theory provided the mathematical foundation for the Standard Model, which describes the behavior of all known elementary particles and unifies three of nature's four fundamental forces. His work remains a cornerstone of our understanding of the subatomic world.</p>
