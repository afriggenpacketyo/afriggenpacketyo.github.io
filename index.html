        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nearly a decade after the acrimonious split between creator Hideo Kojima and publisher Konami, the "Metal Gear Solid" series has returned with a remake of its third installment, "Metal Gear Solid Delta." The article explores the history of the franchise, the likely reasons for Kojima's 2015 departure, and Konami's subsequent shift away from major console game development. Amidst a lucrative industry trend of remaking classic games, this release is seen as a pivotal moment for the series. Early impressions from fans suggest the remake is a faithful recreation that honors the original's legacy while modernizing its graphics and controls.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers and their instructors in the UK are reporting a rising tide of abuse and intimidation from other motorists, including tailgating, aggressive horn use, and verbal threats. Some instructors have installed dashcams to capture evidence, which has led to police action in a significant number of cases. The article highlights the story of one instructor who was physically assaulted during a lesson, leading to a conviction and fine for the attacker. Police and driving instructors are urging other road users to show more empathy and patience, reminding them of the legal and financial consequences of inconsiderate driving.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new dating show, "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," hosted by Davina McCall, which combines elements of survival and romance. The format involves couples being matched by experts after a brief speed date, having a fake wedding, and then being left on a remote tropical island to build a relationship under harsh conditions. Contestants and critics suggest the show's focus on authenticity and overcoming adversity could lead to stronger connections compared to more superficial dating programs. The show also features a slightly older cast, reflecting a trend of people settling down later in life.</p>

          <p>NFL free agent Shilo Sanders, son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, has been fined $4,669 by the league for throwing a punch during a preseason game against the Buffalo Bills. The incident also led to his ejection from the game and his subsequent release by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Head coach Todd Bowles, who had previously praised Sanders' aggressiveness, called the action inexcusable. After clearing waivers and not being signed to a practice squad, Sanders' NFL future is uncertain, and he has suggested he may explore other career paths outside of football, such as music or modeling.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in the UK are using an innovative combination of technology and animal instinct to fight the invasive spruce bark beetle, a significant threat to the nation's forests. The beetle, which has devastated millions of spruce trees across Europe, is now being carried to the UK on winds across the English Channel. To combat the infestation, Forestry Research is deploying drones for aerial surveillance, sniffer dogs trained to detect the beetles' pheromones, and adapted nuclear fallout models to predict their spread.

          <p>Australia's Alex de Minaur has reached the fourth round of the US Open for the fifth time after his opponent, Daniel Altmaier of Germany, retired due to injury. De Minaur was leading the match when Altmaier, who was struggling after a grueling previous round, could no longer continue. As the last Australian player remaining in the singles draw, de Minaur now faces a favorable matchup against a qualifier for a spot in the quarterfinals. Meanwhile, fellow Australian Daria Kasatkina was knocked out in the third round by two-time champion Naomi Osaka, who advanced to face Coco Gauff.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order to prevent city departments, including the police, from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement. This move is a direct response to the Trump administration's plans for a large-scale crackdown on undocumented immigrants in Chicago and other Democratic-run "sanctuary cities." The order bars police from participating in federal patrols or checkpoints and from concealing their identities with face coverings. The action underscores the escalating conflict between the city and the federal government over immigration policy, with both the mayor and Illinois' governor condemning the potential deployment of federal agents or the National Guard.</p>

          <p>As the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in Florida prepares to shut down, families of former detainees are sharing stories of alleged medical neglect and lack of communication. The temporary facility, built in the Everglades, became a symbol of the Trump administration's immigration policies and is now closing following a judge's order. One family claims their son was left bleeding in severe pain after a medical emergency, while another reports their loved one, who has a heart condition, disappeared within the system for over a week.

The company acknowledged a software issue was impacting its wireless service and stated that its engineers were working to resolve the problem. Reports of the outage, tracked by DownDetector, peaked with nearly 23,000 complaints from coast to coast. SOS mode allows devices to make emergency calls by connecting to other available carrier networks when their primary network is unavailable, but it restricts normal calling, texting, and data usage for affected customers.</p>

          <p>An unregulated industry of for-profit "body brokers" is flourishing in the United States, acquiring donated corpses, dissecting them, and selling the parts for medical research and training. Unlike the UK and Europe where profiting from human tissue is largely illegal, loose U.S. laws allow companies to charge significant "processing" fees, creating a lucrative market. The article details instances of exploitation, where families believed they were donating a loved one's body for science, only to discover it was dismembered and sold disrespectfully. While proponents argue these brokers fill a critical need for medical advancement, critics call for stronger regulations to prevent the mistreatment of the deceased.</p>

          <p>New data from England's Department for Education reveals a strong correlation between student attendance in the first week of the school year and their attendance for the remainder of the year. According to the figures, 57% of pupils who were absent at all during the first week of the 2024 term went on to become "persistently absent," meaning they missed at least 10% of school. In contrast, only 14% of students with perfect attendance in the first week became persistently absent. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging parents and schools to prioritize getting children into classrooms from day one to combat post-pandemic attendance issues.</p>

However, councillors rejected the proposal, stating that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character, especially after a recent £55,000 restoration project. Local sentiment appears to support the council's decision, with many residents considering the sound to be unobtrusive background noise and a cherished feature of the town.</p>

          <p>A new investigation has implicated legendary Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, the inspiration for the movie "Walking Tall," in the 1967 murder of his wife, Pauline. For decades, it was believed she was killed in an ambush intended for him, but the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found inconsistencies in his statements and new forensic evidence suggesting the crime scene was staged. An exhumation and new autopsy revealed injuries inconsistent with Pusser's account and indicated a gunshot wound to his own cheek was likely self-inflicted. Officials stated that if Pusser, who died in 1974, were alive today, there would be enough evidence for a murder indictment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has eliminated the jobs of more than 500 employees at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America and other government-funded international broadcasters. The move, announced by acting CEO Kari Lake, comes despite a federal judge's recent ruling blocking the removal of VOA's director and ordering Lake to sit for a deposition. A group of agency employees, who have an ongoing lawsuit against the administration, called the continued attacks on the agency "abhorrent." The layoffs are the latest development in a protracted battle over the future of the news outlets, which the administration has accused of being "radical."</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man's Best Friend," chronicles her frustrating experiences in the dating world, even after achieving massive success with her previous record. The album presents a gallery of disappointing men, from crybabies to those too focused on self-improvement to be intimate. The sound combines '70s-era pop influences with country and dance music, produced with collaborators like Jack Antonoff. While the review suggests it isn't as consistently sharp as her breakout album "Short n' Sweet," it praises her versatile vocal performance and highlights standout tracks that showcase her witty and cynical take on modern romance.</p>

          <p>Controversial decisions involving the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system marred several Premier League matches, prompting criticism from managers and pundits. Burnley manager Scott Parker condemned the system after a late penalty decision, awarded after a lengthy VAR review, led to his team's loss against Manchester United. In another match, Fulham manager Marco Silva was left seething after a goal was disallowed for a minimal foul in the build-up. Pundits expressed frustration that the forensic analysis of VAR is making the game less enjoyable to watch and called for changes, such as including former players in the review process.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump took to social media to announce he had personally solved the mystery of a large gash in the newly installed limestone in the White House Rose Garden. In his post, Trump described how he angrily demanded to know who was responsible for the damage and used White House security footage to identify the culprits. He determined that a subcontractor's broken steel cart had scraped against the stone. Trump stated that he would have the stone replaced at the contractor's expense and that the company would never be allowed to work at the White House again, emphasizing the importance of surfaces to him as a builder.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by imposing widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on most of the world, deeming the action illegal. The court found that the President's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the levies was improper, stating that the power to impose such taxes rests exclusively with Congress. The ruling jeopardizes tariffs affecting a majority of U.S. goods imports but does not impact sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum or those imposed on China during his first term. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, medical and psychological experts generally agree on precautionary principles for children's screen time based on developmental stages. For toddlers, the recommendation is to be screen-free until age three to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. For kindergarten-aged children, limited and supervised screen time is advised to foster imagination and social interaction. As children grow, the focus shifts from strict time limits to the quality of content and maintaining open communication, ensuring digital activities do not replace essential real-world experiences and social development.</p>
