        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life for murdering her children in Idaho, has been sentenced to two additional consecutive life sentences in Arizona. The convictions stem from conspiracies to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and her niece's ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux, in 2019. Prosecutors argued her motives were financial gain and a desire to be with her new husband, Chad Daybell, using twisted religious beliefs as justification. The judge described her actions as showing a "blatant disregard for humanity" and leaving a "wake of destruction" across multiple states.</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has seen its stock value more than double in 2025, pushing its market capitalization to $375 billion and making it one of the 20 most valuable companies in the United States. This rapid growth is fueled by investor confidence in its artificial intelligence capabilities and its strong ties to the U.S. government, with government business revenue increasing by 45% in the last quarter. Despite its high valuation, the company's sales are significantly smaller than other firms in the top 20, and its stock trades at a very high multiple of 273 times forward earnings.

          <p>Intel's stock experienced a significant drop of over 8% after the company announced cost-cutting measures for its struggling chip manufacturing, or foundry, business. Despite a better-than-expected earnings report, investors are concerned about the foundry's failure to secure major external customers for its advanced chip-making processes. The company is canceling projects in Germany and Poland and slowing production in Ohio, admitting it may have to discontinue the foundry business entirely if it cannot attract commitments. This setback highlights Intel's ongoing difficulties in competing in the AI-dominated market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that the U.S. may not reach a negotiated trade agreement with Canada, suggesting tariffs might be the alternative. This statement comes as an August 1st deadline approaches for Canada to agree to new terms, with Trump threatening a 35% tax on Canadian goods if a deal isn't struck. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated his country will not be rushed into a bad deal. The ongoing negotiations are part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to renegotiate trade relationships and protect American manufacturing through tariffs, a move that has caused significant disruption to the global economy.</p>

Secretary Dan Driscoll criticized the original decision as an example of pushing a "far-left" agenda into military institutions. The reversal was praised by Judicial Watch, the group that filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit seeking documents related to the initial removal of the historic symbol.</p>

While Israel maintains there are no restrictions on aid, the UN and aid agencies cite significant logistical and security challenges.

          <p>Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche has concluded a second day of meetings with Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's convicted associate who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. Maxwell's lawyer stated that she answered every question truthfully and that "no asks and no promises" were made regarding her testimony. The meetings come amid growing pressure on the Trump administration to release files related to the Epstein investigation. When asked about potential clemency for Maxwell, President Trump said he had not thought about it, though he confirmed he had the power to grant it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coroner has concluded that former England cricketer Graham Thorpe died by suicide and that there were "shortcomings" in his mental health care in the months leading up to his death. The court heard that Thorpe, who died at 55 after being struck by a train, was not deemed to be in a crisis situation by healthcare professionals, even after his wife reported he was asking for help to end his life. The coroner noted that while there were care failures, they did not amount to gross misconduct. Thorpe had reportedly spiraled into depression after losing his coaching job.</p>

          <p>In a joint statement, the leaders of Germany, the UK, and France have urgently called on Israel to permit unrestricted humanitarian aid into Gaza and to support an immediate ceasefire. Describing the situation as a "humanitarian catastrophe," they warned that withholding essential assistance is unacceptable and stated they are ready to take further action to support peace. The coordinated appeal follows French President Emmanuel Macron's announcement that France will formally recognize a Palestinian state in September, a move that has highlighted differing approaches among the key European allies on how to address the conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military's presence at the southern border has tripled to 7,600 troops, who are taking on a more central role in deterring migrant crossings. Operating from a new command center in Arizona, troops are now authorized to apprehend individuals in designated militarized zones and are working closely with Border Patrol agents in high-traffic areas. This expansion, described by a commanding general as a way to apply pressure on smuggling cartels, comes even as apprehension rates have fallen to a 60-year low. Critics argue the move is a norm-breaking and aggressive strategy that puts the military in an awkward legal and ethical position.</p>

          <p>England's Joe Root continues his historic run-scoring form, recently surpassing Ricky Ponting to become the second-highest run-scorer in Test cricket history, now trailing only Sachin Tendulkar. This article analyzes Root's trajectory and England's upcoming schedule, speculating on when he might break the seemingly untouchable record. At his current rate, Root could pass Tendulkar's 15,921 runs within the next few years, a feat that once seemed impossible. The pursuit of this ultimate record is set against the backdrop of Root's remaining challenge: scoring a Test century in Australia, a crucial goal for the upcoming Ashes series.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of 220 Members of Parliament has signed a letter urging UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The letter, backed by MPs from nine parties including over half of Labour, argues that recognition is a vital step toward a two-state solution and would send a powerful message of support. This puts pressure on the Prime Minister, who has stated that recognition must be part of a broader plan for peace, not an isolated gesture. The call comes after France announced its intention to recognize Palestinian statehood later this year.</p>

          <p>The new Marvel film, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," attempts to reboot the franchise with a stylish, retro-futuristic aesthetic but struggles to find a sense of fun. This review argues that by dispensing with the team's origin story and their unique family dynamic, the movie dives too quickly into a grim, world-ending plot involving the planet-eater Galactus. While the cast is capable and the action sequences have scale, the characters feel flattened and the script lacks playful banter. The film's relentless focus on apocalyptic menace leaves little room for the charm and chemistry that define the classic comic book source material.</p>

Despite legal frameworks designed to protect the bank's independence, Hitler sought to oust Luther to fund his massive rearmament program. After Luther refused to provide the requested billions, Hitler used extralegal threats of ruthless action to force his resignation. Luther was replaced by the more compliant Hjalmar Schacht, demonstrating how the Nazi regime dismantled institutional safeguards to consolidate power and finance its military ambitions.</p>
