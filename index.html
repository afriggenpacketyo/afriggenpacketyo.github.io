          <p>Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton reaggravated a calf injury during Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, forcing him to leave the game and not return. Haliburton, who had been a key player for the Pacers throughout the playoffs, initially suffered the injury earlier in the series. His father indicated it was an Achilles injury. Haliburton's absence significantly impacted the Pacers' chances as he had been instrumental in their success throughout the playoffs, making key shots and leading the team through various rounds. The Pacers ultimately lost to the Thunder. The injury is a major blow to the Pacers and Haliburton's future in the series is now uncertain. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, former President Donald Trump addressed the possibility of regime change in Iran on his Truth Social platform. Trump questioned why regime change wouldn't be considered if the current Iranian regime couldn't "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN," echoing his campaign slogan. This statement followed the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, which Trump hailed as a major military success. The strikes and subsequent comments indicate a potential shift in U.S. policy towards Iran, raising concerns about further escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>A shooting occurred at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, resulting in one person injured and the death of the suspect. The suspect, a 31-year-old man, arrived at the church armed and began firing from the outside. A parishioner struck the suspect with their vehicle, and at least two staff members, including a security guard, shot and killed the attacker. The security guard was injured in the leg by the gunman, but his injuries were not life-threatening. About 150 people were inside the church at the time of the shooting, and authorities are investigating the motive behind the attack.</p>

          <p>World leaders have reacted to former President Trump's announcement that the U.S. attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordo, with varying degrees of concern and condemnation.

China strongly condemned the U.S. action, and UN Secretary-General Guterres warned of a dangerous escalation posing a threat to global peace and security.

Six adults died, two people were rescued and taken to the hospital, and the search for the remaining two missing individuals was suspended pending further developments.

However, he is expected to be immediately detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Prosecutors indicated that ICE would take Abrego Garcia into custody upon release, potentially deporting him before his trial. The judge acknowledged that the release is "little more than an academic exercise" due to the likely ICE detention, emphasizing everyone's right to the presumption of innocence.

          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, has identified five phrases that often lead to defiance in children. These phrases, such as "Because I said so" and "Stop crying. You're fine," trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, the expert recommends using language that respects a child's autonomy while setting boundaries, such as explaining reasons for decisions and acknowledging feelings. By creating conditions where cooperation feels natural, parents can foster trust and emotional resilience in their children.</p>

While esketamine, a nasal spray form of ketamine, has been approved for treatment-resistant depression in Scotland, intravenous ketamine has not, though it can be prescribed 'off-label'.</p>
