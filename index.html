          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk are engaged in a public dispute stemming from Musk's opposition to Trump's budget bill, which Musk argues will significantly increase the national deficit. Trump criticized Musk as "crazy" and threatened to terminate government contracts with Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX. Musk responded by claiming he was essential to Trump's election victory and accused Trump of concealing information related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.

          <p>A private Japanese lunar lander, Resilience, built by ispace, attempted a landing on the moon but failed to send a signal back to Earth, leaving its fate uncertain. The mission aimed to deploy a rover named Tenacious, which was to explore the lunar surface and deploy a small model house designed by a Swedish artist. This attempt follows a previous failed landing by ispace in 2023 and highlights the challenges of private lunar missions. Other companies, such as Intuitive Machines, have also faced difficulties in achieving successful and fully operational lunar landings.</p>

          <p>The relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk has deteriorated rapidly, with both figures trading insults and accusations publicly.

Trump expressed disappointment in Musk's opposition, while Musk claimed he was instrumental in Trump's election victory, leading to threats of canceled government contracts and further escalating the conflict.

          <p>A California appeals court has ruled that holding a cellphone while driving, even for navigation purposes, is illegal under state law. The court determined that the law prohibiting drivers from texting or talking on a cellphone while driving also applies to viewing a map on the screen. This decision aims to reduce distracted driving and encourage drivers to keep their eyes on the road, although mounted phones operated with a single swipe are exempt.</p>

The trade gap fell by more than half in April as imports plunged, with the U.S. registering a trade deficit of about $61 billion. Consumer attitudes have soured for four consecutive months as tariffs have taken hold, but key measures of the economy have largely defied fears of a downturn. (not investment advice)</p>
