This historic blast contributed to the Mariners' dominant 11-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels, propelling them into sole possession of first place in the American League West and extending their winning streak to nine games. Raleigh, while acknowledging the personal achievement, highlighted his primary focus on the team's objective to end their long-standing division title drought, which dates back to 2001.

          <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has arrested Adeeb Nasir, 58, and Adil Justice Ahmed Nasir, 31, in Utah after an incendiary device was discovered under a FOX 13 News vehicle in Salt Lake City. The device, found on Friday, had been lit but failed to detonate, posing a significant public safety threat near an occupied building. Investigators traced the suspects to a Magna residence where they found additional hoax weapons of mass destruction, firearms, bomb-making equipment, and illegal drugs, necessitating neighborhood evacuations. The two men are being held on multiple charges, including threat of terrorism and possession of explosive devices, with authorities emphasizing the potential for mass casualties had the device functioned as intended.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has formally endorsed Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, expressing confidence in his leadership qualities to address the city's challenges. Despite acknowledging past disagreements, Hochul highlighted Mamdani's shared commitment to neighborhood safety, urban affordability, and a firm stance against Donald Trump's political agenda. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has recently made efforts to moderate his image, including apologizing for a 2020 social media post critical of the NYPD. This significant endorsement from the moderate governor aims to unify the Democratic party, as Mamdani faces incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who are both running as independents in the upcoming election.</p>

This significant market boost followed an announcement by Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol that the government would abandon its previous plan to raise taxes on stock investments, signaling a supportive stance for investors. While South Korea's market showed strong gains, other Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed as investors monitored ongoing U.S.-China talks in Madrid and evaluated recent Chinese economic data, which indicated a slowdown. U.S. equity futures were largely flat as market participants awaited a Federal Reserve meeting this week, with hopes for potential interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party has formally written to Sir Keir Starmer, demanding clarification on the extent of Downing Street's knowledge regarding Lord Mandelson's ties to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The Tories are also calling for the release of documents related to Mandelson's appointment as ambassador to the US, specifically seeking evidence of how No 10 reacted upon learning of his connections. This demand follows Mandelson's sacking last week after a cache of emails, reported by Bloomberg, showed supportive messages he sent after Epstein pleaded guilty to sex offenses. The unfolding scandal has intensified scrutiny on Starmer's judgment and leadership, with some Labour MPs now vocalizing their concerns about the potential impact on the party's performance in next year's local elections.</p>

          <p>China's economic slowdown intensified in August, with key indicators like retail sales and industrial output missing analyst expectations. Retail sales increased by 3.4% year-on-year, falling below the 3.9% forecast, while industrial output growth slowed to 5.2%, marking its weakest level in a year. Fixed-asset investment expanded by only 0.5% year-to-date, a significant drop from the previous period, with the contraction in real estate investment worsening to 12.9%. The urban unemployment rate also slightly increased to 5.3%. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged "many unstable and uncertain factors" in the external environment, highlighting persistent weak domestic demand and the impact of Beijing's campaign against industrial overcapacity as ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 627, known as the No Secret Police Act, which aims to ban most local and federal law enforcement officers from covering their faces during operations, including immigration enforcement. The bill, introduced by Democratic state Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin, now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature. Proponents argue that the article enhances transparency, boosts public trust, and helps prevent impersonation, citing concerns over rising fascism and ICE's masking practices. While exemptions exist for SWAT teams, approved undercover assignments, and medical masks, opponents, such as the California Statewide Law Enforcement Association, contend that it undermines officer safety and disregards essential operational realities for law enforcement personnel.</p>

          <p>The city of Long Beach has canceled its annual Día de los Muertos parade, a decision made "out of an abundance of caution" due to community fears surrounding federal immigration operations. This comes after a new Supreme Court ruling allowed U.S. immigration agents to stop and detain individuals based on suspicion, sparking outrage and concerns about racial profiling, especially among the Latino community. City officials and council member Mary Zendejas emphasized that the decision addresses "genuine fears" among residents. Despite the cancellation of this year's parade, the city council approved allocating unspent funds to next year's budget and added $600,000 to the Long Beach Justice Fund, which provides crucial legal representation for residents facing immigration actions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that foreign workers are "welcome" in the United States, expressing a desire not to "frighten off" investors, days after approximately 475 South Korean nationals were arrested at a Georgia electric vehicle battery factory. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials alleged these workers had overstayed visas or held inappropriate permits for manual labor, leading to the largest single-site operation since Trump's immigration crackdown. Despite the US deciding against deportation, the images of chained workers caused widespread alarm in South Korea, prompting President Lee Jae Myung to warn that the raid could discourage future investment. Trump clarified his stance, emphasizing the need for temporary foreign experts to teach complex manufacturing skills in specific industries.</p>

          <p>A significant number of U.S. drivers, approximately 26.6% in the second quarter of 2025, are "underwater" on their auto loans, meaning they owe more than their car's current value. This figure represents a four-year high, according to Edmunds, and impacts consumers when trading in for a new vehicle, with an average negative equity of $6,754. This situation often forces drivers to either pay the outstanding balance or roll it into a new, larger loan. Contributing factors include increasingly common 84-month loan terms and smaller down payments. Experts advise retaining current vehicles if possible, understanding one's credit score, and securing pre-approvals for new loans to mitigate costs. Gap insurance is also recommended to cover the difference between a car's value and loan amount if it is totaled. (not investment advice)</p>

Ozel denounced the case as politically motivated slander, accusing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government of attempting to undermine democracy and govern through oppression.

Chlamydia can cause blindness, starvation, and bladder damage in koalas. While antibiotics previously offered limited and often problematic treatment, this new vaccine provides three levels of protection: reducing infection, preventing disease progression, and even reversing existing symptoms.

          <p>American farmers are facing significant economic challenges, including a sharp decline in Chinese crop orders due to President Trump's tariffs, leading to a five-year high in small business bankruptcies. Despite these financial pressures, rural Americans, a key voting bloc, largely maintain their loyalty to Trump, with many expressing patience and belief in the long-term benefits of his policies. Experts suggest this continued support stems from a "rural identity" that feels alienated by urban liberals and a "selective blame attribution" where voters are reticent to blame their preferred politicians for negative outcomes. The article notes that while federal subsidies have been provided, the long-term damage to supply chains and the pervasive uncertainty continue to be significant concerns for the agricultural sector.</p>

While not a medical condition itself, it signifies a tired, stressed, or overstretched brain, often exacerbated after weekends. Medical expert Dr. Tharaka offers four practical tips to combat this mental cloudiness, emphasizing that it's not a personal failing. These strategies focus on creating "firebreaks" or deliberately scheduled short breaks between activities, even just 5-10 minutes, to allow the brain to reset, process information, and let go of lingering stress.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a dominant 10-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants, winning their three-game series and maintaining a 2.5-game lead in the National League West standings. This offensive outburst, following a 13-run performance the previous day, signals a return to fundamental, non-reliant-on-home-runs baseball after a 2.5-month slump. Manager Dave Roberts praised the team's improved quality of at-bats, situational hitting, and ability to consistently manufacture runs, with Teoscar Hernández and Mookie Betts leading the charge. Pitcher Tyler Glasnow also delivered a strong performance, settling down after early command issues to pitch into the seventh inning. The team's renewed focus on "little things" is seen as crucial for their playoff aspirations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is requesting $58 million from Congress to significantly enhance security for the executive and judicial branches, following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. A White House official confirmed these funds would primarily be directed to the U.S. Marshals Service, including increased protection for Supreme Court justices. The administration also expressed support for more funding to protect congressional lawmakers, a matter currently under review by the legislative branch, which launched a pilot program in August. This urgent request comes ahead of a September 30 government funding deadline, amidst rising threats against public officials, with the U.S. Capitol Police expecting over 14,000 threats this year, necessitating a "heightened posture."</p>

          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond faces intense scrutiny following the firing of football coach DeShaun Foster after just five wins in 15 games, less than two years into his tenure. Critics argue Jarmond mishandled the previous coaching situation by not firing Chip Kelly earlier and then making a hasty, unqualified hire in Foster, who had no prior head coaching experience. The article questions Jarmond's suitability to lead the search for a new coach, given his consecutive missteps in managing the program's most crucial and lucrative asset. Despite Jarmond's successes in other sports, the financial and reputational importance of football means his leadership is now widely questioned, with some suggesting a new athletic director or a general manager should oversee the next hire.</p>

          <p>A new report, exclusively seen by the BBC, highlights the profound and varied impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on 600 children and teenagers, ahead of a public inquiry. The collected accounts include both positive memories of increased family time and the severe consequences of school disruption, social isolation, and the devastating loss of loved ones. Many describe struggling with grief and regret, like Sam, who lost his father and then his mother, finding resilience through the experience. The report also reveals darker experiences, such as excessive online screen time leading to anxiety and body image issues, and an increased risk of online exploitation. The inquiry plans to hear evidence on these lasting effects across four weeks from late September.</p>

Despite regulations requiring EU-approved R44 or R129 codes, these cheap, uncertified products, some costing as little as £12.50, continue to appear, tempting families facing cost-of-living pressures.

Credited with bringing greater financial stability to the state in the 1990s, Edgar, a moderate, won re-election easily, even in heavily Democratic Cook County. During his tenure, he pushed for budget cuts, made layoffs, and managed to make a temporary income tax surcharge permanent, ensuring a stable funding source for public schools. Despite his popularity, he surprised many by not seeking a third term. Edgar remained a respected party statesman and adviser, notably joining "Republicans for Harris" last year, reflecting his unease with the Republican party's shift to the right.</p>

He specifically criticizes Bruno Fernandes playing in a deeper midfield role, where his defensive instincts are lacking, costing the team goals. Murphy suggests that while the system has potential, the manager's failure to recognize and address player discomfort or unsuitability in specific roles is causing recurring errors and undermining the team's overall performance.</p>
