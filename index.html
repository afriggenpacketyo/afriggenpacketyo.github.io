          <p>Storm Amy has impacted the UK and Ireland with severe weather, including heavy rain and winds gusting up to 96mph. The storm led to the death of a man in a "weather-related incident" in the Republic of Ireland and caused significant disruption, including power outages for over 60,000 customers in Scotland. The Met Office has issued amber and yellow wind warnings, advising of potential danger from flying debris and further power cuts as the storm sets a new record for the deepest low pressure in the UK for October.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on organizers of pro-Palestinian protests to "recognise and respect the grief of British Jews" following a recent synagogue attack in Manchester. While acknowledging peaceful protest as a cornerstone of democracy, Starmer and other officials, including the Home Secretary and Met Police Commissioner, expressed concerns that the timing of the demonstrations could stoke tensions and antisemitism. Protest organizers have condemned the attack but stated their intention to proceed, arguing that "cancelling peaceful protests lets terror win."</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces are advancing preparations to implement the first phase of a US-proposed ceasefire plan, focusing on the release of hostages. This development follows a response from Hamas to the proposal, which other Palestinian militant groups like Islamic Jihad have publicly supported, describing it as representative of the Palestinian resistance forces. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed readiness to proceed with the plan, emphasizing continued cooperation with the US to end the war in line with Israel's principles.</p>

          <p>The aviation industry is grappling with the feasibility of achieving its net-zero emissions targets by 2050, with a heavy reliance on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). While the UK and EU have mandated a 2% SAF usage, rising to 10% in Britain by 2030, key industry figures like Ryanair's CEO express deep skepticism about meeting these goals due to production shortfalls and high costs. Despite challenges, including policy shifts in the US and production setbacks, proponents insist progress is being made and that government support is crucial for developing next-generation SAF from sources like household waste.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has successfully summited the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States, all peaks above 14,000 feet, within a 31-day period. The project, titled "States of Elevation," involved Jornet cycling over 3,000 miles between the mountains and then running up each one, demonstrating extraordinary endurance. The article documents his journey across six states, highlighting his minimalist approach, deep connection with nature, and his motivation to create an "aesthetic line" through the American wilderness rather than simply setting speed records.</p>

A recent study indicates that 31% of these "Russia Germans" are prepared to vote for the AfD, a figure significantly higher than the party's average among other migrant-background groups. This trend was evident in recent municipal elections where the AfD dominated integration councils in areas with large Russia German populations, a surprising outcome for a party with a strong anti-immigration platform.</p>

          <p>This analysis suggests that President Trump's decision to interpret Hamas's conditional response as an acceptance of his Gaza peace plan is a characteristically pragmatic and unorthodox diplomatic maneuver. Despite Hamas not agreeing to all terms, Trump seized on their commitment to release all hostages to declare a breakthrough, putting pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt military operations. The move is framed as a success for Trump's deal-making style, driven by a desire to resolve the conflict, further his Abraham Accords, and secure a significant foreign policy win.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to parts of the Gaza peace proposal outlined by President Trump, notably committing to the release of all hostages. However, the group indicated that other aspects of the 20-point plan require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian national framework. In response, President Trump urged Israel to immediately halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe recovery of hostages, and the Israeli Prime Minister's office stated it was preparing to implement the first phase of the plan.</p>

          <p>China's biopharmaceutical industry is rapidly developing, attracting global investor interest as domestic firms begin to produce innovative drugs that rival best-selling global medicines. A notable example is ivonescimab, a cancer drug from Guangzhou-based Akeso, which clinical trials showed could delay lung cancer progression longer than Merck's Keytruda. While this signals a significant advancement in China's drug-creation capabilities, analysts remain watchful about whether the sector can consistently deliver true breakthroughs in a highly complex and regulated field.</p>

          <h2>Youth-Led Protests Erupt Across Morocco Demanding Better Public Services Over World Cup Spending</h2>

          <p>A youth-led protest movement, coordinated under the name "Gen Z 212," has emerged across Morocco, demanding the government prioritize essential services like healthcare and education over massive spending on infrastructure for the 2030 World Cup. Demonstrators argue that the reported $5 billion budget for new stadiums is misplaced when public services are severely underfunded, chanting slogans like "We need hospitals more than football stadiums." The leaderless movement, galvanized by recent deaths in a maternity ward, has persisted despite police arrests and some violent clashes.</p>

          <p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs has been sentenced to more than four years in federal prison following his conviction on two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. During the sentencing, Combs offered a tearful apology to his victims and family, stating his actions were "disgusting, shameful, and sick." The judge, citing the need for deterrence and accountability for violence against women, handed down a 50-month sentence, rejecting the defense's plea for a shorter term while also falling short of the 11 years requested by prosecutors.</p>
