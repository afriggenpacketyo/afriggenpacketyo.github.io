          <h2>Hershey Announces Significant Price Hikes on Candy Due to Soaring Cocoa Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 18:58:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hershey Company is set to implement a low double-digit price increase across its candy portfolio, citing the unprecedented rise in global cocoa costs. This price surge is attributed to poor harvests in West Africa, driven by climate change and disease, which has caused cocoa prices to skyrocket. Hershey plans to navigate this by focusing on products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of its strategy to expand into a broader "snacking powerhouse." The company's share prices saw a notable increase following the announcement.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, is traveling to Europe to continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace agreement in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Indirect negotiations are ongoing, with mediators awaiting Hamas's response to a recent Israeli proposal for a 60-day truce. A key sticking point remains the positioning of Israeli troops within Gaza during any potential ceasefire. The Trump administration is reportedly cautiously optimistic about a breakthrough, as diplomatic efforts intensify to secure the release of hostages and allow humanitarian aid into the war-torn region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration is deliberately purging women from top leadership positions in the U.S. military. It cites the recent removal of Vice Admiral Yvette Davids as head of the U.S. Naval Academy, along with the firings of other high-ranking female officers like Admiral Lisa Franchetti and Admiral Linda Fagan. The author contends these actions reflect Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's documented belief that women are a "distracting influence" and that their presence is a form of "social engineering." The piece concludes that this sends a chilling message that women are not welcome in the armed forces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated he is considering the elimination of the federal capital gains tax on profits from home sales, a move that could significantly alter the housing market. Currently, sellers can exclude up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers) in gains, a figure unchanged since 1997. Proponents argue that eliminating the tax would unlock housing inventory by removing a "stay-put penalty" for long-time homeowners, particularly seniors. However, critics suggest the change would primarily benefit wealthy Americans and could further fuel housing affordability issues by attracting more investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that dogs may help humans manage stress in a more complex way than previously understood by regulating two separate physiological pathways. Researchers found that in a stressful situation, people with their dogs present had lower levels of the long-term stress hormone cortisol. At the same time, they exhibited a healthy spike in alpha-amylase, an enzyme linked to the short-term "fight or flight" response. This balanced biological reaction suggests that canine companionship helps keep humans in an optimal zone for handling stress, remaining alert but not overwhelmed, which could have profound long-term health benefits.</p>

          <p>A New Jersey man, Navin Khanna, has pleaded guilty to masterminding a nationwide catalytic converter theft ring that generated over $600 million. Khanna admitted to conspiring to purchase stolen converters from multiple states and selling them to a metal refinery, which extracted the valuable precious metals inside. The massive criminal enterprise was uncovered following a traffic stop in Oklahoma in 2021 during a surge in such thefts across the country. Khanna now faces a potential prison sentence of up to 17.5 years for his role in the extensive criminal operation.</p>

The agreements include a five-year, $1.5 billion deal for exclusive global streaming rights on Paramount+ and a separate production deal extension worth at least $250 million annually through 2030. The lucrative pacts, which will fund at least 50 new episodes, underscore the enduring value of the nearly three-decade-old animated series.

The facility was established as part of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement push.

The plan offers loan forgiveness after 30 years.

The article points to a weekend spree of bizarre posts, including AI-generated videos and angry culture-war grievances, as a sign of him lashing out. The author suggests that when Trump feels his power is limited, as evidenced by his inability to stop media coverage of his ties to Epstein, his online behavior becomes more extreme. The posts are interpreted not as a strategy, but as the ramblings of a president retreating from reality.</p>
