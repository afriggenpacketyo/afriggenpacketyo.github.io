          <p>After more than a week on the run, eight of the ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans have been apprehended. The inmates escaped by climbing through a hole behind a toilet, leading to a massive manhunt and the arrest of seven people suspected of aiding their escape. Authorities have commended the collaboration between local, state, and federal agencies in the successful capture of the escapees, who now face additional charges related to the escape itself. Two fugitives remain at large as the investigation continues, with authorities urging anyone with information to come forward.</p>

His winning film, depicting torture in Iranian jails, has sparked a diplomatic row between French and Iranian officials, with France praising it as resistance against oppression. Upon his return, Panahi was met with cheers and flowers, with some shouting "woman, life, freedom," the slogan of protests following Mahsa Amini's death in 2022. Panahi's return fulfills a pledge he made at Cannes, where he emphasized the importance of freedom for his country.</p>

          <p>As the United States and China negotiate over tariffs, China's labor market, particularly factory jobs, is a key concern due to a struggling economy. A persistent property slowdown and high youth unemployment have made China more vulnerable than during Trump's first term. Economists suggest that maintaining China’s 100 million manufacturing jobs is crucial, as other sectors face employment challenges. A full-blown trade war could result in the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs, exacerbating existing economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has allocated 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize household and business energy bills during the summer, addressing inflation partly caused by U.S. tariffs. The subsidies are part of a larger relief package to counter the adverse economic impact of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The measures aim to reduce household energy bills and support small and medium-sized companies affected by the tariffs.

          <p>Japan has lost its status as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, overtaken by Germany, despite its net external assets rising to a record high. The Finance Ministry attributed this shift partly to a weaker yen, which boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets. Japan's gross external assets increased significantly, but Germany's total surpassed Japan's due to a large current account surplus. Japan increased its net external credit for the seventh consecutive year, driven by direct investment in the United States.</p>
