          <h2>Offshore Yuan Experiences Gains Against US Dollar Amid Anticipation of Rate Reductions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 02:00:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The offshore yuan has strengthened against the US dollar, surpassing a rate of 7.1 for the first time in almost a year, as markets anticipate an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. This milestone reflects a gradual shift in China's monetary policy, with the yuan steadily gaining ground over the past month. The yuan reached 7.0999 per US dollar on Wednesday morning, marking its strongest performance since November of the previous year, and experts predict that the Fed's easing policies will further depreciate the US dollar and bolster the yuan's stability and strength. This is due to the anticipated announcement of lower interest rates following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington. Optimism is cautiously high as the currency shows resilience.</p>

          <p>Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa's presence at China's military parade in Beijing underscored the enduring relationship between the two nations, which originated during Zimbabwe's liberation struggle. Mnangagwa was among the few African leaders to attend the Victory Day event, and during a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the two countries elevated their ties to an "all-weather community with a shared future". Xi Jinping emphasized the "five-star ironclad" friendship between China and Zimbabwe, positioning it as a model for the Global South and vowing to oppose external interference and illegal sanctions against Zimbabwe, referring to sanctions imposed by the US and other Western nations. The strengthened ties signal continued collaboration and support between the two countries. The diplomatic relationship between China and Zimbabwe appears stable.</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield has stepped down from his position at Ben & Jerry's ice cream company, expressing his disappointment in a social media message about the company's direction. Greenfield stated that Unilever, the owner of Ben & Jerry's, had initially promised to uphold the company's social mission, which involved supporting peace, justice, and human rights. However, Greenfield asserts that the promised independence, which formed the basis of the sale to Unilever, has been compromised. Co-founder Ben Cohen echoed these sentiments, emphasizing that Greenfield's legacy should remain true to their values and not be silenced. This article reflects on the departure of a founder and the potential shift in the company's values.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's state visit to the UK is viewed as an opportunity to deepen trade and business ties, particularly given the UK's current economic stagnation. The UK is leveraging "tiara diplomacy" to foster stronger relationships, as demonstrated by past state visits with leaders like China's Xi Jinping. Nvidia, OpenAI, and BlackRock are among the companies expected to announce significant investments in the UK, including a joint data center project and expansions in AI. These deals aim to establish AI sovereignty for the UK and align with the Trump administration's ambition to sell American AI packages to allies, and the visit emphasizes the economic benefits and strategic partnerships.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Wednesday as investors awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. Japan's Nikkei 225 remained flat, while exports contracted by 0.1% year-on-year in August, which was less than anticipated. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed, driven by Baidu's surge after announcing a bond offering and an AI collaboration with China Merchants Group. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports plunged, reflecting concerns about global demand. Overall, Asian markets are responding cautiously to economic data and awaiting the Fed's monetary policy direction, influencing investor sentiment and market movements.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller-than-expected contraction in August, driven by a rebound in shipments to Asia, although overall growth remained negative for the fourth consecutive month. Exports decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, surpassing economists' expectations of a 1.9% decline, while imports fell by 5.2%. Exports to Asia increased by 1.7%, while shipments to Western Europe saw a significant jump, partially offsetting a steeper decline in exports to the U.S., which dropped by 13.8%. The data precedes the Bank of Japan's rate decision, where economists anticipate rates will remain at 0.5%, as export volumes may shrink in 2026 due to slower external demand. Japan's economic outlook remains cautiously optimistic.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani was removed after five no-hit innings, a decision that proved consequential as the Dodgers' bullpen collapsed in a loss to the Phillies. Ohtani, coming off Tommy John surgery, was limited to five innings, and the bullpen surrendered six runs in the sixth inning, squandering a four-run lead. Despite Ohtani's leadoff home run in the eighth, the bullpen faltered again in the ninth, leading to a 9-6 defeat. This game highlights both Ohtani's brilliance and the Dodgers' bullpen struggles, and it reflects the challenges of managing a two-way star's workload.</p>

Powell dismissed claims that her deputy leadership bid was a "proxy" for leadership bids by Andy Burnham or Ed Miliband. She emphasized her independence and said she would be a "conduit" for the views of party members, telling Sir Keir Starmer "when we're getting things wrong".

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge denied the Menendez brothers' petition for a new trial, stating that the alleged new evidence presented was not compelling enough to alter the initial decision. The petition claimed that a 1988 letter from Erik Menendez and a declaration from Roy Rossello proved their father, Jose Menendez, was sexually abusive. Judge William Ryan stated that neither piece of evidence was "particularly strong" and did not add to the allegations already considered by the jury. The Menendez brothers were initially sentenced in 1996 for the killings of their parents, and they were later resentenced in 2024, making them eligible for parole, which they were denied.

It highlights the danger of polarization hardening into tribalism, and it urges vigilance against the erosion of liberal democracy. The piece serves as a cautionary tale about the potential for political violence to be manipulated for authoritarian purposes.</p>

          <p>China's large reusable Tianlong-3 rocket has successfully passed a 1,000-tonne thrust ground test, marking a significant milestone in its development. The 35-second burn involved nine Tianhuo-12 engines firing together, producing nearly 1,000 tonnes of thrust. Space Pioneer, the company behind the rocket, stated that the Tianlong-3 is now entering the final sprint towards launch, with plans to fly by the end of the year. The company aims to quickly move into routine commercial operations, targeting more than 30 missions annually. This achievement demonstrates China's progress in reusable rocket technology.</p>

          <p>A report by Global Witness reveals that at least 142 environmental advocates were killed worldwide in 2024, with many victims being indigenous people or farmers. These advocates were often targeted for their activism against mining, logging, agriculture, and energy projects. Most of the attacks were carried out by criminal groups, and the majority of killings remain unsolved. Colombia is identified as the most dangerous country for environmental defenders, with Latin America accounting for over 80% of the deaths. The organization emphasizes the need for governments to protect environmental defenders by investigating attacks and prosecuting the perpetrators.

          <p>China and the Philippines have exchanged accusations following an incident near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. China's coast guard claimed a Philippine ship deliberately rammed one of its vessels, while the Philippines stated that Chinese forces used water cannons, damaging its ship and injuring a crew member.

Several countries, including the U.S., U.K., and Australia, have expressed concern over China's actions. The incident highlights ongoing tensions in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>Five individuals have been arrested in connection with a bicoastal drug trafficking operation that allegedly flew 22 tons of cocaine between Los Angeles and New York City. The organization is accused of using luxury private shipping companies to transport the drugs, with a downtown Los Angeles jewelry store serving as a front. The cocaine was shipped to New York City's Diamond District, and the proceeds were allegedly laundered and disseminated through the organization. Authorities seized millions in cash, cocaine, and high-end assets during the investigation. The ringleaders face potential life sentences if convicted.</p>

          <p>Democrat Xp Lee won a special election for a seat in the Minnesota House, previously held by the late Rep. Melissa Hortman, restoring a 67-67 tie in the chamber. Lee defeated Republican Ruth Bittner with 61% of the vote, and the election followed Hortman's assassination in June. Lee's victory preserves a power-sharing deal that had been in place for most of the 2025 legislative session. The election was influenced by concerns about political violence, and Lee aims to calm the "charged atmosphere". The tie in the House means bipartisan agreement will be necessary to pass legislation.</p>

Maxwell was convicted of trafficking young girls to Epstein and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.

          <p>Robert Munsch, the renowned Canadian children's author, has been approved for medically assisted dying due to dementia and Parkinson's disease. Munsch has not set a date for his death but will proceed "when I start having real trouble talking and communicating". Canada legalized euthanasia in 2016 for people with terminal illnesses and expanded the law in 2021 to include those with serious and chronic physical conditions. Munsch's decision was influenced by watching his brother die from Lou Gehrig's disease, and he emphasized the importance of choosing the moment when he can still ask for it.

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced new measures to accelerate the phase-out of oil and gas imports from Russia. The EU's current plan aims to fully stop Russian gas imports by 2028 and oil imports by 2027. The announcement follows a call with US President Donald Trump, who has linked further US sanctions on Russia to Europe imposing high tariffs on Chinese imports and stopping the purchase of Russian oil. The Commission will soon present its 19th package of sanctions, targeting crypto, banks, and energy. The measures aim to reduce Russia's war economy, which is financed by fossil fuel revenues. The move shows a united front.</p>
