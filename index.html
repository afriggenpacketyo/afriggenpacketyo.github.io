          <h2>Chinese Biotech Firms Increase Drug Licensing Deals with Multinationals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese biotechnology companies are increasingly entering into drug-licensing agreements with multinational pharmaceutical firms as a cost-saving measure. These deals often involve a 'newco structure,' combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate entity. This trend allows Chinese firms to license development rights for innovative medicines to global companies, particularly amid depressed valuations in the stock market. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group, for example, is in talks to license its drug candidates, potentially receiving up to US$5 billion per candidate, showcasing the significant value these deals can bring to Chinese biotech companies. The company's shares surged on the news, reflecting investor optimism regarding the potential financial benefits of these licensing agreements. Optimism surrounding this trend is high as it indicates a growing collaboration and financial opportunity within the biotech sector. </p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding a significant crypto enforcement action. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds, as well as enabling trading in unregistered crypto assets. This dismissal signals a potential shift in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency in the U.S., particularly as the Trump administration seeks to foster a more industry-friendly environment. Binance is also deepening its footprint in Pakistan, with Zhao advising the country's newly formed Crypto Council, indicating the exchange's continued global expansion. This move is viewed as positive for Binance, and the broader crypto market. </p>

          <p>An Argentine court has declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer star Diego Maradona. The decision came after one of the judges stepped down due to criticism surrounding her involvement in a documentary series about the case. The prosecutor raised concerns about the judge's impartiality, leading to her recusal and the subsequent mistrial declaration. A new trial will be conducted with three new judges selected by lottery, casting uncertainty over the timeline of the proceedings, which were initially expected to conclude in July. The case involves allegations of inadequate medical care provided to Maradona in the weeks leading up to his death from cardiac arrest in November 2020. </p>

          <p>In 1950, the U.S. government deported Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist who had significantly contributed to American aerospace and weaponry. Despite his crucial role in developing America's first guided ballistic missiles and working on the Manhattan Project, Qian was targeted during the Red Scare and deported in 1955. Upon returning to China, he played a pivotal role in establishing China's modern weapons program, which dramatically altered the global balance of power. The deportation of Qian Xuesen serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of xenophobia and the potential consequences of alienating talented individuals. The U.S. lost an opportunity to maintain its dominance in scientific prowess, which now reflects on the consequences of short-sighted policies. </p>

          <p>China has agreed to initiate procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, which were banned following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japan's government announced the agreement, stating that Chinese authorities are expected to issue a public notice easing the ban, which has been in place since August 2023. The two nations have reached an agreement on technical requirements for the resumption of seafood exports, with Japan continuing to seek the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from ten Japanese prefectures. This development is seen as a positive step in resolving tensions between the two countries and could lead to solutions for other bilateral issues. The restart of seafood exports is considered a significant milestone, though it may take a few months for shipments to begin due to registration and radiation checks. </p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, warns that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new battleground in the China-US rivalry. While the chance of full-scale financial sanctions remains slim, Washington could target specific Chinese entities and gradually expand the scope to push China out of the US dollar system. Lian notes that implementing full-blown sanctions, such as cutting China off from the Swift system, would inflict serious damage on the system itself. He suggests that excluding China from Swift would lead countries with trade and investment ties to shift to China's alternative, CIPS, undermining Swift's importance. This analysis highlights the potential for escalating financial tensions between the two countries. </p>

This outburst came after a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, ruled most of his tariffs illegal. Trump expressed disappointment in The Federalist Society, claiming they gave him bad advice on judicial nominations. Leo, who previously advised Trump on Supreme Court picks, stated he was grateful for Trump's transformation of the Federal Courts.

The Trump administration had threatened to seek 'emergency relief' from the Supreme Court if the tariff ruling was not quickly put on pause.

          <p>President Trump teased Elon Musk's departure from his official role in the Trump administration, stating that he is 'having a Press Conference tomorrow at 1:30 P.M. EST, with Elon Musk, at the Oval Office.' Musk's government service will end May 30, the legal 130-day limit for his 'special government employee' designation as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, but the initiative has faced criticism from Democrats in Congress. Markets are welcoming Musk's return to the private sector, with Tesla shares rising on news of his government exit. </p>
