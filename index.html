          <p>This article discusses how voters in countries allied with the U.S. are favoring stability over radical change, even after experiencing the disruptive policies of the Trump administration. It references Elon Musk's public criticism of Peter Navarro, highlighting the clash between different approaches to domestic and foreign policy under Trump. The article suggests a broader trend of voters seeking a return to normalcy and predictability in uncertain times, and that voters have been 'shell-shocked' by the recent political climate. The article notes that Musk's reputation has suffered as a result of his leadership of Tesla, while voters in allied nations prefer governments which are more stable.</p>

          <p>The British film and TV industry is expressing concern over President Trump's threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on films made in "foreign lands," fearing it could devastate the sector after pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes.

On April 15, 2025, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said that the U.K. has a "good chance" of securing a trade deal with America.</p>
