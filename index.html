          <p>The New York Jets' quarterback situation has become increasingly complicated following an injury to veteran Tyrod Taylor, forcing the team to start the struggling Justin Fields. This decision comes just days after team owner Woody Johnson publicly expressed his disappointment with Fields' performance and head coach Aaron Glenn remained evasive with the media about his choice. Taylor's knee injury, sustained in the previous game, leaves the winless Jets with limited options as they prepare to face the Cincinnati Bengals, compounding the team's on-field challenges and internal tensions.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is projected to intensify into a major hurricane over the weekend, presenting a significant threat to Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for potentially catastrophic flash flooding and landslides, with rainfall expected to reach up to 25 inches in some areas. While the storm is not anticipated to have a major impact on the U.S. mainland, its slow movement and rapid intensification could bring life-threatening conditions and destructive winds to the Caribbean islands early next week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's rugby league team experienced a difficult return to the Ashes series, suffering a 26-6 defeat against Australia at Wembley. Head coach Shaun Wane described the performance as "torture," citing numerous errors and missed opportunities that allowed the Australian side to dominate, particularly in the second half. The loss puts England in a precarious position, as Australia can retain the Ashes with a victory in the next match. The performance highlighted a significant quality gap, leaving the English team with much to correct before their next encounter.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery to remove between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets he had swallowed, resulting in the loss of part of his bowel. The magnets, purchased from an online retailer, had clamped together inside his digestive system, causing pressure necrosis where tissue dies from lack of blood flow. This case highlights the significant dangers of small, high-powered magnets, which are often sold as toys but can cause severe internal injuries if ingested. The incident has renewed concerns about the enforcement of bans on such products.</p>

          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index funds, like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), is reportedly losing favor among some investors seeking better diversification.

          <p>Following the demolition of the White House East Wing, a reporter embarked on a quest to locate the historic rubble. The search led to East Potomac Golf Links, where truckloads of soil from the site were being deposited, reportedly to create a new golf hole as part of a potential Trump-led rebranding of the course. Further investigation to find more substantial debris, like concrete and rebar, at an industrial park in Maryland proved fruitless, with workers remaining tight-lipped. The article reflects on how a cherished national symbol can be unceremoniously dismantled and hauled away.</p>

          <h2>Over a Third of Manhattan Condo Sellers Lost Money in the Past Year, Report Finds</h2>

          <p>A new report reveals that more than a third of Manhattan condos resold over the last year were sold at a loss, indicating a decade of stagnant prices in the market. The median price per square foot for condos has remained essentially flat since 2015, a stark contrast to rising home prices in most of the U.S. When factoring in inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual losses are likely even higher. The luxury market, with sales over $10 million, was the only segment to consistently see profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has abruptly terminated trade negotiations with Canada, a move that experts warn could affect U.S. consumer prices for goods like cars, auto parts, and home appliances. The decision was reportedly a response to a Canadian television ad critical of tariffs that featured former President Ronald Reagan. This halt in discussions may keep existing steep tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in place for longer, potentially increasing manufacturing costs for U.S. companies, which are then often passed on to consumers.
