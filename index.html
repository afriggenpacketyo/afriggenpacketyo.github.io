          <p>Illinois lawmakers approved a budget including a tax increase on online sports betting, causing a decline in online sports betting stocks.  The tax, starting at $0.25 per wager and increasing, is a surprise to analysts, who note it's the second consecutive year of unexpected tax increases in the state.  This raises concerns that other states may follow suit, potentially impacting the entire industry.  The impact is expected to be more significant for larger companies like DraftKings and FanDuel than smaller competitors. (not investment advice)</p>
