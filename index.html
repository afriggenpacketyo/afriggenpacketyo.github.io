            <p>Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa, a Nobel Prize winner, has died at the age of 89. Llosa was a giant of Latin American culture, exploring themes of violence, societal disruption, and authoritarian politics through his novels. His works often highlighted the challenges faced by his native Peru. He also ran for president of Peru in 1990 but was unsuccessful. In his later years, he faced criticism for his comments on feminism and the safety of Mexican journalists, but his books remained widely read.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has extended an invitation to Donald Trump to visit Ukraine before any potential agreement with Russia to end the war. This invitation was made before a devastating Russian missile attack on Sumy. Zelenskyy emphasized the importance of witnessing the human cost of the conflict firsthand. Trump described the attack as a "horrible thing," while others condemned it as a war crime. The US, under Trump, is pursuing negotiations to end the war, which is now in its fourth year.</p>

In 2024, China exported 298.1 billion integrated circuit units, marking an 11.6% year-on-year increase. The US is planning new tariffs on Chinese tech products, citing national security, which will include semiconductors. China has been boosting its domestic chip industry amid heightened US-China tech tensions. The US Commerce Secretary confirmed the tariffs will fall outside of Trump's “reciprocal tariffs.”</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has criticized CBS and its '60 Minutes' program, calling for fines and punishment against the network for its recent broadcast. Trump complained about the show's interview with Kamala Harris from the previous year, as well as reports on Greenland and the war in Ukraine. He urged the FCC to penalize CBS for what he considers 'unlawful and illegal behavior.' The Ukraine segment featured an interview with President Zelenskyy, while the Greenland report included critical comments about Trump's interest in acquiring the territory.</p>

            <p>A retrial has commenced for Sarah Palin's libel lawsuit against The New York Times, stemming from a 2017 editorial that falsely linked her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting. Palin claims the editorial damaged her reputation and career. The Times acknowledges the inaccuracy but maintains it was an honest mistake that was quickly corrected. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals restored the case after a previous ruling rejected Palin's claims. The retrial occurs amid heightened tensions between political figures and news outlets.</p>

            <p>Goldman Sachs suggests that ESG investors should re-evaluate their stance on oil and gas companies, similar to how attitudes toward defense stocks have shifted after the Russia-Ukraine war. They argue that the energy transition will be longer than expected and that oil and gas companies are major investors in low-carbon energy. The firm believes that excluding these companies hinders the energy transition and could lead to energy poverty. However, some ESG experts disagree, citing the negative impacts of fossil fuels on the climate. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge in March, jumping 12.4% as businesses accelerated shipments to avoid impending U.S. tariffs. However, imports declined by 4.3% due to sluggish domestic demand. Analysts predict that exports will likely weaken in the coming months as U.S. tariffs increase. The Chinese government has set an ambitious growth target of around 5% for the year, which may be challenging to achieve given the escalating trade war and weak domestic consumption. China has retaliated with tit-for-tat tariff increases on select American goods.</p>

Noboa, who has been in power since November 2023, campaigned on a platform of tough military action against violent criminal gangs. His left-wing challenger, Luisa González, has disputed the results, claiming fraud. Noboa's victory gives him a mandate to continue his 'war' on drug gangs, which includes militarizing the streets and prisons.

            <p>China's export growth jumped by 12.4% in March, driven by businesses frontloading shipments before the implementation of higher tariffs from the United States. However, imports fell by 4.3%, reflecting weak domestic demand. Analysts anticipate a decline in exports in the coming months due to the increased tariffs. The US has threatened new tariffs on all Chinese goods, potentially reaching a cumulative 145%. The exemption for some electronic products offers limited relief amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts acknowledges the offensive struggles but remains confident that the team will improve. The Dodgers are averaging barely three runs per game during their current slump.

            <p>Singapore has eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time following a lower-than-expected GDP growth of 3.8% for the first quarter. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reduced the rate of appreciation of its policy band, the S$NEER. The Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2%. The slowdown is attributed to declines in manufacturing and some services sectors. The ministry cited sweeping US tariffs and the US-China trade war as factors affecting the growth outlook.</p>
