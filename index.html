          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested by the FBI on obstruction charges for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest. FBI Director Kash Patel stated that Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing him to temporarily escape custody. While Flores Ruiz was later apprehended, Patel emphasized that Dugan's actions created increased danger to the public. The Trump administration has vowed to investigate and prosecute local officials who do not assist federal immigration enforcement efforts. The case highlights the tension between local authorities and federal immigration agents over arrests in state courthouses.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Rep. George Santos is facing sentencing on Long Island after pleading guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors are seeking 87 months in prison, citing his lies, theft, and defrauding of voters and donors, while Santos' lawyers are requesting a lighter sentence of 24 months. Santos has expressed remorse but also protested the severity of the potential sentence. The case details how Santos fabricated his biography to enrich himself, used fake donations, and made false financial disclosures to Congress, ultimately leading to his expulsion from the House. As part of his plea deal, he has agreed to pay more than $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture.</p>

          <p>The Norwegian Refugee Council reports that Sudanese people are resorting to eating leaves and charcoal to survive after fleeing an attack on a displaced persons camp near el-Fasher. People are dying of thirst and exhaustion while traveling to Tawila, with reports of bodies along the route. A family recounted the story of a girl who was repeatedly sexually assaulted and died from her wounds after fleeing el-Fasher. The Zamzam camp was destroyed by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), exacerbating the humanitarian crisis, and Tawila is struggling to provide for the influx of displaced people. The RSF denies committing atrocities, but the conflict has displaced millions and created what aid agencies call the world's worst humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Greece's Immigration and Asylum Minister Makis Voridis stated that Greece will not accept requests from Germany to take back refugees who initially sought asylum in Greece. Voridis argues that Greece already hosts the highest number of refugees per capita in the EU after Cyprus and cannot handle additional returns. He emphasized that until there is a fair distribution of burdens within the European Union, Greece will not accept any returns. The decision comes in response to a German court ruling that deportations to Greece are permissible under the Dublin Agreement, which requires asylum seekers to complete their procedure in the first EU country of reception.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new carnivorous caterpillar species on Oahu, Hawaii, dubbed the "bone collector," which disguises itself by adorning its silk case with the remains of its prey. This unique caterpillar feeds on insects trapped in spiderwebs and uses their body parts for protection, possibly as camouflage. Researchers found only 62 of these predatory caterpillars in over 20 years of observation, noting that they will even eat each other. The species is believed to be over 6 million years old and is restricted to a small area of mountain forest, prompting calls for conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Wildlife charities are using ultraviolet lights to spot glow-in-the-dark caterpillars, hoping to improve surveys of butterflies and moths. The new technique is part of a conservation project in the Bernwood Forest area near Oxford. The surveys aim to uncover secrets about the caterpillars' behavior and evolution. The black hairstreak caterpillar, an endangered species in the UK, is a key target of the project, as are other declining hairstreak butterfly species.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used the Signal app on a personal computer in his Pentagon office connected to an unsecured commercial internet line. This "dirty line" lacks the firewall protections of the Defense Department's systems, making it potentially vulnerable to monitoring, especially if sensitive information is being communicated. Hegseth denies sharing classified war plans on the app but has been criticized for sharing information with a smaller Signal group that included his wife. The Pentagon has stated that Hegseth's use of communication systems is classified.</p>
