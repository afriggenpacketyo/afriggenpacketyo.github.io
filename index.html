          <h2>House Approves $9 Billion in Spending Cuts for Foreign Aid and Public Media</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:50:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in government spending, sending the measure to the president's desk. The package, which faced delays due to disputes over releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, targets approximately $8 billion in foreign aid and $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The vote occurred just before a deadline that would have required the funds to be spent as originally allocated. The cuts to public media, which supports NPR and PBS, have drawn criticism for potentially harming communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to growing pressure, President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to petition the court for the release of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move came shortly after the Wall Street Journal published a story about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, which the president has decried as fake and threatened to sue over. The directive has been met with mixed reactions, with some supporters praising it as a step toward transparency while critics argue it is a limited gesture that will not reveal the full scope of evidence.</p>

          <p>A roundup of UK newspaper headlines highlights the government's plan to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote, a move described as a "historic ballot box reform." The change has been criticized by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage as an attempt to "rig the political system." Other major stories include the suspension of MP Diane Abbott from the Labour Party over comments about racism, which is seen as a sign of leader Keir Starmer's tougher approach to party discipline. Additionally, reports indicate junior doctors may have their student debt written off to avert a planned strike.</p>

          <p>Congress has approved a $9 billion rescission package that eliminates all federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The move has been condemned by public media executives, who warn it will lead to the shutdown of many local stations, particularly those serving rural and underserved communities. While supporters of the cuts targeted what they call "woke" programming, opponents highlighted the vital role of these stations in providing emergency alerts and local news. The legislation also cuts about $7.9 billion in foreign aid and other programs.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Trump has linked the potential tariffs to the ongoing legal case against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, demanding charges be dropped. Lula described the threat as "unacceptable blackmail" and a "grave attack on national sovereignty," while also labeling Brazilian politicians who support Trump as "traitors." The escalating diplomatic dispute highlights the tense relationship between the two leaders amid a backdrop of potential U.S. sanctions.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and the realization that adulthood does not come with all the answers. He muses that most people are simply "winging it" through a constant process of becoming. Using the French comedy series "Bref" as a bookend to his own journey as an American immigrant in France, he explores themes of nostalgia, regret, and the formation of identity. The author concludes that while living in a world facing immense challenges, the goal is to build a meaningful life, stay open to the unexpected, and hope that the pieces will make sense in retrospect.</p>

The largest drop was seen in the sub-index measuring government-market relations, indicating increased government intervention in the economy.

Authorities say the suspect seized control of a Cessna aircraft at Victoria International Airport by threatening a flight instructor and then flew it to Vancouver.

Economists note that while the easing is welcome, persistent yen depreciation and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs complicate the economic outlook.

          <p>The surprise cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is being viewed by some as more than just a financial decision by its network, CBS. This article argues the move fits a broader pattern of the network's parent company, Paramount Global, capitulating to political pressure from the Trump administration, especially as it seeks federal approval for a merger. The analysis points to other recent events, such as a controversial legal settlement with Trump and the departure of the head of "60 Minutes," as evidence of eroding editorial independence. It questions whether sacrificing a top-rated, critical host is a calculated business maneuver.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence for on-screen visual effects for the first time in one of its original productions. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos announced that AI was used to create a building collapse scene in the Argentine sci-fi show "The Eternauts." He positioned the technology as an opportunity to enhance creativity and make advanced effects feasible for productions with smaller budgets, stating it was ten times faster than traditional methods. The use of generative AI remains a controversial topic in Hollywood, where it has sparked fears of job displacement and was a key issue in the 2023 actors' strike.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump, 79, was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described CVI as a benign and common condition where leg veins have difficulty sending blood back to the heart. A letter from the presidential physician affirmed that Trump "remains in excellent health" and that tests found no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis. The announcement addresses recent public speculation about images showing the president with swollen legs and a bruised hand.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its decision to cancel $4 billion in federal funding for the state's high-speed rail project. The lawsuit, filed by the state's attorney general, calls the administration's action "arbitrary and capricious" and alleges it is a political stunt intended to punish California. Governor Gavin Newsom stated the move is a "heartless attack on the Central Valley" that will jeopardize jobs. The administration cited significant project failures, budget shortfalls, and missed deadlines as the basis for pulling the funds from the long-delayed project.</p>

          <p>Following a directive from President Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced she will ask a court to unseal grand jury transcripts from the Jeffrey Epstein case. This move comes as the White House seeks to manage political fallout from its base, with Trump now framing the entire Epstein saga as a "hoax" perpetuated by Democrats. The administration has also dismissed calls for a special prosecutor, attempting to shift blame for any lack of transparency onto the previous administration. The action is seen as an attempt to quell anger from supporters who were expecting major revelations from the case files.</p>

          <p>This article provides context on the role of the U.S. Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, amid renewed criticism from President Trump, who recently discussed the possibility of firing him. The Federal Reserve operates as an independent central bank responsible for setting monetary policy to maintain low unemployment and stable prices. Trump's frustration stems from the Fed's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation, a move he believes hinders economic growth. While a president firing a Fed chair is legally untested, the act could cause significant financial market turmoil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted raids at a Home Depot and other sites in Sacramento, an action seemingly intended to challenge California's sanctuary state policies. A Border Patrol chief recorded a video in front of the state capitol, stating, "There is no such thing as a sanctuary state." The enforcement action, which resulted in 11 arrests, was condemned by Governor Gavin Newsom's office as "illegal racial profiling." The raids occurred just days after a federal judge blocked agents from using racial profiling in arrests in Southern California, raising questions about their legality.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized Juul to keep its tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the market. The agency concluded that the company's products can benefit adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes, as they are exposed to fewer harmful chemicals. The decision reverses a 2022 marketing denial order and comes after years of controversy in which Juul was blamed for a surge in teen vaping. Anti-tobacco groups have condemned the decision, arguing the product responsible for the youth vaping crisis should be banned permanently.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to use "REAL Cane Sugar" instead of high-fructose corn syrup, a move he claims will improve the soda's taste. While the change has been praised by some health advocates, this analysis argues it is more of a political gesture than a meaningful public health victory. Health experts note that cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are metabolically almost identical, and both contribute to health issues like diabetes and obesity. The article suggests the move is a way for the administration to score an easy political point without addressing the larger health risks of sugary drinks.</p>

This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security checks. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3D images of bag contents, enhancing security screening capabilities.</p>

The event raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity that supports young adults diagnosed with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep.

His wardrobe is composed entirely of period clothing, he listens to orchestras from the time, and he even rides a 1939 bicycle. He believes it is important to remember the sacrifices made during that period and hopes to one day decorate his own home entirely with 1940s items.</p>
