          <p>Tracey Bregman, known for her role as Lauren Fenmore on "The Young and the Restless," recently shared the intense backlash she faced early in her career. Due to her character's portrayal as a bully, she claims to have received death threats and even had people try to run her off the freeway. Bregman explained that the storyline was particularly difficult because it involved her saying cruel things to her real-life best friend and co-star, Beth Maitland. The article highlights the extreme reactions some fans can have when they blur the line between fiction and reality.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order directs city departments not to cooperate with such federal actions and seeks to prohibit federal agents from wearing masks while requiring them to display identifying information. This preemptive measure is a response to concerns about potential militarized activity in the city, similar to what has occurred in other major U.S. cities. The mayor stated the city will use all available legal tools to counter federal actions that violate residents' rights.</p>

          <p>Verizon customers across the United States reported significant service outages on Saturday, with many phones being limited to "SOS mode," which only allows for emergency calls. The company acknowledged a "software issue" was impacting wireless service for some customers and stated its engineers were working quickly to resolve it. Reports on social media and outage-tracking site DownDetector showed issues spanning from California to Florida, peaking with nearly 23,000 reports in the afternoon. This incident follows a similar large-scale outage the company experienced in October 2024.</p>

          <h2>AI Identifies Common Stock Market Myth That Investing is Akin to Gambling</h2>

          <p>An inquiry to ChatGPT revealed that the most common myth about the stock market is that it is equivalent to gambling. The article explores this misconception, noting that while short-term market volatility can feel random, long-term investing is fundamentally different. Unlike gambling, which is based on chance, investing involves owning parts of real companies, and returns are tied to performance and economic forces. The article contrasts the two, emphasizing that disciplined, research-based investing in diversified portfolios has historically been a method for wealth creation, not a zero-sum game of luck.

          <p>A BBC report delves into the largely unregulated for-profit "body broker" industry in the United States, where companies acquire donated corpses, dissect them, and sell the parts for medical research. The article highlights the story of a family who discovered their father's donated body was dismembered with a coarse instrument, exposing the lack of dignity in some operations. Unlike in the UK and Europe, loose U.S. regulations allow companies to charge "reasonable" processing fees, which has created a profitable and global trade ripe for exploitation. Critics argue the industry preys on grieving families, while proponents claim it fills a critical need for medical research.</p>

          <p>New government data from England indicates a strong correlation between school attendance in the first week of the academic year and attendance throughout the rest of the year. According to the figures, 57% of pupils who were partially absent in the first week of September 2024 later became "persistently absent," meaning they missed at least 10% of school. In contrast, only 14% of students with full attendance in the first week became persistently absent. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging parents and schools to prioritize getting children in from the very start of the new term to combat ongoing attendance challenges.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa will not be running for reelection in 2026, according to a senior Republican official familiar with her decision. First elected in 2014, Ernst was the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran. Her departure will open up a key Senate seat, and Representative Ashley Hinson is reportedly planning to announce her candidacy for the position. Ernst's decision sets the stage for what is expected to be a competitive race, though Democrats have not won a U.S. Senate race in Iowa since 2008.</p>

Del Toro emphasized his use of physical sets over CGI to create an immersive world, a choice praised by the cast. Early reviews are mixed but generally acknowledge the film's impressive artistry, scale, and emotional depth, with some calling it one of the director's finest works.</p>

          <p>Lee Roy Jordan, a formidable linebacker and a key member of the Dallas Cowboys' first Super Bowl-winning team, has passed away at 84. Jordan was a cornerstone of the famed "Doomsday" defense throughout his 14-season career with the team, from 1963 to 1976. A five-time Pro Bowler, he was inducted into the Cowboys' Ring of Honor in 1989 and remains second on the franchise's all-time tackles list. Before his NFL career, he was an All-American at the University of Alabama under legendary coach Paul "Bear" Bryant, where he led the team to a national championship in 1961.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has dealt a significant blow to President Trump's trade agenda, ruling that the broad "reciprocal tariffs" he imposed on most countries are illegal. The court found that the president overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the levies, stating that the power to impose such taxes rests exclusively with Congress. The ruling affects tariffs on over 60 countries but does not impact sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum or tariffs imposed during his first term. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article synthesizes expert advice on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that guidelines are linked to developmental milestones. For the youngest children (under three), experts recommend a screen-free environment to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-control. As children get older, limited and supervised screen time is suggested, with a focus on content and interaction over passive viewing. While acknowledging the social necessity of digital tools for adolescents, the article stresses the importance of parental guidance, open communication about online dangers, and setting clear rules for media use for the entire family.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor and former Bridgewater strategist Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, such as his push to fire Governor Lisa Cook, could jeopardize the central bank's independence. She cautions that politicizing the Fed could erode its credibility and lead to negative long-term economic consequences, drawing parallels to other countries where institutional integrity has been compromised. Patterson predicts that while markets might initially react positively to politically motivated lower interest rates, it could eventually lead to higher inflation, a weaker dollar, and reduced foreign investment.

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly called for the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering public health. In a New York Times op-ed, Sanders criticized Kennedy's long-standing crusade against vaccines and promotion of scientifically rejected conspiracy theories. The call for resignation comes amid turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where the director was recently fired and several top officials resigned in protest of Kennedy's policies. Sanders warned that Kennedy is launching a "war on science" that could lead to the resurgence of preventable diseases.</p>

The announcement from acting CEO Kari Lake came just one day after a federal judge blocked her from firing the VOA director and ordered her to comply with previous rulings to restore the agency's operations. VOA's mission is to provide objective news in countries with limited press freedom, and critics worry that dismantling the organization cedes influence to authoritarian regimes and undermines U.S. soft power.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK say they will continue to pursue legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling. The court overturned an injunction that had blocked the use of The Bell Hotel in Epping, a decision seen as a setback for other councils with similar plans. However, councils like West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne are pressing on with their own legal challenges, often citing planning law breaches and public safety concerns. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between the central government's asylum policy and the authority of local governments.</p>

A local man, Dave Lister, discovered the fish "gasping for air" and, after not receiving an urgent response from the environmental agency Natural Resources Wales (NRW), rallied friends to help move them to a nearby river. NRW later stated that moving fish during extreme heat can cause more harm than good, but the residents felt they had to act to prevent the fish from dying.</p>
