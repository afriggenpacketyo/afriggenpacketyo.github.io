          <p>The LA Galaxy have extended head coach Greg Vanney's contract for three years, despite a disastrous 0-10-3 start to the season. The club cited Vanney's "vision" and success in winning the MLS Cup last season as reasons for the extension. The extension makes Vanney one of the highest-paid coaches in MLS. The club also announced the hiring of Ravi Ramineni as director of quantitative analysis and promotions for Juninho and Zack Murshedi. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>After years of legal battles, Boeing may avoid criminal responsibility for its role in the deadly 737 Max crashes. Justice Department officials are considering a deal where Boeing would agree to some concessions, including contributing to a victims fund, without pleading guilty to any charges. Lawyers for the families of the victims expressed deep disappointment, stating they would fight the deal in court. The crashes, which occurred in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019, have been blamed on changes Boeing made to flight control software on the 737 Max. Optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense team plans to argue "mutual violence" in his trial, suggesting that both he and accuser Cassie Ventura engaged in abusive behavior. Legal experts argue that "mutual abuse" is not a legal defense for abuse, which is about a pattern of behavior designed to maintain control over another person. Some believe the defense may try to reframe the violence as consensual sexual activity. This strategy raises questions about power dynamics and the definition of abuse in the context of the trial.
