          <p>Scientists have confirmed that a meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, is approximately 4.5 billion years old, making it more ancient than our own planet. The object, a type of stony meteorite known as a chondrite, created a loud boom and was seen as a fireball across the state in late June. Researchers are studying fragments to better understand its composition and trajectory, which could provide valuable data for planetary defense against future asteroid threats. The incident marks the 27th meteorite recovery in Georgia, with experts noting that modern technology and public awareness are increasing the frequency of such finds.</p>

          <p>In the Russian-occupied Luhansk region of Ukraine, residents describe a life of increasing difficulty, with dwindling finances, damaged infrastructure, and a lack of essential services. One resident from Novoaidar explains that her income is gone and she now barters for food, as the cost of living has skyrocketed while job opportunities are scarce outside of the military. The occupying authorities are pressuring locals to accept Russian citizenship to access medical care and social benefits, creating impossible conditions for those who refuse. Despite the hardships and destruction, many older residents remain, holding out hope for a return to their previous lives.</p>

          <p>The 2022 death of Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig, initially reported as a suicide, was solved after investigators uncovered a crucial piece of evidence. Her colleague, Matthew Ecker, claimed she shot herself after locking herself in the bathroom, but detectives found his story inconsistent. The key discovery was a small, round metal piece from the bathroom door's lock found underneath Pennig's body. This suggested Ecker had forced the door open before the shooting, causing the piece to fall, and that Pennig then fell on top of it. This evidence contradicted Ecker's timeline and led to his conviction for second-degree murder and a 30-year sentence.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have intensified their drone attacks against each other, with both sides reporting significant overnight exchanges. Ukraine's air force stated that Russia launched 100 drones, with 70 being suppressed, while Russia claimed to have downed 126 Ukrainian drones, resulting in at least one civilian death in Saratov. This escalation comes as diplomatic maneuvers intensify ahead of a planned summit between U.S. and Russian leaders. Ukrainian officials are rallying European support to ensure Kyiv is included in any peace negotiations, firmly rejecting any territorial concessions as a basis for a settlement.</p>

          <p>Actress Lindsay Lohan revealed that the intense and terrifying experiences with paparazzi during her youth led to her developing post-traumatic stress disorder and ultimately drove her to leave Hollywood. Now residing in Dubai with her husband and son, Lohan says the move has provided her with a safe and normal life, free from the constant media intrusion she faced in Los Angeles. She notes that in Dubai, strict privacy laws prevent the kind of aggressive photography that was common in her early career. Lohan feels that social media has now given celebrities more control over their own narratives, a tool she lacked in the early 2000s.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has issued a public apology after two blind women were left behind on a flight from New Orleans to Orlando. The passengers, Camille Tate and Sherri Brun, were waiting for their delayed flight when the airline rebooked most other passengers onto an earlier plane from a different gate without verbally notifying them. Unable to see the gate change information, the two friends were left to board their originally scheduled plane alone. The airline offered a $100 voucher, but the women are calling for improved communication protocols to better assist passengers with disabilities and prevent similar incidents.</p>

          <p>A sweeping tax and spending bill signed by President Trump has become a central point of contention for both Republicans and Democrats during the congressional August recess. The legislation extends tax cuts, introduces new work requirements for Medicaid, and funds mass deportations, which Republicans champion as fulfilling campaign promises. Democrats, however, are highlighting the bill's cuts to social safety nets and the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies, which they argue will make healthcare unaffordable for millions. With the 2026 midterms approaching, both parties are using the bill to frame their message to voters in key districts across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

For many, like Jorge Malagón Márquez who arrived as a traumatized five-year-old, the tower represents a pivotal moment of fear and hope.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new tax bill creating a "no tax on tips" policy has left many service industry workers feeling uncertain about its actual benefits. The law provides a federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income, but key details about which occupations qualify and how different types of gratuities are handled remain unclear. Experts note that workers will still owe state income taxes and federal payroll taxes for Medicare and Social Security on their tips.

Tarpley argues against the perfectionistic, all-or-nothing approach to recovery, suggesting that embracing imperfections and accepting setbacks can lead to a more sustainable and fulfilling life. This perspective is particularly relevant as diet culture re-emerges, making the path to recovery even more complex for many.</p>

The administration has taken numerous controversial actions, including demanding the prosecution of his predecessor, firing a top statistician after a poor jobs report, and pursuing a hostile takeover of Washington D.C.'s governance. This period has seen a more sophisticated and targeted effort to expand presidential power, undermine democratic institutions, and control information compared to his first term.

          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a surge in tourism from neighboring Turkey, with thousands of visitors arriving via new and expanded ferry routes. Turkish tourists are drawn by the island's relaxed atmosphere and relative affordability compared to Turkish coastal resorts. This influx is providing a significant boost to the local economy and fostering positive interactions between Greeks and Turks, despite ongoing political tensions between their governments over maritime borders and other issues. Local officials and business owners welcome the trend, seeing it as a way to strengthen cross-border relations and heal historical wounds through personal connection.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned European football's governing body, UEFA, over its tribute to former Palestinian player Suleiman al-Obeid. In a social media post, UEFA mourned al-Obeid's death but did not mention the circumstances. Salah replied directly, asking UEFA to state how, where, and why he died. According to the Palestinian Football Association, al-Obeid was killed by Israeli forces while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza. Salah, a prominent Arab athlete, has previously called for humanitarian access to Gaza and for world leaders to prevent the killing of innocent people.</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics company Unitree, predicts that the robotics industry could experience its own "ChatGPT moment" within the next two to three years. He defines this breakthrough as the point when a robot can autonomously perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment. While current hardware is capable, Wang believes the crucial missing piece is more advanced artificial intelligence for "embodied intelligence." He expressed skepticism about current models but noted that new approaches, like generating interactive video models for robots to follow, show significant promise.</p>

          <p>A broken water control valve has caused a multi-day service outage for about 9,200 households in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills. Officials are now pleading with all residents in the area, even those with restored service, to stop using water for flushing toilets or watering lawns. They warn that continued consumption is lowering pressure in the system and delaying the complex, 20-foot-deep repairs needed to fix the main valve. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has set up locations for residents to access showers, laundry facilities, and bottled water while crews work around the clock to restore full service.</p>

          <p>Northern China has once again been hit by severe flooding during its traditional rainy season in July and August, with the capital Beijing experiencing another deadly disaster. This year's event marks the fifth major flood to affect the region since 2012. The recent storms were unusual as they primarily impacted the northern part of Beijing. In contrast, previous severe floods that occurred in 2016 and 2023 were concentrated in the southern areas of the city. The recurring nature of these extreme weather events underscores the growing climate challenges facing the densely populated capital.</p>
