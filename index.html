          <p>Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander noted the despondency among Labour MPs after a week of significant political upheaval. This included Lord Mandelson's dismissal as US ambassador due to links with Jeffrey Epstein, and Deputy PM Angela Rayner's resignation over tax affairs. The handling of Mandelson's appointment and subsequent departure has drawn criticism, with some blaming the prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. Opposition parties are demanding transparency and a review of vetting procedures, while Labour leaders acknowledge a difficult period for the government.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced a profit-sharing agreement with Japan for $550 billion in investments in US-based projects. Initially, profits will be split equally until Japan recoups its investment, after which the US will receive 90% and Japan 10%. This deal, part of a broader tariff agreement, aims to boost domestic manufacturing in the US, funding projects like nuclear power plants and antibiotic production. Lutnick stated the arrangement benefits both nations, providing Japan with lower tariffs and the US with significant capital for development, without long-term cost to Japanese taxpayers.

          <p>The European Union accepted Microsoft's commitments to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its popular productivity apps, thereby exempting the company from a potentially substantial antitrust fine. This decision, binding for seven years or more, addresses concerns that Microsoft's bundling practices hindered competition. Under the agreement, Microsoft will offer Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites at reduced prices without Teams, enhance interoperability with rival tools, and allow data migration. The resolution follows an EU investigation initiated in 2023 after a complaint from Salesforce-owned Slack, marking a significant outcome in tech regulation.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced zero growth in July, aligning with expectations and following a 0.4% expansion in June, according to the Office for National Statistics. This stagnation was largely attributed to the biggest contraction in manufacturing output in a year. While the economy grew by 0.2% over the three months to July, indicating a slowdown, the government faces increasing pressure to boost growth ahead of the Autumn Budget. Policymakers are now balancing flagging growth against persistent inflation as the Bank of England prepares for its next interest rate decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper has secured its first in-flight WiFi contract with JetBlue, marking a significant step in its competition with SpaceX's dominant Starlink satellite internet service. While Kuiper has only 102 satellites in orbit compared to Starlink's thousands, this deal signals Amazon's serious intent to catch up in the rapidly expanding market. The article highlights the intense competition and the vast potential of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to provide internet access to billions globally, especially for the upcoming 6G communications.

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has reportedly deployed a new fleet of advanced specialized island-landing barges, identified by hull numbers 401 to 403, indicating service in the Eastern Theatre Command. Drone footage shows these "Dong Gong" series vessels equipped with four, six, and eight legs designed to extend to the seabed, lifting the craft for stable landing operations. These barges feature extended bridge decks and cable-stayed bridge towers, suggesting enhanced capabilities for island assaults or engineering tasks. This deployment signals a significant upgrade to China's naval engineering and amphibious warfare capabilities.</p>

          <p>UFC chief Dana White's new boxing venture sparked a heated exchange with a reporter during the Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford super-fight news conference. White's efforts to amend the Muhammad Ali Act, which protects boxers' rights, drew criticism for potentially creating a monopoly and restricting fighter earnings. The clash overshadowed the highly anticipated fight, where Alvarez defends his super-middleweight titles against Crawford, who aims to make history by unifying three divisions. The event, broadcast on Netflix, signals a new era for boxing, but also highlights ongoing debates about fighter welfare and industry control.</p>

          <p>A four-year mystery surrounding a wedding crasher in Ayrshire, Scotland, has finally been solved, revealing a humorous case of mistaken identity. Michelle and John Wylie discovered a stranger in their wedding photos and, despite extensive inquiries, couldn't identify him. An internet appeal eventually led to Andrew Hillhouse, who had accidentally attended the wrong wedding, confusing the Carlton Hotel with the Great Western Hotel. He only realized his error when the bride walked down the aisle, finding himself committed to the ceremony before making a discreet exit, providing a memorable anecdote for all involved.</p>

          <p>Steve Reed, the new UK Housing Secretary, affirmed the government's "absolute commitment" to building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, a key Labour manifesto pledge. He promised an "acceleration package" to streamline planning approvals and threatened sanctions for developers delaying projects. Industry leaders, however, warn of "huge challenges" due to rising costs, regulatory burdens, and planning delays. Reed's appointment follows Angela Rayner's resignation, and he faces scrutiny on how to achieve this ambitious target without increasing pressure on the housing market, particularly concerning asylum seeker accommodation.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis explores the international legal principle of proportionality in the context of Israel's military operation in Gaza, which has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and widespread destruction. While Israel asserts its right to self-defense and adherence to international law, the vast majority of experts consulted argue that its actions, particularly the overall campaign and its impact on civilians, have been disproportionate. Concerns are raised regarding civilian casualties, the aid blockade, and the destruction of infrastructure, with some questioning Israel's ultimate goals. The article also touches upon ongoing cases at the ICC and ICJ.</p>

          <p>A significant trend sees top Chinese scientists increasingly leaving the United States to return to China, a movement that is fundamentally altering the global research landscape. This shift, explored in a series by the South China Morning Post, highlights a "brain drain" from the US to China in critical scientific fields. The motivations behind these scientists' decisions to relocate back to their home country are varied but contribute to China's growing scientific prowess and influence. This phenomenon has considerable implications for both countries' technological and research capabilities in the long term.</p>

          <p>More than two million people have been evacuated in Pakistan's Punjab and Sindh provinces as deadly monsoon floods sweep across the country's eastern regions, claiming over 900 lives since late June. The disaster is exacerbated by climate change and criticized for a lack of government investment in mitigation. The floods have devastated farms and homes, particularly impacting the 40% of Pakistanis living below the poverty line. International aid, including $5 million from the UN and US assistance, has been deployed, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has declared a climate emergency, ordering a 300-day plan for response.</p>

          <p>A National Audit Office report reveals that the cost of residential care for vulnerable children in England has nearly doubled in five years, reaching an average of £318,400 per child, yet often provides inappropriate or poor quality care. The "dysfunctional" market, dominated by profit-driven providers, struggles to meet the complex needs of a record number of children in care, often placing them far from home. Former residents recount experiences of inadequate facilities. The Department for Education acknowledges past neglect and is implementing reforms to address profiteering and improve the social care system.</p>

Despite efforts from Dearica Hamby and Kelsey Plum, the Sparks were outmatched, and an injury to Cameron Brink further hampered their performance.
