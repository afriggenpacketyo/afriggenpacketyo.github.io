          <p>The Walt Disney Company reported fiscal third-quarter results that surpassed earnings expectations, though revenue fell slightly short of projections. Strong performance in its streaming division and theme parks helped to counterbalance the ongoing decline in its traditional television business. The company highlighted significant growth in its direct-to-consumer services, which are now on a solid financial foundation after previously incurring substantial losses. Disney also raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance, signaling confidence in its future performance. (not investment advice)</p>

He is urging House Speaker Mike Johnson to support the legislation to prevent instability in representation and end what he terms a destructive, nationwide redistricting war.</p>

          <p>To bolster its tourism industry and strengthen diplomatic ties, South Korea is implementing a temporary visa waiver for Chinese tour groups. The program will run from September 29, 2025, to June 30, 2026, allowing organized groups of Chinese tourists to enter the country without a visa. This policy is expected to revitalize regional economies and follows a similar unilateral visa-free measure that Beijing extended to South Korean travelers last year, reflecting a mutual effort to encourage travel between the two nations.</p>

          <p>At a ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing, the mayor of Hiroshima, Kazumi Matsui, made an impassioned plea for world powers to abandon the concept of nuclear deterrence. He warned that the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are fostering a dangerous and growing acceptance of nuclear weapons. The mayor stressed that the international community is ignoring the tragic lessons of history and called on citizens to work harder toward the complete abolition of these weapons.</p>

          <p>A rare aerial perspective from a Jordanian military aid flight over Gaza has revealed a landscape of almost total devastation, described as resembling the ruins of an ancient, wiped-out civilization. The view shows a vast patchwork of shattered concrete, cratered neighborhoods, and roads that lead nowhere, underscoring the immense scale of destruction from the conflict. This vantage point offers a stark look at a territory that has been largely inaccessible to international media since the war began.</p>

          <p>A new cover story for The Atlantic uses the devastating civil war in Sudan as a case study for what the end of the liberal, U.S.-led world order could look like. The reporting from within the country depicts a descent into anarchy and nihilistic violence, exacerbated by the retreat of international aid and the interference of competing middle powers. The article argues that Sudan's humanitarian catastrophe, with millions displaced and facing starvation, serves as a stark warning of growing global instability in a world without a clear structure.</p>

          <p>The future of direct cash assistance as a form of foreign aid is now in question after the Trump administration cut funding for several USAID programs, including a notable project in Mozambique. Proponents argue that giving cash directly to people in poverty is a highly effective and efficient method, supported by hundreds of studies showing it improves well-being and boosts local economies. Despite a growing consensus on its benefits, the model's continuation now hinges on convincing a skeptical administration of its value.</p>

The fast-food chain also saw strong performance in its international markets, contributing to a positive overall quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

Civil rights advocates warn that ongoing political battles over issues like redistricting and new legal cases heading to the court are continuing to erode this pillar of American democracy.</p>

The data, voluntarily submitted by thousands of law enforcement agencies, showed a 4.5% year-on-year decrease in overall violent crime, with murders dropping by 14.5%. These figures directly contradict the political narrative of a surging, out-of-control crime wave that was prevalent during the recent presidential election campaign, indicating the nation was safer than it had been in decades.</p>
