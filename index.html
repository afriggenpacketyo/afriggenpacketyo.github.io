          <p>As stock and bond markets experience increased volatility, dividend stocks are attracting a broader range of investors seeking a balance between equity growth and yield. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on dividend stocks, such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) and Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), are gaining traction. Actively managed dividend ETFs like the T. Rowe Dividend Growth ETF (TDVG) are also emerging, aiming to identify high-quality dividend payers. Investors should be cautious about buying dividend funds based solely on yield and should instead seek a balance of consistent dividend payments and capital appreciation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>U.S. agriculture exporters are facing a severe economic downturn due to global backlash from President Trump's tariffs, particularly a decline in Chinese buying of U.S. farm products. The Agriculture Transportation Coalition (AgTC) reports massive financial losses among its members, including canceled export orders and layoffs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture revealed China's largest cancellation of pork orders since 2020. The Port of Oakland warns that tariff-induced downturns could jeopardize job stability and the region's economic health, as China is a major trading partner.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is reviewing federal programs, including those targeting HIV/AIDS, to identify waste and improve efficiency. While maintaining the United States' commitment to fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic is crucial, a reevaluation of programs like the Ryan White CARE Act is warranted to ensure resources are optimally allocated. Streamlining initiatives and addressing bureaucratic overlap can lead to more effective and efficient use of funds, ultimately strengthening the United States' response to the epidemic.</p>

          <p>The Children's Commissioner for England is urging the government to ban apps that use artificial intelligence (AI) to create sexually explicit images of children. Dame Rachel de Souza advocates for a total ban on apps that allow "nudification," where AI is used to edit photos of real people to make them appear naked. She asserts that the government is allowing such apps to "go unchecked with extreme real-world consequences," disproportionately targeting girls and young women. The government has stated that child sexual abuse material is illegal and plans to introduce further offenses for creating, possessing, or distributing AI tools designed to create such content.</p>
