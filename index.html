        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge in California, appointed by President Trump, has blocked the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. This ruling aligns with similar court decisions in other states that have limited the administration's practice of rapidly deporting individuals accused of gang membership under the 1798 law. The judge emphasized that the government failed to provide sufficient notice for individuals to challenge their deportation, although he did acknowledge the president's authority to determine whether an invasion or incursion has occurred. This legal challenge highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the use of the Alien Enemies Act and its potential impact on due process rights. Optimism is tempered by the legal complexities and differing judicial opinions surrounding the Act.</p>

          <p>An escaped zebra caused traffic disruptions in Tennessee after it was reported missing by its owners, who had acquired it the previous night. The zebra was seen running along Interstate 24, leading to lane closures for safety reasons as deputies attempted to manage the situation. The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office reported that the zebra ran through traffic on both sides of the highway, creating chaos for drivers.

          <p>Officials in Boulder, Colorado, have shared details about an attack on a group rallying for Israeli hostages, during which a suspect threw Molotov cocktails, injuring 12 people. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism and a targeted attack, with the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, facing multiple felony charges and a federal hate crime charge. Witnesses reported that Soliman yelled "Free Palestine!" during the attack, and investigators found 16 unused Molotov cocktails within his reach at the time of his arrest. The attack occurred less than two weeks after a similar incident in Washington, D.C., raising concerns about rising tensions and hate crimes.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack during a pro-Israel demonstration, has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple state charges, including attempted first-degree murder.

He had planned the attack for a year, waiting until his daughter's high school graduation, and disguised himself as a gardener during the incident. The Department of Homeland Security has stated that Soliman is in the United States illegally, having entered on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023.</p>

          <p>The State Department has instructed U.S. embassies and consulates to increase vetting for all visa applicants seeking to attend Harvard University, including students, faculty, and visitors. This "additional vetting" involves a thorough screening of applicants' online presence and consideration of whether a lack of online presence indicates evasiveness. The State Department spokesperson stated that this new vetting procedure will also serve as a pilot for expanded screening of visa applicants generally, including for student visas. The decision stems from concerns that Harvard has failed to maintain a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration remains optimistic that the Alaska LNG project, a massive liquified natural gas initiative, will attract investors despite its $40 billion price tag. Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes that securing commercial offtakers for the gas will facilitate financing, with countries seeking to reduce their trade deficit with the U.S. as potential buyers. However, energy analysts express skepticism about the project's commercial viability, noting its decades-long planning phase without significant progress. The administration plans to build the project in stages, initially serving domestic demand in Alaska, with the Department of Defense ready to support the project with its resources.</p>

          <p>The UN Secretary-General has called for an independent investigation into the killing of Palestinians near an aid distribution center in Gaza, amidst conflicting reports about whether Israeli forces opened fire. Witnesses claim they were shot at while waiting for food at the Rafah center run by the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Red Cross reported receiving 179 casualties, including 21 deaths, while the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency reported 31 deaths. The Israeli military denies its troops fired at civilians, and the GHF calls the reports "outright fabrications."</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine failed to reach a ceasefire agreement during talks in Istanbul but committed to exchanging sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war, as well as those aged under 25. Ukraine is insisting on a full and unconditional ceasefire for at least 30 days on land, at sea, and in the air, a demand Russia rejected. Russia continues to demand Ukrainian military withdrawal from its four partly occupied regions and international recognition of those regions, along with Crimea. Despite the lack of progress on a ceasefire, both sides agreed to return the bodies of soldiers killed in the conflict.</p>

Officials expect the resumption of regular runway operations to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages and technical problems. The Federal Aviation Administration is working to certify the runway for arriving flights, which would allow the airport to increase its hourly flight capacity.</p>
