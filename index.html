          <p>This opinion article suggests that the Trump era might lead to a "reverse convergence" in US-China relations, moving beyond traditional ideological differences. It posits that the US is adopting a similar approach to political legitimacy and matters of war and peace as China, rather than China conforming to liberal democratic values. The author argues that previous theories oversimplified complex social changes and underestimated power dynamics. This shift could redefine how the two global powers interact on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Devastating floods in Arizona have resulted in at least four fatalities, with three deaths reported in Globe and one near Phoenix. The severe rainfall, the highest in Phoenix in nearly seven years, caused widespread damage, including the displacement of approximately 1,000 propane tanks in Globe, creating a hazardous situation. Authorities have initiated a massive search and rescue operation and urged residents to avoid floodwaters. Officials have declared an emergency, noting the unprecedented intensity of the rainfall.</p>

          <p>Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group and political party is commemorating the one-year anniversary of its former leader Hassan Nasrallah's killing by Israel. Large gatherings are anticipated in Hezbollah strongholds across Beirut and southern Lebanon, with new secretary-general Naim Qassem expected to deliver an address. Nasrallah led the Iran-backed group for over 30 years, significantly shaping its influence and forcing Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000. His death last year, alongside his heir apparent, marked a major escalation in regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Iraq's Oil Ministry announced the resumption of crude oil exports to Turkey from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, ending a two-and-a-half-year deadlock. The pipeline, which had been frozen since March 2023 after independent Kurdish sales were deemed illegal, is now fully operational following an agreement between the federal government, the Kurdistan regional government, and foreign oil producers. This development signifies a significant step towards resolving long-standing disputes over oil revenue sharing and regional autonomy.</p>

          <p>Syria has issued an arrest warrant in absentia for former President Bashar Assad, charging him with premeditated murder, torture, and deprivation of liberty related to the 2011 Daraa incidents. Assad, who was overthrown in December 2024 and fled to Russia, is accused of a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests that escalated into a civil war. This warrant could facilitate international pursuit through Interpol, highlighting the new government's efforts to address past human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have killed at least 91 people across Gaza, intensifying international calls for a ceasefire. Despite global pressure and walkouts during his UN address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu affirmed his commitment to continuing the war against Hamas.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly close to a deal to ease fighting and secure hostage releases, with a meeting scheduled with Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is cautioning that millions of Americans could lose flood insurance coverage if Democrats reject a House-passed spending bill that includes reauthorization for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). White House officials support the measure, emphasizing the urgency of protecting policyholders during hurricane season. Democrats cite broader spending disputes for their opposition, but critics argue the standoff jeopardizes homeowners, the housing market, and disaster recovery funds.

          <p>The UK has successfully grown and is preparing to harvest its first rice crop as part of an ambitious trial addressing future food security and climate change. Ecologist Nadine Mitschunas, the UK's sole rice-grower, cultivated nine varieties on a Cambridgeshire farm, benefiting from the hottest summer on record. This experiment, led by UKCEH, explores how new crops could protect farmer livelihoods and combat climate change by re-wetting peat soils to lock in greenhouse gases. Initial results suggest the rice crop does not increase emissions.</p>

Their research, initially aimed at designing better student shoe racks, discovered that odor, caused by the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius, was the primary issue. They developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack that sterilizes footwear, finding that 2-3 minutes of UVC treatment effectively eliminated the smell.

          <p>A deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE field office, investigated by the FBI as a targeted attack, resulted in one detainee killed and two critically injured. The shooter, identified as Joshua Jahn, died of self-inflicted wounds after firing indiscriminately from a rooftop across the street. Authorities identified the deceased as Norlan Guzman-Fuentes and the wounded as Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez and Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, all detainees with alleged criminal histories. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem blamed anti-ICE rhetoric for the violence and ordered increased security at facilities nationwide.</p>

          <h2>Efficacy of Collagen Supplements for Skin Ageing Remains Debated by Dermatologists</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, noting that while popular, dermatologists remain skeptical. Collagen, vital for skin and joint health, naturally declines with age. While some users report benefits, experts like Dr. Emma Wedgeworth question if orally ingested collagen peptides effectively reach the skin. Studies show conflicting results, with industry-funded research suggesting improvements, while independent studies find no significant effect. Experts emphasize that sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking are more impactful for skin health.</p>

          <p>Bali, a popular tourist destination, is grappling with the negative consequences of its own success, leading to "Instagram vs reality" disillusionment among visitors. A post-pandemic tourism boom has brought crowds, traffic, and rampant construction, straining the island's infrastructure and environment. Recent fatal floods, exacerbated by poor waste management and unchecked development, prompted officials to restrict new construction. While some argue Bali's beauty remains beyond tourist hotspots, many locals feel their island is being "eroded day by day," highlighting the need for sustainable tourism practices.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a powerful Category 5 storm, is swirling north of the Caribbean, with a low possibility of interacting with another developing tropical storm, Imelda, in a rare "Fujiwhara effect." This phenomenon involves two storms merging or spinning around a common center. While an unlikely outcome, a collision could slightly alter their paths, though experts believe the weaker Imelda would likely be absorbed by Humberto. Both systems pose a threat of heavy rainfall to parts of the Caribbean and the southeastern US, prompting South Carolina to declare a state of emergency.</p>
