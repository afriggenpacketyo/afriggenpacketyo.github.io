          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered the earliest known evidence of rice in Remote Oceania, finding 3,500-year-old remnants in Guam. The discovery was made at the Ritidian Site Complex in the form of phytoliths, which are fossilized plant parts, found exclusively on ancient earthenware pottery. This finding suggests the rice was part of specialized cultural rituals within a cave that also contained rare rock art and formal burials. The evidence indicates that the first settlers of Guam successfully transported and cultivated rice after a record-setting ocean migration of over 2,300 kilometers.</p>

          <p>Two major wildfires burning near the Grand Canyon's North Rim have destroyed over 70 structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge. The Dragon Bravo Fire exhibited extreme behavior, expanding to thousands of acres and also damaging a water treatment plant, causing a hazardous chlorine gas leak. All guests and employees were safely evacuated, but the loss of the iconic lodge, a central feature of the North Rim, has been described as losing a piece of state history. Investigations into the fire's handling are being called for, as other fires and smoke from Canada also impact the U.S.</p>

          <p>Rescue and recovery operations are ongoing in Texas following catastrophic flooding along the Guadalupe River, with the death toll now at 130 people. Heavy rains have intermittently halted the search for missing individuals in Kerr County, where the majority of fatalities have occurred. Officials described the floodwater moving at an astonishing 1.5 million gallons per second in some areas, highlighting the disaster's immense scale. A flood watch remains in effect as more thunderstorms are expected, complicating efforts and maintaining a high level of risk for the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired another 15 immigration judges, adding to the dozens let go in recent months as part of an effort to accelerate deportations. The judges, who were at the end of their two-year probationary period, received termination notices without a stated cause, according to their union. This move comes despite Congress allocating funds to hire more judges to address a backlog of nearly 4 million cases. Critics, including the judges' union and Democratic senators, have expressed outrage, suggesting the firings may be based on perceived loyalty to the administration's agenda rather than performance.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a dramatic 763% increase in the rate of young children accidentally ingesting nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. Researchers analyzing U.S. poison center data found that while these smoke-free products like Zyn are a small fraction of total nicotine exposures, they are more likely to lead to serious medical outcomes or hospitalization. The study highlights the danger posed by the products' colorful, flavored packaging, which can be attractive to children under six.

However, federal loans have strict borrowing limits, often creating a funding gap. Private loans can cover the remaining costs and may offer lower rates for those with good credit, but they lack the flexible protections of federal options, making a balanced approach essential.

The administration has cited concerns that some funds are used in ways contrary to its policies, but the lawsuit argues the executive branch cannot unilaterally refuse to spend congressionally approved appropriations.

Lingering GOP frustration over the industry's support for the Affordable Care Act may have also diminished their influence.

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a 50-day ultimatum to Russia, threatening to impose "secondary tariffs" of around 100% on countries and entities that purchase Russian exports if a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine is not reached by September. Announcing the new hardline stance from the White House, Trump expressed his disappointment with Vladimir Putin and said he thought a deal would have been made months ago. These secondary tariffs could severely impact major buyers of Russian goods, particularly fossil fuels, such as China, India, and Brazil, marking a significant escalation in economic pressure.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China reported a significant surge in new credit for June, with total social financing reaching 4.2 trillion yuan, well above expectations. This increase was largely driven by a seasonal push in bank lending and substantial government bond issuance, reflecting the central bank's efforts to stimulate the economy. However, analysts note that the spike masks underlying weakness, as it relies heavily on government action rather than organic borrowing from a hesitant private sector. With the property market still in decline and consumer confidence subdued, it remains uncertain if this credit injection can spark a sustainable recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

The article highlights the story of Kelly and Larry Peterson, a married couple who both have spina bifida and were initially rejected by an agency because of their condition. They eventually adopted their daughter, Hadley, who also has spina bifida, believing their shared experience makes them uniquely qualified to care for her. The story underscores how, in practice, equal access is not always guaranteed, even when disabled adults are well-equipped to be parents.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian exports introduces a powerful economic weapon that could significantly impact Russia's war economy. This analysis explores how such sanctions, which would target countries like China and India, could be more severe than previous measures by choking off crucial revenue streams. While Russia's economy has shown resilience, it is facing a slowdown, and the threat of these sanctions could pressure its key trading partners. However, Russia has reportedly been developing alternative payment systems to reduce its vulnerability, making the ultimate effectiveness of the new policy uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking on CNBC, Hassett theorized that Trump's leadership has inspired consumers to prefer American-made products, causing demand for imports to fall so sharply that it has offset any price increases from the tariffs. This theory has been met with skepticism from other economists, who point to factors like importers stockpiling goods and suggest that data shows import prices are, in fact, rising.
