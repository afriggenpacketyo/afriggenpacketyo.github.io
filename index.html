        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major fast-food chains McDonald's and Wendy's are reporting a slowdown in breakfast sales, which executives attribute to economic anxiety among low-income consumers. Factors such as inflation, potential tariffs, and a weakening labor market are causing many Americans to cut back on discretionary spending, with breakfast being one of the first expenses to be eliminated. This trend is viewed by economists as a significant indicator of the financial pressures facing households, as consumers opt for cheaper at-home meals or skip breakfast entirely.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old student from Glasgow, Rebecca Young, has been named one of Time magazine's "girls of the year" for her invention of a solar-powered warming blanket. The device, designed to help homeless individuals endure cold nights, was developed from her idea into a working prototype by the engineering firm Thales. Thirty-five of these blankets have been distributed by Homeless Project Scotland, providing tangible comfort and support to the city's vulnerable population and highlighting the real-world impact of youth innovation.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) recorded an $8 billion writedown on its ambitious "gigaprojects," such as the futuristic city of Neom, according to its latest annual report. Despite this decline in project valuation, the fund's total assets under management grew to nearly $1 trillion, partly due to an increased stake in state oil giant Aramco. The writedown reflects challenges from lower global oil prices and a growing fiscal deficit, prompting the kingdom to scale back some of its most high-profile development plans.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a ban on exporting certain advanced AI chips to China, allowing sales in exchange for a 15% revenue share for the U.S. government. Critics, including former national security officials, argue this decision represents a significant strategic concession that could endanger America's military and economic edge in artificial intelligence. The move is seen as part of President Trump's desperate push for a trade agreement with Beijing, potentially trading long-term security interests for short-term financial and political gains.</p>

The deal, which will officially end in August 2026, had been a key strategy for Target to attract shoppers and boost its high-growth beauty category. The dissolution of this popular "shop-in-shop" concept is seen as a potential setback for Target as it struggles with sluggish sales and seeks to regain momentum in a competitive retail environment.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News contends that Democrats are showing hypocrisy by criticizing the Trump administration's review of Smithsonian museum content. The author argues that these same politicians were silent or supportive when activists toppled historical statues, such as those of Christopher Columbus, in 2020. The piece claims that for decades, cultural institutions have been dominated by a one-sided, leftist narrative of American history, and the administration's review is a necessary step to introduce a more patriotic and balanced perspective.</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to a new estimate from The Senior Citizens League. This projection, based on recent inflation data, suggests a slight increase from the 2.5% boost beneficiaries received in the current year. The final COLA will be determined by the Social Security Administration in the fall, but some experts worry that even with the adjustment, benefit payments may not fully keep pace with the actual living expenses faced by seniors.</p>

          <h2>Health Secretary's Background Could Signal Changes to Vaccine-Injury Compensation System</h2>

          <p>This article from The Economist explores the potential implications of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s appointment, given his past work as a personal-injury lawyer and his skepticism towards vaccines. The piece suggests that his leadership could lead to changes in the specialized vaccine-injury court system. These potential reforms might create new opportunities for personal-injury lawyers, a group President Trump has often criticized, signaling a potentially significant and controversial shift in public health and legal policy under the current administration.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic political maneuver, nearly 40 Democratic lawmakers have fled the state of Texas to prevent the Republican-led legislature from achieving a quorum and passing its agenda. By holing up in Illinois, the Democrats are effectively blocking controversial legislation but are also engaging in a high-stakes standoff that The Economist frames as a "glorious defeat." This act of protest highlights the intense partisan divisions within the state and the extraordinary measures being taken to fight political battles in a deeply polarized environment.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are pressing the Trump administration for answers regarding significant staffing and budget cuts at the U.S. Forest Service. Citing internal data showing over a quarter of firefighting roles were unfilled in mid-July, they express grave concern that these shortages are hampering the nation's ability to respond to an intense wildfire season. The inquiry seeks to determine the full extent to which administration policies have weakened wildfire preparedness and put both firefighters and the public at risk during a critical time.</p>

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, Pakistan is confronting a significant deterioration in its internal security situation. The Taliban's victory has emboldened various militant factions within Pakistan, particularly the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has intensified its attacks. The inability or unwillingness of the Afghan Taliban to restrain the TTP, which enjoys logistical support from Afghanistan, has strained relations between the two countries and turned Pakistan into a new hub of regional militant activity.</p>

His stance on monetary policy aligns with President Trump's repeated calls for easing, though Sumerlin stressed the importance of Fed independence before accepting the role.</p>
