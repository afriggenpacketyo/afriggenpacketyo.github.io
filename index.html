          <p>Reform UK achieved a narrow victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, defeating Labour by just six votes after a recount. Sarah Pochin, a former Conservative councillor, overturned a significant Labour majority to secure the seat for Reform. This marks Reform UK's first parliamentary by-election win, signaling a potential shift in British politics, with Nigel Farage declaring Reform as the main opposition to the Labour government. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of former Labour MP Mike Amesbury, following his conviction for assaulting a constituent.</p>

          <p>Roche has made a significant move into the competitive obesity drug market by partnering with Zealand Pharma in a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a novel amylin analog for weight loss. This collaboration aims to create both standalone and combination therapies, potentially challenging Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly's dominance. Petrelintide has shown promising early clinical data, with comparable weight reduction to GLP-1 drugs but potentially better tolerability and lean muscle preservation. The partnership is structured as a 50-50 co-development and co-commercialization agreement, emphasizing a balanced collaboration between the two companies.</p>

          <p>Former Florida Senator Marco Rubio has taken on four prominent roles within the Trump administration, including Secretary of State, acting administrator of U.S.A.I.D., acting archivist for the National Archives, and interim national security adviser. This unprecedented accumulation of titles raises questions about Rubio's capacity to effectively manage these responsibilities, especially under a president known for unconventional governance. The appointment was abrupt, catching even State Department officials by surprise, and highlights the close relationship between Rubio and Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles.

Canada's global influence is perceived differently internally versus externally, with criticism of its soft power and worsening bilateral relationships with China and India.

The Akrotiri base in Cyprus plays a significant role in supporting US and UK military operations, including surveillance flights over Gaza and potential movement of special forces into Israel.

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a move expected to have major socio-economic and political consequences. This decision, announced by Information Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, reflects the government's commitment to societal values and interests. The census is likely to prompt demands for increased quotas in government jobs, college admissions, and elected offices for various castes, particularly the Other Backward Classes (OBCs). While supporters argue that this data is crucial for implementing social justice programs, critics fear it could exacerbate social unrest. The last comprehensive caste-based census was conducted by British colonial rulers in 1931.</p>

          <p>China is considering holding trade talks with the Trump administration, but insists that the US must first cancel its tariffs on Chinese goods to demonstrate sincerity. The Commerce Ministry stated that failure to correct unilateral tariff measures would damage mutual trust. The two countries have been engaged in a trade war, with tariffs on goods exchanged between them reaching a minimum of 145%. This development comes as tariffs appear to have taken a toll on Chinese producers. Some analysts have said that the two sides have different approaches to such talks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has closed a duty-free loophole that has allowed Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu to ship low-value packages directly to the US without paying duties or import taxes. The so-called "de minimis" exemption applied to parcels worth less than $800. The move is aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. </p>

          <p>As tensions escalate between Pakistan and India, a weary Pakistani public sees war as the last thing the country needs, grappling with economic hardship, political resignation, and a future clouded by uncertainty. Inflation, unemployment, and an unrepresentative political system are pressing concerns for many Pakistanis. While the military has long played a central role in Pakistani life, public sentiment is now complicated by frustration and anger. With the government recently securing another bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the promised economic turnaround feels distant and slow to trickle down.</p>

Huang noted that "50% of the world’s AI researchers are Chinese," a factor he says must "play into how we think about the game." He compared today’s AI revolution to previous industrial transformations, arguing that the United States succeeded historically because it “applied steel, applied energy faster than any country,” rather than worrying about labor displacement.
