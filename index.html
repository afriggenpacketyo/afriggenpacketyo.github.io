          <p>European stock markets saw gains, driven by positive news in the defense and healthcare industries. A significant £10 billion warship export deal between the U.K. and Norway boosted defense company shares, particularly BAE Systems. In the pharmaceutical sector, Novo Nordisk's stock rose following trial data suggesting its weight-loss drug, Wegovy, is highly effective in reducing heart disease risks compared to competitors. These developments occurred as investors also monitored mixed economic data from China and noted the closure of U.S. markets for Labor Day.</p>

          <p>U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has publicly supported his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism over her past property dealings. Conservative opponents have accused Rayner of hypocrisy and potential tax avoidance related to the sale of a flat she owned, calling for a standards investigation. Starmer dismissed the criticism, describing Rayner as a "great story of British success" and suggesting the attacks are motivated by sexism and classism. A spokesperson for Rayner has stated that all relevant property taxes were paid properly and in accordance with the law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Montpellier reveals a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic animals beginning in the Middle Ages. Researchers analyzed over 225,000 animal bones from southern France, spanning 8,000 years, to reach their conclusions. The findings indicate that while domesticated species like chickens and sheep grew larger due to selective breeding, wild species such as foxes and deer shrank. This shift is attributed to increased human control over livestock and the fragmentation of wild habitats due to expanding human settlements and hunting.</p>

          <p>Algerian Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif is legally challenging a mandate from World Boxing that requires her to undergo gender testing to remain eligible for competition. The rule was implemented following controversy at the Paris Olympics, where Khelif's victory sparked debate. Her appeal, filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, seeks to overturn the ban and allow her to compete in the upcoming World Boxing Championships without testing. Khelif, along with another boxer, has been at the center of a contentious international discussion regarding gender eligibility in the sport.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian authorities have announced the arrest of a suspect in the assassination of Andriy Parubiy, a prominent pro-Western politician and former speaker of parliament. Kyiv has asserted that there is a "Russian trace" in the killing, which took place in the western city of Lviv. The suspect, who allegedly disguised himself as a delivery worker, shot Parubiy eight times in broad daylight before fleeing. Parubiy was a key figure in Ukraine's pro-European movements and a vocal advocate for Ukrainian independence, making his murder a politically charged event amid the ongoing war.</p>

This concern was raised despite Levi's reporting a rise in UK sales and profits.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his legal authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs on most of the nation's trading partners. The court found it unlikely that Congress intended to grant the president such unlimited power to set taxes. However, the 7-4 decision gives the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court before the tariffs are struck down. This ruling represents a significant legal challenge to one of the administration's cornerstone economic policies and could impact future trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's intensified immigration enforcement could significantly harm key sectors of California's $4 trillion economy, which heavily relies on immigrant labor. According to a new study, industries such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality are particularly vulnerable to the loss of their workforce, a large portion of which is undocumented. The research estimates that mass deportations combined with other restrictive policies could cost the state up to $278 billion in gross domestic product. This potential economic disruption highlights the critical role immigrant workers play in sustaining California's economy, especially given the state's aging population and declining birthrates.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has devastated eastern Afghanistan, killing more than 800 people and injuring nearly 3,000, according to the United Nations. The quake struck near midnight on Sunday in a remote, mountainous region of Kunar province, causing entire villages to be destroyed and complicating rescue efforts. With roads blocked by landslides, the Taliban government is using helicopters for rescue operations, but officials warn the death toll is likely to rise significantly as many are still trapped under rubble. The disaster exacerbates an already severe humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, which is grappling with drought and economic collapse.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old boy who survived the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting has been found to have a bullet fragment lodged in his neck, dangerously close to his carotid artery. The boy, Weston Halsne, had initially thought he was covered in gunpowder after his friend, Victor Greenawalt, shielded him from the gunfire. His father stated that doctors called his survival a "miracle," and he is scheduled for surgery to remove the fragment with an expected full recovery. The harrowing detail emerges as other survivor accounts highlight the bravery of students and the severe injuries sustained by many children in the attack.</p>

While bilateral trade has grown, it remains significantly smaller than Germany's trade with China, and progress on an EU-India free trade agreement has been slow.

          <p>An 85-year-old man has died after he and his 82-year-old wife were trampled by a herd of cows while hiking with their dog in the Austrian Alps. The incident occurred in the province of Styria as the Viennese couple was walking near a mountain hut. According to police, a herd of nine cows, including calves, charged the couple, inflicting severe injuries. Despite receiving first aid from other hikers and being airlifted to a hospital, the man succumbed to his injuries. Authorities have published guidelines for hikers in the region, as free-grazing cattle can sometimes become aggressive.</p>

          <p>Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have activated the "snapback" mechanism within the 2015 nuclear deal, which could reinstate all previously lifted UN sanctions on Iran. The move comes in response to Iran's advancements in its nuclear program, which the European powers argue violate the terms of the agreement. Iran has stated it will not alter its position and is now considering a withdrawal from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This escalation creates a significant diplomatic dilemma for Tehran, which now faces the prospect of severe economic isolation while trying to manage internal and regional pressures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is defending his administration's decision to issue 600,000 student visas to Chinese nationals, pushing back against criticism from some of his staunchest supporters. Critics within the MAGA movement have expressed concern that the move allows potential spies into the country and takes university spots from Americans. However, Trump argued that it would be "insulting" to ban Chinese students, stating that they bring significant money into the U.S. economy and that maintaining a good relationship with China is important. This reversal of a previously hardline stance comes as delicate trade negotiations between the two countries continue.</p>

The vision aims to eliminate outdated practices and improve efficiency as Albania pushes for EU integration. However, the plan faces significant skepticism from financial and cybersecurity experts, who point to the country's high rate of economic informality, a population that heavily prefers cash, and vulnerabilities in its digital infrastructure, which were exposed by major cyberattacks in 2024.
