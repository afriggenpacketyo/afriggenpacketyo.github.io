          <p>Airbnb has suspended a "superhost" in Manchester after she declined a booking request from two women explicitly because they are from Wales. The guests, Jemma Louise Gough and Jamie Lee Watkins, were planning to attend a concert and were shocked by the host's message, which they described as "pure discrimination." Despite the host having high ratings, this incident has prompted an investigation by Airbnb, which stated that discrimination has no place on its platform. The women spoke out to challenge such narrow-minded views and expressed their pride in being Welsh.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly considering the termination of its $7 billion Solar for All program, which was designed to help 900,000 low-income households access affordable solar energy. The program, which has already awarded grants to 60 recipients across the country, is now facing potential cancellation following a directive from the Office of Management and Budget. Grant recipients, including state agencies in both red and blue states and tribal organizations, have not been formally notified and expressed shock and devastation. Critics of the potential move argue it would be a major setback for energy affordability and a broken promise to disadvantaged communities.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced the termination of approximately $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. The canceled projects, which included research for COVID-19, flu, and bird flu vaccines from companies like Pfizer and Moderna, were halted based on Kennedy's assertion that mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses. This decision has drawn sharp criticism from leading infectious disease experts, who argue the move is not based on scientific evidence and will leave the U.S. vulnerable to future pandemics by abandoning a rapidly adaptable vaccine platform.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Ashcroft, British Columbia, have attributed a recent wildfire to a bizarre sequence of events involving an osprey and a fish. Investigators believe the bird of prey caught a fish from a nearby river and subsequently dropped it onto a power line. The contact caused sparks that ignited the dry grass below, leading to a significant fire that required 4,800 gallons of water to extinguish. The fire department shared the unusual story on social media, joking that the osprey may have been trying to cook its meal.</p>

These agreements often involve paying protection fees, but they offer a fragile peace and highlight the state's inability to fulfill its social contract.

          <p>President Donald Trump has characterized multi-billion dollar investment commitments from trade partners like Japan and the European Union as "gifts" and "signing bonuses" for the U.S. However, this portrayal is at odds with how these partners view the agreements, which are often non-binding frameworks rather than firm commitments. For instance, the EU noted only an "interest" from private companies in investing, an area outside the European Commission's direct control.

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the maker of the weight loss drug Wegovy, is intensifying its focus on a direct-to-consumer sales strategy to counter competition from copycat compounders and address U.S. demands for lower drug prices. The company's cash channel allows uninsured patients to buy Wegovy at a significantly reduced price, a model it may extend to its forthcoming obesity pill. This strategy comes as the company faces a surprise profit warning due to the prevalence of "unsafe and unlawful" compounded drugs. Novo Nordisk's CFO also noted that the company is in discussions with the Trump administration regarding policies to lower prescription drug costs.</p>

          <p>Iran is grappling with an extreme heatwave, with temperatures nearing 50 degrees Celsius, leading to severe water and electricity shortages. Authorities have ordered government office closures to conserve power, as the capital, Tehran, experiences its lowest rainfall in 60 years. Experts warn that decades of resource mismanagement and uncontrolled urban growth have depleted water sources, leaving 80% of the country's reservoirs nearly empty. President Masoud Pezeshkian has cautioned that without controlled consumption, Tehran could run out of water in its dams by September, highlighting a long-predicted environmental crisis.</p>

          <p>Disney reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, although revenue fell slightly short. The strong performance was largely driven by continued growth in its direct-to-consumer streaming business and increased consumer spending at its theme parks. The company's streaming unit, once losing a billion dollars a quarter, is now on a solid financial foundation, helping to offset the decline in the traditional television business. Disney raised its full-year earnings guidance, signaling confidence in its strategy despite some headwinds in its film and linear TV divisions. (not investment advice)</p>

The article points to recent decisions, such as lifting export controls on advanced Nvidia chips to China and approving AI data center deals in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, as strategic missteps. These actions, reportedly influenced by tech advisor David Sacks and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, are seen as ceding a competitive advantage to China and placing critical U.S. assets in a volatile region. Critics, including former administration officials, warn these moves endanger America's economic and military edge.</p>

          <p>A downbeat economic forecast from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) suggests the UK government faces a budget gap of £40-50 billion, potentially forcing significant tax rises. The analysis indicates that Chancellor Rachel Reeves has limited options and may need to create a larger buffer against missing her borrowing targets. With spending largely fixed, potential revenue-raising measures could include changes to VAT, pension allowances, and prolonging the freeze on income tax thresholds. This reflects growing uncertainty and the significant economic challenges confronting the new government. (not investment advice)</p>

According to football finance experts, this is possible through clever financing, such as spreading payments for recent signings over the length of their contracts. The club has also freed up significant funds by loaning out Marcus Rashford, covering his full salary, and has benefited from sell-on clauses and sales of academy players. While not without financial challenges, the club's massive commercial revenue provides it with substantial spending power.</p>
