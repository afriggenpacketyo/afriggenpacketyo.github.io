          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank might consider lowering interest rates as early as July, contingent on inflation not posing a significant economic threat. Waller emphasized the importance of moving proactively to avoid potential labor market slowdowns, suggesting an inclination towards early easing. He noted that recent data has been fine, with no big tariff shock to inflation, and that the Fed has been on pause for six months, thinking that there was going to be a big tariff shock to inflation.

Japan plans to cut super-long-term bond issuances amid rising yields, but the total amount of bonds scheduled for issuance in the current fiscal year through March 2026 is projected to remain unchanged from the initial plan at 176.9 trillion yen ($1.2 trillion), as the Finance Ministry seeks to increase sales of short-term bonds. A former leader of Komeito will retire from politics, and the Japanese imperial couple are scheduled to visit Mongolia in July.

          <p>Invasive insects, such as the Asian tiger mosquito and Asian hornet, are increasingly prevalent in Europe due to climate change and global trade, leading to ecological and economic challenges. These pests compete with native species, destabilize ecosystems, spread diseases, and damage crops, costing the EU billions annually. The Asian hornet, for example, preys on crucial pollinators, including honeybees, impacting food security. Efforts to manage these invasive species include trapping, nest removal, and biological controls, though complete eradication remains difficult.</p>

          <p>A proposed Republican bill, referred to as the 'Big Beautiful Bill,' aims to extend the 2017 Trump tax cuts but could negatively impact low-income children and families by scaling back key social safety net programs. The bill proposes changes to Medicaid, SNAP, and child tax credits, potentially reducing healthcare, food assistance, and financial support for millions. Critics argue that the changes would create administrative hurdles and reduce benefits for the poorest households, while benefiting wealthier Americans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that resources for the poorest households would decrease by about $1,600 per year.</p>

          <p>China's export shipments of magnets to the US experienced a significant decline in May, plummeting by 93.3% year-on-year. This decline, stemming from Beijing's export controls in response to Washington's tariffs, has intensified pressure on US manufacturers in critical sectors. Exports to Germany and Japan also saw substantial drops. China's Ministry of Commerce has stated it is expediting the review of rare earth-related export license applications and promoting compliant trade.</p>

          <h2>China Emphasizes Governance and Resilience Amid Multiple Crises</h2>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent commemoration of Chen Yun, a foundational economic planner, signals a shift towards stressing resilient governance over ideology. Xi's remarks emphasized development planning and political resilience, deviating from the strong communist conviction references in his 2015 address. Chen was portrayed as a model of disciplined governance and a technocrat embracing policy logic in uncertain times. Xi's emphasis on Chen's 15-character maxim underscores the need for cadres to navigate a volatile world by following facts and embracing strategic thinking.</p>

          <p>An investment of $5,000 in Alphabet stock at its IPO in 2004 would be worth approximately $412,300 today, including dividends. Alphabet's growth has been driven primarily by digital advertising through Google searches and YouTube. While advertising still makes up a significant portion of the company's revenue, businesses like Google Cloud and Waymo hold potential for future growth. The analysis underscores the significant potential for long-term growth in this stock. (not investment advice)</p>
