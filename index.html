          <p>The White House has confirmed President Trump signed an executive order extending the pause on new tariffs against Chinese imports. This 90-day delay prevents a significant tariff hike that was set to expire at midnight. The extension was an anticipated result of recent trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials in Stockholm, providing more time for the two nations to reach a broader trade agreement and de-escalating immediate economic pressures.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that gold will not be subjected to tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling that would have applied duties to gold bars from Switzerland and other countries. The initial customs ruling had caused uncertainty in the precious metals market, leading to a record high in gold prices. Following the president's announcement via a social media post, gold futures experienced a notable decline, settling lower and alleviating industry concerns about disruptions to the international flow of physical gold.</p>

          <p>President Trump has initiated a federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department and deployed approximately 800 National Guard members to address what he termed a public safety emergency. Invoking the D.C. Home Rule Act, the administration placed the local police under the command of the Attorney General, despite official data showing a significant decline in violent crime in the city. The move has been framed by the White House as a necessary crackdown, while critics, including D.C. officials, have called it a historic assault on local governance.</p>

          <p>Paramount has acquired the U.S. media rights for UFC events in a landmark seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion. The agreement places 13 headline events and 30 fight nights on the Paramount+ streaming service, with select fights also airing on the CBS broadcast network. A significant change under this deal is the elimination of the pay-per-view model for UFC, making all fights accessible to Paramount+ subscribers. This aggressive content acquisition signals Paramount's strategy to bolster its streaming platform's appeal against competitors in the market.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Hurricane Center has reported the formation of Tropical Storm Erin in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, making it the fifth named storm of the season. Located west of the Cabo Verde islands, the storm is currently moving west and does not pose an immediate threat to the United States. However, early forecast models project that Erin could strengthen into a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands later in the week. This development aligns with predictions for an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season this year.</p>

          <p>Cannabis stocks experienced a significant rally after reports that President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug schedule. The President confirmed he is looking at the issue and expects a decision in the coming weeks. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a move to Schedule III could provide major benefits to the industry, including changes to tax regulations and increased investor interest. While Trump's support is a positive signal, the final authority for reclassification rests with the Attorney General and the DEA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, U2 frontman Bono has issued a strong condemnation of the Israeli government's actions in Gaza, labeling them a "moral failure" and unequivocally denouncing the brutality inflicted on the Palestinian people. While acknowledging the evil of the October 7th attack by Hamas, he argues that Israel's disproportionate response, including the use of starvation as a weapon, is indefensible. Bono calls for a cessation of hostilities, supports the Palestinian demand for statehood, and urges a rational path toward peace and coexistence for both sides.</p>

          <p>An analysis of retirement planning tools contrasts the benefits of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and annuities. The article explains that IRAs offer growth potential and flexibility through market investments, making them suitable for younger savers with a longer time horizon. In contrast, annuities provide guaranteed income streams, appealing to those nearing retirement who prioritize security and predictability over market growth. The piece suggests a hybrid strategy, using an IRA for wealth accumulation and converting a portion to an annuity later to create a stable income floor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of the White House's deal with Nvidia and AMD, which requires the companies to share 15% of their China-related revenue with the U.S. government, highlights its unusual nature. In exchange for the revenue cut, the companies can sell specific AI chips to China, a move investors see as a net positive since it restores access to a major market. The article suggests this transactional approach is characteristic of the Trump administration but is unlikely to be replicated in other sectors, as semiconductors are viewed as a unique strategic technology under strict export controls.</p>

          <p>The online retail landscape is on the verge of a major shift as generative AI platforms like ChatGPT are expected to integrate direct checkout functionalities. This would allow consumers to complete purchases within the AI chat interface rather than being redirected to a merchant's website, creating a more frictionless experience. Experts believe this will fundamentally change e-commerce by shifting the focus from who closes the sale to who controls the pre-sale product discovery. This evolution could disrupt existing payment processors and alter how retail media revenue is generated.</p>
