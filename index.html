          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the United States and China are nearing a trade pact, despite acknowledging that a few technical details still require resolution on the Chinese side. He noted that negotiations in Stockholm were "tough," and any final deal would need President Donald Trump's personal sign-off before the August 12 tariff deadline. This potential agreement follows a period of aggressive tariff exchanges, where U.S. duties reached 145% and China's countered at 125%, later reduced to 30% and 10% respectively. The U.S. also remains concerned about China's purchase of Iranian oil and technology supplies to Russia.</p>

Trudeau, accompanied by his 16-year-old daughter, Ella-Grace, was seen enthusiastically attending Perry's sold-out concert, singing along to her hits. This concert appearance came days after the pair were reportedly spotted enjoying an intimate dinner together at a Montreal restaurant. The speculation about a new relationship emerges after Perry's recent public split from actor Orlando Bloom, and Trudeau's separation from his wife in 2023.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recently announced 50% copper tariff, aimed at boosting the domestic copper industry, has surprised traders by exempting raw input materials like copper cathode and ores, applying instead to semi-finished products. While this specific exemption initially caused a sharp drop in U.S. copper prices, analysts widely predict that it will not prevent consumer prices for goods containing the metal from rising. Manufacturers, who purchase wiring and other semi-finished copper products, will face higher production costs, which are likely to be passed on to consumers. Despite short-term market volatility, the long-term demand fundamentals for copper remain strong, driven by global energy transition needs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proceeding with plans to revoke the 2009 endangerment finding, a pivotal scientific conclusion that has served as the legal foundation for U.S. climate action. This rollback would strip the EPA of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, potentially leading to the repeal of rules on power plants, vehicles, and landfills. Experts warn that this represents a "radical pivot" towards expanded fossil fuel production, intensifying climate change impacts. Legal challenges are anticipated, with the case likely heading to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and has previously limited federal climate regulations.</p>

          <p>A mere 20-minute outage in the UK's air traffic control system, managed by NATS, caused widespread chaos, leading to 150 flight cancellations and ongoing delays across the country. The system's failure, described as a "radar-related issue," forced a reduction in air traffic for safety, severely degrading the network's capacity. Airlines have vehemently criticized NATS, noting this is the second major system failure since 2023, with Ryanair calling for the CEO's resignation. While NATS stated no evidence of a cyber attack, air traffic control consultants question the lack of detailed explanation and the acceptance of such "unavoidable" faults in a critical national service.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced an order to eliminate the "de minimis" tariff exemption globally, effective August 29, expanding a measure previously aimed primarily at China. This action is part of a broader strategy to close loopholes used to evade tariffs and smuggle illicit goods, including synthetic opioids and unsafe products, into the United States. Experts suggest this move signals a return to more conventional trade practices, but it will significantly alter the landscape for exporters. Chinese businesses, in particular, will find their pathways to the U.S. market further restricted, forcing them to either compete in an already saturated domestic market or contend with other Chinese sellers abroad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests a remarkable evolutionary origin for the potato: it may have arisen from a chance hybridization event between an ancient tomato and a flowering plant from the Etuberosum group, 8 to 9 million years ago. Scientists previously struggled to reconcile the potato's mixed genetic lineage, which showed resemblances to both tomatoes and Etuberosum. The study found that neither parent plant could form tubers, the underground nutrient-storage organs. However, the unique genetic combination in their hybrid offspring enabled the development of tubers, allowing the proto-potato to colonize colder, drier environments and diversify into over 100 species, including the modern cultivated potato.</p>

A lower court previously ruled against Trump, but the tariffs were temporarily reinstated pending this appeal.

However, a watchdog group criticized the lack of clarity on the contamination's origin, urging greater transparency.</p>

          <p>West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of all spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, nearly two years after the Football Association initiated an investigation. Paqueta was accused of deliberately getting booked to influence betting markets, an offense that could have led to a lifetime ban from the sport. While the four primary charges were found "not proven," the commission did determine that Paqueta failed to cooperate with the investigation and will decide an appropriate sanction for these breaches. Paqueta expressed immense relief and gratitude, eagerly anticipating his return to professional football.</p>

          <p>Bangladeshi fishermen are increasingly endangered on the Naf river, which separates Bangladesh from Myanmar, due to the escalating activities of the Arakan Army (AA), a powerful rebel group. Fishermen, including Mohammad Siddiqui, have reported being abducted, beaten, and held by AA fighters for allegedly crossing into Myanmar territory, despite their claims of remaining within Bangladeshi waters. With the AA now controlling key border regions, these incidents are causing significant frustration for both Dhaka and the AA, who view their actions as legitimate law enforcement against encroachment. This situation poses a severe threat to the livelihoods and safety of the local fishing community.</p>

          <p>UK Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has defended the government's stance on potentially recognizing a Palestinian state, arguing that legal warnings about its statehood criteria are "missing the point." Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer outlined conditions for recognition, including a ceasefire and renewed commitment to a two-state solution. However, legal experts argue Palestine lacks defined territory and a single effective government, citing undefined borders and a divided government. Separately, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also announced his country's intention to recognize a Palestinian state, driven by the "catastrophe" in Gaza and the receding prospects for a two-state solution.</p>

This initiative follows his 2018 acquisition, which initially promised a revitalization but has largely fallen short, marked by significant journalist departures and questions regarding editorial independence due to his political affiliations.

Developed by a team at the PLA Academy of Military Sciences, this design outlines a compact, relativistic electron beam device capable of generating a rapid sequence of sub-nanosecond microwave bursts. Computer simulations demonstrate its ability to achieve a first pulse with 16.6GW peak power by leveraging coherent, avalanche-like emission from tightly bunched electrons. This advancement marks a significant leap in high-power microwave systems, potentially reshaping future military capabilities.</p>

          <p>Congress has allocated over $175 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a sum exceeding most countries' annual military budgets, intended for a three-and-a-half-year deportation campaign. Critics express deep concern over the lack of oversight and guardrails for ICE and Customs and Border Protection, agencies with a documented history of financial mismanagement. The substantial funding is expected to facilitate a significant expansion of detention and surveillance systems, creating a windfall for private prison companies and tech firms with ties to the administration. This massive allocation raises questions about its necessity and potential for increased human suffering. (not investment advice)</p>
