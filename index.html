          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, formed over the central Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday. Forecasters predict the system will remain over open waters for several days, potentially intensifying into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend. While its current track carries it north of the Caribbean, it could reach Bermuda next week. The National Hurricane Center notes high uncertainty in its path, but officials at NOAA had previously predicted a busier-than-average season.</p>

          <p>A suspect named Donald Henson is in custody after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's Pittsburgh Field office in what was initially called a "targeted attack." After the crash, Henson reportedly threw an American flag over the gate. No injuries were reported, and the FBI later retracted the "act of terror" label, noting Henson's history of mental health issues and a previous nonsensical complaint at the office. He faces federal charges for assaulting a government employee and damaging property.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan formalized a strategic defense pact on Wednesday, deepening their long-standing security partnership. The agreement stipulates that an attack on one nation will be considered an aggression against both. This enhanced alliance follows Israel's attack on Qatar and growing apprehension among Gulf Arab states regarding the reliability of the United States as a security guarantor. The pact also comes after a tense conflict between Pakistan and India, in which Saudi Arabia reportedly played a de-escalation role.</p>

          <p>ABC indefinitely suspended "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after controversial comments by its host linking the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to President Donald Trump's MAGA movement. The decision followed FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr's suggestion that ABC's broadcast license was at risk, and Nexstar Media Group's pre-emption of the show on its affiliate stations. While Kimmel has not been fired, Disney plans to discuss his future on-air statements. This article highlights the ongoing debate over free speech and media accountability in a charged political climate, noting similar recent dismissals at other news outlets.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index reached a new record high on Thursday, driven by real estate and technology sectors, while other Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed trading. This followed the Federal Reserve's expected benchmark rate cut on Wednesday, framed by Chairman Jerome Powell as a "risk management cut." The Fed indicated potential for two more cuts this year, with additional reductions in 2026 and 2027. HSBC anticipates the Bank of Japan will maintain steady policy rates but forecasts a 25 basis point hike in October. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, analysts anticipate China's central bank will likely pursue only moderate easing despite increased room for action. On Thursday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the yuan's midpoint rate at 7.1085 against the U.S. dollar, a slight depreciation. Experts suggest the PBOC's slower rate cut pace compared to the Fed will narrow the interest rate gap, easing capital outflow pressures and supporting the yuan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced early Thursday his intention to designate Antifa as a "major terrorist organization," calling it a "SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER." Antifa is a decentralized, far-left movement, not a singular entity, which complicates its designation as a terrorist group under existing U.S. law, particularly due to First Amendment protections for domestic organizations. Trump also stated he would recommend investigating Antifa's funders.

          <p>In her upcoming book, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reveals she considered Pete Buttigieg her "first choice" for running mate but deemed it "too big of a risk" to pair a Black woman with a gay man. Harris ultimately chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and the pair lost to Donald Trump. This candid disclosure highlights the Democratic Party's evolving strategy, moving from prioritizing historic representation to focusing on electability. The article suggests Harris's decision reflects a pragmatic assessment of voter tolerance for diverse tickets, especially after past electoral losses with pioneering candidates.</p>

          <p>University of California police departments received approval to replenish and increase their arsenal of military-grade weapons and equipment, including drones and pepper-ball rounds. This annual request, approved by the board of regents, comes as UC's handling of campus protests faces scrutiny. While some campuses sought new weapons, others did not, with UC San Diego requesting 5,000 rifle rounds and UC Irvine 1,500 pepper-ball projectiles. This article highlights concerns from faculty members who believe such equipment will be used against students and faculty, citing past incidents where pepper-balls were deployed during protests.</p>

          <p>The Shasta County Coroner’s Office identified Nathan Arthur Webster, 46, of Redding, as the man who died while in custody at the county jail. Jail staff found Webster unresponsive in his cell on Sunday, September 14, despite attempts by deputies and medical staff to revive him. This marks the sixth inmate death reported in the jail within approximately two years. The Shasta Grand Jury previously concluded that five earlier inmate deaths were due to lifestyle issues rather than jail procedures. The Major Crimes Unit is investigating this incident.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume naturally fermented fruit with an alcohol content equivalent to nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day. Scientists measured the alcohol in the fruit chimps eat, finding an average of 0.3% by weight. While chimps don't get drunk, this steady low dose supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, suggesting primates' attraction to alcohol stems from ancestral fruit-eating habits. This article highlights that other animals also seek this natural buzz, connecting human alcohol preference to evolutionary dietary patterns.</p>

          <p>A new report from the California Budget and Policy Center reveals California continues to have the highest poverty rate in the U.S., tied with Louisiana, with little improvement. In 2024, approximately 7 million residents, or 17.7%, could not afford basic needs, a rate that surged after pandemic-era policies expired. The report notes that people of color, renters, and children are disproportionately affected, with child poverty more than doubling since 2021. It calls for "bold action" from state leaders, including tax reforms, to mitigate rising poverty amidst federal and state budget cuts. (not investment advice)</p>
