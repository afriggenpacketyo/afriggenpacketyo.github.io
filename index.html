          <p>A major Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv has resulted in at least 28 deaths and 159 injuries, with three children among the deceased. The barrage, which damaged an apartment block and other civilian infrastructure, occurred despite a recent ceasefire demand from U.S. President Donald Trump. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a demonstrative act of violence in response to peace efforts. Meanwhile, fighting continues in the eastern Donetsk region, with conflicting reports over the control of the strategic town of Chasiv Yar.</p>

Key U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea successfully negotiated lower rates, while Taiwan also saw a reduction pending further talks. Southeast Asian nations faced varied tariffs, with Vietnam securing a deal and countries like Laos and Myanmar being hit with higher levies. India faces a 25% tariff, partly due to its ties with Russia, while Pakistan received a comparatively lower rate, potentially boosting its textile industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has established a dedicated attaché office in Wellington, New Zealand, explicitly stating that one of its key missions is to counter the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in the Indo-Pacific region. The announcement was made by a U.S. official recognized as a loyalist to President Donald Trump. In response, the Chinese embassy in Wellington strongly opposed the move, denouncing it as groundless vilification rooted in a "Cold War mentality." The new office signifies an enhancement of the FBI's presence, which was previously managed under its Australian division.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied that its H20 chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, contain any "back doors" that would allow for remote access or control. The statement follows an inquiry from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), which summoned the company over potential security risks, including tracking functions. This development creates a significant challenge for Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, as it navigates the complex geopolitical landscape. The company must balance compliance with U.S. export controls while also maintaining the trust of its crucial market in China.</p>

          <p>Florida has set a new record for the most executions in a single year since the U.S. death penalty was reinstated, carrying out its ninth execution of the year on Thursday. Edward Zakrzewski, 60, was executed for the 1994 murders of his wife and two young children. This total surpasses the state's previous record of eight executions in 2014 and makes Florida the state with the most executions in the nation this year. The execution proceeded despite appeals that highlighted Zakrzewski's military service and the non-unanimous jury recommendation for his death sentence.</p>

          <p>In an innovative effort to combat rhino poaching, a South African university has launched the Rhisotope Project, which involves injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes. The goal is to make the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at borders and airports, thereby disrupting trafficking networks and leading to arrests. Following successful trials, five rhinos were treated in the project's official launch. Conservationists hope this method will provide a new layer of protection for the world's dwindling rhino population, which has been devastated by the illegal horn trade.</p>

This shift is leaving a gap in lunar development that private companies are eagerly filling through initiatives like NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program.

These unlicensed Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) are plagued by issues like rats, black mould, and fire hazards, with one such property leading to a fatal fire. Despite laws requiring landlords to license large house-shares, evidence suggests that illegal HMOs may far outnumber legal ones in some areas.

          <h2>Opinion: U.S. Healthcare Failures Are Not the Fault of Australia or Other Nations</h2>

          <p>This commentary argues that the United States' high healthcare costs and poor health outcomes are internal problems, not the fault of countries like Australia, which President Trump has labeled "freeloaders." The author points out that the U.S. spends nearly twice as much per person on healthcare as other wealthy nations for worse results, including lower life expectancy. The piece refutes the claim that other countries unfairly benefit from U.S. medical research, noting that U.S. public research funding has stagnated and major innovations now often come from Europe. The article suggests the U.S. could learn from systems like Australia's Medicare and PBS.</p>

          <p>Mike Donilon, a former senior adviser to Joe Biden, testified to the House Oversight Committee that he was paid $4 million for his work on the 2024 campaign and had an agreement to receive an additional $4 million if Biden had won reelection.

As part of the Republican-led committee's investigation into the former president's cognitive state, Donilon defended Biden's fitness for office.

Sebije Nelovic, 65, was working on the 33rd floor when the shooter entered and pointed his AR-15-style rifle at her. She identified herself as a cleaner and managed to run and hide in a closet, where she remained for hours while the attack unfolded. The gunman killed four people, including an off-duty police officer, before taking his own life. Investigators are still exploring the motive, which may be linked to the NFL headquarters in the same building.</p>

In an interview, her siblings also expressed shock at President Trump's recent comment that Epstein had "stolen" Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club, saying the term objectified her. The family urged Trump not to consider a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's associate who is currently imprisoned for sex trafficking. Giuffre, who alleged she was trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell as a teenager, died earlier this year.</p>

          <p>An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has sentenced 108 members of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's political party, PTI, to prison. The convictions, including a 10-year term for opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan, are related to their involvement in violent protests against the military in May 2023. The PTI has denounced the rulings as politically motivated and a "black day for democracy," vowing to appeal the decision. This mass sentencing represents a significant blow to the opposition party, whose leader, Imran Khan, remains imprisoned on numerous charges.</p>
