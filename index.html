          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has pleaded not guilty in federal court to charges of mortgage fraud, with a trial date set for January 26. The prosecution was initiated by a U.S. attorney appointed by President Donald Trump, leading James and her supporters to condemn it as a politically motivated act of revenge. Speaking outside the courthouse, James described the case as an example of the justice system being "weaponized" but expressed faith that justice would prevail. This article provides a detailed account of the arraignment and the politically charged context surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>The Ethiopian Media Authority (EMA) has suspended nine Deutsche Welle correspondents, accusing the international broadcaster of disseminating unbalanced and conflict-aggravating reports. This move is part of a wider trend of tightening media control in Ethiopia, which has seen a surge in journalist detentions and the suspension of other foreign channels. Press freedom watchdogs like the Committee to Protect Journalists have condemned the action as an outrageous act of censorship. The crackdown raises concerns about the state of press freedom in the country ahead of the scheduled 2026 general election.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew's banner bearing his coat of arms has been removed from St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. This action follows his recent decision to relinquish his membership in the Order of the Garter and cease using his royal titles. The move comes amid continued public scrutiny and pressure over his connection to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and sexual assault allegations made by Virginia Giuffre, which the prince has consistently denied. The removal of the banner is a symbolic reflection of his diminished status within the royal family.</p>

          <p>During a protest against a planned federal immigration crackdown in the San Francisco Bay Area, officers opened fire on a U-Haul truck that was reversing toward a line of law enforcement personnel. The incident occurred outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, which was intended to be a staging area for the operation. The driver of the vehicle was wounded and later taken for a mental health evaluation, while two civilians sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The FBI has taken the lead in the investigation into the shooting.</p>

          <p>This article highlights the personal stories of federal employees who are going without pay as the government shutdown extends into its 24th day. Many workers deemed "essential" must continue to report to their jobs despite not receiving a paycheck, leading to significant financial strain. Individuals are being forced to cancel appointments, contact mortgage lenders for deferred payments, and cut all nonessential spending to stay afloat. The situation is causing widespread anxiety and has led some long-term government employees to consider leaving public service for the private sector.</p>

          <p>The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, released despite the government shutdown, showed that annual inflation was 3.0% in September, slightly lower than economists had forecasted.

This decision escalates trade tensions between the two major economic partners, which have been strained by the Trump administration's tariff strategy.

          <h2>Fact Check: Comparing National Sexual Assault Statistics is Misleading</h2>

          <p>This article serves as a fact-check, explaining why directly comparing sexual assault statistics between different countries is a flawed and misleading practice. A viral graphic claiming the UK has an exponentially higher rate of sexual assault than other European nations fails to account for critical differences in legal definitions, crime recording practices, and cultural attitudes toward reporting. Criminologists cited in the article argue that police-reported data is not a reliable measure of prevalence and that victim surveys offer a more accurate, though still complex, picture.</p>

          <p>English Championship club Sheffield Wednesday has officially been placed into administration, triggering an automatic 12-point deduction from the English Football League. This penalty drops the club to the bottom of the league table, making their fight against relegation significantly harder. The move marks the end of the deeply unpopular ownership of Dejphon Chansiri, and administrators are now in the process of finding new buyers. For many fans, the day is considered "bittersweet," as administration brings short-term pain but offers hope for a more stable long-term future.</p>

Petro labeled the attacks as "easy, but ineffective" and a violation of international law, claiming they kill low-level workers instead of cartel leaders and have resulted in civilian deaths. He argued that the U.S. has provided no warning or intelligence about the strikes and urged for diplomatic dialogue with President Trump instead of unilateral military actions.</p>

          <p>This article explores the question of how much a person needs to owe before a debt collector is likely to file a lawsuit. While there is no definitive minimum amount, legal action often becomes a practical consideration for unsecured debts in the range of $1,000 to $5,000. For smaller balances, the costs associated with litigation can make a lawsuit unprofitable for the collection agency. The decision also depends heavily on state laws, the type of debt, and the practices of the specific court system.</p>

          <p>In a reflective essay, acclaimed filmmaker Guillermo del Toro explains the deep personal and artistic motivations behind his upcoming adaptation of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein." He posits that the horror genre serves as one of the last bastions of spirituality in a material world, allowing for the exploration of profound existential questions. Del Toro sees the novel as a powerful parable about abandonment, the sorrow of a creation without a caring god, and the search for truth, themes that have resonated with him since childhood and echo in his other works.</p>
