            <p>This article humorously explores the negative stereotypes associated with stepmothers, drawing parallels to classic fairy tales and myths. It discusses how these stereotypes can deter women from dating parents and influence their behavior within blended families. The author argues that while stepmothers are often portrayed as "wicked," the reality is more complex, and the fear of being perceived negatively should not prevent individuals from pursuing relationships. The article suggests that children are predisposed to have complicated feelings about their mothers, regardless of whether they are biological or stepmothers. Optimism score: 70</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an order preventing the Trump administration from removing Venezuelan immigrants without due process, signaling a potential shift in the Court's tolerance for the administration's actions. The order came in response to concerns that the government was attempting to deport immigrants without providing them a meaningful opportunity to challenge their removal. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented. The decision suggests that the Court may be less willing to tolerate procedural maneuvers intended to evade judicial review. Optimism score: 60</p>
