          <p>The Israeli military launched air and artillery strikes in southern Gaza, stating the action was a response to Hamas firing on its soldiers. Israeli officials described the alleged rocket-propelled grenade and sniper attacks as a "bold violation" of the recent U.S.-brokered ceasefire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the military to take "strong action" against violations, though he did not explicitly threaten a return to full-scale war. Hamas, through its Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, denied involvement in any clashes and reaffirmed its commitment to the ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of "murder" and violating his country's sovereignty after a U.S. strike on a boat in Colombian waters. Petro stated the vessel was a fishing boat in distress, resulting in the death of a fisherman with no ties to drug trafficking. The accusation follows President Trump's announcement that the U.S. had struck a "drug-carrying submarine," killing two people. This incident is the latest in a series of U.S. strikes in the Caribbean aimed at curbing drug flow, which have been described by UN experts as "extrajudicial executions."</p>

The exercise drew criticism from Governor Gavin Newsom, who cited safety risks from closing a major interstate. In his speech, Vance praised his own military service, blamed Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown, and criticized past diversity and "woke" initiatives within the armed forces. He reaffirmed the Trump administration's commitment to eliminating such programs to maintain a focus on military readiness.</p>

          <p>"Nobody's Girl," a posthumously published memoir by Virginia Giuffre, provides an unflinching account of her experiences within Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, details being recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at age 16 and her subsequent sexual assault by powerful men, including Prince Andrew. The book's co-author, Amy Wallace, discusses Giuffre's motivations for writing, her belief that unreleased Epstein files contain more names, and the personal turmoil that marked her final years. The memoir serves as a final testament from a key voice for abuse survivors.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris was forced to close after a brazen daytime robbery where thieves stole jewelry of "inestimable" historical value.

The suspects reportedly took at least nine pieces once belonging to Emperor Napoleon before escaping on motorcycles. French authorities have launched a major investigation into the heist, which was described as a highly organized operation that took only seven minutes to execute.</p>

          <p>This opinion article commends two federal district court judges, Karin Immergut in Portland and April Perry in Chicago, for blocking the Trump administration's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to their cities. The author argues the judges courageously challenged the president's justifications, which one deemed "untethered to the facts," and upheld the constitutional tradition against military intrusion in civil affairs.

          <p>Amid a recent dip in tourism, Las Vegas is once again grappling with its identity as a travel destination, particularly concerning its suitability for families with children. An online discussion highlighted visitor complaints about seeing young kids in smoke-filled casinos and out late at night, with some lamenting the shift away from an adults-only atmosphere. While tourism officials promote numerous family-friendly activities, some visitors expressed skepticism, noting that high prices could deter families. The debate reflects the tension between the city's "Sin City" reputation and its efforts to attract a broader demographic.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering a cut to the 5% Value Added Tax (VAT) on household energy bills ahead of the November budget. While not confirming the policy, Miliband acknowledged the country faces a significant "cost-of-living crisis" and that officials are "looking at all of these issues." This potential move comes as the government faces pressure to reduce high energy costs, which have become a major political issue. Scrapping the tax could save the average household approximately £86 per year. (not investment advice)</p>

Shoppers describe cutting back on items like meat, facing higher costs for essentials from baby formula to car tires, and seeing emptier store shelves. A recent study by S&P Global estimates that U.S. consumers will absorb over $900 billion in extra costs in 2025 due to the tariffs.

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Coordinated Campaign by Food Industry to Counter Health Initiatives</h2>

          <p>An investigation has found that major soft-drink and snack-food corporations are funding a campaign through a network of Republican-tied operatives to undermine public health initiatives. The effort aims to frame policies, such as restricting soda purchases with SNAP benefits, as an attack on the working-class voters of the MAGA movement, pitting them against Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" agenda. The campaign utilizes industry-funded polls, conservative media outlets, and paid social media influencers to create a narrative that opposes government regulation of food and beverage choices, thereby protecting corporate profits.</p>

          <p>Autistic researchers and advocates are criticizing the Trump administration for prioritizing research into unproven causes of autism, such as acetaminophen, over funding essential support services. They argue that this focus is a distraction from the real needs of the autistic community, which include improved access to healthcare, education, and community-based support through programs like Medicaid, which has faced cuts. Advocates emphasize that quality-of-life research and policies promoting inclusion are far more beneficial than pursuing scientifically unsupported theories. They call for autistic people to be included in policy decisions that directly affect their lives.</p>

          <p>In northeastern Ukraine, communities are building schools deep underground to allow children to continue their education safely amid constant Russian drone and missile attacks. After years of isolating online-only instruction, these subterranean classrooms provide a vital space for social interaction and learning, though they highlight the grim expectation of a long war. This effort is part of a broader struggle to counter the psychological and educational toll on Ukraine's youth, who face the dual challenge of preserving their national identity and preparing to rebuild a war-torn country.</p>

          <p>The growing popularity of pickleball has been accompanied by a significant rise in eye injuries associated with the sport, according to a new study in JAMA Ophthalmology. Researchers estimate an increase of over 400 cases annually from 2021 to 2024, with adults over 50 accounting for 70% of incidents. The injuries, caused by fast-paced play on a small court, include corneal abrasions and lacerations from being hit by the ball or a paddle. The study's authors call for standardized eye protection guidelines to mitigate the risks, noting that proper eyewear can prevent up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police are "actively" looking into media reports alleging that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail to obtain personal information about his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The claims suggest he asked an officer to investigate her shortly before a newspaper published a photo of their first meeting in 2011. This development follows Prince Andrew's recent decision to relinquish his royal titles and public roles amid ongoing scrutiny of his association with Jeffrey Epstein. The allegations raise serious concerns about the potential misuse of taxpayer-funded security resources.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to neuroscientist Dr. Charan Ranganath, memory functions less like a file cabinet and more like a resource for shaping the story of our lives. In his book "Why We Remember," he explains that memory is not about perfect recall but about constructing meaning to understand the present and anticipate the future. Forgetting is an essential part of this process, as our minds prioritize emotionally significant events and details that are useful for future decisions. This selective, narrative-building function explains why our recollection of an experience, rather than the experience itself, often determines our long-term satisfaction.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to 6.18%, its lowest level since October 2024, according to Zillow data. This decline is partly attributed to the ongoing government shutdown, which is also causing processing delays for government-backed FHA and VA loans. For homebuyers with strong credit who can qualify for a conventional loan, the current low rates may present a favorable purchasing opportunity. Refinance rates have also seen a slight decrease, with the average for a 30-year fixed refinance now at 6.29%. (not investment advice)</p>
