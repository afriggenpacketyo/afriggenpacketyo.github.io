          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), asserting the committee had become a "rubber stamp" for vaccines. Kennedy believes a clean sweep is necessary to restore public confidence in vaccine science. Medical groups have voiced outrage, with the American Public Health Association calling it an undemocratic "coup." Senator Bill Cassidy has expressed concern that the ACIP will be filled with unqualified individuals, but Kennedy has assured him that this is not the case. The move comes a week after a committee leader resigned following an order from Kennedy to change the CDC's guidance on COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed £14.2 billion to construct the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, which is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a landmark decision to kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband envisions a golden age of clean energy abundance. However, Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C condemned the announcement, fearing it would add to consumer bills and undermine value for money. The final investment decision on the funding model is due later this summer, and the project has faced opposition at local and national levels.</p>

          <p>Over 100 House Democrats voted against a GOP-led resolution condemning the attack in Boulder, Colorado, with the resolution passing 280-113. Democratic lawmakers opposed the resolution's language, which they felt was politically charged, as it rebuked sanctuary jurisdictions and condemned illegal immigrants who overstayed their visas. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the resolution as not being a serious effort to combat anti-Semitism, while Representative Dan Goldman, who is Jewish, expressed being tired of being used as pawns. Representative Jeff Van Drew defended the measure, highlighting the dangers of illegal immigration and the need for free communication between law enforcement agencies.

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his conflict with California Governor Gavin Newsom over protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Los Angeles. Trump stated it would be "great" if Newsom were arrested, prompting Newsom to accuse Trump of authoritarianism. Trump has deployed National Guard members to Los Angeles, while Newsom is suing the administration, claiming the federalization of the National Guard is illegal. Both leaders accuse each other of exploiting the situation for political gain, as Newsom has also accused the White House of exacerbating the situation for political gain.

          <p>Chinese electric car manufacturers, like BYD, are rapidly expanding into the European market, offering cheaper alternatives such as the BYD Dolphin Surf. This expansion is part of China's broader strategy to become a leader in high-tech industries, leading to concerns about security risks and potential market dominance. While consumers may benefit from more affordable electric vehicles, some experts worry about potential hacking and espionage risks associated with Chinese vehicles. The US has responded by raising import tariffs, while the EU has imposed additional tariffs to protect its manufacturers. This article explores the growing influence of Chinese electric cars and the associated economic and security implications.</p>

          <p>California is suing the Trump administration over the deployment of the state's National Guard to confront protesters in Los Angeles, with Attorney General Rob Bonta arguing that the federalization of the Guard deprives the state of resources needed to protect citizens. Governor Gavin Newsom has accused President Trump of illegally federalizing the National Guard and escalating tensions, while Trump has voiced support for arresting Newsom. Bonta argues that the president lacks the authority to deploy the troops, as the situation does not meet the criteria for federal intervention. The lawsuit claims that the governor, as commander in chief of the Guard, must consent to its federalization.</p>

          <p>A columnist argues that President Trump's decision to activate the California National Guard in response to protests is unwarranted and violates democratic norms. The columnist notes that the announcement of the Guard's activation appeared to incite more mayhem, making Trump's decision politically advantageous. Rioting is politically unpopular, and Trump is using the unrest to his advantage, aided by enablers in the White House pushing for wartime powers. The author concludes that this situation is leading to a contest of competing theories of the propaganda of the deed, which will likely end poorly for the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump's actions in California, including deploying the National Guard and seeking to cut off federal funding, represent a break from traditional conservative defense of states' rights. Trump's vision of federalism is a one-way street, where states are on their own if they need help but must comply with federal intervention regardless of their beliefs. This approach reflects a centralization of control and a willingness to use the federal government as a cudgel. The article suggests that Trump's actions are likely to worsen tensions between Washington and the states.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court for the authority to bypass the Convention Against Torture by deporting individuals to countries where they may face torture. Trump's lawyers argue that if a country provides diplomatic assurances that deportees will not be persecuted or tortured, the administration can deport individuals there without further procedures. Critics argue that this would deny due process to those who might be tortured, and the case is unlike others in that the deportees have already gone through legal proceedings. The outcome of the case could significantly impact the rights of immigrants facing deportation.</p>
