          <p>Shedeur Sanders experienced a surprising slide in the NFL Draft, with several quarterbacks being selected ahead of him. Jalen Milroe was picked by the Seattle Seahawks, who previously traded Geno Smith and acquired Sam Darnold, while Dillon Gabriel went to the Cleveland Browns, despite the team having multiple opportunities to draft Sanders. Milroe is known for his athleticism, and Gabriel led the Big Ten in completions and attempts. Sanders expressed his surprise at not being drafted in the first round, making his current situation all the more unexpected.</p>

          <p>Canada is heading to the polls with a close race anticipated between the ruling Liberals, led by the newly appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney, and the opposition Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre. Carney, former head of the Banks of Canada and England, is politically untested but brings financial expertise to the table. Poilievre, a long-time politician known for his confrontational style, has been critical of the Liberals' policies and is advocating for a return to "common sense politics." The Bloc Québécois, led by Yves-François Blanchet, and the New Democratic Party, led by Jagmeet Singh, also play crucial roles in the election.</p>

This research is particularly relevant with the rise of self-driving vehicles, where passengers are more prone to motion sickness.

          <p>The Justice Department has rescinded a Biden-era policy that protected journalists in leak investigations, allowing authorities to once again subpoena reporters and compel testimony. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the policy is necessary to stop federal employees from leaking sensitive information. This decision marks a shift back to a more aggressive approach to leak investigations, similar to those used during the Trump and Obama administrations. Press freedom advocates have criticized the move, arguing it could hinder important reporting.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon allegedly set up a system in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office to access messages on the encrypted messaging app Signal, bypassing standard Defense Department security protocols. A computer monitor in Hegseth's office was installed to give him remote access to Signal messages from his personal cellphone. This setup is considered a security risk, giving Hegseth access to his personal iPhone text messages and Signal chat groups at his desk even though his cellphone isn't physically in the office.</p>

The state's standard automobile license plates, which have followed a configuration of one number, three letters, and three numbers since 1980, are projected to reach their limit in 2026. The new sequence will be three numerals, followed by three letters, and one numeral (e.g., "000AAA0"). The accelerated rate of new vehicle registrations, influenced by fears of increased car prices due to Trump's tariffs, has contributed to the earlier-than-expected exhaustion of the current sequence.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has reversed a Biden administration policy, now allowing federal authorities to seek reporters' phone records and compel their testimony in leak investigations. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the change is necessary to safeguard classified information. First Amendment advocates have expressed concerns that this policy could stifle journalism and limit the press's ability to report on government activities.</p>

          <h2>Senators Request Ethics Probe into Trump's Meme Coin Dinner</h2>

          <p>Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren are calling for an ethics investigation into President Donald Trump's private dinner with top investors in his $TRUMP meme coin, citing concerns about potential "pay to play" corruption. The value of the coin surged after the announcement, raising questions about Trump and his family personally profiting from political influence. The senators are concerned about the risk of selling presidential access to individuals or entities with vested interests in federal action. With the White House controlled by Republicans, the letter is likely to fall on deaf ears.</p>
