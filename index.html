          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary halt to the deportation of Venezuelan men held in a detention center in northern Texas, acting on an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were preparing to deport the men under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, accusing them of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. This action prevents their removal until further court orders, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting. The ACLU has sued to block deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of two Venezuelans held in the Texas detention center. </p>

            <p>Economists warn that President Trump's proposed tariffs on imports could lead to corporate profiteering, with companies using the tariffs as an excuse to raise prices beyond what is necessary to cover the additional costs. This 'greedflation' could result in consumers paying significantly more for goods, even those not directly affected by tariffs. Analysis suggests that US consumers could face an average effective tariff rate of 28%, potentially increasing consumer prices by 3%, with experts divided along political lines on whether the tariffs will help or hurt the economy.

It details a 2019 incident where police identified Garcia as an MS-13 member based on clothing and information from a 'proven and reliable source'. Garcia's lawyers argue that he has never lived in New York, where the identified clique is based, and was granted a 'withholding of removal' order due to fear of persecution by a rival gang.</p>

            <p>President Trump stated that the US may cease brokering Russia-Ukraine peace talks if no progress is made soon, echoing Secretary of State Marco Rubio's warning. Trump said he wants a deal done 'quickly' and will 'take a pass' if either party makes it 'very difficult'. These comments followed news of ongoing Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities and US efforts to finalize a minerals deal with Ukraine, potentially including control of its energy infrastructure. Vice President Vance expressed optimism about ending the war after meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.</p>

            <p>A Somali film warning against clan revenge killings has taken a tragic turn as one of its actors, Guudey Mohamed Geedi, was shot dead in a family feud. The short film, 'Clan Vengeance,' sought to highlight the futility of vendettas between rival clans. Geedi played a character who tried to stop a tea shop owner from being killed. His murder highlights the pervasive issue of clan-related violence in Somalia, where such killings often go uninvestigated.</p>

            <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has granted clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation. Bin, a former gang member sentenced in 2008, became a minister in prison and had his sentence reduced. Newsom's pardon aims to prevent Bin's deportation, following previous efforts to use clemency powers to aid immigrants. Newsom also issued a posthumous pardon to Sgt. Richard Allen Penry, a Vietnam War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient.</p>

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to further investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by refusing to turn around two flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members who were sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador last month. The order does not rule in either way on the merits of Boasberg’s inquiry, however, and merely gives the petitioners in the case a deadline of April 23 by 5 p.m. to file their reply to the government.</p>

            <p>An expert discusses why the US bond market is being closely watched. Governments sell bonds to raise money for public spending and in return they pay interest. Recently, in an extremely rare move the rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell. The volatility suggests investors were losing confidence in the world's biggest economy. The bond market reaction has led to comparisons with former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's infamous mini-Budget of September 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The BBC analyzes the Supreme Court's ruling that legally defines 'woman' as a biological woman. The judgment aims to provide clarity on the term for the Equality Act, excluding biological males even with gender recognition certificates from women-only spaces. Reactions range from 'victory for common sense' to 'devastating,' reflecting the polarized views on transgender rights. The ruling's practical implications will be outlined in detailed guidance, addressing concerns about privacy, safety, and discrimination.</p>
