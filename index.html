          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is currently tracking northeast in the open Atlantic Ocean. As of Sunday morning, it was located 295 miles east-southeast of Bermuda with 40 mph winds, moving north-northeast at 15 mph. Forecasters anticipate the storm will intensify into a hurricane by Monday before gradually weakening on Tuesday, with its path expected to remain safely over subtropical waters. This development follows Hurricane Erin, which earlier reached Category 5 status, contributing to an Atlantic hurricane season that NOAA predicted would be above normal, with up to 18 named storms and five to nine hurricanes. The ongoing activity underscores the region's vulnerability to severe weather events and the importance of continuous monitoring.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore has labeled President Trump's rhetoric on crime as "purely performative," firmly rejecting the president's offer to deploy federal troops to Baltimore. Moore argued that the administration's approach, which included federalizing D.C.'s police and deploying the National Guard there, is "not scalable," "unsustainable," and "unconstitutional" for other major American cities. He highlighted Baltimore's significant 22% decrease in homicides in 2025, attributing it to state investments in law enforcement and community efforts, and invited Trump to a public safety walk to discuss effective strategies. The governor emphasized that addressing crime requires proper resource allocation and proven tactics, not "theatrics" or "1980s scare tactics" from the Oval Office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Renewable energy executives are warning that President Trump's aggressive stance against solar and wind projects, including his stated intent to block federal permits, threatens to trigger a national power supply crunch and significantly increase electricity prices for consumers. Industry leaders report that rising costs from tariffs and regulatory uncertainty are already causing market instability and leading to reduced investment plans. They argue that hindering renewable growth will exacerbate a looming power shortage, especially as demand from AI data centers surges, and that alternative energy sources cannot be deployed rapidly enough. The Trump administration, however, prioritizes oil, gas, and nuclear power, dismissing the renewable sector's concerns as a reaction to ending "Biden's Green New Scam subsidies."</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes have hit Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in retaliation for Houthi missile attacks towards Israel, reportedly killing at least two people and injuring 35. Simultaneously, relatives of Israeli hostages held in Gaza gathered outside ministers' homes, urgently demanding a ceasefire deal to secure the release of the remaining 50 captives, 20 of whom Israel estimates are still alive. This comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greenlit a plan to take over Gaza City. The conflict also saw a Palestinian cameraman killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza near the Zikim goods crossing, sparking further condemnation from the Palestinian Journalists' Association regarding the "ongoing Israeli campaign against journalists."</p>

          <p>Forensic analysis of Bryan Kohberger's phone activity indicates he panicked upon seeing news about a white Hyundai Elantra, the suspect vehicle in the Idaho student murders, just hours before his arrest. According to digital forensics experts, Kohberger immediately searched for "wiretap" and "psychopaths paranoid," read articles about the vehicle, visited the Moscow Police Department website, and looked into buying a new car and detailing his current one. This behavior, described as "not normal," suggests he was scrambling as police closed in. Kohberger later pleaded guilty to the murders of Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin, receiving four consecutive life sentences.</p>

          <p>Chicago political leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson and Governor JB Pritzker, have strongly condemned President Trump's suggestion to deploy National Guard troops to the city to combat crime. Mayor Johnson labeled the approach "uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound," warning it could "inflame tensions" and violate the Constitution, while highlighting a significant drop in Chicago's violent crime rates, including a 30% reduction in homicides. Governor Pritzker called Trump's threat a "test of the limits of his power and a trial run for a police state," asserting that Illinois had not requested federal intervention and that no emergency warrants such a deployment. This mirrors similar rejections from other "Blue States" regarding Trump's federalization of the D.C. police and deployment of the National Guard there.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo has vehemently dismissed speculation of his resignation as "absurd," yet he could not guarantee his continued tenure beyond the summer transfer window. His future is clouded by a strained relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis, primarily stemming from disagreements over the club's transfer activity. Despite having led Forest to their highest Premier League position in decades and enjoying strong fan support, Nuno expressed dissatisfaction with the summer signings, emphasizing the need for a new goalkeeper and two full-backs. Football experts suggest that Nuno's public questioning of the owner's decisions puts him in a precarious position, making a resolution favorable to the manager appear unlikely in this internal power struggle.</p>

These AI-powered tools combine vast public and private data to track and target individuals, posing significant threats to First and Fourth Amendment rights through mass surveillance and warrantless data seizures.

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that the UK faces an "acute challenge" from weak underlying economic growth and a post-pandemic decline in its workforce. Speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Bailey highlighted a rise in long-term sickness and a significant drop in young people working as key factors, exacerbating issues from an aging population. He emphasized the urgent need to boost economic productivity, noting that the UK's labor market participation rate for 16-64 year olds is lower than other advanced economies, with mental health being a primary reason for inactivity. These factors contribute to concerns that Britain's high inflation rate may be slow to return to its 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of sentencing rules, which could see individuals convicted of crimes barred from pubs and sports matches, alongside driving and travel bans. This legislation, expected next month, aims to deter crime and ease prison overcrowding by restricting short prison sentences and introducing early release schemes for well-behaved inmates, inspired by US models. While Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood ruled out early release for serious offenders, the proposals have raised concerns among former judges and hospitality sectors about implementation and funding.

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of its asylum appeals system to reduce its heavy reliance on hotels for housing asylum seekers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the establishment of a new body with independent adjudicators to expedite appeal hearings, which currently take over a year to process 51,000 cases, costing taxpayers for accommodation. While initial asylum decisions have reportedly sped up, critics, including the Refugee Council, argue that reducing mistakes in initial decisions is paramount, as nearly half of original decisions are overturned on appeal. These plans emerge amid rising public frustration and protests across the UK regarding asylum seeker housing, with the government committed to closing all asylum hotels in a "properly managed way."</p>

The verses vividly describe a yearning for a "golden silence" where the clamor of talk and sound gracefully fades, yet simultaneously acknowledge the "perversely sentient" and often "devilishly wrong" nature of language. The speaker reflects on the nightly hope that speech itself might ultimately reveal its "one true alphabet," leading to a profound, burning understanding. Ultimately, the poem suggests a transformative shift towards a "plateau of nested changes," seeking an "irresistible" inner renewal where letters of gold, perhaps anew, guide the poem's heartfelt core.</p>

Despite Parsons' back tightness, for which an MRI was "pretty clean," he is expected to be ready for the season opener, while the team considers using a franchise tag to retain him beyond his current contract in 2026 and 2027.</p>

          <p>The annual Notting Hill Carnival transformed the streets of west London with vibrant colors and sounds for its first day, featuring the children's parade and drawing over a million attendees. The festivities began with J'ouvert, where revelers were awash in bright paint and powder, followed by parades with musicians, dancers in elaborate costumes, and numerous food and drink stalls serving jerk chicken and rum punch. Towering sound systems played reggae, dub, and drum and bass, creating an atmosphere of unity and celebration of Caribbean culture, with EastEnders star Rudolph Walker and TV chef Big Zuu among those enjoying the event. The carnival also included a poignant 72-second silence to commemorate the 72 lives lost in the Grenfell Tower fire and others who have died.</p>

          <p>Biographer Michael Wolff has revealed that during his first administration, President Donald Trump reportedly had confrontations with the Secret Service over his personal sleeping habits. According to Wolff, Trump insisted on installing a lock on his bedroom door, a request the Secret Service denied and subsequently removed the lock, citing crucial security protocols that require their unimpeded access to the president. This particular incident is not new, with similar accounts of Trump's desire for a locked bedroom door having emerged in 2019. Wolff also mentioned a separate, unspecified "fit" Trump had when White House domestic staff changed his sheets, further highlighting the president's reportedly unusual preferences regarding his private living arrangements and interactions with staff.</p>

          <p>Former CIA Director and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin is unequivocally "the obstacle to peace" in Ukraine, expressing significant doubt about any imminent meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Petraeus urged the U.S. to provide more aid and lift restrictions on certain weapons, such as long-range missiles, to fundamentally change the war's dynamics, citing a Wall Street Journal report that the Pentagon is currently blocking Ukraine's use of US-made ATACMS against Russian targets. He also voiced strong concern over the Trump administration's unprecedented firing or reassignment of 16 top military officers, including the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, just weeks after a report contradicted Trump's assertions about Iran's nuclear sites.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's military announced it killed 35 jihadists in a series of air strikes near its north-eastern border with Cameroon and rescued 76 kidnapping victims, including women and children, in north-western Katsina state. The air strikes targeted four areas to thwart jihadist attacks on ground troops, while the rescue operation followed an assault in Unguwan Mantau that killed 50 people and abducted 60. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to dismantle criminal networks, as Nigeria battles jihadist groups like Boko Haram and ISWAP, and violent criminal gangs, which have caused over 35,000 deaths and two million displacements. A group of prominent Nigerians has raised concerns about "war-time levels of slaughter" despite the country officially being at peace, calling for a Presidential Task Force.</p>

Flights have been canceled, and boats ordered ashore in anticipation of the severe storm, which is forecast to bring winds up to 200km/h, 300-400mm of rainfall, and storm surges of 2-4m (6.6-13ft). Soldiers have been deployed to assist with evacuations, and officials have warned residents not to go outdoors after Sunday afternoon.

Many survivors suffered severe chemical burns from the mix of seawater and petrol. This tragedy highlights the perilous journey migrants face, with over 700 deaths this year, and underscores UN accusations against the EU-funded Libyan Coast Guard for alleged complicity in human trafficking and inhumane treatment.</p>

Using an old utility trailer as a foundation, the month-long project prioritized efficiency, featuring a compact AC/heating unit, a tilting bed in a vaulted loft, and a kitchen area with a mini-fridge and folding faucet. The entire house, including an outdoor shower, is powered by roof-mounted solar panels.

          <p>US nuclear sanctions against China, including the blacklisting of China General Nuclear Power Group and equipment license suspensions, have reportedly backfired, inadvertently hindering the West's own atomic energy revival. Despite these stringent measures, China has achieved "awe-inspiring" progress and "incredible" industrial scale in its nuclear capabilities. As the US and Europe grapple with costly delays and atrophied supply chains, China's sanctioned industry has become an unattainable benchmark of efficiency. The article suggests that China's exclusion from global nuclear cooperation threatens to stall Western efforts to expand atomic energy, emphasizing the need for balance between international collaboration and local participation in the supply chain.

Although the top prize went unclaimed, Saturday's drawing did produce several significant winners, including two $1 million tickets sold in Maine and Massachusetts, and one $2 million ticket in South Dakota due to the Power Play option. This marks the 36th consecutive round without a grand prize winner since May 31, driving the jackpot to its current impressive size and generating considerable public interest.</p>
