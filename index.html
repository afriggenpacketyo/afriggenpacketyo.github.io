          <p>A concrete wall now splits the Armenian village of Kirants as part of a new border demarcation with Azerbaijan, following the latter's takeover of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. This division has plunged the community into an economic and emotional crisis, as many farmers have lost access to their land. While the wall has brought a fragile peace and an end to gunfire, villagers remain anxious about the future and mourn the loss of what they consider their homeland, reflecting the complex trade-offs between security and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships in Tokyo have been marked by grueling conditions, with athletes battling temperatures over 30°C and stifling humidity. Despite the challenges, the event represents a significant moment for Japan, which celebrated its first medal and welcomed enthusiastic crowds, a stark contrast to the spectator-less 2020 Olympics. Organizers have adjusted start times for some events due to health concerns, but the heat remains a dominant factor as the nine-day competition continues.</p>

Although Mater Dei mounted a massive 29-point comeback in the third quarter to briefly take the lead, Centennial rallied in the fourth to clinch the historic victory, marking Mater Dei's first loss to a Southern Section team other than St. John Bosco in a decade.</p>

          <p>Line dancing is shedding its old-fashioned image and becoming a popular trend among younger generations, largely fueled by TikTok crazes and the mainstream success of country-pop artists like Sabrina Carpenter. The dance style, once associated mainly with older crowds in village halls, is now drawing teenagers and young adults to classes across the UK. Instructors and participants note that the genre has diversified, with routines set to a wide range of music, making it more accessible and breaking down long-held stereotypes.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Connects Jeffrey Epstein's 'Birthday Book' to a Pre-Feminist Culture of Sexual Exploitation</h2>

          <p>In this commentary, Rebecca Solnit argues that the recently released Jeffrey Epstein birthday album is a relic of a pre-feminist era where the sexual exploitation of underage girls was normalized in mainstream culture. The article cites examples from 1970s and 80s films, music, and media that portrayed relationships between adult men and teenage girls as acceptable. Solnit credits the feminist movement with fundamentally shifting public perception by insisting on consent, exposing widespread abuse, and denormalizing patriarchal exploitation.</p>

          <p>A fierce rivalry between tech giants Alibaba and Meituan is transforming China's retail sector through an 'instant commerce' war. This competition has led to significant consumer subsidies and expanded on-demand delivery services from just meals to a wide array of goods, including high-value items like Apple's new iPhones. The battle for market dominance is pushing providers to become more efficient and is fundamentally changing the landscape for both online platforms and traditional brick-and-mortar stores across the country.</p>

          <p>Officials in the UK Prime Minister's office and the Foreign Office were reportedly aware of supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly defended him. Mandelson was subsequently dismissed as ambassador to the US after the emails, which revealed a much closer relationship than previously disclosed, were published. The revelation has intensified political pressure on Starmer over his handling of the appointment and the associated vetting process.</p>

While the release is seen as a positive step, Tsikhanouskaya highlighted that it was not true freedom, as many were exiled to Lithuania against their will. She noted that about half of the prisoners were nearing the end of their sentences and would have preferred to remain in Belarus with their families.</p>

          <p>Missouri's state legislature has passed a new congressional redistricting plan that aims to create an additional Republican-leaning House seat by dividing the Kansas City area. The move, backed by former President Donald Trump, is part of a broader mid-decade Republican strategy to strengthen their slim majority in the U.S. House. The new map, which now awaits the governor's signature, was immediately challenged in court by opponents who argue it is an unconstitutional and racially-motivated gerrymander.</p>
