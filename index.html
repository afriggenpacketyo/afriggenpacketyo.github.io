          <p>Ichiro Suzuki became the first Japanese player inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving nearly unanimous support from voters. He was enshrined alongside dominant pitcher CC Sabathia and elite closer Billy Wagner in a ceremony at Cooperstown. Suzuki, known for his unique hitting style and record-breaking career, delivered a speech reflecting on his journey and the connection between Japanese and American baseball. The event also posthumously honored Dave Parker and Dick Allen, celebrating a diverse class of baseball legends.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have finalized a trade agreement, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods, which is half the rate previously threatened by the US. The deal, announced after talks in Scotland, also includes a commitment from the EU to purchase $750 billion in US energy products and invest $600 billion in the American economy. While hailed as a move to bring stability, some contentious points remain, such as a 50% tariff on steel and potential diplomatic issues for Ireland. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The RSPCA is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK amid concerns over imported pets. An investigation found that thousands of dogs are brought from countries like Romania and Ukraine with minimal vetting, leading to issues for new owners, including aggressive behavior and the spread of diseases like Brucella canis. The charity describes the current system as a "Deliveroo for dogs," which places a significant strain on UK shelters that have to manage the fallout from poorly matched and unhealthy animals.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced daily 10-hour "tactical pauses" in specific areas of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to reach the population amid a severe hunger crisis. This measure comes as international pressure mounts over the dire conditions, with the UN warning of famine and recent reports of deaths from malnutrition. While aid agencies welcomed the step, they reiterated that a full ceasefire is necessary to address the widespread suffering adequately. The pauses are localized and do not signify an end to Israel's broader military operations against Hamas in other parts of the territory.</p>

The 26-year-old finished more than four minutes ahead of his main rival, two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard.

Instead of a loud "Take Action" alarm, which could have provided up to 35 seconds of warning, most users received a lower-level "Be Aware" notification or no alert at all. The company stated that "limitations to the detection algorithms" were to blame and has since updated the system, but faces criticism for the delay in disclosing the failure's extent.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Johns Hopkins professor Yuen Yuen Ang discusses the concept of turning China's current "polycrisis" into a "polytunity" through adaptive strategies. Ang, a prominent scholar on China's political economy, also addresses the decline in American expertise on the country. She draws a historical parallel to the era of US-China normalization, when pioneers like her "grand teacher" Michel Oksenberg purposefully invested in building a deep understanding of China within the US. This contrasts with the current environment, where fewer Americans are studying in China, potentially hindering nuanced policy and public discourse.</p>

          <p>A hotshot firefighter, Renzo Reginato, was critically injured after being struck by a falling tree while fighting the Orleans Complex fire in Northern California. Reginato, a member of the Cleveland National Forest's elite crew, suffered a traumatic spinal injury and broken bones, requiring emergency surgery.

The illness, which causes symptoms like nausea and diarrhea, led some athletes, including Olympians Torri Huske and Claire Weinstein, to miss individual events over the weekend. Despite the health challenges, the team has shown resilience, with both the men's and women's 4x100m freestyle relay teams securing medals.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Greater Bay Area, encompassing Hong Kong and neighboring cities, has a prime opportunity to become a global model for sustainable tourism. Policymakers are already investing in green infrastructure, such as Hong Kong's new electric ferry and Shenzhen's fully electrified public transport fleet. The author contends that to capitalize on this, the region must move beyond just hardware and develop coordinated systems and partnerships. This would create a low-carbon tourism corridor that aligns with the growing environmental consciousness of modern travelers.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with US President Donald Trump in Scotland, with discussions expected to focus on the war in Gaza and transatlantic trade. Starmer is anticipated to press for further action to secure a ceasefire in the Middle East, navigating a delicate diplomatic position between the US and European allies who have taken a more critical stance on Israel. The meeting will also likely cover the recent US-UK trade deal, with Starmer seeking to lower remaining tariffs on key imports like steel.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the new US-EU trade agreement suggests both sides can claim a victory, though the ultimate impact will depend on the fine print. For the EU, the 15% tariff is better than the threatened 30%, while the US secures significant investment commitments and tariff revenue. The deal showcases President Trump's aggressive, personal negotiating style and sets a precedent for ongoing talks with other major partners, including China. The article notes that while the agreement provides stability, the EU's gains are less clear than those for the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Dustin May's future with the team is in question as the MLB trade deadline approaches. May, who is in his final year before free agency, has had an inconsistent season following his return from elbow surgery. His recent start against the Boston Red Sox, a 4-3 loss, exemplified his struggles, as he pitched well for several innings before a three-run fifth inning proved decisive. With the Dodgers needing to make room in their rotation for a returning player, May's performance and trade value are under intense scrutiny.</p>
