          <p>Charles B. Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has passed away at the age of 94. Rangel, a Harlem mainstay, served in Congress from 1970 to 2016, becoming the ninth-longest continuously serving member of the House. He played a crucial role in persuading Hillary Clinton to run for Senate in New York and was known for his instrumental work on the Ways and Means Committee, though his tenure was marked by an ethics censure in 2010. The article details his early life, military service, and political career, highlighting his influence and the controversies he faced. The impact of his legacy is significant, and his passing marks the end of an era for Harlem's political landscape.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley achieved his first French Open victory by defeating Swiss veteran Stan Wawrinka in straight sets. Fearnley, making his Roland Garros debut, won 7-6 (8-6), 6-3, 6-2, against the 2015 champion, who is currently ranked 138th in the world. The Scot, who was only three years old when Wawrinka debuted at the French Open in 2005, secured the win in just over two hours. This marks a significant milestone for Fearnley, who had never played an ATP Tour match on clay before this year, and signals a passing of the torch moment in the tournament.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the U.S., escalating his attacks on the Ivy League institution. This threat follows previous actions to block Harvard from enrolling international students and freeze billions in federal funding, citing insufficient efforts to address anti-semitism on campus. Harvard has filed lawsuits in response, alleging unlawful retaliation against its academic independence. The White House has also targeted other universities, withdrawing federal funding from Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Cornell University, in an effort to enforce compliance with the Trump administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>While the official unemployment rate remains low, a report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests a different picture, with a "true rate" of unemployment at 24.3% in April. This measure includes unemployed workers, those seeking full-time work but unable to find it, and individuals in poverty-wage jobs. LISEP argues that the official rate presents an incomplete view by counting part-time or poorly paid work as equal to full-time employment. The article highlights disparities among racial and gender groups, with Hispanic, Black, and women workers facing higher rates of functional unemployment, indicating a struggle to maintain a minimal quality of life.</p>

The pan-European Stoxx 600 provisionally ended up 1%, with all sectors showing positive gains, and European autos stocks rebounded significantly. German carmakers saw broad gains, with BMW and Mercedes-Benz rising, while Zealand Pharma climbed to the top of the Stoxx 600 after Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an overweight position on the stock. This positive market reaction followed Trump's initial call for the tariffs and his subsequent agreement to delay them after a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest a potential vision of a world order where the United States, China, and Russia each dominate their respective spheres of influence. This approach involves potential deals with Russia to normalize commerce and efforts to limit the fallout from the global trade war with China. Critics say Trump's actions reflect a desire to return to a 19th-century style of imperial rule, while some analysts caution against attributing a strategic vision to his actions. The article highlights Trump's pursuit of influence in the Western Hemisphere and the challenges he faces in establishing spheres of influence in the post-imperial age.</p>

The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index, is due out Friday, with economists lowering forecasts after cooler CPI and PPI reports. Nvidia's earnings on Wednesday night are highly anticipated, with guidance being a key driver of stock reaction amid concerns about the Trump administration's China AI chip ban. Salesforce earnings will provide updates on AI product adoption, and Costco's earnings will offer insights into the retailer's performance amid tariff concerns. (not investment advice)</p>
