          <p>Cassie Ventura faced a rigorous six-hour cross-examination on day eight of Sean "Diddy" Combs' sexual assault trial, with defense attorneys using archived text messages to challenge her credibility. The defense aimed to portray Ventura as a willing participant in Combs' lifestyle, including drug-fueled orgies, arguing she was not a victim of sexual assault or racketeering. Ventura acknowledged loving Combs for over a decade and hoping to build a life with him, while maintaining that his personality grew violent and coercive over time. The trial continues with concerns over Ventura's pregnancy nearing term.</p>

The FDA has already requested more clinical data from Novavax for its COVID vaccine, and officials are questioning the need for COVID vaccines for children under 12.

          <p>Meta has reportedly delayed the release of its latest artificial intelligence model, known as “Behemoth,” raising concerns among employees about the effectiveness and direction of the company’s massive AI investments. Engineers have struggled to improve the large-language model’s performance compared to earlier versions in the Llama model family. Initially set for an April debut, Behemoth’s launch was pushed to June and potentially has been postponed until at least the fall. The company now faces increasing pressure to demonstrate meaningful progress with Behemoth and signal to Wall Street it can follow through with a return-on-investment.</p>
