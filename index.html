Jeffries also stated that Mamdani would need to clarify his positions on Israel and antisemitism, calling some of his past rhetoric unacceptable.

          <p>A massive spending package championed by President Trump narrowly passed a key procedural hurdle in the Senate following a dramatic late-night session. The motion to proceed passed 51-49 after several Republican holdouts eventually voted in favor, avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The bill, which faces criticism over its potential $3.9 trillion addition to the national debt, now moves to a final Senate vote. It must also be re-approved by the House, where it faces potential opposition, before a self-imposed July 4th deadline.</p>

          <p>This op-ed argues that the United States is critically vulnerable due to its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are essential for modern technology and defense systems. The author contends that despite years of awareness, the U.S. has failed to build a secure, independent supply chain, leaving it exposed to Chinese economic leverage and potential disruption. Recent Chinese export controls and a temporary trade reprieve are presented as insufficient solutions that highlight the urgency of the situation. The article calls for a long-term, unified national strategy to treat critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to dismantle federal energy-efficiency standards, including the popular Energy Star program. President Trump has issued directives aimed at eliminating regulations for home appliances, which he claims drive up costs and reduce quality. The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to end the Energy Star labeling initiative, a voluntary program that helps consumers identify energy-efficient products. Consumer groups and some manufacturers warn that this could lead to higher utility bills and remove a trusted guide for shoppers, creating a 'buyer beware' market for appliances.</p>

          <p>The recently designated SÃ¡ttÃ­tla Highlands national monument in northern California faces an uncertain future following threats from Donald Trump to undo the protection. The nearly 230,000-acre area, which is sacred to the Pit River Tribe and vital for water resources, was protected by President Biden in January. However, Trump has signaled his intent to roll back this and other monument designations to open the lands for economic development, a move that legal experts say is questionable but could lead to a significant court battle. The tribe and environmental advocates, who fought for decades to protect the land, are now preparing for a potential new fight.</p>

In a social media post, Trump accused Tillis of grandstanding and making a 'BIG MISTAKE,' stating he would meet with potential primary candidates.

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus examines the life and influence of William F. Buckley Jr., the founder of the National Review and a pivotal figure in the American conservative movement. The book, 'Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America,' argues that Buckley created the framework for modern cultural politics and paved the way for figures from Barry Goldwater to Donald Trump. Tanenhaus suggests Buckley's intellectual and celebrity status helped make conservatism a dominant force in the Republican Party. The biography explores his controversial stances, including his opposition to civil rights legislation, and his role in elevating the political careers of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had mishandled the rollout and that concerns raised by over 120 backbenchers led to a strengthened plan. The changes include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit rises with inflation. Rebel MPs expressed satisfaction with the U-turn, indicating they will now support the bill, which aims to reduce the nation's welfare spending.</p>

Researchers tested nearly 200 products in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Cameroon, finding that approximately 17% had incorrect levels of active ingredients. Such defects can lead to treatment failure and disease progression for patients relying on these vital medications. The findings highlight a critical issue in pharmaceutical regulation and supply chain integrity on the continent, where inadequate oversight and the high cost of medicine drive patients toward less reliable sources.</p>

          <p>A collection of letters to the editor from the Des Moines Register shows readers debating a recent column about a study suggesting conservatives report higher levels of happiness than liberals. One writer agrees, linking liberal unhappiness to frequent anger, while another reader offers a different perspective, suggesting that conservative happiness might stem from a lack of concern for complex societal problems. Other letters in the collection touch on different political issues, including tax fairness, the environmental impact of industrial agriculture, and the importance of protecting female-only sports under Title IX, reflecting a diverse range of reader opinions.</p>

          <p>Director James Gunn and actor David Corenswet are aiming for a more 'down-to-Earth' portrayal of Superman in the upcoming film, the first feature from the newly branded DC Studios. Gunn explains that his version of the character is not indestructible and is depicted as more vulnerable, drawing inspiration from the challenges of adopting a difficult dog. Corenswet, who follows in the footsteps of Christopher Reeve, emphasizes his desire to embody the character's loneliness and his desperate wish to be part of humanity. The film seeks to present a hero who stands for goodness and kindness in a world filled with meanness.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is alerting Americans to a 'brushing' scam where people receive unsolicited packages containing low-value items they did not order. This scheme is used by third-party online sellers to post fake 'verified' reviews in the recipient's name to boost their product ratings. While receiving a free item may seem harmless, the USPS warns it's a major red flag that your personal information, including your name and address, has been compromised.

          <p>A psychologist who studies couples suggests that answering 'no' to four specific questions may indicate unrecognized unhappiness in a relationship. These questions probe whether partners feel like a team during conflicts, can be their authentic selves, are genuinely curious about each other's inner worlds, and take accountability for their mistakes. The article argues that while many know the components of a healthy relationship, they often don't recognize what they look like in practice. A negative response to these points could suggest a relationship is running on autopilot, lacking intimacy, or burdened by unresolved resentment.</p>

Through personal anecdotes and expert interviews, it reveals how practices like endless phone trees, dropped calls, and confusing procedures are often by design, aimed at discouraging customers from seeking refunds, canceling services, or resolving issues. This weaponized inefficiency saves companies money but leads to widespread consumer rage and a sense of powerlessness.

          <h2>Analysis: Liberal Media Bubble Persists on Youth Gender Medicine Despite Shifting Evidence</h2>

          <p>This analysis argues that many liberals are caught in a 'misinformation bubble' regarding youth gender medicine, clinging to claims that are not supported by evidence and have been conceded by top advocates. The article points to the 'transition or suicide' narrative, which an ACLU lawyer admitted in court lacks evidence for completed suicides, as a key 'zombie fact.' It also highlights how organizations like WPATH have downplayed internal doubts and weak evidence for their treatment guidelines due to political pressure. The author suggests this polarization prevents an honest appraisal of the complex issue, unlike in Europe where medical bodies have urged more caution.</p>

          <p>According to sources, China is planning to invite U.S. President Donald Trump to a military parade in Beijing on September 3rd to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. This comes as the U.S. has reportedly proposed a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping during the same month. If either visit occurs, it would mark the first in-person meeting between the two leaders since Trump's return to office. The potential presence of Trump alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at the parade could create a complex diplomatic situation for U.S. allies, particularly Japan.</p>

          <h2>A Federal Employee's Battle with Cancer Intersects with an Agency's Fight for Survival</h2>

          <p>This article tells the story of Anne Romatowski, an employee at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), who was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer on the same day she was fired as part of the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the agency. The narrative intertwines her personal health crisisâ€”undergoing chemotherapy while navigating job loss and insurance uncertaintyâ€”with the CFPB's legal and existential battle against an administration determined to eliminate it. Romatowski was reinstated twice by court order, only to continue working in a hollowed-out agency, highlighting the human cost of the political war on the federal bureaucracy.</p>
