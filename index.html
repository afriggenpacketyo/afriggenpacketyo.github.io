          <p>This article explores the challenges and potential of public transport to replace cars in cities. Despite efforts to make public transport more appealing, psychological factors like the desire for safety and comfort often favor car ownership. Cities are experimenting with strategies like free public transport, designated bus lanes, and disincentivizing car ownership through levies and redesigned infrastructure. The article highlights the importance of first and last-mile connectivity and improving the quality of information and ticketing for public transport users.</p>
