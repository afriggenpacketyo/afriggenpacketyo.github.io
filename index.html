          <p>Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, is raising alarms about the prevalence of internet fraud, particularly scams involving cryptocurrency and AI that have used his image. He has been engaged in a five-year lawsuit against YouTube after his likeness was used in a bitcoin scam that defrauded users of their savings. Wozniak's legal efforts have been complicated by Section 230, a federal law that shields online platforms from liability for third-party content. He argues that tech companies are not doing enough to combat these crimes and that the internet's initial promise has been exploited by business models focused on user tracking.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, a summit aimed at ending the war in Ukraine and fulfilling a key campaign promise. The meeting was orchestrated through back-channel discussions led by real-estate executive Steve Witkoff, a close Trump ally, after the president grew frustrated with Putin's lack of compromise. European allies and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have expressed concern that Trump might concede Ukrainian territory, as Zelensky has not been invited to the bilateral talks at Putin's request.

However, critics like former SEC official Amanda Fischer warn of high volatility and the risk of scams, comparing the current enthusiasm to the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The report also notes that the Trump family's crypto ventures have generated significant revenue, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a couple from Ohio, saved $60,000 over five years to quit their jobs and move to Taiwan for a 13-month sabbatical with their young son.

During the career break, Jason focused on his mental and physical health, re-evaluating his career goals and realizing his family could be happier with a less demanding lifestyle. The couple's sabbatical also led to an unexpected joy, as they welcomed their second child, a daughter, before their planned return to the United States.</p>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is set in 18th-century England and centers on five mysterious sisters accused of witchcraft after they are rumored to transform into dogs. The story directly confronts the historical trope of femininity being perceived as a threat, exploring why women's bodies and behaviors are often feared. The narrative is told from the perspective of outsiders, creating a refracted view of the sisters and questioning why their strangeness incites such animosity. While the review notes the novel sometimes states its themes too directly, it praises its lush, violent prose and its fresh take on the persecution of women.</p>

          <h2>Article Explores Humanity's Negativity Bias and the Importance of Recognizing Progress</h2>

          <p>An article from Vox delves into why humans are so attuned to negative news, exploring the concept of "negativity bias." This psychological trait, an evolutionary adaptation for survival, now contributes to a media landscape and personal outlook dominated by doomscrolling and a focus on problems. The author argues that despite constant negative headlines, genuine progress is happening in areas like global public health and U.S. crime rates, but these stories are often overlooked. Embracing a "realistic optimism" by acknowledging these positive developments is presented as a necessary tool for building resilience and inspiring action to solve the world's problems.</p>

          <p>A schoolboy out for a run on a beach in Sanday, one of Scotland's Orkney Islands, discovered the wreckage of a 275-year-old ship. The ship's hull was exposed by a storm, and the local community rallied to preserve the 12-ton oak timbers. Researchers identified the vessel as the former HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy ship built in 1749 that was active during the American Revolution. It was later sold and repurposed as a whaling ship named the Earl of Chatham before sinking in the North Sea in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving the wreck.</p>

          <p>A fragment of a meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed by scientists and found to be older than our planet. Researchers at the University of Georgia determined the rock is a chondrite meteorite, formed approximately 4.56 billion years ago, about 20 million years before Earth. The fireball was witnessed by hundreds across the state in June before the fragments struck the house. The object, now named the McDonough meteorite, is the 27th recovered in Georgia, and scientists hope its analysis will contribute to understanding the threat of future asteroid impacts.</p>

          <p>A report from the Russian-occupied Luhansk region of Ukraine details the daily struggles faced by residents living under the new authorities. One resident describes a sharp decline in her standard of living, with rising food prices, limited job opportunities, and a reliance on her father's Ukrainian pension to survive. The article highlights widespread problems, including failing infrastructure, poor internet and mobile service, and a lack of medical professionals. Furthermore, residents face immense pressure to accept Russian citizenship to access essential services like healthcare, while also fearing that doing so will make them eligible for military conscription.</p>

          <p>Investigators in St. Paul, Minnesota, solved the murder of nurse Alexandra Pennig by focusing on a tiny piece of physical evidence. Pennig was found with a gunshot wound to the head in her bathroom, with her colleague Matthew Ecker claiming she had locked herself in and died by suicide. However, detectives discovered a small, round metal piece from the bathroom door's lock underneath Pennig's body. This finding contradicted Ecker's story, suggesting he had forcibly broken the door open before the shot was fired, leading to his conviction for second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has issued an apology after two blind women were left at a gate in New Orleans while their flight to Orlando was rebooked and departed without them. The airline had rebooked nearly all passengers onto an earlier flight from a different gate but failed to verbally notify the two women, Camille Tate and Sherri Brun, of the change. The pair ended up being flown to their destination on a private flight, but they have spoken out to advocate for improved communication protocols for passengers with disabilities. Southwest offered each woman a $100 voucher but stated they were not eligible for a refund.</p>

          <p>A sweeping legislative package signed by President Trump, which extends tax cuts and funds mass deportations while cutting safety net programs, is becoming a central issue for both parties during the August congressional recess. Democrats are highlighting the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid and the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies, arguing it will harm working families and benefit the wealthy. Republicans are defending the bill, promoting its tax relief for certain workers and stricter work requirements for benefit programs as fiscally responsible. The legislation's delayed implementation of major cuts is a key strategic point in the looming battle for the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Miami's historic Freedom Tower, which served as a processing center for over half a million Cuban refugees, is set to reopen with a new exhibition focused on their personal stories. Known to exiles as "el refugio" (the shelter), the building has been refurbished to recreate the spaces where new arrivals were medically checked and processed in the 1960s and 70s. The exhibition, "Libertad," uses technology and recorded testimonials to capture the emotional journeys of those who fled Fidel Castro's regime. The project aims to preserve the legacy of the tower as a symbol of hope and opportunity for generations of Cuban-Americans.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new legislative package to eliminate federal income tax on tips is being met with a mix of hope and confusion by service industry workers. The measure provides a deduction of up to $25,000 for tip income, but some workers feel it sounds "too good to be true," noting that key details about which occupations and gratuities qualify remain unclear. Experts clarify that the break is a deduction, not a complete exemption, meaning workers will still owe payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, as well as state income taxes. The IRS is expected to provide further guidance on the new rule.</p>

          <p>In a culture column, an Atlantic writer recommends the 1958 novel "The Rise of the Meritocracy" by British sociologist Michael Young. The book, which popularized the term "meritocracy," was intended as a satirical critique, envisioning a dystopian future where society is stratified by educational attainment rather than class. The story culminates in a populist rebellion against this new elite. The recommendation highlights the book's enduring relevance in today's society. The column also features the writer's other cultural favorites, including the TV show "The Bear" and the music of Bob Dylan.</p>

          <p>NASA has been directed by the Trump administration to place a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the moon by the end of the decade, a crucial step toward establishing a permanent human settlement. Solar power is insufficient for the long lunar nights, making nuclear energy essential for a sustainable base. The push is also framed as a national security issue, aimed at countering a planned joint Chinese-Russian lunar base that will feature a more powerful reactor. This renewed focus on the moon, with astronauts scheduled to return in 2027, could enable a new era of space exploration and scientific research.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses the dilemma of a person who wants to avoid animal products for ethical reasons but is struggling with a vegetarian diet due to health issues. The column suggests a pragmatic, "reducetarian" approach, which focuses on minimizing animal suffering rather than complete elimination, which may not be feasible for everyone. Recommendations include choosing pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products, eating larger animals like cows instead of many smaller ones like chickens, and opting for wild-caught fish. This framework allows individuals to balance their personal well-being with their moral commitment to animal welfare without adhering to an absolutist stance.</p>

          <p>In her new book "SLIP," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley shares her experience of living in the "middle place" of eating disorder recovery, a space between acute illness and complete wellness. Diagnosed with anorexia at 13, Tarpley spent years pursuing a perfectionist idea of full recovery, which often led to shame and secretive relapses. She argues that shifting to a mindset that accepts and normalizes slips has been crucial for her to live a full life while still striving for progress. The book combines memoir and research to examine this nuanced reality, challenging the all-or-nothing approach to recovery.</p>
