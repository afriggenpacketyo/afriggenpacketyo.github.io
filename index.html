            <p>The Supreme Court has instructed the Trump administration to assist in the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was wrongly deported to a mega-jail in El Salvador.

The court's decision clarifies that the government must facilitate Garcia's release from custody and ensure his case is handled properly. The case will now return to the trial court, with justices emphasizing deference to the executive branch in foreign affairs.</p>

            <p>Markets experienced further turmoil after a brief rally, driven by investor fears over ongoing uncertainty related to President Trump's tariff policies. The confirmation of 145% tariffs on Chinese imports led to market declines, despite positive news regarding inflation and the EU's suspension of retaliatory tariffs. Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen criticized Trump's economic policies, labeling them a "self-inflicted wound" on the economy. The market's volatility underscores the instability caused by the administration's trade war.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has partially sided against the Trump administration, ordering it to seek the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The court's decision was unanimous, even from justices typically aligned with Trump. The case raises concerns about the administration's potential defiance of court orders and its treatment of immigrants. The administration could either comply, defy the order, or make a token effort, creating significant risks for constitutional government.</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% in March, indicating progress in the Federal Reserve's efforts to bring inflation down to 2%. While prices fell slightly on a monthly basis, travel-related costs contributed to the decline. Experts note that the report may not fully reflect the impact of recent trade policy changes. Despite easing inflation, inflationary risks remain a threat, particularly with some of President Trump's tariffs still in place.
