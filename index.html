          <p>President Trump's abrupt announcement to increase steel tariffs from 25% to 50% has surprised markets, with analysts predicting inflationary pressure on U.S. domestic prices. According to CRU's Josh Spoores, the U.S. relies on steel imports, so this move will likely raise prices, while Europe could see redirected steel, potentially lowering prices for manufacturers. Rella Suskin from Morningstar noted that BMW had previously flagged a negative impact from existing tariffs and Citi analysts suggest Orsted could be negatively impacted due to the lack of a local offshore wind turbine supply chain in the U.S. Some manufacturers in Europe might benefit from building steel-intensive products at home and exporting them to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A decision coach who works with clients on major life choices, such as moving abroad or changing careers, suggests that prolonged deliberation can actually worsen decision-making. The coach notes that clients often spend excessive time mulling over options, leading to an unwieldy mass of details and increased awareness of potential sacrifices. This analysis paralysis drains energy and mental space, making life demonstrably worse, as clients become exhausted from constant overthinking. The coach advocates for a more streamlined approach to decision-making to avoid this common trap.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has identified Rayan Ait-Nouri as his top target to address the team's left-back position. The team has been without a specialist left-back since Benjamin Mendy's departure, with various players filling the role. While no agreement is currently in place for the 23-year-old Algerian international, sources express confidence that a deal will be reached. To ensure Ait-Nouri's availability for the Club World Cup group stage, City would need to finalize the transfer before June 10.</p>
