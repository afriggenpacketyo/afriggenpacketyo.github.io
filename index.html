          <h2>Proposed Medicaid Cuts Could Lead to Increased Deaths and Reduced Healthcare Access, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that proposed Republican Medicaid cuts, including work requirements and financing limits, could lead to significant healthcare coverage losses for millions of Americans. The study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, estimates that these cuts could result in thousands of additional deaths annually due to reduced access to preventive care and necessary medical services. Specifically, the research highlights potential declines in doctor visits, cholesterol screenings, and mammograms, disproportionately affecting low-income and minority populations. While the Senate is still debating the bill, hospitals are lobbying against the cuts, warning of devastating consequences for healthcare access and the creation of a true universal healthcare system. The potential consequences of these policy changes highlight the critical role of Medicaid in providing healthcare access for vulnerable populations. Optimism is tempered by the recognition that the bill's impact is uncertain and may be offset by individuals obtaining insurance through other means.</p>

          <p>The United States government is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to the whereabouts of Mahmood Habibi, an Afghan-American who worked for a telecommunications firm and was allegedly abducted in Kabul in 2022. According to the State Department, Habibi and his driver were detained by the Taliban government's intelligence service, along with 29 other employees, most of whom have since been released. The Taliban has denied taking Habibi into custody, but the U.S. considers him unjustly held. This announcement follows the release of two other Americans in January through an exchange mediated by Qatar, highlighting ongoing efforts to secure the release of American citizens detained in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Europe experienced a fifth consecutive month of decline in May, with a significant 27.9% year-over-year decrease, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). This drop is attributed to increasing competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles and brand damage. Auto giant BYD, for instance, registered nearly as many vehicles as Tesla in May after outselling Musk's company for the first time in April. Despite Tesla's efforts to revamp the Model Y, the company continues to face challenges in the European market, as its market share falls from 1.8% to 1.2%. Shares of Tesla are down more than 15% in the year to date.</p>

          <p>A cargo ship carrying approximately 3,000 new vehicles sank in the North Pacific Ocean off the coast of Alaska, weeks after a fire broke out on board. The crew had previously abandoned the ship due to their inability to extinguish the fire. The ship, named Morning Midas, contained about 350 metric tons of marine gas oil and 1,530 metric tons of very low sulfur fuel oil, raising concerns about potential pollution. Salvage crews and pollution control equipment are on site to monitor for any signs of environmental damage, and investigations are underway to determine the cause of the fire and prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

          <p>Thailand is moving to recriminalize recreational cannabis, reversing its 2022 decision to decriminalize the substance. The move comes after the government failed to implement a regulatory framework, leading to an unregulated market with numerous cannabis shops, particularly in tourist areas. The decision follows criticism of the government's handling of a border dispute and the withdrawal of a key party from the ruling coalition. The health ministry has issued an order banning recreational cannabis sales, requiring a doctor's prescription for legal purchases, which is expected to be published in the Royal Gazette soon, potentially impacting a $1 billion industry.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has dismissed an early Pentagon report suggesting that U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities only set back its program by a few months, asserting that the strikes resulted in "total obliteration." Trump insisted that Iran's nuclear program has been set back "basically decades," claiming it is "gone for years." This statement contradicts a preliminary analysis by the Defense Intelligence Agency and U.S. Central Command, which indicated limited damage and the relocation of enriched uranium stocks before the strikes. The report has sparked consternation among Trump's opponents, who argue that the recent fighting could have been avoided if Trump had not withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal during his first term.</p>

Campaigners are advocating for a more compassionate approach to debt collection, rather than the use of bailiffs.

          <p>Mortgage rates and demand are currently stuck in a holding pattern, showing little movement despite economic uncertainty and international conflicts. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages slightly increased to 6.88%, but has remained within a narrow range since early April. Applications for a mortgage to buy a home dropped slightly, but are still higher than the same week last year, although overall demand remains historically low. Applications to refinance a home loan rose, but small changes in volume make for big percentage moves.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-brokered cease-fire between Iran and Israel has brought a temporary halt to recent hostilities, but significant issues remain unresolved. While Israel demonstrated its intelligence capabilities by targeting Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists, it failed to fully destroy Iran's nuclear program. Iran's regime proved resilient despite facing significant challenges, but the conflict has exposed vulnerabilities and intensified internal political divisions. The cease-fire may lead to renewed talks on limiting Iran's nuclear program, but hard-liners within Iran continue to advocate for a more confrontational approach, potentially leading to further instability.</p>

Exemptions would be available for those with dependent children or qualifying circumstances, but some analysts warn that these exemptions may not always be effective.
