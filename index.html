          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's primary victory in the New York City mayoral race, Republican leaders are framing his win as evidence of the Democratic party's shift towards radical socialism. Figures like Donald Trump and RNC Chair Michael Whatley are using Mamdani's platform, which includes higher taxes on the wealthy and expanded public services, to energize their base. While some progressive Democrats support Mamdani, moderates have been more hesitant, and the situation has also ignited Islamophobic attacks against the candidate, which prominent Democrats have condemned. Mamdani maintains that his focus on economic inequality resonates with many New Yorkers.</p>

          <p>The Senate narrowly voted to advance a major Republican legislative package, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," after intense last-minute negotiations. A bloc of four conservative senators initially held out, demanding further deficit reduction and changes to Medicaid, but ultimately allowed the bill to proceed after securing promises for a future amendment vote. The process was fraught with tension, requiring a flipped vote from Senator Ron Johnson to avoid a tie. Following the vote, Democrats initiated a procedural delay by requesting the entire 1,000-page bill be read aloud, a process estimated to take over 15 hours.</p>

          <p>As England international Marc Guehi enters the final year of his Crystal Palace contract, Liverpool is reportedly a strong contender for his signature. The potential transfer hinges on several factors, including Crystal Palace's valuation, which was as high as Â£65 million last year, and whether Liverpool sees value in a deal estimated around Â£40-Â£45 million. Guehi's decision will also depend on his prospective role at Anfield, where he would compete with established defenders Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate. With the 2026 World Cup approaching, securing regular playing time will be crucial for his international aspirations.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay, especially among Gen Z and millennials, is raising economic concerns. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, are seen by some as a symptom of an economy where young people feel financially unstable. Economic commentator Kyla Scanlon notes that while BNPL isn't inherently bad, it encourages impulse spending and reflects a broader normalization of debt. Many young consumers use these services for small luxuries as a form of agency in an economy where major milestones like homeownership feel unattainable.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its flagship welfare reform bill to avert a large-scale backbench rebellion, according to Health Secretary Wes Streeting. After more than 120 Labour MPs threatened to vote against the initial plans, the government made key concessions, including limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only. Rebel MPs expressed satisfaction with the changes, which they believe protect nearly 400,000 disabled people, and now plan to support the bill. The episode has raised questions about the Prime Minister's ability to manage internal party dissent while pushing for welfare system reforms.</p>

The Sunday Times reported that Freeman, a former science minister, asked an environmental monitoring firm for input on questions related to its sector. This action potentially conflicts with advice from a government watchdog that he should not lobby on the company's behalf. Freeman denies any wrongdoing but stated he would accept the commissioner's judgment, while opposition parties have called for his suspension during the investigation.</p>

          <p>In a reflective essay, author V (formerly Eve Ensler) contemplates how to resist despair and take action in a political climate she describes as authoritarian and suffocating. She argues that survival depends on embracing dualityâ€”feeling pain without being immobilized by it and directing rage into purposeful action. The author points to the power of public demonstrations not just as acts of refusal but as community-building events that strengthen resolve. Drawing inspiration from activists in the Congo and the US, the piece advocates for building local networks of care and believing that creating a new, more humane world is possible.</p>

          <p>A music teacher with 21 years of service at a Catholic school in Metairie, Louisiana, was fired after his late husband's obituary revealed he was married to a man. The teacher stated his dismissal was due to a morality clause in his contract prohibiting conduct contrary to Catholic teachings, which do not recognize same-sex marriage. The firing has sparked outrage among school parents, who started a petition calling the decision unjust and praising the teacher.

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently operating without a confirmed or acting director, placing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in direct control. This situation grants him the authority to approve or reject vaccine recommendations, a power he has already used. Legal experts express concern over this power vacuum, especially given Kennedy's history of anti-vaccine activism and his recent dismissal of 17 independent vaccine advisers. The lack of clear leadership and conflicting statements from the administration about who is in charge could expose the agency's decisions to legal challenges.</p>

She also expresses a sense of betrayal by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose confirmation she supported, for his role in overturning abortion rights after emphasizing the importance of precedent.

Rising temperatures due to the climate crisis have allowed these aggressive ticks to spread from the Southeast to northern and western regions, potentially affecting millions. The number of alpha-gal cases has surged, with the CDC estimating up to 450,000 people may be affected, many without realizing the link between their symptoms and a tick bite.

The 'Tuesday Group' has been visiting Congress weekly since February, sharing their stories and pleading for help after losing their jobs, with over 59,000 federal employees terminated since Trump took office. While some Democrats offer encouragement, the group often faces rejection or indifference from Republican members of Congress.

Bartenders interviewed expressed that this habit is annoying and time-consuming, especially during busy periods, as it disrupts their workflow. While some young adults cite fiscal responsibility and a desire to monitor their spending as reasons for the practice, it also creates more transaction fees for bar owners. The behavior is part of a larger shift, with data showing that fewer young adults are consuming alcohol compared to previous generations.</p>

The comment highlights Cambodia's military relationship with China, which is a major supplier of its defense equipment. According to a former Chinese military instructor, China's policy is that weapon ownership and usage rights belong entirely to the recipient country.

          <p>Fifteen years after its initial public offering on June 29, 2010, Tesla's stock has seen a monumental increase, turning a $10,000 investment into nearly $3 million. The company has grown from a niche electric sportscar maker into the world's eighth most-valuable public company, largely driven by the mass-market success of its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. However, with recent sluggish sales and increased competition, CEO Elon Musk is now pivoting the company's future value proposition towards advancements in autonomous driving and humanoid robots. Despite this vision, the stock has underperformed in 2025 amid market skepticism and concerns over Musk's political activities. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's Chinese owner, Geely, was reportedly exploring options to move manufacturing of its Emira sportscar to the US, a decision that would threaten 1,300 jobs at its Norfolk factory. In a statement, Lotus insisted it has 'no plans to close the factory' and is exploring strategic options to enhance efficiency.

          <p>An opinion piece by Simon Tisdall argues that the recently agreed-upon ceasefire between Iran and Israel is extremely fragile and serves the political interests of leaders who benefit from perpetual conflict. The author suggests that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may use the perception of military success for political gain and is unlikely to cease actions against Iran. Meanwhile, Iran's regime may be pushed to secretly accelerate its nuclear program in response to the attacks. The article concludes that the intervention, driven by political posturing, has only inflamed regional problems rather than solving them.</p>

With the BLS forced to use more estimations due to reduced staffing, there is a risk that the inflation data for the crucial third quarter could be inaccurate.

          <p>The recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites reflects President Trump's evolving but consistent approach to military force, characterized by a preference for discrete, high-impact strikes over sustained campaigns. This 'One-and-Done' doctrine, as some analysts term it, was also seen in actions like the killing of Qassem Soleimani. Trump has grown more confident in his own military instincts and is surrounded by advisers less likely to challenge him. While the administration has framed the Iran attack as a decisive, singular action to 'obliterate' its nuclear program, it remains uncertain if one strike will be sufficient to achieve long-term goals.</p>

Despite being Iran's economic lifeline, China prioritized diplomacy and global economic stability over a strong defense of its ally, highlighting that its relationship with the West remains more critical. This muted response suggests that while the three nations share an antagonism towards the U.S., their strategic interests diverge significantly when faced with major military confrontation.

          <p>One hundred years after a devastating earthquake struck Santa Barbara, experts say its lessons on structural vulnerability remain relevant for California's seismic preparedness. The 1925 quake exposed the dangers of unreinforced brick buildings, a problem that persisted for decades and led to fatalities in later temblors. While many cities eventually mandated retrofits for brick structures, other vulnerabilities, like soft-story apartment buildings, remain unaddressed in some areas, including Santa Barbara.

          <p>BÃ¤rbel Bas has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), where she will serve alongside Lars Klingbeil. Bas, who comes from a working-class background and belongs to the party's left wing, is seen as a new source of hope for the ailing SPD, which suffered a historic defeat in the last election. In her new role as Labor Minister, she faces the monumental tasks of reforming unemployment benefits and the pension system. Her election with 95% of the delegate vote signals strong party support for her vision of a society based on solidarity and dignified work.</p>
