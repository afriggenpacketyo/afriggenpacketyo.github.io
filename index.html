          <p>Jen Pawol officiated a regular-season MLB game, becoming the first woman to do so in the league's history. Her debut as the first base umpire for the game between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins was met with a warm reception and support from fans and family. Following the historic game, Pawol donated the cap she wore to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to commemorate the milestone. She is scheduled to umpire behind the plate later in the series, continuing her groundbreaking role.</p>

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry is experiencing a significant slowdown after a period of rapid growth that followed the 2008 recession. Factors contributing to the decline include changing consumer habits, particularly among younger generations, inflation, and the impact of global tariffs. Several distilleries have faced financial hardship, with some filing for bankruptcy, signaling a potential market correction. The article notes that while the downturn is challenging, it could also spur innovation, similar to how past slumps have reshaped other spirits markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has publicly called on his mayoral opponent, Zohran Mamdani, to vacate his rent-stabilized apartment. Cuomo argues that Mamdani, whom he describes as affluent, is occupying affordable housing that a family in need should have. This criticism is part of a broader political attack by Cuomo, who is running as an independent against the Democratic primary winner. The dispute highlights the city's severe housing affordability crisis, with median rents continuing to rise.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to strip the institution of its valuable, federally funded patents. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick accused Harvard of breaching its legal obligations related to this research, initiating a "march-in" process that could allow the government to seize the patents. This action is viewed by many as a politically motivated move to exert federal control over the university, following disputes over its handling of campus protests regarding the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages," which promise benefits like calm and relaxation, is facing scrutiny from health experts. A BBC article explores whether these drinks, often containing supplements like Lion's Mane and L-theanine, deliver on their advertised effects. Dietitians and nutritionists express skepticism, noting the low dosage of active ingredients and a lack of conclusive scientific evidence. However, they acknowledge the drinks can serve as a positive alternative to alcohol for unwinding, with some effects potentially being psychological.</p>

          <p>The village of Pampa Clemesí in Peru faces a stark paradox, as its residents live without electricity despite being located next to the country's largest solar complex. The community lacks basic infrastructure like power, water, and sewage, forcing residents to use makeshift stoves and torches for light. While the solar plant operator has installed infrastructure to connect the village, the final step of wiring individual homes remains the government's responsibility and has been delayed. This situation highlights a broader issue in Peru where energy infrastructure development often bypasses remote, sparsely populated areas.</p>

          <p>Four months after entrepreneur Mark Cuban predicted companies would use tariffs as a reason to increase prices, major corporations like Procter & Gamble are doing just that. P&G announced price hikes on about a quarter of its products, attributing the increase partly to a projected $1 billion annual impact from tariffs. This trend is expected to continue across various sectors, affecting consumer staples from household goods to food and beverages. The development confirms fears that tariffs would lead to higher costs for American consumers who are already facing financial pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

Gallego argued the legislation would harm the country, a message that resonated with the hundreds in attendance. The event is part of a broader Democratic offensive against the tax law, which they see as a key vulnerability for Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections.

          <p>The Chief Financial Officer for Wilton, Connecticut, has resigned after officials discovered she was simultaneously employed as the town administrator for Greybull, Wyoming. Dawn Norton, who earned $210,000 a year in her Connecticut role, claims she had informed Wilton's leadership about her plans and was working remotely. However, Wilton officials state they were unaware she had accepted a second full-time public office, which would have violated town policy.

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans to immediately deport foreign criminals after they receive a custodial sentence, rather than having them serve time in British prisons. Under the proposal, those with fixed-term sentences would be deported and barred from re-entry, with their destination country deciding if they serve any remaining prison time. The Justice Secretary stated the move would save taxpayer money and protect the public. Critics, however, have warned that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals, questioning the plan's feasibility.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned UEFA for a social media tribute to Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid that omitted the circumstances of his death. The Palestinian Football Association reported that al-Obeid was killed in an Israeli attack while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza. In its post, UEFA referred to him as the "Palestinian Pele" but did not mention how he died. Salah responded directly on social media, asking UEFA to explain "how he died, where, and why," drawing attention to the sensitive context.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a demonstration in support of Palestine Action, a recently proscribed organization. Protesters intentionally violated the law by displaying signs supporting the group, aiming to challenge the government's ban and strain the justice system. The government outlawed Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act after activists vandalized military aircraft to protest UK support for Israel. While the Home Secretary defended the ban, human rights groups like Amnesty International called the mass arrests "deeply concerning" and a threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>The dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long after just two months was reportedly due to a conflict with the White House over releasing taxpayer data. The administration had requested the IRS use its confidential data to help locate undocumented immigrants, but the agency declined, citing taxpayer privacy laws and its inability to verify most names on a list provided by DHS. The incident highlights the administration's pressure on federal agencies to assist in its immigration crackdown. Long's removal makes him the shortest-serving Senate-confirmed IRS commissioner in the agency's history.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket competition, Jonny Bairstow's incredible unbeaten 86 runs from 50 balls was not enough to secure a win for Welsh Fire against London Spirit. Despite Bairstow's late-game heroics, which included back-to-back sixes, the Fire fell short by eight runs in their pursuit of 164. The team's top-order collapse left Bairstow with too much to do, despite a rapid 100-run partnership with Chris Green. London Spirit's total was anchored by David Warner's unbeaten 70, securing their first win of the competition.</p>
