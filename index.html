        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sources indicate that Elon Musk has been privately expressing his discontent with several recent decisions made by the Trump administration. Musk's frustrations reportedly stem from the proposed cuts to the electric vehicle tax credit in the spending bill, which Tesla has publicly opposed, arguing it would threaten America's energy independence. Additionally, Musk is said to be unhappy about the administration's artificial intelligence deals with his competitor, OpenAI, and the withdrawal of Jared Isaacman's nomination as NASA administrator, a move that disappointed Musk. The disagreements extend to trade policy, with Musk previously criticizing trade advisor Peter Navarro. Optimism among Musk may be low given these issues.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has temporarily halted its operations in Gaza to address security concerns and improve efficiency, following reports of numerous Palestinian deaths near its distribution hubs. The United Nations and other aid agencies have criticized the GHF, accusing it of weaponizing access to food, while Hamas claims Israeli forces have killed over 50 people near the sites. GHF's operations have been plagued by questions about funding, operational details, and internal operations, including the closure of its Swiss office due to violations of Swiss NGO rules. The IDF spokesperson warned Gazans against using the roads leading to GHF distribution centers, considering them "combat zones" for the day.</p>

          <p>Rep. Chip Roy is advocating for new legislation that would grant Congress greater oversight of federal spending, building on the foundation laid by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The proposed bill would provide lawmakers with real-time access to Treasury Department invoices exceeding $25,000, as well as visibility into payments made to individual recipients of federal benefits and federal employees. Roy emphasizes that this legislation would equip Congress with the necessary tools to identify and address wasteful spending, regardless of which party controls the White House.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates following a disappointing ADP jobs report. Trump criticized Powell on Truth Social, stating that Europe has lowered rates nine times, while the ADP report showed private payrolls increasing by only 37,000 in May, significantly below expectations. This comes after a recent meeting between Trump and Powell at the White House, where Trump reportedly expressed his view that Powell was making a mistake by not lowering rates. The European Central Bank is expected to lower rates, highlighting the divergence in monetary policy.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation impacting savings, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that can outpace inflation while providing a safe investment option. Current national average CD yields range from 1.70% to 2.00% APY, but top CDs offer significantly higher rates, particularly from online banks. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include considering short-term CDs and laddering CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve.

          <p>The Trump administration is urging Congress to rescind $9.4 billion in approved funding for foreign aid and public broadcasters, including NPR and PBS. This request aligns with spending cuts identified by Elon Musk's “department of government efficiency” (Doge). The proposed cuts include $8.3 billion from the State Department and USAID, as well as $1.1 billion from NPR and PBS. House Speaker Mike Johnson has pledged to pass the cuts, while NPR and PBS have filed lawsuits against Trump, alleging violations of the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>According to his biographer, Stephen Witt, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is significantly motivated by negative emotions, particularly the fear of failure. Despite leading a company valued at nearly $3.4 trillion, Huang reportedly worries about the company's potential collapse at any moment. Witt spent six hours interviewing Huang and found that his drive stems from anxiety, paranoia about competition, and guilt about letting people down. This contrasts with other CEOs who are typically portrayed as upbeat and optimistic, suggesting a unique perspective on leadership.</p>

The court heard that Monzo broke into a couple's home, attacked them with a sword, and shouted about God.

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett is facing increasing criticism from right-wing figures due to several votes that diverge from President Trump's agenda. This includes her vote with liberal justices against Trump's effort to rescind foreign aid, joining Chief Justice John Roberts in rejecting Trump's request to delay sentencing in his New York hush money case, and dissenting on an order tossing out the appeal of Venezuelan detainees. While Trump has publicly backed Barrett, sources indicate he has privately expressed frustration with his Supreme Court picks. Despite the criticism, Barrett remains a conservative vote on the bench, often aligning with Justices Kavanaugh and Alito.</p>

          <p>The Swiss franc's appreciation due to investor demand for safe-haven assets is causing deflationary pressure in Switzerland. A strong franc makes imports cheaper, leading to negative inflation, with the country's Consumer Price Index falling by 0.1% year-on-year in May. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) may need to combat the franc's appreciation by cutting interest rates, potentially returning to negative rates. Experts suggest that the SNB is concerned about the impact on international trade and may need to take further action if the franc continues to strengthen (not investment advice).</p>
