          <p>Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa stated the company's immediate priority is to stabilize the struggling Japanese automaker amidst declining sales, the transition to electric vehicles, and intense global competition, especially from Chinese rivals. Espinosa believes the current plan is robust enough to address these challenges, including the impact of potential tariffs. The company plans to cut 11,000 jobs and close seven plants to streamline operations, following failed merger talks with Honda earlier in the year which would have potentially created the world's third largest automaker. Espinosa assumed leadership in April and faces a significant task to reverse Nissan's current trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Executives from major corporations like Target, Goldman Sachs, and Pepsi are expressing concern about the unsteady business environment, particularly regarding President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. These tariff shifts and court rulings have created uncertainty, causing companies to put hiring and investment plans on hold. Experts warn that this paralysis could hinder economic momentum and potentially lead to a downturn, with companies unable to accurately assess the costs and benefits of long-term decisions. While the Trump administration defends its approach as "strategic uncertainty" to gain leverage in trade negotiations, companies fear potential losses due to the lack of clarity.

          <p>A New York Times opinion piece examines President Trump's attempt to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery, Kim Sajet, due to her alleged partisan views and support for DEI initiatives. The article points out that the National Portrait Gallery is part of the Smithsonian Institution, which is independent of the federal government, and the director can only be removed by the Smithsonian's Board of Regents. The author suggests that Trump's actions highlight a broader issue of expanding presidential power and the potential for political influence over cultural institutions. While Trump lacks formal authority, the piece questions whether political actors treating him as if he does, makes a difference.</p>

          <p>A New York Times opinion piece discusses the legal challenges to President Trump's tariffs and their implications for the separation of powers. The article highlights the debate over whether the International Economic Emergency Powers Act of 1977 grants the president the authority to impose tariffs, a power traditionally held by Congress. The litigation is compared to the "steel seizure" case of 1952, emphasizing the importance of preventing any single branch of government from becoming too powerful. The author questions whether vague language in the act can justify the president's tariff-setting power, as no previous president has interpreted it this way. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed budget package includes a new restriction for the federal Child Tax Credit (CTC) that could exclude millions of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents. The bill requires both the tax filer and their spouse to have Social Security numbers to claim the CTC, impacting children with mixed-status parents or undocumented parents. While Republicans claim the bill would benefit families by increasing the CTC, experts argue it could deny the tax credit to roughly 4.5 million children. Critics say the restriction would create different tax rules for families based on immigration status, potentially harming children's well-being.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to double steel and aluminum tariffs to 50% is causing concern for manufacturers who rely on these materials. While domestic steel producers may benefit, companies that use steel face higher costs and increased competition from global competitors. A North Carolina manufacturer expresses concern about the ability to compete with companies that have access to world market pricing. Economists warn that the tariffs could lead to job losses in downstream manufacturing and higher prices for consumers, despite the Trump administration's goal of promoting domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>The German city of Cologne evacuated approximately 20,500 residents from its city center to allow experts to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. The evacuation, described as the largest operation since the end of the war, affected homes, shops, hotels, schools, a hospital, and a major train station. Authorities sealed off a 1,000-meter radius around the bombs, discovered in a shipyard, to ensure public safety. The bomb disposal service worked to defuse the bombs, with the operation causing significant disruption to transport and daily life in the city.</p>

          <p>Manchester City has agreed to sign AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders, a capped player for the Netherlands. Reijnders is a balanced midfielder capable of playing both deep and high, and scored 15 goals in 54 matches for Milan last season, earning him the Serie A midfielder of the season award. The signing will provide City coach Pep Guardiola with greater options in midfield, either alongside Rodri or in a more advanced role. Reijnders is adept at taking the ball in tight areas and beating the press through passing or ball-carrying.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is widely expected to cut its key interest rate, with markets pricing in a high probability of a 25-basis-point reduction. Europe faces a highly uncertain economic outlook, with inflation hovering around the ECB's 2% target and sluggish economic growth. Analysts expect more rate cuts later in the year but disagree on the timing, with some suggesting July and others pointing to September and December. The ECB will also publish its latest staff projections for inflation and economic growth, and is unlikely to give hints about how low rates could go. (not investment advice)</p>

The OECD notes that "substantial barriers to trade" and "diminishing confidence" are putting downward pressure on global economic growth rates. The report highlights that Chinese exports will be "curbed by the newly imposed tariffs," disproportionately affecting private companies. The U.S. absorbed a significant portion of China's merchandise exports last year, making it a key factor in the projected slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the May rebound, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down year-to-date compared to the same period last year, however, Tesla was able to regain a lead against BYD in vehicle sales in Australia.
