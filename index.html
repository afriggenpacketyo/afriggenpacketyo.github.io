        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has paused discovery for one week in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant wrongfully deported. Judge Paula Xinis issued the order at the request of the Trump administration, with agreement from Abrego Garcia's attorneys. This pause follows the judge's previous order for the government to fully answer questions about the deportation and is related to a dispute over the legal basis for Abrego Garcia's confinement, with the government citing diplomatic discussions. Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution, after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13.</p>

          <p>South Korea's GDP contracted by 0.1% year-on-year in the first quarter, marking the first contraction in four years, primarily due to a sharp decline in construction activity. The Bank of Korea had previously warned of slower growth, citing prolonged political uncertainties, including the impeachment trials of former president Yoon Suk Yeol and prime minister Han Duck-soo, and deteriorating trade conditions. The country's export-led economy has also been affected by the ongoing trade war, with tariffs on steel and automobiles impacting its largest exports to the U.S. Analysts anticipate further rate cuts and fiscal stimulus to address the challenging economic environment.</p>

Acting Governor Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency for Ocean County, and officials are investigating the cause of the fire, attributing its rapid spread to ongoing dry conditions and wind.

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg stated that China has stopped taking deliveries of Boeing aircraft due to the ongoing trade war and associated tariffs. This disruption has led Boeing to consider reallocating some of these planes to other customers, as there is high demand for the 737 Max aircraft. Ortberg emphasized that this situation will not derail the company's recovery. This announcement came after Boeing reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the first quarter, with better-than-feared cash burn due to increased airplane deliveries. </p>

While revenue and operating profit rose significantly year-on-year, they decreased on a quarter-on-quarter basis from record highs. The company cautioned that macroeconomic uncertainties and U.S. tariff policies could create demand volatility in the second half of the year.

          <p>President Trump has signed executive actions aimed at higher education and K-12 schools, including efforts to rein in DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives. One action targets college accreditors, accusing them of imposing discriminatory DEI-based standards, while another promises new discipline guidance for K-12 schools, prioritizing objective behavior over DEI. These orders seek to cement Trump's conservative agenda in education, rolling back policies from the Biden administration, bolstering workforce training, and improving teaching about artificial intelligence. The actions also address foreign funding disclosure for universities and aim to increase competition among accreditors.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, facing increasing strain, is scaling back his involvement with the federal government, though his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) remains. Musk intends to continue advocating for lower tariffs but acknowledges that President Trump's receptiveness is uncertain. This shift comes after a period of significant influence in Washington, where Musk drove radical changes across the government. His role had drawn both praise and criticism, highlighting the complexities of private sector involvement in public administration.</p>

          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's GOP congressional delegation are urging President Trump to reconsider the denial of federal disaster relief following severe storms in March. The request was denied by FEMA, prompting concern from state officials who cite catastrophic damage and the deaths of three Arkansans. This follows similar denials of relief requests in Washington and North Carolina, marking the first time Republicans have publicly pushed back on FEMA's decisions. The situation underscores ongoing debates about federal disaster response and resource allocation.</p>

This development occurs amid ongoing political turmoil in South Korea, including the impeachment and removal of Yoon Suk Yeol, Moon's successor, and ahead of a general election.

          <p>A bill in California to reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels is generating intense debate between union electrical workers, utilities, and solar owners. Assembly Bill 942, proposed by Lisa Calderon, would limit credits for existing solar systems, leading to protests and accusations of favoring utilities. Calderon argues the bill addresses equity concerns, while opponents contend it undermines the state's commitment to renewable energy. The outcome will impact the financial viability of rooftop solar for many Californians.</p>

          <p>England's NHS safety watchdog, the Health Services Safety Investigations Body, warns that extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patients. The watchdog found medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention, and rude behavior are the most common problems associated with fatigued staff in hospitals. The report cited examples of mistakes being made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs, and emphasized the need for better systems to monitor fatigue and raise awareness about the issue. The watchdog also noted that exhaustion was a risk to staff themselves.</p>
