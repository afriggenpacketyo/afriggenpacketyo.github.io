          <h2>Economists Question Trump's Tariff Calculation Method</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-05 13:23:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are challenging the formula used by the Trump administration to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it inflates the actual rates. The formula, which involves dividing a country's trade deficit with the U.S. by its exports and then by two, assumes an elasticity rate lower than it should be, leading to inflated tariff percentages. Adjusting the elasticity assumption would significantly reduce the tariff rates imposed on various nations, bringing them closer to the baseline established by the administration. This discrepancy raises concerns about the accuracy and justification of the tariffs imposed on U.S. trading partners. (not investment advice) <br><i></p>

He allegedly laundered donor money through a fraudulent political consulting firm, used an elderly woman's credit card for personal expenses, and falsely reported a $500,000 personal loan to his campaign.

          <p>Donald Trump’s tariff announcement has baffled global leaders and forced markets to reckon with the fallout from America’s dramatic shift in international trade policy. The United States economy has tended to work in favor of educated professionals, blue-collar workers have not benefited in the same ways. Adjustments to trade policy could be one way to address this, but Trump’s tariffs are "shambolic, they’re extremely high,” and “no one knows whether he’s going to take them back the next day.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration argues that a federal judge lacks the authority to order the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The man, a Salvadoran national, was deported despite a 2019 ruling that shielded him from deportation. The government claims it has no control over the man and no authority to arrange for his return, while the man's attorneys argue the government has done nothing to rectify its error.</p>

          <p>The United States grabbing land from an ally sounds like the stuff of a Netflix political thriller. But every American should contemplate three realities about Donald Trump’s aggressive desire to acquire Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory. First, unlike his usual shtick, in which he floats wild ideas and then he and his aides alternate between saying he was serious and saying he might have been joking, he means it.</p>
