          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court swiftly rejected Attorney General Josh Kaul's attempt to halt Elon Musk's $1 million giveaways to two Wisconsin voters.  The court's decision came minutes before the event, supporting conservative candidate Brad Schimel.  The ruling highlights the increasing politicization of judicial races and Musk's significant financial influence in state elections; the potential bias lies in the court's speed in making a decision that seemingly favors a politically-aligned candidate.</p>
