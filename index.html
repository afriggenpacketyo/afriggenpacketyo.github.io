          <p>As protests unfold in Los Angeles, U.S. officials have clarified the rules of force for the deployed National Guard and Marines, emphasizing their role in protecting federal buildings and personnel without directly engaging with protesters unless necessary for self-defense. Troops are carrying weapons but will not have ammunition loaded, and they are instructed to de-escalate situations. The Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell expressed concerns about the logistical challenges and stressed the need for clear communication between agencies. Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas Edmonds questioned the distinction between protecting federal officers and enforcing the law, seeking clarification on the use of deadly force. The presence of the military aims to ensure continuous coverage of the area. Optimism is present in the safety and security of federal property and personnel.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to address rising rice prices, according to Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. This move aims to stabilize the cost of Japan's staple food by directly contracting with retailers, particularly smaller supermarket operators. The country's rice reserves will be reduced to 100,000 tons after this release, following previous auctions in March and April. Rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, prompting the government to take action to lower overall prices for consumers. The release consists of rice from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kg. (not investment advice)</p>

Kruger noted that the protests are giving Trump the moment he needs to declare martial law. Pussy Riot frontwoman Nadya Tolokonnikova's performance, "Police State," continued inside the museum, broadcasting live audio of the protests mixed with her heartbeat to the empty museum.

          <p>The UK government has committed £14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear plant project on the Suffolk coastline, aiming to boost economic growth and transition to clean energy. The project is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized the investment as crucial for energy independence and tackling climate change, although the plant will take at least a decade to complete. Critics, like Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C, argue the funds could be better spent and fear increased consumer bills, citing budget disputes and delays with similar projects. The investment reflects the government's broader strategy to eliminate fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030.</p>

The Streaming & Studios business, including HBO Max and the film division, will be led by Mr. Zaslav, while the Global Networks company, encompassing CNN, Discovery, and TNT Sports, will be led by Gunnar Wiedenfels. The move aims to provide each division with sharper focus and strategic flexibility to compete effectively in the evolving media landscape.

          <p>China's next-generation stealth fighter jets, the Chengdu J-36 and the Shenyang J-50, have garnered attention since their emergence in December of last year. The J-36, nicknamed “Gingko leaf,” features a distinctive diamond shape with a delta wing platform designed to reduce air drag at high speeds, and is tailless for radar evasion. Unique aerodynamic features include trailing edge control surfaces per wing and split flaps close to the wingtips, enhancing maneuverability. Increasing sightings and images have provided more detail about these advanced aircraft, although official information remains limited.

          <p>Victims of the January 6th Capitol riot and congressional Democrats are criticizing the Trump administration's response to the Los Angeles protests, pointing to perceived hypocrisy. They contrast the aggressive response to those accused of assaulting police in Los Angeles with the defense of individuals who admitted to assaulting police on January 6th. Critics highlight statements from FBI officials condemning violence against law enforcement in Los Angeles, while President Trump has referred to January 6th as a "day of love." Democrats also noted the contrast in deploying the National Guard to California quickly, despite delays in doing so during the Capitol attack. The perceived disparity risks further inflaming tensions and controversy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has authorized the deployment of 2,000 more National Guard troops to Los Angeles, prompting strong opposition from California Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom, who is suing the Trump administration over the initial deployment, criticized the move as unnecessary and disrespectful to the troops. The Defense Department has also mobilized Marines to support the Guard troops in protecting federal personnel and property. Trump defended the possibility of arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions. The situation highlights the escalating conflict between the federal government and California over immigration policy and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has described the UK's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world," citing fundamental flaws and outdated gender stereotypes. The Women and Equalities Committee report recommends increasing paternity pay and leave to promote equality, requiring significant investment. Statutory paternity leave, introduced in 2003, allows new fathers to take up to two weeks off work, but the report argues this is insufficient. The report also criticizes shared parental leave as overly complex and underutilized. The government has stated it is reviewing current parental leave entitlements to better support working families.</p>

The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) acknowledges the potential for AI to free up time for face-to-face teaching but notes unresolved issues.

          <p>An opinion piece discusses concerns that President Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles against the wishes of local authorities signals a move towards autocracy. The author argues that Trump is inventing a crisis to justify an authoritarian crackdown.

The presidential memorandum calling out the National Guard refers to protests that "inhibit" law enforcement, potentially targeting even peaceful demonstrations.

About 3.5 million tonnes of sludge, containing cancer-linked chemicals and microplastics, are used as cheap fertilizer annually. Concerns include a lack of regulation and the potential for long-term soil contamination with persistent substances like "forever chemicals". The water industry is increasingly worried about farmers refusing the sludge and is lobbying regulators and making contingency plans.
