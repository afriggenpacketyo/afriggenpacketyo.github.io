          <p>A significant wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, prompted mandatory evacuations for 3,000 residents and the closure of major roadways, including parts of the Garden State Parkway. The fire, which started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, rapidly spread across 8,500 acres with only 10% containment as of late Tuesday night. While evacuation orders have since been lifted and roads reopened, thousands remain without power as a result of the measures taken to protect firefighters. Fire officials continue to battle the blaze, utilizing fire engines, bulldozers, and backfiring operations to establish containment lines.</p>

While Jones didn't elaborate on the specifics, this announcement comes after criticism of the Cowboys' limited activity in recent offseasons. The team has focused on bolstering existing positions by adding linebacker Kenneth Murray, running backs Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders, cornerback Kaiir Elam and defensive lineman Solomon Thomas, and trading for quarterback Joe Milton. The Cowboys are also working on a contract extension for linebacker Micah Parsons, but negotiations are ongoing.</p>

          <p>The article critiques the notion that regenerative agriculture can reverse climate change, as promoted in documentaries like "Kiss the Ground" and "Common Ground." While regenerative practices improve soil health, the article argues that the films oversimplify the issue and ignore tradeoffs. The author notes that regenerative agriculture requires more land, and that carbon sequestration in soil is limited and difficult to measure. The article suggests reducing meat and dairy production as a more effective approach to slashing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.</p>

          <p>The anti-abortion movement is increasingly embracing more punitive measures, including treating fetuses as people and potentially charging women who have abortions with homicide. This shift comes as the movement gains power after Roe v Wade was overturned. The article explores the evolution of the anti-abortion movement and its growing alignment with Republican politics, as well as the rise of "abolitionists" who believe women should be punished for having abortions. Despite the unpopularity of extreme measures, the movement's focus on judicial influence allows it to disregard public opinion.</p>
