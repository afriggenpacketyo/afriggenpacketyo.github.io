          <p>China's national broadcaster CCTV aired a confession from Wei Huairen, also known as Wei San, identified as the head of an ethnic Chinese crime family in Kokang, northern Myanmar. Wei was handed over to Chinese law enforcement in January. A police officer indicated that the Wei family's criminal activities were "state-authorised," distinguishing them from other syndicates due to their direct command of an army unit.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent benchmark rate cut, experts anticipate further reductions this year, likely leading to lower home equity loan rates. Projections suggest an additional 0.5% drop by year-end, potentially pushing average rates below 8%, with some lenders already offering such rates. Homeowners are encouraged to explore their options and compare offers, as these favorable conditions could make tapping into significant home equity more affordable. The trajectory of home equity and HELOC rates is directly tied to the prime rate, influenced by the Fed's decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

Mourners perform K'riah, a ritual tearing of clothing, and observe shiva for seven days, refraining from work and grooming. The Mourner's Kaddish, an ancient Aramaic prayer, is recited in communal settings to honor the deceased and provide support, with gravestones typically added a month to a year after burial.</p>

          <p>A Deloitte survey indicates that most U.S. consumers expect a weaker economy and higher prices for holiday items, leading to a planned 10% reduction in average holiday spending. This marks the most negative economic outlook since 1997, with Gen Z and Millennials planning the most significant spending cuts. The pessimism is influenced by recent tariff hikes and rising living costs.

          <p>U.S. officials have reported multiple strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats in the Caribbean, claiming self-defense against drug trafficking.

The Trump administration reportedly views itself in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, a stance that broadens presidential powers.
