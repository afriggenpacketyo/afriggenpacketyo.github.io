          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture near Tokyo as part of its restructuring efforts, according to a company source. This move comes after the automaker announced plans to shut down seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally following a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal 2024. The plants under consideration are the Oppama plant in Yokosuka and the Shonan plant of Nissan Shatai Co. in Hiratsuka. The company clarified that this news is speculative and not based on official information, but the potential closures would mark the first plant shutdowns in Japan since 2001.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, led by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is implementing an executive order to ensure Americans pay no more for medications than citizens of other wealthy nations. The plan addresses the disparity where Americans often pay significantly higher prices for the same drugs compared to other countries. Pharmaceutical companies extract a large portion of their profits from the United States, and the administration aims to end this imbalance.

          <p>The Supreme Court has extended the ban on the Trump administration’s use of a wartime law to deport Venezuelans, sending the case back to a lower court for further review. This decision blocks the administration from deporting Venezuelan detainees accused of gang membership, pending a ruling on whether the Alien Enemies Act can be applied. The justices also want the lower court to consider if the migrants were given adequate notice to challenge their deportations. Justice Alito dissented, while President Trump expressed his frustration with the ruling.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that long-term care costs, which can exceed $100,000, pose a significant financial challenge for many Americans. Many households are unprepared to manage these expenses, as health insurance and Medicare often do not cover custodial care. Medicaid is the largest payer of long-term care, but eligibility requirements can be stringent. Proactive planning, including considering long-term care insurance and discussing needs with family, is crucial to mitigate the financial burden of long-term care.</p>

The fees would target asylum seekers, children, and survivors of crimes, potentially requiring them to pay thousands of dollars. Republicans claim the fees are necessary to offset the costs of Trump’s immigration policies. Critics argue that the fees are designed to penalize immigrants and could force them into exploitative situations or push them to leave the country.</p>

Researchers are experimenting with colonizing patients’ guts with new bacteria through fecal transplants, with some promising results. The work comes as the broader scientific community is under attack by the Trump administration, which has proposed large cuts to scientific institutions.</p>

The book explores the concerns of Democratic officials and the actions taken to conceal Biden's symptoms from the press and public. Ultimately, the authors conclude that Biden's decision to run for reelection, followed by efforts to hide his cognitive diminishment, was a significant mistake.</p>
