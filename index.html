          <p>Elon Musk announced his departure from his role as a Special Government Employee in the Trump administration, marking the end of his 130-day mandate focused on reducing wasteful spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk expressed gratitude to President Trump for the opportunity and affirmed that the DOGE mission would continue to strengthen within the government. His exit follows criticism of Trump's budget bill, which Musk believes undermines DOGE's efforts, and coincides with a period of declining sales at his electric car company. Musk's role had involved cutting federal jobs, sometimes leading to controversies and legal challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing reciprocal tariffs, a significant blow to his economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The court ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs, impacting those on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking, as well as reciprocal tariffs imposed on numerous countries. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling, while critics hailed it as a victory for working families and small businesses.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea (BOK) has cut its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5%, the fourth cut in the last six meetings, in response to political uncertainty and reciprocal tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. This decision comes as South Korea grapples with the aftermath of a failed attempt to impose martial law and faces a deadline to strike a deal with the U.S. government to avoid tariffs. The BOK also slashed its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to 0.8%, citing expectations that economic growth will decline considerably while inflation remains stable. The central bank aims to mitigate downside risks to economic growth while monitoring the domestic and external policy environment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended exports of critical U.S. technologies, including those related to jet engines, semiconductors, and certain chemicals and machinery, to China. This move is a response to China’s recent restrictions on exports of critical minerals to the United States, which threatened to cripple U.S. company supply chains. The new limits are pushing the world’s largest economies closer to supply chain warfare, as both countries attempt to gain the upper hand in an intensifying trade conflict. The restrictions affect companies like COMAC, a Chinese state-owned aerospace manufacturer, and software used to design computer chips. </p>

The Fever's point differential was significantly lower without Clark, and their 77 points were the lowest they've scored all season.

Starmer argues that Reform's policies, particularly unfunded tax cuts, would lead to an economic meltdown and increased mortgage costs. Reform UK has gained traction in recent local elections, posing a challenge to the traditional main parties in Britain. Starmer's speech underscores the growing political rivalry between Labour and Reform, with the prime minister positioning himself as a defender of economic stability against what he views as reckless fiscal policies.</p>

The Court of International Trade ruled that an emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Manhattan-based court said the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations and this is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy.

          <p>The government has fast-tracked two major new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire in a bid to shore up England's water supplies. These projects have been declared "nationally significant," allowing them to speed through the planning process, though they could still be more than a decade away from opening. The move is intended to address rising temperatures, a growing population, and increased demand, but some experts warn that managing water usage needs greater precedence. Local objections and the cost of building the reservoirs remain significant challenges.</p>

          <p>Golden eagles are beginning to venture back into England from the south of Scotland after years of absence, raising hopes that they might nest. The resurgence is attributed to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has successfully translocated juveniles and sub-adults from the Scottish Highlands. These birds have been sighted in Northumberland, the North Pennines, and the Lake District, signaling a potentially exciting milestone for the species' recovery. Golden eagles were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th Century, mainly due to persecution.</p>

          <p>Justice Department lawyers said the government is taking steps to comply with a court order to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, known as O.C.G., who had been deported to Mexico and then Guatemala.

Judge Murphy ordered the government to “facilitate” O.C.G.’s return to the United States, finding that he was likely to “succeed in showing that his removal lacked any semblance of due process.” This represents a de-escalation in a case that is shaping up to be one of the key courtroom battles over President Trump’s attempts to conduct mass deportations.</p>

Judge Michael Farbiarz wrote that the government's justification, that Khalil's beliefs may pose a threat to US foreign policy, could lead to arbitrary enforcement. However, he did not order Khalil's release, citing a lack of response from Khalil's attorneys regarding personal details in his residency application. The ruling is the first time a federal judge has weighed in on the constitutionality of Trump’s use of a law granting the US secretary of state the power to seek the deportation of any non-citizen whose presence in the country is deemed adverse to US foreign policy interests.</p>
