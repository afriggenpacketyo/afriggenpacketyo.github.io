          <p>A controversial immigration facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to have zero detainees within a few days, according to a state official. The head of Florida's Division of Emergency Management confirmed the development in an email to an interfaith community group. This closure follows lawsuits that halted the transfer of new detainees to the facility, which has been a focal point of political attention and was projected to cost around $400 million. The news comes as the state government announces plans for a new detention center called "Deportation Depot."</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, forecasting sales growth to remain above 50% for the upcoming quarter. Despite the strong performance driven by high demand for its AI infrastructure, the company's stock fell in extended trading. This was primarily because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year to $41.1 billion, fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive period. The company also approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei was pelted with stones while greeting supporters from a pickup truck during a campaign event in Buenos Aires province. The president was unhurt and quickly removed from the scene by his security detail, but the incident cut the rally short. The attack heightens political tensions ahead of provincial and midterm elections, which are seen as a major test of Milei's libertarian policies aimed at curbing inflation and fiscal deficits. Scuffles broke out between his supporters and opponents following the confrontation.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Board of Public Works president Steve Kang to serve as the city's chief film liaison, fulfilling a long-standing promise to the entertainment industry. The appointment comes over two and a half years into her term, a delay that had frustrated industry advocates concerned about production jobs leaving the city. The liaison role is designed to help film and television productions navigate city bureaucracy and streamline the process of shooting in Los Angeles. The move is part of a broader effort to support the local industry amid a production slump.</p>

          <p>Susan Monarez has been ousted as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention less than a month after her Senate confirmation. Her lawyers claim she was targeted for refusing to approve "unscientific, reckless directives" and has not officially resigned or been fired. The sudden departure coincides with the resignations of at least three other senior CDC leaders, who cited concerns over budget cuts, the rise of misinformation, and the "weaponizing of public health." The upheaval follows months of turmoil at the agency, including layoffs and controversial policy changes regarding vaccines.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to fourth-tier Grimsby Town has intensified pressure on manager Ruben Amorim. The loss comes after a 15th-place league finish last season, despite a £200 million investment in new attacking players this summer. Amorim's system, which does not use conventional wingers, has led to the marginalization of valuable players and has yet to yield consistent results. Following the shocking loss, the manager's comments suggested a sense of resignation, raising questions about whether the club's new leadership will continue to back him.</p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding its funded childcare program, offering working parents in England 30 hours a week for children as young as nine months old starting in September. While the move aims to alleviate high childcare costs, which average over £12,000 annually, concerns remain about the sector's capacity to meet demand. Nurseries and childminders face financial pressures, as government funding rates often don't cover their full costs, leading some to charge extra for essentials.

          <p>Cracker Barrel quickly reverted to its old logo after a new, minimalist design sparked a right-wing backlash, with critics claiming the chain had gone "woke." The article argues this controversy misses the point, as Cracker Barrel has always been a corporate simulation of rural authenticity, not a genuine mom-and-pop establishment. Founded in 1969 to sell gas along interstate highways, the chain capitalized on nostalgia for a disappearing way of life that those same highways helped erode. The failed rebrand is presented not as a political misstep but as another example of corporate monoculture attempting to sanitize vernacular culture.</p>

          <p>The value of small, low-cost parcels sent from China to the UK more than doubled last year, reaching £3 billion, according to data obtained by the BBC. This surge is largely attributed to the growth of e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu, which utilize a tax exemption for imports valued under £135, allowing them to avoid customs duties. UK retailers argue this creates unfair competition and are urging the government to take swift action. The Treasury is currently reviewing the import rules, following similar moves by the U.S. and EU to address the issue.</p>

          <h2>Financial Analyst Pushes Back on AI Bubble Fears After Nvidia's Strong Report</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Nvidia's strong earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against the idea that the market is in an artificial intelligence bubble. He asserted that the massive AI spending by major tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google is a worthwhile investment, not a repeat of the dot-com bust. Cramer noted that today's major AI investors have competent leadership and strong balance sheets, unlike many companies from the dot-com era. He suggested that even if there is a downturn, a handful of clear winners will emerge and ultimately thrive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to a Democratic-led push to redraw California's congressional districts, state Republicans have proposed a resolution to split the state in two. The plan would separate the heavily Democratic coastal areas from the more conservative rural and inland regions, creating a new state. While the proposal is a political stunt with no chance of passing, it highlights the deep partisan divisions surrounding the upcoming special election on redistricting. Democrats have dismissed the idea as a "joke" and a gerrymander in its own right.</p>

          <p>Denmark's foreign minister summoned the top U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen following a report that Americans were conducting covert operations in Greenland. The alleged aim was to infiltrate Greenlandic society and promote its secession from Denmark to the United States. Danish intelligence services had previously warned that Greenland was being targeted by influence campaigns designed to create discord. The U.S. State Department said it respects Greenland's right to self-determination but could not comment on the actions of private citizens, adding to ongoing diplomatic tensions over the territory's future.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized NBC on social media for extending its contract with "Late Night" host Seth Meyers, calling him one of the "least talented" hosts. The president's post referred to a "sick rumor" about the contract, though the extension through 2028 was publicly announced in May 2024. The article notes the long-standing tension between the two, dating back to Meyers' jokes at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner. It frames late-night television as one of the few platforms consistently challenging the president's policies.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Conservative party is facing a significant challenge from the right-wing Reform UK party, which is now consistently leading the Tories in Holyrood opinion polls. The issue was highlighted as a third Conservative MSP, Graham Simpson, defected to Reform UK, following over a dozen local councillors. Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay faces a difficult balancing act, as shifting to the right to counter Reform risks alienating the moderate voter base that previously helped the party surpass Labour. The defections suggest a fracturing of the party's support across the political spectrum.</p>

The dispute centers on the fees Fox is charging for its content, which Google claims are "far higher" than what comparable partners receive.
