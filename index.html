          <p>Despite facing significant tariffs, China's economy demonstrated resilience in April, with industrial output growing by 6.1% and retail sales increasing by 5.1%. These figures, released by the National Bureau of Statistics, indicate a stronger performance than economists' estimates. The Politburo has affirmed the need to bolster domestic consumption amidst global trade uncertainties. This period represents the only month where the full impact of triple-digit tariffs was evident before the recent agreement between Washington and Beijing, which provides a 90-day reprieve in the trade conflict.

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a ‚Äúsmall nodule‚Äù on his prostate. While the cancer is Stage 4 and considered aggressive, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Prostate cancer experts say that while the cancer cannot be cured once it has spread to the bones, men can live for many years with treatment; former President Trump and Vice President Harris have offered supportive statements.

          <p>The United States is considering region-based tariffs instead of individual duty rates for many countries, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The Trump administration aims to strike deals with key trading partners on its reciprocal tariffs imposed in April. The administration paused country-specific tariffs for 90 days until early July to allow for negotiations. Bessent said that Trump would enforce the same tariff rates prior to the pause if those trading partners do not negotiate in good faith. Optimism score = 50</p>

          <p>A Reddit post sparked discussion about whether driving a luxury car still signifies wealth, given the accessibility of financing and leasing. Many users pointed out that owning a high-end vehicle doesn't automatically mean someone is wealthy, as many people prioritize it over other financial goals. Conversely, some emphasized that wealthy individuals often avoid displaying their wealth conspicuously. The discussion highlighted differing personal values and financial priorities, with some prioritizing transportation while others prioritize investment. Optimism score = 60</p>

The Guardian says talks between the EU and UK about a "major reset" of the trade deal went "down to the wire".
