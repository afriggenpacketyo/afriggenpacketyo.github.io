        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many UK newspapers are leading with Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spending Review, particularly the £39 billion investment in affordable housing. The Financial Times highlights this as a significant boost to social housing, while the Daily Mirror emphasizes the potential to alleviate the housing crisis. The i Paper notes Deputy PM Angela Rayner's role in advocating for the extended housing program. The Times reports the NHS may still struggle to meet waiting list targets despite a £30 billion boost, and the Daily Mail criticizes the Chancellor over job losses since the last budget. The Daily Express calls for Reeves to reverse inheritance tax changes for farmers. The Guardian leads with sanctions on Israeli ministers, and the Telegraph covers Mauritius's debt repayment using funds from the UK government. </p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second night of serious disorder, with petrol bombs and fireworks thrown at police, who responded with baton rounds and a water cannon. The violence, described by police as "racially motivated," followed an earlier peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault. Homes and businesses were attacked, with some residents displaying signs indicating their nationality in an attempt to avoid being targeted. Politicians have condemned the violence, with some attributing it to tensions arising from an oversubscription of migrants in the area following the sexual assault. The unrest has prompted concerns and calls for reflection from political figures and authorities. </p>

          <p>Around 15,000 protesters gathered in Budapest, Hungary, to demonstrate against the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, initiating what organizers call a resistance movement. Speakers criticized the government's anti-democratic conduct and alleged corruption. The protest follows a law banning public LGBTQ+ events and a constitutional amendment allowing authorities to use facial recognition to identify protesters, leading to allegations of autocracy. As elections approach, critics claim Orbán is using authoritarian tactics to silence opposition, including a draft bill that would blacklist critical media and NGOs. The EU has warned that the bill breaches EU laws and fundamental values. </p>

          <p>Germany is pushing to import gas from various sources to reduce its reliance on Russian gas. The country, like others across Europe, is building more facilities to handle an increase in imports of liquefied natural gas, much of it from the United States. This effort is part of a broader strategy to diversify energy supplies and ensure energy security. Germany's move reflects a shift in the European energy landscape. </p>

May, who arrived as the U.S. consul general for Hong Kong and Macau in September 2022, is considered a top candidate for a ministerial role in the embassy. His pragmatism and experience covering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan make him well-suited to assist the new American ambassador, David Perdue.
