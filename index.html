          <p>Ford is recalling more than 103,000 of its F-150 pickup trucks from model years 2023 to 2025 due to a potential rear axle hub bolt failure. This defect could cause a vehicle to lose power or roll away while in park, significantly increasing the risk of a crash. While Ford has stated it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to this issue, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has identified warning signs like clicking or rattling noises. Owners will be notified and can have the rear axle shaft assemblies replaced for free at dealerships.</p>

What began as a pandemic hobby of making Japanese cheesecakes evolved into a thriving business, particularly after she perfected a recipe for cream-filled brioche donuts inspired by a trip to France. After testing the market from her home to overwhelming demand, she took a leap of faith and opened her storefront last year.

This announcement caused its stock to plummet by nearly 40%, reflecting deep investor concern about its future. The budget carrier pointed to adverse market conditions, including weak leisure travel demand and high operating costs, which have persisted despite its recent emergence from bankruptcy. The company is now considering further cost-cutting measures, including the potential sale of aircraft and real estate, to improve its liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report has found that the situation in South Africa has "significantly worsened," citing credible reports of extrajudicial killings by government agents and repression against minorities. The report specifically notes a high number of murders on farms and highlights rhetoric from the Economic Freedom Fighters party encouraging violence. It also criticizes the 2024 Expropriation Bill, which allows land seizure without compensation and could disproportionately affect Afrikaner landowners. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has previously denied claims of genocide and harassment against this group.</p>

Miran, tapped for a governor role, and Bullard, a contender for Fed Chair, argued that any price effects from tariffs are muted and temporary. Both men stressed the importance of Fed independence while also praising Trump's pro-growth agenda and downplaying current inflation concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

This suggestion has alarmed many economists, who view it as a political move to undermine the credibility of vital economic data, especially after Trump fired the previous commissioner.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has released significantly shortened versions of its annual human rights reports, removing entire categories of abuse and repression from its assessments. An NPR analysis shows the reports are about one-third their previous length, with documentation of issues like government corruption, restrictions on peaceful assembly, and gender-based violence largely eliminated. Critics argue this "streamlined" approach, which the department claims adheres more closely to legal requirements, effectively lets authoritarian regimes off the hook.

However, early models project it will intensify into a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands.

Another option for charitably inclined individuals over age 70½ is to make a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct transfer to a nonprofit that satisfies the RMD without increasing taxable income.

          <p>A severe heatwave with temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F) is fueling numerous wildfires across southern Europe, leading to mass evacuations and significant health warnings. Countries including Spain, Portugal, Italy, and France have issued red alerts, with one death from severe burns reported near Madrid. Thousands have been forced to flee their homes and hotels in Spain, where nearly 1,000 soldiers have been deployed to fight the blazes. The extreme weather, which scientists attribute to global warming making Mediterranean summers hotter and drier, has also sparked fires in Greece, Turkey, and the Balkans, stretching emergency services thin across the continent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A formal inquiry has concluded that some British soldiers stationed in Kenya have continued to pay for sex, despite a 2022 Ministry of Defence ban on the practice. The report identified 35 suspected instances of transactional sex at the Batuk training base, acknowledging the activity persists at a "low to moderate level." This investigation was launched following years of controversy, including the 2012 death of Agnes Wanjiru, allegedly killed by a British soldier, and other allegations of misconduct and a case of alleged sexual assault. The army has committed to implementing the report's recommendations to better enforce its policies.</p>

          <p>DermaRite Industries is voluntarily recalling several of its hand soap, cleanser, and antiseptic products due to contamination with Burkholderia cepacia, a bacteria that can cause serious infections. The recall affects multiple products, including DermaKleen lotion soap and KleenFoam antibacterial soap, distributed in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The bacteria poses a significant risk to individuals with compromised immune systems, potentially leading to life-threatening sepsis, while healthier individuals may experience local skin infections. The company has notified distributors to destroy the affected products, and no adverse reactions have been reported to date.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kodak, the 133-year-old company that pioneered consumer photography, has warned there is "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern. The warning, which caused its stock to plunge 26%, is tied to significant short-term debt and pension liabilities that it may not have the financial resources to meet. This marks another critical challenge for the iconic brand, which struggled to adapt to the digital revolution and filed for bankruptcy in 2012. After emerging as a smaller company focused on commercial printing, Kodak now faces another fight for survival as it works to satisfy its financial obligations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leaders from 26 of the 27 European Union member states have issued a joint statement insisting that Ukraine's borders must not be changed by force. The declaration comes just days before a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the war. The statement underscores European anxiety that a peace deal brokered by the U.S. might involve ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia, a move the EU finds unacceptable. Hungary was the sole EU nation that did not sign the statement, with its leader Viktor Orban advocating for a separate EU-Russia summit.</p>

          <p>Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, reported a 53% increase in second-quarter revenue in its first earnings report as a public company, driven by strong growth in its stablecoin circulation. Revenue rose to $658.1 million, and the company's stock jumped on the news, continuing a massive rally since its June IPO. CEO Jeremy Allaire attributed the success to growing recognition that blockchains and stablecoins are foundational to the future of the financial system. The positive results come as the crypto industry benefits from a more supportive legislative environment, including the recently passed GENIUS Act for stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With ongoing inflation and market volatility, many retirees are considering annuities for a guaranteed income stream, but their safety depends on several factors. The financial strength of the issuing insurance company is paramount, as annuities are not FDIC-insured. While state guarantee associations offer a safety net, coverage is limited. The current high-interest-rate environment can provide a larger safety cushion for insurers, but the biggest long-term threat to an annuity's value is inflation eroding its purchasing power over time. Experts advise carefully selecting the right type of annuity and considering products with inflation protection features. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is seeking monetary sanctions against a California-based lawyer who attempted to block his client's deportation, signaling an escalation in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement. The government alleges that attorney Joshua Schroeder made meritless and reckless claims in his court filings on behalf of a Hmong man from Laos. This action follows a March memorandum from President Trump instructing the attorney general to target lawyers pursuing "frivolous" lawsuits against the government. Advocates warn this move is intended to intimidate immigration lawyers and weaponize the justice system against those opposing the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have intensified their bombardment of residential areas in Gaza City, with the local civil defense agency reporting massive destruction and an inability to rescue the dead and injured. This military action coincides with a joint statement from the UK, EU, and other nations warning that a famine is actively unfolding in the territory. The allies are demanding Israel take immediate steps to facilitate aid entry and stop using lethal force near distribution sites. The World Health Organization has also appealed for access to pre-stock medical supplies ahead of a potential full-scale occupation of the city.</p>
