The company saw a 10% overall revenue increase, driven by a 13% rise in iPhone sales. While Mac and Services divisions also grew, iPad and wearables sales declined. Notably, sales in China reversed a downward trend, which CEO Tim Cook partially attributed to a government subsidy program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide this year, has expressed shock over President Trump's recent comments. Trump stated that he became upset with Epstein for "stealing" employees, including Giuffre, from his Mar-a-Lago club. In a statement, Giuffre's family questioned whether Trump was aware of the criminal activities of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at the time. The White House responded by reiterating that Trump had banned Epstein from his club for inappropriate behavior.</p>

The new venue, with a seating capacity of 650, is intended to eliminate the need for temporary tents for large events like state dinners. The estimated $200 million cost will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, with construction slated to begin in September. The project involves replacing the current East Wing with a structure designed to match the White House's architectural heritage.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that changes to federal student loan programs within a new law will make professional education less accessible. The law caps federal loans for professional-school students at $50,000 per year, creating a significant funding gap for degrees in law and medicine where costs are much higher. The author suggests this will disproportionately affect working-class students who lack the credit history for more expensive private loans. The article urges California to create its own state-level loan program to counteract these federal changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new sequel to "The Naked Gun" is praised as a surprisingly effective and hilarious revival of the classic comedy franchise. The article commends the film for faithfully adhering to the absurd, deadpan humor of the original series while finding a worthy successor to Leslie Nielsen in Liam Neeson. Neeson is celebrated for his unexpectedly entertaining performance as Frank Drebin Jr., skillfully handling both wordplay and physical comedy. The film is positioned as a successful delivery of irreverent fun and nostalgia for audiences.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, with 250 remaining to protect federal property. The troops were initially deployed by the Trump administration two months ago to manage protests related to federal immigration policies. The deployment was met with resistance from California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, who argued it was unnecessary. The withdrawal was praised by local politicians, who are continuing to push for the removal of all remaining troops.</p>

The reversal came after thousands of young Ukrainians participated in the largest anti-government demonstrations since Russia's full-scale invasion. Protesters argued that safeguarding the autonomy of these agencies was vital for Ukraine's path toward EU membership and maintaining crucial financial support from Western partners. The government's quick U-turn is seen as a victory for civil society, though it has raised some questions about the administration's reform commitments.</p>

          <h2>The Historical Roots of the Attention Economy and Modern Media Anxiety</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 16:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This article explores the origins of the modern attention economy, tracing today's anxieties about digital media back to the rise of the daily newspaper in the 19th century. Critics at the time, like Henry David Thoreau, warned that the constant churn of sensational news was diminishing intellect. The author draws parallels between these historical concerns and contemporary fears about the internet, social media, and artificial intelligence. The article questions if the current moment is different, as machines increasingly perform our intellectual and emotional labor.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has opened its 1,000th new bank branch since beginning a major expansion plan in 2018, with the milestone location opening in Charlotte, North Carolina. This growth has given the firm approximately 5,000 branches, the most of any U.S. bank, and a presence in all 48 contiguous states. The strategy runs counter to the post-financial crisis trend of branch closures, as JPMorgan aims to capture more deposits by expanding its physical footprint. The bank plans to open another 500 new locations by 2027.</p>

          <p>Residents of the Venice Canals neighborhood in Los Angeles are seeking answers after seven dogs have died and others have fallen ill from a mysterious illness. The affected dogs, all previously healthy, experienced a sudden onset of symptoms including lethargy, nausea, and seizures.

The concerned community has posted warnings and is sharing information to protect their pets.</p>

          <p>England's bowlers showed moments of both brilliance and inconsistency on the opening day of the fifth Test against India, who finished on 204-6. Bowler Josh Tongue was particularly erratic, taking key wickets but also conceding numerous extras. The day was further complicated for England when key pace bowler Chris Woakes suffered a shoulder injury while fielding and is now expected to miss the rest of the match. Despite the challenging conditions, an unbeaten partnership from India's lower order left the day's honors relatively even.</p>

          <p>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a federal agency distributing over $12 billion to health programs, has lost about a quarter of its staff due to Trump administration purges. Former agency leaders warn these cuts threaten HRSA's ability to manage grants that support community health centers, addiction treatment, and rural hospitals. The staffing reduction has already led to the cancellation of at least one scholarship program for disadvantaged health students. The situation raises serious concerns about the stability of the nation's health care safety net.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Sean "Diddy" Combs have filed a motion asking a judge to either throw out his two felony convictions for transportation to engage in prostitution or grant him a new trial. The filing argues the convictions represent an unprecedented and improper application of the federal Mann Act, as there was no evidence of coercion or commercial motive. Combs was acquitted of more serious charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking. His lawyers contend the jury was prejudiced by inflammatory evidence related to the charges he was cleared of.</p>
