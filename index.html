          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed President Donald Trump's response to Ukraine's drone operation on Russian military airfields, emphasizing the need to end the war through negotiation. Leavitt sidestepped questions about Trump's reaction to talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, deferring to the president for any specific response. Trump has consistently advocated for a negotiated resolution to the conflict, highlighting the devastating consequences and loss of life on both sides. The administration's focus remains on bringing the war to an end at the negotiating table, as conveyed to both leaders publicly and privately.</p>

          <p>Economists are raising concerns about a G.O.P. bill that proposes increasing the deficit during a period of economic stability. They warn that the substantial deficits are already causing unease among bond investors, which could make it more challenging to respond effectively to future economic crises. The economists argue that increasing the deficit when the economy is not in recession is fiscally irresponsible and could have long-term negative consequences. This critique highlights the ongoing debate about fiscal policy and the potential risks associated with increasing government debt, especially during times of relative economic prosperity (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>CBS News suggests that opening a $10,000 long-term certificate of deposit (CD) in June 2025 could be a wise financial decision for many savers. With potential rate cuts looming from the Federal Reserve later in the summer, securing a CD now can lock in current rates, which are still in the 4% range. A long-term CD also provides protection against market volatility, offering a fixed interest rate regardless of market changes. Depending on the CD term, savers can earn hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest, making it a simple and safe way to grow their money (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has removed its list of "sanctuary jurisdictions" from its website, which previously identified areas that allegedly undermine immigration law enforcement. A senior Homeland Security official stated that the list is under constant review and subject to change, with designations based on factors such as self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with federal immigration laws, and restrictions on information sharing. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem indicated that the list is still being used to identify jurisdictions not honoring law and justice, despite some cities pushing back against their inclusion. The removal of the list reflects ongoing debate and scrutiny surrounding sanctuary policies and their impact on immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Campbell's CEO Mick Beekhuizen noted that consumers are cooking at home at levels not seen since the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating a shift in consumer behavior due to economic concerns. This trend spans across all income brackets within the meals and beverages category, mirroring the uncertainty felt during the pandemic's initial economic disruptions. The increased cooking at home suggests that people are tightening their wallets in response to economic pressures and uncertainties. These observations from the Pepperidge Farm and V-8 maker come as economists consider the potential impacts of President Trump's tariff policies on consumer sentiment and the overall economy. The rise in at-home cooking is a notable indicator of how economic factors influence everyday consumer choices. Optimism about the economy is tempered given the potential for recessionary fears. </p>

Etna is known for its frequent eruptions, and this event follows a significant eruption just over a year ago, with the current activity caused by the collapse of part of the southeast crater.

Since Benjamin Mendy's departure, City has used various players in the position, including Oleksandr Zinchenko, Joao Cancelo, and Josko Gvardiol. While youngster Nico O'Reilly filled the role towards the end of last season, Guardiola is keen to find a permanent solution. Although no agreement is yet in place, sources are optimistic that the transfer of the 23-year-old Algeria international will be completed, providing City with a much-needed specialist in the left-back position.</p>

The review identifies Russia as an immediate threat, China as a persistent challenge, and Iran and North Korea as regional disruptors, warning of alarming new threats and vulnerabilities.

Lyons announced the results of a May operation in Massachusetts, where nearly 1,500 immigrants were taken into custody, many with criminal histories. He argued that sanctuary city policies, which limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers, make such operations necessary, and said that the White House is aiming for 3,000 arrests by ICE each day.

Vanasse highlighted that lethality extends beyond physical fitness, encompassing tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership.

Russia's demands include Ukrainian military withdrawal from occupied regions, recognition of annexed territories, and a ban on Ukraine joining military alliances.

The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide due to a "deteriorating mental state" precipitated by the Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) decision.
