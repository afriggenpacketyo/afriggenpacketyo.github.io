          <p>A U.S. appeals court has permitted the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, overturning a lower court's injunction against the action. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the plan was a "measured response" to ongoing protests, siding with the Justice Department's argument that troops are needed to protect federal property. However, the deployment is not yet certain, as a second, broader order from the lower court blocking any troop deployment to Oregon remains in effect. The decision has drawn praise from the White House and sharp criticism from Oregon officials, who fear it grants the president excessive power.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the Sydney-based Lowy Institute recommends the formation of a new intelligence-sharing alliance named “Pacific Eyes” to counteract China's growing influence in the Pacific Islands. The proposed body would help address institutional weaknesses in the region that external powers, particularly Beijing, are leveraging for their own strategic advantage. According to the study, China has made significant security advancements in the Pacific in recent years, creating an environment of heightened geopolitical competition. The alliance would aim to strengthen regional stability by providing a coordinated intelligence framework for Pacific Island nations and their partners.</p>

          <h2>New Tariffs on Imported Goods Expected to Worsen U.S. Housing Market Affordability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 07:28:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent implementation of new U.S. tariffs on imported building materials, such as kitchen cabinets and timber, is creating additional financial strain on the American housing market. Homebuilders and renovators are already facing inflated costs, with one New Jersey homeowner reporting his budget increased from $300,000 to $450,000 even before the latest levies took effect. While the White House claims the tariffs will support domestic manufacturing, economists warn they will likely slow construction and exacerbate affordability issues. This adds to previous tariffs on steel and copper, with reports suggesting that consumers will ultimately bear a significant portion of these increased costs.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Atlanta arrested a man at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport who had allegedly threatened to commit a mass shooting. The suspect's family alerted police after he streamed on social media that he was heading to the airport with an assault rifle to "shoot it up." Police apprehended the 49-year-old man, a felon with known mental health challenges, as he was reportedly returning to his truck to retrieve the weapon. An AR-15 with 27 rounds of ammunition was found in his vehicle. Officials praised the family's intervention and the swift police collaboration for preventing a potential tragedy at the world's busiest airport.</p>

          <p>Nicolas Sarkozy has become the first former French president to be imprisoned, starting a five-year sentence for conspiring to illegally finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The 70-year-old, who maintains his innocence and has appealed the verdict, is being held in the isolation wing of Paris's La Santé prison for his safety. As he entered the facility, Sarkozy released a statement asserting he was an innocent man and a victim of a "will for revenge." The historic event has drawn mixed reactions in France, with President Emmanuel Macron acknowledging the human difficulty of the situation while respecting the judicial decision.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola's third-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, yet the company noted that consumer demand for its beverages remains weak. The beverage giant reported an adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents on $12.41 billion in adjusted revenue, slightly above analyst forecasts. While global unit case volume saw a modest 1% increase, key markets like North America and Latin America remained flat, suggesting that lower-income consumers are still hesitant to spend. The company's water, sports, coffee, and tea segments drove the volume growth, while its flagship sparkling soft drinks saw no change and its juice segment declined.</p>

Giuffre, a victim of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, describes being directed by Ghislaine Maxwell to engage in sexual activity with the prince.

Court documents reveal that Christopher Moynihan sent text messages stating his intent to "eliminate" Jeffries during an event in New York City. Moynihan, who was previously convicted of obstructing an official proceeding, now faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat. This arrest highlights growing concerns about recidivism among pardoned rioters and contributes to a significant increase in threats made against members of Congress in the past year.</p>

          <p>The rapid construction of power-intensive data centers, driven by the AI boom, is contributing to rising electricity costs for households across the United States. Tech companies are aggressively securing energy capacity for both existing and future facilities, creating a "land rush" that drives up power prices even before the centers are built. In Maryland, consumer advocates have asked the regional grid operator to address this energy speculation, as ratepayers are already funding infrastructure for demand that may never materialize. This mismatch between the tech industry's rapid energy acquisition and the grid's supply capabilities is leading to significantly higher wholesale electricity prices.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that black garden ants actively redesign their nests to reduce the transmission of deadly pathogens, a concept termed "architectural immunity." When exposed to a lethal fungus, the ants build more compartmentalized and less interconnected nests with entrances spaced farther apart, effectively creating a form of social distancing. These structural modifications complement their known behavioral changes, such as self-isolation by infected individuals, to protect the colony's most valuable members, like the queen and nurses. Scientists suggest these findings could offer inspiration for designing human public spaces that better balance functionality with disease prevention.</p>

The CIA's role involves using satellites and signal intercepts to identify and track vessels, then recommending targets for missile strikes carried out by the U.S. military. This reliance on the CIA means that the evidence used to justify these strikes will likely remain classified, shielding it from public or legal scrutiny. The practice has drawn criticism from international law experts, who argue that using deadly force against civilians on the high seas is illegal.</p>

          <p>A growing number of federal judges, including those appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents, are issuing strong rebukes to the Trump administration's policies on crime and immigration. Courts have challenged the factual basis for executive actions, such as the deployment of National Guard troops to cities like Portland and Chicago, ruling that the administration's claims of emergency were often "untethered to the facts." Legal scholars observe that this judicial pushback reflects a deep skepticism toward the administration's expansive claims of executive power and its contempt for the rule of law.

          <p>In a personal essay, a resident of Gaza reflects on the profound sense of unease and loss that accompanies a ceasefire after two years of devastating war. The author describes how the pause in fighting does not bring relief but instead allows the return of painful thoughts and the immense task of counting the dead and surveying the destruction. With civil infrastructure ground to dust and daily life completely upended, the ceasefire feels less like peace and more like a fragile limbo. For many, especially young people whose education and futures are on hold, it marks the beginning of a different kind of war—one of grief, memory, and uncertain reconstruction.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently imposed peace plan for Gaza has put him at odds with Israel's far-right, which had expected his support for resettling the territory. The agreement explicitly rejects Israeli territorial claims on Gaza and has angered hardline politicians like Limor Son Har-Melech, who advocate for Jewish settlements in the area. This development follows Trump's earlier declaration that he would not permit Israel to annex the West Bank. While the plan has momentarily sidelined the settler movement's influence, analysts suggest its activists will exploit any delays or skirmishes in the fragile ceasefire to advance their agenda, creating an ongoing challenge for the administration's diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Belize has agreed to act as a "safe third country" for migrants seeking asylum in the U.S., allowing Washington to deport certain asylum seekers to the Central American nation instead of their home countries. The U.S. State Department hailed the deal as a significant step toward curbing illegal immigration and abuse of the asylum system. Belize's prime minister framed it as a job program for qualified individuals, stating the country would prioritize migrants from Central America. However, human rights groups have criticized such agreements, warning they could endanger migrants by sending them to countries where they may face harm.</p>

          <p>A recent poll conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation indicates that a plurality of Taiwanese people do not believe President Trump is serious about defending the island from a potential Chinese invasion. Nearly 45% of respondents said they thought Trump was unwilling to prevent an attack by force, compared to just over 34% who believed he would. The survey reflects growing pessimism and wavering confidence in the United States as a reliable security partner for Taiwan. This skepticism has reportedly been on the rise during Trump's second term, with a previous poll showing a majority no longer viewed Washington as dependable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Internet activist Cory Doctorow's theory of "enshittification" describes a three-stage process by which online platforms degrade over time. Initially, platforms attract users with good services, often subsidized by investor cash. Next, they pivot to benefit business customers at the expense of users, such as by altering feeds to prioritize paid content. Finally, once both users and businesses are locked in, the platform squeezes value from its business customers and delivers a poor experience to everyone, turning into what Doctorow calls "a pile of shit." He argues this pattern, seen in companies like Amazon and Facebook, is driven by a lack of competition and insufficient regulation.</p>

          <p>The president of a citrus producers association in Michoacan, Mexico, was found killed in his vehicle after publicly condemning cartel extortion. Bernardo Bravo had recently given interviews detailing how organized crime groups were making unsustainable financial demands on lime growers, leaving them with no choice but to negotiate. This murder highlights the ongoing violence and control exerted by cartels over agricultural industries in the region, including limes and avocados. Despite federal troop deployment last year to protect growers, criminal groups continue to demand a share of their income, creating a climate of fear and impunity.</p>

The strike utilizes a new online tool that helps tenants document issues and generate formal dispute letters to challenge debt collectors.

          <p>Scientists report that the population of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale has grown slightly for the fourth consecutive year, reaching an estimated 384 individuals. This slow but encouraging recovery follows a significant decline in the previous decade due to ship collisions and entanglement in fishing gear. Researchers credit conservation efforts, particularly new protective measures in Canadian waters, for the positive trend. While the population remains fragile, there are also promising signs of improved reproduction, with several new mother whales giving birth this year, offering cautious optimism for the species' future survival.</p>

The exhibition gains urgency as the Trump administration begins reinstalling some of these memorials. One featured piece is a statue of Gen.

The collapse is attributed to pressures from tariffs and a complex, opaque debt structure involving lightly-regulated private creditors.

The incident occurred during a dress rehearsal for an event celebrating the Marine Corps' 250th birthday.
