          <p>The winning numbers for Saturday's estimated $700 million Powerball jackpot were announced: 11, 14, 34, 47, 51, and Powerball 18. This marks the 36th consecutive drawing without a grand prize winner, leading to a cash option of $316.3 million before taxes. While no one matched all six numbers, several players won smaller prizes, including a Tennessee player who secured $2 million. The current jackpot is the largest of 2025, though it remains below last year's $1.3 billion record.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, an El Salvadoran national, is at the center of a contentious immigration case after being mistakenly deported to El Salvador and now facing a threat of deportation to Uganda. Despite a 2019 court order protecting him from return to El Salvador due to gang persecution fears, the Trump administration initially deported him and later arrested him on human smuggling charges upon his US return. His lawyers argue the latest deportation threat is vindictive, highlighting concerns about due process in the administration's immigration policies. The case draws significant attention to the broader implications of US immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock plunged, losing nearly $100 million in market value, following the release of a new, cleaner logo that removes the traditional overall-clad man. This redesign is part of CEO Julie Felss Masino's broader strategy to modernize the 55-year-old chain's image, including new menu items and store aesthetics. While the company states its values remain unchanged, the move drew criticism from conservative commentators and marketing experts, with some labeling it "woke" and a "fiasco" for potentially alienating long-time customers. The company's revenue growth has slowed, and net income declined in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper aims to address "unacceptable delays" in appeals, which currently average over a year for 51,000 pending cases, leading to failed asylum seekers being housed at taxpayer expense. This move comes amid increasing pressure to end reliance on asylum hotels and public protests against their use. The government plans to provide further details on speeding up cases this autumn.</p>

While some practitioners see it as slowing the aging process, others, like consultant plastic surgeon Nora Nugent, advise against starting too early, calling it a waste of money for those with minimal lines.

          <p>Israeli strikes and shootings in Gaza killed at least 33 people, including those sheltering in tents and seeking food aid, as a leading authority declared famine in Gaza City. This rare pronouncement, the first in the Middle East, intensifies global calls for Israel to halt its 22-month offensive, initiated after Hamas's October 7, 2023, attacks. Israel dismisses the famine declaration as false, while preparing for a Gaza City offensive. Ceasefire efforts are on hold as mediators await Israel's response to a new Hamas proposal, with US President Trump expressing frustration over Hamas's stance.</p>

          <p>Lt. General Jeffrey Kruse has been removed as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a move that has raised concerns about the politicization of intelligence within the Trump administration. The ousting follows the DIA's assessment that military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities only set back Tehran's program by months, contradicting President Trump's claim of "decades." Senator Mark Warner criticized the administration for treating intelligence as a "loyalty test." Other senior military officials, including Rear Adm. Milton Sands and Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, have also been removed from their posts.</p>

          <p>The United States immigrant population has decreased by over a million people since Donald Trump took office in January, marking the first decline in over 50 years. A Pew Research Center study indicates the number dropped from 53.3 million to 51.9 million by June 2025. This shift is attributed to the Trump administration's 181 executive actions targeting immigration, including asylum restrictions and mass deportations. The article notes a significant drop in Mexican-born residents and 750,000 immigrant workers leaving the labor force, highlighting a major demographic and policy impact.</p>

          <p>At a closed French marine zoo, a male orca named Keijo is being sexually stimulated by trainers to prevent him from inbreeding with his mother, Wikie. This unusual practice comes as Marineland Antibes faces an impasse over rehoming the orcas, ahead of a December law banning whales in marine shows. Animal rights activists obtained footage of the stimulation, raising concerns about the ethics and the potential for semen collection for sale to less regulated facilities. Managers defend the action as necessary to relieve Keijo's sexual urges and prevent injury, denying any intent to sell semen.</p>

This disclosure sparked anger from relatives and the brothers’ attorney, who argued it compromised the fairness of Lyle’s subsequent hearing, calling it an attempt to create a "public spectacle."

Shippers cite ambiguous policies and insufficient time to establish new logistics systems for collecting duties and transmitting data to US Customs and Border Protection.

          <p>The UK government is planning an overhaul of sentencing rules, allowing courts to impose non-custodial penalties such as bans from pubs, concerts, sports matches, and travel. These reforms aim to "toughen up community punishments" and deter reoffending, as well as address prison overcrowding by reducing custodial sentences for less serious offenses. Additionally, offenders released on probation could face similar restrictions and increased mandatory drug testing. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated these measures are part of Labour's plan to cut crime and enhance public safety.</p>
