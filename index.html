          <p>A federal judge is demanding answers regarding the potential deportation of a two-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras alongside her mother and sister. The judge expressed concern that the deportation may have occurred without due process, especially since the child was born in Louisiana and is a U.S. citizen. Despite being informed of the child's citizenship and provided with a birth certificate, ICE proceeded with the deportation. A hearing is scheduled for May 16 to further investigate the matter and determine if the child's rights were violated.</p>

          <p>A federal judge strongly criticized the government's attempt to deport a Venezuelan couple legally residing in the U.S., accusing them of gang membership without providing sufficient evidence. The judge ordered their release and barred the administration from removing anyone under the Alien Enemies Act in the Western District of Texas without adequate notice. The couple, who fled Venezuela in 2022 and were granted Temporary Protected Status, were arrested based on claims of association with a foreign terrorist organization, a claim the judge found unsupported.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers across the UK are struggling to book driving tests due to an ongoing backlog, with some comparing the process to buying festival tickets. The average waiting time is 22 weeks, with many centers at the maximum of 24 weeks, prompting learners to book far in advance and potentially requiring refresher lessons. The DVSA has blamed increased demand and booking behavior, as well as bots buying up slots, and aims to reduce wait times by summer 2026.</p>

          <p>The area burned by wildfires in the UK this year has already surpassed the total for any year in over a decade, with over 29,200 hectares affected. Prolonged dry weather in March and early April created ideal conditions for widespread burning, with most fires started by humans. Researchers are concerned about a potential second peak in the fire season later in the year and scientists anticipate an increase in extreme wildfire conditions due to climate change.</p>

          <p>A miniature dachshund named Valerie has been rescued after surviving 529 days in the Australian wilderness. Valerie had been lost while camping, and volunteers spent over 1,000 hours searching for her. The rescue involved surveillance cameras, a trap cage with a remote door system, and clothing from Valerie's owner to create a scent trail, leading to her successful capture and return.</p>
