          <p>Boeing's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month, ending a pause caused by trade tensions. Ortberg dismissed concerns about the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs, noting that Boeing already pays tariffs on imported components for its Dreamliner planes but can recoup much of it upon export. The company, a major U.S. exporter, is also planning to increase production of its 737 Max aircraft. This resumption of deliveries is a positive sign for Boeing's financial outlook and its relationship with China, a key market for the company.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade struck down most of President Trump's tariffs, a significant blow to his economic policies. The ruling voids a 10% baseline tariff on most countries and blocks levies on China, Mexico, and Canada, but does not affect tariffs on specific sectors like steel and aluminum. The court's decision was unanimous, with three judges ruling that Trump exceeded his legal authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. The Trump administration has already appealed the decision, setting the stage for a legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is giving Harvard University 30 days to challenge the revocation of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification. This notice comes after Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced the termination of Harvard's SEVP certification, citing the university's alleged failure to provide information about international students and its creation of an unsafe campus environment. Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the revocation violates the school's free speech rights and due process protections, and is retaliatory. A U.S. District Judge plans to issue a preliminary injunction to prevent the revocation without due process.</p>

          <p>A search operation was suspended for a missing 64-year-old man after a partial glacier collapse triggered a massive landslide that buried 90% of the village of Blatten, Switzerland. The landslide, caused by a chunk of the Birch Glacier breaking off, sent mud and rocks cascading into the valley, destroying homes and infrastructure. Authorities had evacuated around 300 people from the village earlier this month as a precaution, and are now assessing the risk of an ice jam that could cause further flooding. Swiss glaciologists have expressed concerns about the accelerated retreat of glaciers due to global warming, with Switzerland losing 4% of its glacier volume in 2023.</p>

          <p>Complaints regarding substandard living conditions in social housing in England have increased more than fivefold in the last five years, according to a report by the Housing Ombudsman. The watchdog warns of a growing imbalance of power between tenants and landlords, with issues such as asbestos, electrical and fire safety problems, pest control, and leaks contributing to a breakdown in trust. The report calls for a transformative overhaul of the system, including an independent review of funding practices and the establishment of a national tenant body. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has stated that everyone deserves a safe place to live, emphasizing the importance of housing in his government's work.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that home equity loan and HELOC rates are unlikely to drop in June, remaining stable with a risk of increases due to economic uncertainty and potential inflationary effects from tariffs. While the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation, its plans to lower rates may be delayed. Home equity loans offer fixed rates, while HELOCs have variable rates that adjust monthly based on the prime rate. Despite higher interest rates, these borrowing options can still be more competitive than credit cards or personal loans, but homeowners should be comfortable with the total borrowing amount and monthly payments.

          <p>Astronomers searching for the elusive "Planet Nine" have discovered a new dwarf planet, named 2017 OF201, in the outer reaches of the solar system. The object, roughly 430 miles across, is three times smaller than Pluto and has an extremely elongated orbit that takes 25,000 years to complete. This discovery could challenge the Planet Nine theory, as the new dwarf planet's orbit does not follow the clustered trend of similar objects. Researchers are requesting time to use the James Webb, Hubble, and ALMA telescopes to study the dwarf planet further, which could shed light on the mysteries of the outer solar system.</p>

          <p>A recent court ruling blocking some of President Trump's tariffs has limited impact on the US-UK trade deal, as the tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are significant UK exports, remain in place. Although the UK has secured a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, the agreement has not yet been implemented. The ruling does prevent Trump from imposing blanket tariffs of 10% on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision. This uncertainty makes it difficult for businesses to plan and invest confidently.</p>

          <p>After a U.S. court blocked President Trump's tariffs, the administration has several options to pursue its trade agenda. Goldman Sachs economists suggest the White House could use Section 122 of U.S. trade law to quickly impose similar tariffs, launch Section 301 investigations, or broaden Section 232 tariffs. The Trump administration has appealed the court ruling, and the case could ultimately reach the Supreme Court.

          <h2>Salesforce Shares Fall Despite Earnings Beat</h2>

          <p>Salesforce shares declined despite the company exceeding Wall Street's fiscal first-quarter estimates and raising its full-year guidance, driven by artificial intelligence tailwinds. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share between $11.27 and $11.33 and revenue between $41.0 billion and $41.3 billion for the fiscal year. Analysts attributed the stock's decline to a slight miss on current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter and a slight operating margin miss. Salesforce recently announced its intention to acquire data management company Informatica for $8 billion to enhance its AI offerings.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the reach of environmental impact statements, ruling in favor of developers in a unanimous decision. Justice Brett Kavanaugh stated that environmental impact claims have been used too often to delay or block new projects, hindering infrastructure development. The ruling supports the developers of a proposed 88-mile railroad in Utah, which could carry crude oil to refineries along the Gulf Coast. The decision is expected to streamline the approval process for future development projects.</p>

          <p>An op-ed challenges Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's assertion that U.S. export controls on AI chips have backfired and accelerated China's tech independence. The author argues that China's efforts to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers predated the 2022 restrictions and that the U.S. cannot afford to fuel the military rise of its chief strategic rival. The op-ed suggests that Nvidia should focus on competing against China in other markets rather than prioritizing its diminishing market share in China. The piece concludes that U.S. semiconductor policy is about protecting America's strategic edge, not corporate profits.</p>
