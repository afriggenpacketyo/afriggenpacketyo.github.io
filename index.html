Beijing has been focused on bolstering domestic firms like Huawei to create its own AI chip ecosystem in response to U.S. export curbs.

Local authorities have the autonomy to raise the tax by up to 4.99% annually without central government approval. The Spending Review assumes councils will implement the maximum increase, contributing to an average 2.3% annual rise in "police spending power" in real terms. Chancellor Rachel Reeves clarified that the 5% increase is a cap, not a mandatory requirement, and the funds are intended for services like social care and policing.</p>

While some acknowledge Trump as a strong leader, overall ratings of the U.S. have declined in several countries.

The strategy involves DHS dismissing cases and then arresting migrants at court, catching judges and lawyers off guard. This tactic is one of several the Trump administration has used to streamline cases and quickly deport people without legal status from the U.S. Critics argue this approach bypasses the legal system and denies people a fair opportunity to present their case, while ICE maintains it is following the law by placing illegal aliens in expedited removal.</p>

          <p>A longtime federal employee, Michele Santa Maria, faces a significant reduction in her retirement income due to a provision in the House-passed version of President Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill." The bill would eliminate a special retirement supplement for federal employees who retire before they're old enough to collect Social Security, impacting those younger than 57 on January 1, 2028. Santa Maria, who retired early due to fears of being laid off, estimates she'll lose close to $110,000 over five years if the cut is approved, money she was counting on to support her in retirement.

          <p>House Republicans are considering a plan that would require colleges and universities to reimburse the federal government for a portion of the federal loan debt their students do not repay, aiming to make schools have "a little skin in the game." The proposal would penalize institutions whose students leave with high debt and low earnings potential, while rewarding schools that provide good value for the money. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the plan would save the government over $6 billion in a decade, but experts point out flaws, such as omitting defaulted loans from the calculation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is ending some protections for Afghans who fled their country due to Taliban threats, causing fear and uncertainty among those living in the U.S. with humanitarian parole or Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sent emails to thousands of Afghans, stating their parole would be terminated, while Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced the termination of TPS for Afghanistan, citing an improved security situation and stabilizing economy. Immigration advocates and experts dispute these claims, highlighting ongoing violence and human rights abuses by the Taliban, and worry about the safety of those forced to return.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has determined that Iran has failed to meet its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years, potentially complicating talks between Iran and the US over a new nuclear agreement. The IAEA report cited a general lack of "co-operation" from Iran and raised concerns over secret activities and undeclared nuclear material. The resolution passed by the IAEA board of governors carries the threat of an eventual referral to the UN Security Council. Iran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and that it would never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.</p>

The latest GDP figures show a shrinking economy, underlining the challenges the government faces in delivering growth.

          <p>China's military mouthpiece, PLA Daily, has called for the large-scale and centralized deployment of unmanned combat forces at key locations to fully realize their potential in future intelligent warfare. The article emphasizes the "decisive and dominant" role of unmanned systems, including the capability to conduct close-range precision strikes. Citing efforts by Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S. to build unmanned systems forces, the PLA Daily argues that massed deployment of unmanned systems has become a "consensus" in military modernization. This reflects the intensifying strategic and technological rivalry between the U.S. and China, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Guardian columnist Zoe Williams argues that while protests can be used by authoritarian rulers to justify displays of force, they are still necessary to resist oppression. She notes that the protests sparked by immigration raids in Los Angeles are not symbolic but aim to prevent the arrest of community members. Williams emphasizes the importance of taking action and maintaining hope in the face of fear and hopelessness fostered by autocratic states. The column highlights the tension between the potential for protests to be exploited by tyrants and the need to resist injustice.</p>
