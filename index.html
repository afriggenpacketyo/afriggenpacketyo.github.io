          <p>Storm Amy has impacted the UK with powerful winds and heavy rain, leading to widespread power outages affecting tens of thousands of homes, particularly in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The storm recorded a gust of 96mph and set a new record for the lowest atmospheric pressure in the UK for October. Tragically, a man died in a weather-related incident in Ireland, while significant travel disruptions, including flight and train cancellations, continue across the region.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly ordered the military to cease all offensive operations in the Gaza Strip, permitting only defensive actions. This move follows Hamas's acceptance of key parts of a peace plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which includes an end to the war and the release of hostages. The World Health Organization has endorsed the plan, and Israel is preparing to send a negotiating team, signaling a potential de-escalation of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on pro-Palestinian demonstrators to "recognise and respect the grief of British Jews" by reconsidering protests planned for this weekend, following a recent synagogue attack. Police leaders have expressed concerns that the marches will strain resources needed to protect Jewish communities, describing the timing as "phenomenally tone deaf." Despite these appeals from political and police leaders, protest organizers have stated their intention to proceed, asserting that canceling peaceful protests allows terror to win.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown enters its fourth day, a federal budget expert highlights two critical upcoming dates: the missed paychecks for essential federal workers on October 10 and for military personnel on October 15. These deadlines are expected to intensify pressure on both Democrats and Republicans to reach a compromise, as neither party wants to be blamed for withholding pay from these groups. The shutdown began after Democrats rejected a temporary spending bill, demanding extensions for Affordable Care Act tax credits, leading to a political stalemate with significant consequences.</p>

          <p>The Federal Election Commission (FEC), the agency responsible for regulating U.S. campaign finance, is effectively paralyzed after another commissioner's resignation left it with only two of the required four members for a quorum. This halt prevents the FEC from conducting investigations, issuing penalties, or making policy decisions, though routine financial reporting continues. The lack of a functioning watchdog raises concerns about the enforcement of campaign finance laws, especially with elections approaching, although some experts note the agency's effectiveness was already limited by partisan deadlock.</p>

          <p>A lifelong Manchester United supporter has seen the cost of his season ticket double after being forced to relocate his seat of over 40 years to make way for a new corporate zone at Old Trafford. The 81-year-old fan, Michael Carney, now pays £840 for a less desirable seat, a result of both the move and a reduction in the pensioner discount. This change is part of minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe's strategy to increase club revenues, but it has left loyal, long-standing fans feeling alienated and questioning the club's soul amid poor on-field performances.</p>

Researchers speculate the massive statue could have been transported to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo, though some scholars in China are contesting this surprising historical claim.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, is set to appear on the night of October 7th, appearing larger and brighter than a typical full moon. This event occurs when the full moon coincides with its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, a point known as the perigee. It will be the first of three back-to-back supermoons, with the next two occurring in November and December, offering sky-gazers multiple opportunities to view the enhanced lunar spectacle.</p>

          <h2>New Saudi-Pakistani Defense Agreement Creates a Nuclear Dilemma for China</h2>

          <p>A recently signed defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, which a Saudi official confirmed would "encompass all military means," is raising questions about a potential Pakistani nuclear umbrella for Riyadh. This development presents a complex dilemma for China, which maintains strong ties with both nations and has a civilian nuclear partnership with Saudi Arabia. Analysts believe Beijing will be hesitant to see this collaboration expand into the military sphere to avoid provoking the U.S. or being seen as encouraging nuclear proliferation.</p>
