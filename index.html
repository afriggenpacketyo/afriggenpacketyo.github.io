          <p>This opinion piece analyzes how Donald Trump's past relationship with Jeffrey Epstein has become an indelible part of his political identity, fueling conspiracy theories that he and his allies initially encouraged. The article argues that after the administration debunked the existence of a secret "client list," Trump now faces a credibility gap with his own base, which continues to be fixated on the affair. The author suggests that this unresolved controversy remains a persistent and damaging issue for the presidency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive tariff strategy is facing scrutiny as evidence suggests it is contributing to rising consumer prices, contrary to White House assertions. Economic models project the tariffs will slightly dent U.S. economic growth and temporarily increase inflation, impacting consumer spending. The Federal Reserve is maintaining a cautious hold on interest rates as it assesses the full economic impact, while President Trump has publicly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting rates sooner.

          <p>Texas has enacted a new law, the Life of the Mother Act, which aims to provide clarity for doctors regarding the state's abortion ban in medical emergencies. The law specifies that a pregnant woman's death or impairment does not have to be "imminent" for an abortion to be permissible and confirms the burden of proof lies with the state in any legal challenge. While it represents a rare bipartisan effort, some reproductive rights advocates and patients argue it falls short of providing true safety and does not prevent potential delays in care.</p>

          <p>Tensions are rising in Pakistan as the government has warned the sons of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan not to participate in upcoming nationwide protests demanding his release. Khan's ex-wife, Jemima Goldsmith, accused the government of conducting a "personal vendetta" and preventing the children from communicating with their father. While Khan's PTI party organizes the rallies, government officials have stated that anyone, including Khan's sons, who breaks the law will face legal consequences.</p>

          <p>Italy is grappling with a severe and deepening demographic crisis, as its birth rate has fallen to the lowest level ever recorded at just 1.18 babies per woman. This decline is causing populations in small towns like Fregona to shrink, threatening the viability of local services such as schools. Despite government initiatives, many Italians cite insufficient practical support, like a lack of affordable childcare, as a primary reason for delaying or deciding against having children.</p>

          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers being shut out 2-0 by the Milwaukee Brewers, pitcher Tyler Glasnow's performance was a significant positive. In his second start since returning from injury, Glasnow pitched six impressive innings, allowing only one run while showcasing increased fastball velocity and a more confident approach. His strong outing is a hopeful sign for the Dodgers, who are counting on his health and dependability to strengthen their starting rotation for the rest of the season.</p>

The hearing will focus on strategies to counter what is described as China's "economic coercion against democracies."

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed into law the GENIUS Act, which establishes a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to the U.S. dollar. The bipartisan bill, a significant win for the crypto industry, mandates that stablecoins be backed by liquid assets, aiming to legitimize their use for mainstream payments. Supporters believe the law will reinforce the dollar's global status, while critics raise concerns about insufficient anti-money laundering provisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy may have the unintended effect of awakening dormant cancer cells, potentially accelerating the spread, or metastasis, of cancer to other organs. The findings provide a possible explanation for why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis even after their primary tumors have been successfully treated. The research team is now conducting a clinical trial on a drug combination designed to inhibit this detrimental process.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit seeking at least $10 billion in damages against the Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch. The lawsuit stems from a report detailing a sexually suggestive birthday letter allegedly sent by Trump to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which Trump denies writing. This legal action coincides with the Justice Department moving to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Epstein case, following public and political pressure for greater transparency.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced the elimination of its scientific research arm, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), as part of a major agency reorganization. The move, which the EPA claims will result in significant cost savings, is expected to impact hundreds of scientists and researchers. Critics, including a former senior EPA official, have condemned the decision, warning that dismantling the internationally respected body will severely weaken public health and environmental protections.</p>
