          <p>Amazon is cutting an unspecified number of jobs in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing division as part of its ongoing efforts to streamline operations. The company stated the move is to refocus on key priorities and is not primarily driven by AI investments, though CEO Andy Jassy has previously suggested AI could reduce the corporate workforce. This follows a period of slowing sales growth for AWS and continues a multi-year trend of significant job reductions across the company.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum are visiting Alcatraz to plan for its reopening as a maximum-security prison, a directive issued by President Trump. The move has drawn criticism from Democrats as a wasteful use of resources. Separately, the White House confirmed it will not appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Jeffrey Epstein case, with the press secretary defending the administration's previous probe and labeling the controversy a "hoax."</p>

          <p>Defense contractor L3Harris Technologies has introduced two new long-range missiles, named "Red Wolf" and "Green Wolf," designed to be cost-effective options for the U.S. military. The missiles, which have a range of over 200 nautical miles, are part of a strategy emphasizing "affordable mass" to ensure a plentiful supply of munitions, particularly for deterring China in the Pacific. The Red Wolf is a precision strike missile, while the Green Wolf specializes in electronic warfare and intelligence gathering.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian parliament has approved a significant government reshuffle, appointing former Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, 39, as the new prime minister. She replaces Denys Shmyhal, who had served for over five years. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the changes were necessary to implement agreements with international partners during the ongoing war with Russia. While Svyrydenko is seen as a dynamic and experienced negotiator, analysts suggest key political decisions will likely remain with the president's office.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for all elections, a move ministers say will boost democratic engagement. The proposal has faced criticism that it is politically motivated to benefit the Labour Party, as younger voters tend to lean left. However, political analysts note that while polls support this trend, the actual impact on election results would likely be negligible, given the small percentage of new voters and their historically lower turnout rates.</p>
