          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, was arrested after allegedly firing at least three rounds into the lobby of the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. The incident, which caused property damage but no injuries, is being investigated as a drive-by shooting. After initially being released on bail for local charges, the suspect was rearrested by the FBI on a federal charge. Officials, including California's governor, condemned the act as an attack on journalism and democracy, while the station has increased security for its employees.</p>

          <p>Amid China's ongoing real estate crisis, unfinished and opulent property developments are being repurposed as lavish film sets for the country's rapidly growing micro-drama industry. These short, dramatic series, often centered on urban romance and family feuds, have become immensely popular, with viewership surpassing 660 million people in 2024. This trend provides a new, albeit ironic, source of activity for stalled projects, contrasting the on-screen luxury with the reality of the construction delays and the frustrations of homebuyers still waiting for their promised flats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indefinite suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" by ABC, following the host's comments about Charlie Kirk's assassination, has triggered a significant political controversy. Figures like Kamala Harris condemned the move as an "abuse of power," while critics, including Elon Musk, pointed to her past calls for Donald Trump to be suspended from social media. The Trump administration has denied any involvement in ABC's decision, with the White House press secretary attributing it to Kimmel's ratings and his choice to "knowingly lie" during a time of national mourning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has ignited a contentious debate on Capitol Hill regarding the role of political rhetoric in fostering violence. While lawmakers from both parties have condemned the act, they diverge on the primary cause, with some Republicans accusing the left of creating an "assassination culture" and some Democrats pointing towards gun control as the core issue. The discussion reflects the deep partisan divide in the country, as politicians grapple with how to address inflammatory language and its potential consequences in an increasingly polarized environment.</p>

          <p>A large-scale memorial service was held for conservative organizer Charlie Kirk at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, with speakers including Donald Trump and JD Vance. The event, which drew thousands of attendees, was marked by heavy security following Kirk's assassination at a Utah university campus. The aftermath of his death has intensified national debates, with his allies blaming political opponents for fostering a hostile climate. Meanwhile, federal authorities have reportedly found no link between the suspect, Tyler Robinson, and any organized left-wing groups.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce the United Kingdom's formal recognition of a Palestinian state, marking a significant shift in British foreign policy. The decision follows a deadline given to Israel to agree to a ceasefire and commit to a two-state solution, a prospect diminished by the ongoing war and Israeli settlement expansion. The move has drawn criticism from the Israeli government and some UK conservatives, who argue it rewards terrorism, while the Palestinian Authority has welcomed the pledge.</p>

By using goalkeepers to launch long passes to tall forwards or attacking quickly in transition, these teams are adding unpredictability and minimizing errors in their own half, reflecting a broader tactical trend at the highest level of football.</p>
