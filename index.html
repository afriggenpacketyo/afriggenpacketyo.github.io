          <p>Design software company Figma experienced a 13% drop in its stock price during extended trading after releasing its first quarterly earnings report since its July initial public offering. While the company's revenue of $249.6 million slightly surpassed analyst expectations, its third-quarter revenue forecast suggested a slowdown in growth, which appeared to concern investors. Despite the market reaction, Figma's CEO expressed confidence in the company's future, highlighting recent AI-driven product announcements and strategic acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Key Republican senators on the Senate Banking Committee have stated they will not consider a potential replacement for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook until her lawsuit against President Trump's attempt to fire her is resolved. Senators Mike Rounds and Thom Tillis emphasized that Cook is still a member of the board and must be afforded due process, expressing concern that the move to oust her could be a partisan effort. Their stance is critical as Republican unanimity on the committee would be necessary to advance any new nominee from the president.</p>

          <p>New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel made comments that were interpreted as a slight against his predecessor, Bill Belichick, following Belichick's unsuccessful debut as head coach for the University of North Carolina's football team. After UNC's 48-14 loss, Vrabel was asked if building a college program takes time, to which he contrasted the situation with Urban Meyer's immediate 12-0 record at Ohio State. Vrabel, who coached under Meyer, later qualified his remarks by acknowledging that the college football landscape has likely become more challenging.</p>

While Salesforce maintained its full-year revenue outlook, the disappointing forecast has added to pressure on the company, whose stock has underperformed in the market this year.

          <p>City planners in Anaheim are exploring the possibility of constructing a gondola system to connect major destinations like Angel Stadium, Honda Center, and the Disneyland resort area. This transit option is one of several being considered to improve connectivity between the city's primary visitor hubs, which are approximately three miles apart. A preliminary study commissioned by the city from a gondola company outlined potential designs, including support towers shaped like the stadium's iconic "Big A" landmark, although officials stress the project is still in its very early exploratory stages.</p>

          <p>Conservative media outlet Newsmax has filed a federal lawsuit against rival Fox News, accusing the dominant cable news network of engaging in anticompetitive behavior to maintain a monopoly in the right-leaning news market. The suit alleges that Fox News coerces cable and satellite distributors into restrictive agreements that marginalize or exclude competitors like Newsmax, thereby harming competition and consumers. Newsmax is seeking a permanent injunction against these practices and significant financial damages, while a Fox News spokesperson dismissed the lawsuit as a response to Newsmax's own market failures.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to an estimated $1.4 billion, analysis shows that a winner's take-home amount can vary significantly depending on their state of residence. While all winnings are subject to a 37% federal tax, states like California, Florida, and Texas impose no additional state income tax on lottery prizes. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would see the lowest after-tax payout. This data highlights the considerable financial impact of local tax laws on large lottery windfalls. (not investment advice)</p>

This ruling represents a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy, though the government could still seek to remove the migrants under other legal authorities.</p>
