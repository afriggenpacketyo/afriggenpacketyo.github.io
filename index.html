          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from ICE detention in Louisiana after a federal judge granted bail, superseding an immigration judge's order to keep him detained. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, had been in custody for over three months following his arrest in New York City. The judge criticized the Trump administration's handling of the case, stating there was no evidence Khalil posed a flight risk or danger to the community. Khalil's attorney asserted he was being punished for exercising his First Amendment rights, while the Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge's decision, claiming it undermined national security.</p>

          <p>MLB suspended Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts and San Diego Padres manager Mike Shildt for one game each following a chaotic incident during Thursday night's game. The tension escalated after Dodgers pitcher Jack Little hit Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr., leading to Shildt's ejection and a confrontation with Roberts. Padres reliever Robert Suárez was also suspended three games for intentionally hitting Shohei Ohtani with a pitch later in the game, further inflaming the situation. Despite the Padres winning the game, concern centered on Tatis' injury and the results of his X-ray and CT scan.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles and accused California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent protesters and endangering federal law enforcement. Vance claimed that the city's sanctuary status had created an open season on federal agents, following protests over ICE raids. He defended the deployment of federal troops, stating it was necessary to protect law enforcement, while also misidentifying Senator Alex Padilla as "José Padilla." Newsom's office criticized Vance's visit as a staged photo opportunity during a closed-door fundraiser.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Lime e-bikes have been dumped in rivers and canals across England, raising concerns about pollution, flooding, and damage to infrastructure. The Canal and River Trust reports spending thousands of pounds to retrieve the bikes, with Nottingham being a particular hotspot. Electric bikes pose a pollution risk due to batteries containing harmful substances that can contaminate the water if submerged. Local authorities and environmental groups are urging Lime to address the issue and implement measures to prevent thefts, such as requiring customers to lock bikes in designated bays.</p>

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, the appropriateness of wearing shorts in the office remains a debated topic, with many companies adopting more casual dress codes post-pandemic. Stylists suggest that context is key, with tailored shorts being more acceptable than beach or sports shorts, especially in non-client-facing roles. Some companies have embraced the casual trend, while others maintain expectations of professional attire. Men and women may perceive shorts differently, with some men feeling less comfortable wearing them outside of vacation settings, while others embrace the opportunity to stay cool and comfortable.</p>

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva, with both sides expressing willingness to continue discussions. The U.S. has offered Iran a civilian nuclear program if it agrees not to enrich uranium on its soil, but Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's response remains unclear. Several countries have offered to host direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran, and the situation remains tense.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Nato summit in The Hague will primarily address President Trump's demand for increased defense spending by European allies, with Secretary General Mark Rutte working to accommodate the request. While the summit aims to present a united front, divisions remain between Trump and European allies on trade, Russia, and the Middle East. The summit's format has been shortened, reportedly due to Trump's preferences, and a compromise formula is being sought to increase defense spending to 3.5% of GDP, with an additional 1.5% towards defense-related expenditure.</p>

          <p>During the opening salvo of Operation Rising Lion, Israeli operatives reportedly used a "secret weapon" to simultaneously kill nine of Iran's top nuclear scientists, according to Israel's N12 news outlet. The operation, code-named Operation Narnia, targeted scientists in their homes to prevent any chance of warning or escape. Israeli intelligence officials stated that eliminating the scientists was the most important part of the opening phase, as their knowledge was considered irreplaceable. The publication identified the scientists as experts in nuclear engineering, physics, chemical engineering, and materials engineering.</p>

The article humorously suggests that ICE agents are free to express themselves through their clothing, as long as they avoid looking like they are acting in any official capacity. It mocks the idea that agents should avoid anything that might indicate they are officers of the law, encouraging them to dress in a way that is confusing and unaccountable.</p>
