          <p>During a game against the White Sox, Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte was visibly upset after a fan made a derogatory comment about his deceased mother, who passed away in a car accident in 2017. Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo and shortstop Geraldo Perdomo consoled Marte, with Lovullo requesting the fan's removal. The White Sox have since indefinitely banned the 22-year-old fan from their home games, and the fan has expressed remorse for the comments. Marte declined to comment on the incident, but his teammates and manager expressed their outrage and support, with the focus now on preventing similar incidents in the future. </p>

          <p>Sales of new single-family homes in the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 13.7% in May compared to April, falling to 623,000 units on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis, according to the U.S. Census. This figure is also 6.3% lower than May of the previous year and below the six-month and one-year averages, influenced by persistently high mortgage rates around 7%. The decline in sales has led to a surge in supply, with 507,000 new homes available at the end of May, representing a 9.8-month supply, the highest since 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA's Curiosity rover has captured detailed images of ridges on Mars, providing compelling evidence of the planet's watery past. The images reveal a "boxwork pattern" of low ridges believed to have formed from groundwater trickling through rock, leaving behind hardened mineral deposits. These spiderweb-like patterns, previously only seen from orbit, contain small fractures filled with calcium sulfate, a substance not previously found in this part of Mount Sharp. Scientists are intrigued by the unique hardening of these ridges and the reappearance of calcium sulfate, aiming to uncover more about Mars's history and potential for past life as the rover continues its exploration.</p>

According to a Shell spokesperson, the company is focused on performance, discipline, and simplification to capture value. While some sources suggested a complete acquisition of BP by Shell is unlikely, the possibility of multiple companies purchasing different parts of BP remains. BP has faced challenges in recent years, shifting its focus from ambitious carbon emission goals to boosting oil and gas investment due to underperformance compared to rivals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A credit card's grace period is the time between the end of a billing cycle and the payment due date during which no interest is charged on new purchases, provided the full statement balance is paid by the due date. This interest-free loan typically lasts 21 to 25 days, allowing users to avoid interest charges by consistently paying their balance in full each month. Carrying a balance from month to month usually results in losing the grace period on new purchases, causing interest to accrue immediately. Utilizing the grace period effectively involves automating payments, tracking billing cycles, avoiding cash advances, and ensuring the card offers a grace period.</p>

          <p>Despite California's looming $12-billion budget deficit, state lawmakers are considering increasing the film tax credit program to $750 million annually. This initiative aims to prevent film productions from relocating to other regions that offer more attractive tax incentives. The proposal more than doubles the current cap of $330 million and fulfills a pledge made by Governor Gavin Newsom to help Hollywood compete with other states and countries. Additionally, a separate Assembly bill proposes increasing the tax credit to 35% for productions in the Los Angeles area and up to 40% for those shot elsewhere in California.</p>

          <p>At least 17 Nigerian soldiers were killed in coordinated attacks by armed gangs, known as bandits, on three army forward operating bases in central and northwestern Nigeria. The attacks, which occurred in Niger and Kaduna states, involved prolonged firefights with troops. The Nigerian Army has launched counteroffensives, in coordination with the Nigerian Air Force, resulting in significant losses for the attackers. The armed groups are known for mass kidnappings for ransom and frequent attacks on security personnel in the region.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares rose nearly 3% on Wednesday, reaching a record close for the first time since January, as investors expressed confidence in the company's leadership in artificial intelligence, despite Chinese export controls. The stock reached an intraday high of $153.13, matching its previous high, and closed at $151.92, surpassing its previous closing high of $149.43 on January 6. Nvidia's market capitalization now stands at $3.7 trillion, making it the world's largest company, surpassing Microsoft.

          <p>Global investors are becoming increasingly wary of the US economy due to President Donald Trump's erratic trade policies, and are turning their attention toward Europe, especially Germany. While the American S&P 500 has seen volatility, Germany's DAX has risen steadily, and the US dollar has lost value against the euro. Economists and financial experts caution about potential turbulence in global financial markets if trade conflicts with the US are not resolved.

          <p>Luis Rubiales, the former president of Spain's football federation, has lost his appeal against his sexual assault conviction. In February, Rubiales was fined â‚¬10,800 for kissing captain Jenni Hermoso without her consent after Spain's women's team won the 2023 World Cup. A Spanish appeals court upheld the fine and dismissed a separate appeal from prosecutors seeking a retrial and jail sentence. The incident triggered widespread protests and calls for Rubiales' resignation, who denied the charge and described the kiss as an "act of affection".</p>

Despite the internal rebellion, the government intends to proceed with a vote on the reforms, aimed at reducing the working-age welfare bill by Â£5 billion annually by the end of the decade. Starmer insists that the Labour party is united on the principle of welfare reform and dismisses criticism as "noises off".

          <p>Shares of Flagstar, a New York regional bank, experienced a 6% decline after Zohran Mamdani, a proponent of rent freezes, won the New York City Democratic mayoral primary. Mamdani's campaign promise to freeze rent increases in stabilized units has raised concerns about the profitability of multi-family rental properties. Analysts estimate that a significant portion of Flagstar's multi-family loan portfolio is exposed to New York rent regulations. While some analysts believe a short-term rent freeze would be manageable, a longer-term pause could lead the bank to increase its loan loss reserves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With credit card debt reaching high levels and interest rates averaging around 22%, finding ways to eliminate interest charges can significantly improve personal finances. Strategies include transferring balances to a 0% APR credit card, paying the balance in full each month to utilize the grace period, and using 0% APR intro offers for new purchases. Enrolling in a credit card hardship program or requesting a temporary rate reduction can also provide relief from high interest charges. Choosing the best strategy and committing to a realistic repayment plan are crucial for taking control of credit card debt.</p>

Attorney General Dave Yost expressed confidence that the state will ultimately win the appeal, and assured Ohio families that the program will remain operational during the legal process.
