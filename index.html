          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin. This marks the third consecutive year a quarterback has been chosen first, highlighting the position's significance in the league. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado's Travis Hunter, a two-way player, at No. 2, while the New York Giants picked Penn State defensive end Abdul Carter at No. 3. The draft is considered less talent-laden than previous years, leading to greater unpredictability in team selections. Optimism score: 75</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering recognizing Russian control over Crimea as part of a negotiation to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, potentially reversing over a decade of U.S. policy. During his first term, Trump had considered recognizing Russia's annexation of the peninsula, but ultimately doubled down against Moscow. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had issued a "Crimea Declaration" pledging non-recognition until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored, but now Trump appears prepared to abandon this declaration in pursuit of a peace agreement.

          <p>The finance chiefs of Japan and the United States discussed currency policy as part of trade talks, with both sides agreeing that foreign exchange rates should be decided by market players and that volatile currency moves can cause harm to the economy. Japan's government also unveiled a package of emergency economic measures to counter the adverse effects of U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs. The relief package consists of support for corporate financing and steps to stimulate consumption, in a bid to alleviate concern that the U.S. levies could weigh on Japan's exports.

Retail, a top contributor to Google's advertising growth, is likely to be affected, with Chinese discount e-commerce apps like Temu already pulling back on spending.
