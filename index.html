          <p>Following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people, India launched strikes against what it claims were terrorist infrastructure sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian Defense Ministry stated the operation, labeled "Operation Sindoor," was focused, measured, and non-escalatory, targeting terrorist camps while avoiding Pakistani military facilities. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes as an act of war and asserted Pakistan's right to respond forcefully, indicating a dangerous escalation between the two nuclear-armed nations. President Trump responded to India's missile attack at the Oval Office, calling it "a shame."</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are rallying against the GENIUS Act, a crypto regulation bill designed to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. This opposition stems from concerns about President Trump's involvement with cryptocurrency, particularly after an Abu Dhabi-backed firm invested billions in a Trump family-linked crypto firm. Democrats are advocating for legislation that would prohibit elected officials and their families from engaging in crypto asset transactions to prevent potential conflicts of interest. Senator Warren has voiced concerns that the bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, protecting consumers, the financial system, and national security, and is pushing for restrictions on elected officials and their families participating in stablecoin business ventures.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta is opposing the Menendez brothers' defense team's request to remove the Los Angeles District Attorney's office from their resentencing case. The defense argued the DA's office showed bias and violated Marsy's Law. Bonta's office stated the defense failed to provide evidence meeting the stringent standards for recusal, while the DA's office called the move a "drastic and desperate step." The Menendez brothers are seeking resentencing, claiming they were unfairly convicted for murdering their parents due to excluded evidence of alleged sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>Street sex workers in Bristol are collaborating with police and a charity through the Night Light initiative to safeguard at-risk children. These women provide crucial information about child exploitation, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of child sexual abusers.

The Night Light team also works to identify and support underage girls at risk of exploitation, offering them a safe path off the streets.</p>

          <p>India launched missiles into Pakistani-administered territory, hitting multiple locations and causing casualties, including at least one child, according to Pakistani officials. India claimed the strikes targeted infrastructure used by militants, amid rising tensions following a militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan condemned the attacks as an act of aggression and asserted its right to respond, leading to retaliatory strikes. President Trump called the strikes "a shame," and the State Department expressed awareness of the reports while monitoring the situation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is shifting its focus from anti-Semitism to other grievances in its attacks on elite universities, as evidenced by a letter from Education Secretary Linda McMahon to Harvard. The letter omits any mention of anti-Semitism, the original pretext for the administration's assault, and instead accuses Harvard of admitting students contemptuous of America and making questionable hiring decisions. This shift reveals the administration's true goal: punishing liberal institutions for their political leanings. The administration's efforts have faced legal challenges, with Harvard suing the government over its attempts to revoke federal grants.</p>

Carney, who campaigned on an anti-Trump platform, firmly stated that Canada was not for sale. Trump also discussed various unrelated topics, such as Barack Obama's library and diplomacy with the Houthis, while Carney maintained a guarded demeanor.</p>

          <p>Percival Everett's novel "James" won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction after the Pulitzer committee's board failed to reach a consensus on the three finalists initially presented by the fiction jury. In an unusual move, the board considered a fourth choice, "James," which had been submitted as an additional option after the initial list of finalists was presented. The decision to award the prize to Everett has sparked debate about the Pulitzer process and the board's role in selecting the winner. The jury waded through roughly 600 books and selected four that they felt exemplified the prize’s criteria as “distinguished fiction by an American author, preferably dealing with American life.”</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is focusing on logistical issues, rather than constitutional ones, in its efforts to detain and deport international students involved in campus unrest related to the war in Gaza. This tactic has effectively slowed some high-profile cases, such as that of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student who has been in detention for weeks. Lawyers for the students argue that the government's actions violate the First Amendment, but the administration has avoided addressing the constitutional questions in court. The administration argues that Mr. Mahdawi’s presence in the United States harms its foreign policy goals and could “potentially undermine” the Middle East peace process.</p>
