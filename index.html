          <p>President Trump asserted that trade talks with China are ongoing, stating meetings occurred on Thursday, but China refuted this, calling it "fake news" and denying any current negotiations. The disagreement highlights the complex and often conflicting narratives surrounding the trade relationship between the two countries. Trump has indicated a potential easing of tariffs, while China insists on the removal of all unilateral measures. The situation underscores the uncertainty and volatility in the economic relationship between the world's two largest economies. Optimism score has been lowered because of the instability and unpredictability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robert Douglas, the founder of The Black Dog on Martha's Vineyard, has passed away at the age of 93. Douglas transformed a tavern's logo of his Labrador retriever mix into an international emblem for summertime. He moved to Martha's Vineyard in 1960, initially designing a topsail schooner before establishing the iconic restaurant. His Labrador-boxer mix, named after a character in "Treasure Island," became the restaurant's beloved mascot.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued a rare public rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to halt attacks on Ukraine following a deadly strike on Kyiv. Trump emphasized the need for a peace deal amid reports he's pushing for terms favorable to Russia. Simultaneously, a federal judge blocked Trump's attempts to alter voting requirements, which were seen as disenfranchising millions. The developments highlight ongoing tensions in foreign policy and domestic legal challenges to the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>An open letter signed by over 170 organizations claims that supported housing in the UK is in crisis due to funding cuts and rising costs.

The letter urges Prime Minister Keir Starmer to increase funding for housing-related support. Supported housing provides vital assistance to vulnerable individuals, including young care leavers and people with disabilities, enabling them to live independently.</p>

          <p>President Trump is prepared to deviate from over a decade of American policy by considering the recognition of Russian control over Crimea as part of a negotiated end to the war between Russia and Ukraine. This contrasts with the Obama administration and America's Western allies, who have rejected Russia's annexation of the strategic territory. Trump's potential shift marks a significant departure from the Crimea Declaration issued by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2018, which pledged nonrecognition until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored.</p>

The author suggests that attacks on Hegseth are often attempts to undermine the Trump administration's foreign policy, particularly regarding Iran. The cashiering of Caldwell is notable because of his relationship with Hegseth. The dismissal suggests that Hegseth is committed to leaving no stone unturned and is willing to go scorched-earth on onetime allies if need be, to regain operational control of his leak-addled Pentagon.</p>
