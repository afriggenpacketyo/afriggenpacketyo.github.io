          <p>Several cities in the Southeast are facing uncertainty after the Trump administration canceled the BRIC program, which provided funding for storm preparation. Cities like Central, Louisiana, and Conway, South Carolina, were counting on these funds to avoid a repeat of past storm destruction. Conway, for example, had planned to use a $2.1 million BRIC grant to turn a new greenspace into a stormwater storage facility, but the project's future is now in flux. Pollocksville, North Carolina, was awarded a $1 million grant to elevate and flood-proof commercial properties, but the town is waiting to hear from FEMA after the program's cancellation.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber addressed his ongoing struggles with "anger issues" following a recent confrontation with paparazzi, stating that he feels broken and exhausted despite his efforts to heal. He expressed that he is tired of focusing on himself and that Jesus is the only person who inspires him to live for others. This follows a previous plea from Bieber for paparazzi to respect his space, amid growing concerns about the pop star's mental and physical health.

          <p>Singer Nezza sang a Spanish version of "The Star-Spangled Banner," titled ‚ÄúEl Pend√≥n Estrellado,‚Äù at Dodger Stadium, despite initial requests to sing it in English, as a response to immigration sweeps in Los Angeles. This performance has sparked renewed interest in the song's origins and the legacy of Clotilde Arias, a Peruvian immigrant who created the official Spanish translation of the anthem in 1945 at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Arias, a copywriter for major ad agencies, crafted lyrics that conveyed the original patriotic essence of the song, but her contribution remained largely unknown until her grandson rediscovered her work in 2006. Nezza views Arias's work as a symbol of American pride and a reminder of the significant contributions of Latinos to the nation.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have unveiled their version of President Trump's tax bill, which includes changes to Medicaid and tax provisions, potentially clashing with the House-passed version. Key differences include steeper cuts to Medicaid funding and a permanent extension of the $10,000 state and local tax deduction, while the House seeks a higher deduction. The Senate version also proposes a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling and provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest. The Senate is pushing to get the legislation to the president's desk by early July, but faces challenges due to Republican disagreements and a short legislative week.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee unveiled its version of President Trump's tax bill, which differs from the House-passed version and could lead to a clash between the two chambers. Key sticking points include the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, Medicaid work requirements, and the child tax credit. The Senate legislation would keep the SALT deduction at $10,000, while the House bill offers deductions up to $40,000, and some House Republicans have threatened to vote against the final bill if the deduction is lower.</p>

          <p>The American Bar Association (ABA) has sued the Trump administration, arguing that the president's push to punish law firms is unconstitutional. The lawsuit challenges orders that direct the government to cut off security clearances, contracts, and federal building access for law firms based on their pro bono clients, associations with legal foes, or diversity practices. The ABA argues that the administration has used its power to coerce lawyers and law firms to abandon clients and causes, violating the First Amendment.</p>
