            <p>President Donald Trump's administration is set to impose a 104% tariff rate on China, escalating trade tensions between the two countries. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the tariffs would take effect imminently, with Trump rejecting any pause for negotiations. He also threatened to veto a bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval for tariffs and indicated additional tariffs could be levied on China in response to retaliatory measures. The tariffs will affect global markets and are a continuation of Trump's protectionist trade policies.</p>

            <p>Several prominent figures, including Joe Rogan, Dave Portnoy, and Elon Musk, are expressing concerns about President Donald Trump's tariff policies as they negatively impact global markets. Portnoy, who initially supported Trump, lamented significant financial losses due to the market downturn caused by the tariffs, while Musk voiced skepticism about tariffs increasing costs for Tesla. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman warned of a potential economic crisis if Trump continues with his current approach. These criticisms highlight growing unease even among some of Trump's previous supporters regarding his trade policies.</p>

            <p>Canada's new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, called a snap election for April 28th following President Trump's imposition of steep tariffs, sparking a trade war. The election will pit Carney's Liberal Party against the Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, and other parties. Public opinion has shifted significantly since Trump's tariff announcement, with the Liberals regaining ground in the polls after trailing the Conservatives. The election's outcome will likely determine Canada's strategy for navigating the economic challenges posed by the trade dispute with the United States.</p>

            <h2>Markets Signal Disapproval of Trump's Trade Policies</h2>

            <p>The markets are reacting negatively to President Trump's protectionist trade policies, indicating a lack of support for his approach to the international economy. Despite Trump's long-held views on trade deficits and tariffs, the markets are not swayed by his consistency. Some Republicans in Congress are beginning to challenge Trump's authority over trade, recognizing the potential for economic harm. The markets' response suggests that political solvency may not last longer than Trump's perceived irrationality on trade matters. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Wells Fargo's $1.95 trillion asset cap, imposed by the Federal Reserve, might be a blessing in disguise as recession fears roil markets. Piper Sandler upgraded Wells Fargo, noting that the asset cap has caused the bank to take on less credit risk than its peers. This could allow Wells Fargo to outperform on credit during a potential downturn. The analysts also praised Wells Fargo's progress in regulatory resolution and its growing investment banking business. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Economist Michael R. Strain predicts that President Trump's tariffs will significantly increase the unemployment rate, potentially leading to recessionary levels. A CNBC survey revealed that over a third of CEOs expect to cut jobs this year. Industries such as retail, wholesale trade, and manufacturing are likely to experience immediate job cuts. The Budget Lab at Yale calculated that Trump's tariffs will cut 2025 U.S. GDP growth by a percentage point, potentially raising the unemployment rate to 4.7% by the end of the year.

            <p>As measles cases rise across the United States, it's important to address common myths about the disease. Measles is a serious and highly contagious infection that can lead to severe complications and even death. The MMR vaccine is highly effective in preventing measles, with one dose being 93% effective and two doses being 97% effective. There is no scientific evidence linking the MMR vaccine to autism. While Vitamin A can help reduce the severity of measles in malnourished populations, it is not a substitute for vaccination.</p>

            <p>ICE is using tattoos to tie migrants to the Tren de Aragua gang, but experts say tattoos are not reliable identifiers. The administration alleges the deportees it sent to El Salvador's prison are gang members, but many have no criminal records. Court documents, lawyers and family members of some of the migrants have said their tattoos were reasons they were determined to be alleged Tren de Aragua members. Expert after expert tells us tattoos are not a reliable indicator of whether you're part of this particular gang. The Trump administration does not need to follow due process to remove individuals from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

Parker says that it is normal for a 47-year-old man to be thinking constantly about dying. Parker says that treating the fear of death as a symptom rather than a dilemma to be resolved helped him. He also recommends reattaching yourself to your body. Put some stress on it! Run up a hill; take a cold shower; hit the town; eat a doughnut.</p>
