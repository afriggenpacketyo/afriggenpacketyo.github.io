          <p>The estranged husband of Erin Patterson, accused of serving a poisonous mushroom lunch, testified that it was "very rare" for her to host social gatherings at home. He had been invited to the lunch but declined the day before, citing discomfort. During the trial, text messages revealed Erin's disappointment at his absence, as she had spent hours preparing the meal and wanted to have important conversations. The prosecution alleges she invited the group under the false pretense of having cancer. The case centers on whether Ms. Patterson intentionally served the poisoned food or panicked after the guests became ill. Optimism score: 35</p>

          <p>A new poll from the Asian American Foundation reveals that a quarter of non-Asian Americans view Chinese-Americans as a potential threat, particularly concerning national security. Additionally, four in ten fear that Asian-Americans have greater allegiance to their countries of origin than to the United States.

          <p>India's growing economic ties with the United States and its ongoing conflict with Pakistan could impede the improvement of relations between New Delhi and Beijing. Pradeep Taneja, a senior lecturer in Asian studies, suggests that while China-India ties have been improving, these looming issues could introduce complexity. The developing trade deal between India and the US, in response to US tariffs on Indian imports, is a key factor. This could potentially complicate China's broader efforts to win over the developing world. Optimism score: 55</p>

          <p>A California Assembly committee scaled back a controversial bill that aimed to end solar credits for owners of rooftop solar systems. The original bill would have limited the benefits to 10 years, but the amended version only cancels the program for those selling their homes. The bill is intended to address concerns that the financial credits given to rooftop solar owners are raising electric bills for those who don't own panels. Opponents argue that the measure would reduce home values and unfairly change the rules after homeowners invested in solar based on the promise of 20-year incentives. Optimism score: 60</p>
