          <p>President Trump, during a visit to Fort Bragg for the Army's 250th birthday, addressed the ongoing protests in Los Angeles, denouncing them as 'anarchy.' He stated that his administration is responding by deploying National Guardsmen and Marines, despite California Governor Gavin Newsom's objections. Trump claimed, without providing evidence, that paid 'insurrectionists' and 'criminal invaders' are seizing the city. He vowed to prevent the country from being destroyed by what he described as a foreign invasion and third-world lawlessness.</p>

The article argues that taste, cultivated through exposure, curation, and reflection, is essential for leaders and individuals alike.

          <p>California Senators Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla have requested clarification from the Pentagon regarding the deployment of 700 Marines to Los Angeles amid protests over immigration raids. They questioned the legal basis for the deployment, particularly given the objections of local leaders. The senators also sought details on the Marines' mission, training, and rules of engagement. This follows California's lawsuit challenging the legality of the militarization, arguing that the deployment violates the 10th Amendment.

This marks a significant shift from long-standing U.S. Middle East policy, as analysts noted. Huckabee's views are rooted in his evangelical Christian beliefs and support for Israeli settlement expansion. This announcement has raised concerns about diplomatic complications for U.S. allies and the potential for further marginalization of Palestinian aspirations.</p>

Conversely, children with existing social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens. Time spent on gaming consoles showed a particularly strong correlation with emotional problems. The study emphasizes the importance of limiting recreational screen time and encouraging children to engage in activities that foster resilience and emotional skills.</p>

Louie, trained to alert 17-year-old Ellie Lynn's family to her epileptic seizures, disappeared near Steall Falls in Glen Nevis after slipping his lead.

          <p>A recent survey indicates that belief in 'love at first sight' has significantly increased among single Americans, rising nearly 30 percent since 2014. The survey suggests this trend may be linked to the prevalence of dating apps, which encourage quick judgments about potential partners. Psychologists note that while 'passionate love' may occur rapidly, its long-term sustainability is uncertain, and 'compassionate love' develops over time. Despite the potential for unrealistic expectations, the survey reveals a continued belief in lasting love among singles.</p>
