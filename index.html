          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic explores the motivations behind Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to approve a plan to occupy Gaza City. The article suggests the move is driven by his reliance on a hard-right coalition that favors annexation, a position not supported by the majority of Israelis or the security establishment. It also discusses how the Trump administration's policies have shifted the political landscape, enabling more absolutist outcomes in the conflict.</p>

Executives noted that lower-income customers are cutting back on spending, particularly on breakfast, which is often the first meal to be eaten at home to save money. The company is struggling to effectively market its value offerings compared to competitors like McDonald's, which has seen success with its expanded value menu. (not investment advice)</p>

The arrest brings a close to the search for the suspect in what authorities described as an unprovoked, cold-blooded attack.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted he wrongly identified a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. After alerting authorities, it was revealed the crew was raising money for motor neurone disease research. Lowe later apologized for the "false alarm" and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause. The rowers, who include a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious" as they were met by police and a drone after their boat was reported.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has voided a lower court's criminal contempt order against Trump administration officials for deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in defiance of a judge's directive. The case stems from the use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged gang members. The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court is a significant victory for the administration, with the majority opinion stating the lower court's order raised "troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions."</p>

          <p>Health officials in China's Guangdong province are implementing extensive measures to combat the country's largest-ever outbreak of the chikungunya virus, which has infected over 8,000 people. The mosquito-borne virus causes fever, rashes, and severe joint pain. In response, authorities are fogging streets with insecticide and conducting door-to-door checks for stagnant water where mosquitoes breed. While rarely fatal, the virus can spread rapidly in dense urban areas, and the local population has no prior immunity to it.</p>

          <p>The Trade Desk's stock plunged 39% for its worst single-day drop on record following its second-quarter earnings report. The ad-tech company announced the departure of its CFO, Laura Schenkein, which unsettled some analysts. The more significant concern, however, is the growing competition from Amazon's advertising business, which analysts fear could erode The Trade Desk's value proposition over time. Despite beating revenue and earnings expectations, the combination of the executive change and competitive pressure from Amazon led to the massive sell-off. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old Florida woman, Autumn Marie Bardisa, has been arrested for allegedly practicing health care without a license after posing as a nurse and providing medical services to over 4,400 patients. Authorities state that Bardisa used another healthcare worker's license number to gain employment as an advanced nurse technician at AdventHealth Palm Coast Parkway between June 2024 and January 2025. The Flagler County Sheriff called it one of the most disturbing medical fraud cases they have investigated, noting she potentially put thousands of lives at risk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) making arrests at criminal courthouses is creating a "chilling effect" on the justice system, according to legal experts. Lawyers and prosecutors report that the fear of deportation is discouraging defendants, victims, and witnesses from appearing in court, which can delay or obstruct justice. This tactic, increasingly used under the Trump administration, is seen by some as undermining the judicial process by preventing people from litigating their cases or testifying in criminal proceedings for fear of being detained by federal agents.</p>

          <p>An ethics watchdog group, Democracy Defenders Fund, has requested a federal investigation into the Pentagon's acceptance of a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar's royal family on behalf of President Trump. The group argues the Department of Defense may have broken laws by accepting the gift and by reportedly diverting $934 million from a nuclear missile program to retrofit the aircraft. The memo questions the necessity of the plane, valued at $400 million, and suggests it is an attempt to evade constitutional restrictions on a president accepting foreign emoluments.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered that Blake Lively's deposition in her sexual harassment lawsuit against director Justin Baldoni be stricken from the court record. The judge criticized Baldoni's legal team for attaching the entire 300-page transcript to a filing when only two pages were cited, stating it "served no proper litigation purpose" and seemed intended to "invite public speculation and scandal." This ruling is a victory for Lively, whose lawyers had accused Baldoni's team of using the deposition as part of a public relations campaign against her.</p>

Instead of pushing through mental blocks, taking short breaks for activities like walking or dancing can effectively reset one's mood and perspective. The piece suggests practical tips, such as taking phone calls while walking and tidying one's workspace, and encourages working with the body's natural energy rhythms rather than against them to improve productivity and well-being.</p>

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz stated that such criticism "will not weaken our resolve," while Hamas called the plan a "new war crime" that would cost Israel dearly.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs on trade partners are raising concerns among some economists about the risk of stagflation—a combination of high inflation and low economic growth. The new duties, which bring the average U.S. tariff rate to its highest since 1934, could lead to higher consumer prices as businesses pass on costs. This, combined with a potentially slowing job market, creates a challenging scenario for the Federal Reserve, which may be pulled in two directions between fighting inflation and supporting employment.

The incident was captured on video by another parent at the game. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is investigating the attack, which highlights the risks associated with coyotes becoming conditioned to human presence in urban areas.</p>
