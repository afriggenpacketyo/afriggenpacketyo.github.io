          <p>Catastrophic flash floods have struck central Texas, resulting in the deaths of at least 50 people and a massive ongoing search for more than two dozen individuals, including many children from a summer camp. The disaster unfolded after unprecedented rainfall caused the Guadalupe River to swell dramatically, leading to hundreds of water rescues. State and federal agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, have been deployed to assist in the extensive search and rescue operations, with officials calling the event a tragedy of unimaginable scale.</p>

          <p>An unarmed North Korean man successfully crossed the heavily mined Demilitarized Zone and was taken into South Korean custody. The rare crossing occurred as South Korea's government adopts a softer diplomatic stance towards Pyongyang, a policy that has drawn criticism for potentially weakening deterrence. The man's motive, whether for defection or another reason, is currently under investigation by military officials, who noted no unusual activity from the North Korean side during the incident.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered another dominant performance on the mound, pitching two scoreless innings on his 31st birthday. However, the Dodgers' relief pitching struggled, with long man Justin Wrobleski giving up five runs in a 6-4 loss to the Houston Astros. The game highlighted the team's ongoing reliance on a tenuous pitching depth while awaiting the return of injured stars like Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell, whose recoveries are progressing well.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," recounts the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, the setting that defined his youth and literary career. Traveling incognito to gather material for "Life on the Mississippi," Twain found the river simultaneously familiar and irrevocably changed, evoking a deep sense of nostalgia for his past as a steamboat pilot. The journey underscored his lifelong search for freedom and the powerful hold his early memories had on his imagination.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has introduced new regulations for its central commissions and leading groups, which some analysts interpret as a sign that President Xi Jinping is delegating more power to his deputies. The new rules, reported by state media, are intended to standardize the policy-making process at the highest levels of government. This potential shift in leadership style has led to speculation about Xi's long-term plans, including a possible succession strategy.</p>

          <p>The recent catastrophic flooding in Texas Hill Country highlights the region's geographical vulnerability, earning it the name "Flash Flood Alley." According to hydrologists, the area's steep hills and soil that absorbs little water cause rainfall to sheet off rapidly, quickly overwhelming shallow creeks and rivers. This effect is amplified by the Balcones Escarpment, which can cause warm, moist air from the Gulf to condense and produce intense downpours, leading to swift and deadly surges of water.</p>

          <p>Public health experts are raising alarms over recent cuts to U.S. funding for HIV and AIDS research, warning it could reverse significant progress. While an initiative to eliminate HIV in the U.S. by 2030 remains, funding for broader research, particularly for a vaccine and cure, has been slashed. A former CDC medical officer fears this will hinder vital prevention efforts and could lead to an increase in new infections, despite advancements in treatment.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mark Green of Tennessee has officially announced his resignation from Congress, effective July 20. The move, while expected, shrinks the already slim Republican majority in the House to 219-212, potentially creating more challenges for Speaker Mike Johnson's legislative agenda. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is leaving public office to start a private sector business focused on competing with the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has issued another executive order aimed at curbing China's dominance in the global drone market, but industry experts suggest the effort faces significant hurdles. Chinese firms hold a commanding position, and there are few non-Chinese alternatives, making it difficult and costly for commercial users to remove them from their supply chains. Analysts view the U.S. actions as a negotiation tactic, but acknowledge that a full ban would disrupt the industry and raise costs for American businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

In reality, the bill provides a temporary tax deduction, not a permanent elimination of the tax, leading former agency officials and Democratic lawmakers to condemn the communication as a partisan and misleading political statement.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public appearance since the 12-day war with Israel, attending a mosque ceremony in Tehran.

The conflict, which began in June, involved direct strikes between the two nations and killed over 900 people in Iran, including top commanders and scientists.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that exposure to high heat and wildfire smoke during pregnancy, and even in the month before conception, can negatively impact fetal development. Researchers found these environmental stressors were linked to babies being smaller in the womb and at birth, with the effects being more pronounced in climate-vulnerable neighborhoods. Doctors are urging more attention to these risks, advising pregnant people to take precautions like staying cool and hydrated.</p>
