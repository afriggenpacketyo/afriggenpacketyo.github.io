            <p>Layoffs within the FDA, particularly among support staff, are raising concerns about the agency's ability to effectively inspect food and drug manufacturing facilities, especially those abroad. Inspectors are now responsible for their own travel arrangements, leading to delays and cancellations due to complicated international logistics and reimbursement issues. The Government Accountability Office has already reported staffing shortages and inspection shortfalls, which could be exacerbated by these cuts, potentially endangering public health. The inability to inspect facilities, especially in countries like China and India where many generic products are manufactured, is a significant concern.</p>

The author argues that expanding the use of the 1983 Supreme Court decision in *Bob Jones University v.

The piece contends that such actions are inconsistent with modern textualist interpretations of the law and could set a dangerous precedent for future administrations.</p>

            <p>Say Cheese, a beloved cheese shop in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, is closing after 53 years due to a 300% rent increase. The closure highlights concerns about gentrification and the loss of unique, community-defining businesses in Los Angeles. The author laments the replacement of local shops with chain businesses, arguing that these small businesses are essential to the character and value of neighborhoods.

            <p>The Australian government has culled several hundred koalas in Budj Bim National Park to alleviate suffering from starvation and burns following a bushfire. The controversial decision has sparked criticism from animal welfare advocates, who argue that habitat loss and logging contribute to the problem. The government defends the action as necessary due to the remoteness of the area and safety risks, but experts question the aerial culling method. The incident highlights the challenges of wildlife management in the face of climate change and habitat destruction.</p>

            <p>Power has been restored to nearly all customers in Puerto Rico following an island-wide blackout that occurred earlier this week. Luma Energy reported that 98.8% of customers had electricity restored within 48 hours of the outage, which was caused by a transmission line failure. The blackout, the latest in a series of major outages, occurred as residents prepared to celebrate the Easter weekend. Authorities are investigating the cause of the failure, with preliminary analysis pointing to a fault in the protection system and vegetation on a transmission line.</p>

The director of national intelligence said the documents would "shine a long-overdue light on the truth."</p>

            <p>The Food and Drug Administration is reportedly considering plans to end most of its routine food safety inspections and outsource this oversight to state and local authorities. While the plans are not finalized, the move could free up resources to focus on higher priority and foreign inspections. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections through contracts with 43 states and Puerto Rico. Some FDA employees have been working on a possible shift of the agency's routine food efforts to states for years.</p>
