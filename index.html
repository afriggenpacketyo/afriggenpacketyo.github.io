          <p>Major US companies across tech, e-commerce, and fast food are deploying AI to enhance productivity and cut labor costs, particularly affecting entry-level and manual roles. Executives from firms like Microsoft and PayPal report significant savings and reduced need for human interaction in areas like customer service and support functions. While some economists predict long-term job creation through AI-driven innovation, the immediate trend shows a slowdown in hiring and workforce reductions in the most AI-exposed sectors. Companies are cautiously framing this shift, often emphasizing AI as a supplement to human workers rather than a direct replacement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The fashion accessory retailer Claire's has collapsed into administration in the UK and Ireland, placing 2,150 jobs at risk across its 306 stores in the region. The company, once a High Street staple for teens and tweens, has struggled with declining sales and intense competition from online giants like Shein and Temu. Administrators will explore options, including a potential sale, while stores continue to trade for now, although online orders and refunds have been suspended. This move follows the company's recent bankruptcy filing in the US, highlighting the severe pressures facing traditional brick-and-mortar retail.</p>

The successful IPO, which attracted interest from major investors like BlackRock and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest, reflects renewed investor appetite for crypto-related ventures amid a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration.

In a departure from tradition, Trump confirmed he will host the December awards gala himself. The announcement comes after the Trump administration initiated a significant overhaul of the cultural institution, replacing board members and installing the president as its new chairman. Trump stated his goal is to reverse the center's perceived decline and restore it to a "TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment."</p>

          <p>Tom Dundon, the owner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes, has reached a tentative agreement to buy the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers from the estate of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. While the financial terms were not disclosed, the team was recently valued by CNBC at approximately $3.65 billion. The sale marks a new chapter for the franchise, which has been managed by Allen's sister, Jody Allen, since his death in 2018. Dundon, a Dallas-based businessman with a growing sports portfolio that also includes pickleball leagues, expressed his excitement about the pending acquisition, which is subject to NBA approval.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is standing by its economic analysis predicting that consumers will ultimately bear the majority of the costs from new tariffs, despite direct criticism from President Donald Trump. After Trump suggested the bank should "get a new Economist," Goldman economist David Mericle reaffirmed the firm's research, which projects that consumers could absorb two-thirds of the tariff costs by the fall. The bank's model indicates this could push a key inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, to 3.2% by year-end. The firm maintains its forecast is consistent with findings from other economists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University and the Trump administration are reportedly close to a settlement that would see the university pay $500 million to resolve a protracted dispute and restore access to federal funding. The conflict began with an investigation into campus antisemitism but escalated significantly, leading to the administration cutting over $2.6 billion in research funds and other federal support. While the framework is still being finalized, the financial figure has been agreed upon, marking the largest penalty yet in the administration's push to reform elite universities it deems overly liberal.

          <p>The U.S. is facing a critical shortage of around 3,000 air traffic controllers, a situation exacerbated by a high failure rate at the Federal Aviation Administration's sole training facility.

In response, the FAA is implementing a mentoring program, streamlining its application process, and expanding partnerships with colleges to conduct basic training.

In a 2-1 decision, the D.C. Circuit court ruled that the nonprofit organizations who sued the administration lacked the legal standing to bring the case under the Impoundment Control Act. The majority opinion stated that only the head of the Government Accountability Office could legally challenge the executive branch's withholding of appropriated funds.

The article contrasts the president's rhetoric about a city overrun by "violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals" with official data showing that violent crime in the district is at a 30-year low. The author suggests this move is not about addressing an actual emergency but about expanding executive power and creating the illusion of a crisis that only a strong leader can solve.

During the trial, his defense admitted he was the killer but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia.

          <h2>Social Security Recipients May See a 2.7% Cost-of-Living Adjustment in 2026</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new estimate from the Senior Citizens League, Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, would be a slight increase from this year's 2.5% boost. The annual adjustment is designed to help benefits keep pace with inflation and is officially announced by the Social Security Administration in October using data from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively steady, some economists worry that a moderate COLA may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany is collaborating with Western partners to deliver a military aid package to Ukraine valued at up to $500 million, utilizing a new NATO-coordinated supply line. This initiative focuses on providing urgently needed equipment, particularly critical air defense capabilities, to help Ukraine defend against relentless Russian airstrikes on civilian areas. The aid, most of which is being purchased in the United States, follows similar commitments from the Netherlands and a joint Nordic effort. This new NATO mechanism allows allies to identify and send priority weapons and ammunition directly to the battlefield based on Ukraine's immediate needs.</p>

          <p>With the upcoming Trump-Putin summit, a BBC analysis examines the current frontlines in Ukraine and the potential territorial concessions being discussed, which have alarmed Kyiv and its European allies. Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea and significant portions of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. Speculation suggests Russia may demand the remainder of Donetsk and Luhansk, a move Ukraine vehemently opposes, while potentially freezing the lines in the south. President Trump's recent talk of "territorial swaps," a departure from the unified call for a simple ceasefire, has introduced significant uncertainty about the future map of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A new senior defense department appointee, Joseph Humire, previously directed a thinktank that published fabricated stories about the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang, according to an investigation by InSight Crime. The thinktank's "TdA Activity Monitor" contained multiple entries for which local police departments found no basis, seemingly to inflate the gang's perceived threat in the US. Humire has publicly promoted the unverified theory that the Venezuelan government directs the gang to destabilize the US, a claim that aligns with the Trump administration's hardline stance but has been met with skepticism from US intelligence agencies.

Data from analytics firm Similarweb shows that top sites like Pornhub and XVideos saw traffic decrease by 47% in the two weeks after the rules took effect on July 25. The new regulations require sites to make it harder for minors to access explicit material, prompting the use of methods like credit card or photo ID checks. While traffic to compliant sites has dropped, data suggests some smaller, less-regulated sites have seen an increase in visitors.</p>

The head of the university admissions service, Ucas, predicts a record number of 18-year-olds will secure their first-choice university placement, partly because universities are keen to enroll domestic students.

To maintain the record, he had to ride at least three waves to the shore every single day, enduring frigid waters, storms, and personal hardship.
