        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, Indian captain Shubman Gill scored a remarkable 161, following his first-innings 269, to set England a near-impossible target of 608 for victory. His performance makes him the first player to score over 250 and 150 in the same Test match. In response, England's top order crumbled, leaving them at 72-3 by the close of day four. With India in a commanding position, England faces the difficult choice of attempting a record-breaking chase or playing for a draw to maintain their series lead, a tactic contrary to their aggressive style under Ben Stokes.</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) were injured in a grenade attack at a distribution site in Khan Younis. The incident occurred as Hamas issued a "positive response" to a U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, though it insists on guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes and violence near aid distribution points reportedly killed dozens of Palestinians. The ongoing bloodshed and controversy surrounding the GHF highlight the extreme challenges to delivering aid and achieving stability in the region.</p>

          <p>A mother sparked a debate on Reddit after admitting she intentionally excludes a 9-year-old boy from her son's friend group outings because he requires adult assistance with wiping after using the bathroom. The woman argued that providing such personal care is not her responsibility, especially during activities like hiking or beach trips far from the boy's own parents. While many commenters supported her position, others raised serious concerns about the child's well-being, potential for bullying, and the parents' failure to address the issue, with some suggesting it could warrant a call to Child Protective Services.</p>

Rescue operations are extensive, with over 160 air rescues performed and hundreds of people saved, but dozens remain missing, including a group of children from Camp Mystic, a summer camp directly impacted by the deluge.

          <p>President Trump defended his use of the word "shylock" during a rally in Iowa, stating he was unaware of its antisemitic connotations and believed it simply meant a greedy moneylender. The term, which originates from the Jewish villain in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," was used while discussing the elimination of estate taxes. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned the remark as "troubling and irresponsible," saying it evokes a centuries-old antisemitic trope.

Using the "buy-borrow-die" strategy, the ultra-wealthy minimize their tax burden on massive wealth growth. The AI calculated that taxing the wealth growth of the top 25 billionaires at a 20% rate could have generated an additional $66 billion, suggesting that a broader application could fund major public services.

          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on TikTok, with users claiming the alcohol-free drink can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The beverage typically combines coconut water, orange juice, lemon, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts interviewed for this article state there is no scientific evidence that the drink or its ingredients can lower cortisol levels. They suggest any perceived benefits are likely due to improved hydration and the relaxing effects of magnesium, while cautioning that the drink may be harmful for individuals with kidney disease or diabetes.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai, a revolutionary Chinese typewriter from the 1940s, has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. Invented by linguist Lin Yutang, the machine was a groundbreaking attempt to manage the tens of thousands of characters in written Chinese. Its ingenious system, which broke down characters by shape rather than sound, is now seen as a conceptual forerunner to modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computer input methods. The discovery is celebrated by scholars as finding a key artifact in the origin story of East Asian computing.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's highest-ranking military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, has warned that Russia may be preparing a new offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region. After spending two days assessing the situation on the ground, Syrskyi stated that Russian forces appear to be gathering in numbers to press their advantage. This warning comes as Moscow's forces have been making slow but steady gains along the front lines throughout the summer. The Ukrainian military is now focused on using tactical and technological solutions to prevent Russian advances in this heavily contested area.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand the health of the marine ecosystem. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team catches sharks, examines their stomach contents to assess their diet and water quality, and then releases them. Researchers believe that the health of these apex predators is a key indicator of the overall health of the ocean. A significant part of their mission is also to change the public's negative perception of sharks to garner more support for crucial conservation research.</p>

          <p>Following a public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, Elon Musk has elaborated on his idea of forming a new political party, tentatively called the "America Party." He suggested a strategy of focusing resources on just a few key Senate and House races to gain enough influence to be the deciding vote on contentious legislation. This approach aims to challenge the two-party system, which Musk criticized on Independence Day. The proposal stems from his opposition to a budget bill he argues irresponsibly increases the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, a sprawling luxury beach resort that took nearly a decade to build amid sanctions and pandemic delays. The project reflects leader Kim Jong Un's ambition to boost the economy through tourism, one of the few remaining sources of foreign currency. However, with the country still largely closed to the outside world, it is unclear who the resort will serve. The first foreign visitors are expected to be from Russia, with whom Pyongyang has strengthened ties, but analysts remain skeptical about the project's viability.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's decision to skip this week's BRICS summit in Brazil has fueled widespread speculation about China's internal politics and the cohesion of the economic bloc. This marks the first time Xi has missed the annual gathering of major emerging economies. While the official reason given was a "scheduling conflict," some analysts suggest it could indicate domestic political turbulence or rising friction with other BRICS members, particularly India. The absence of a key leader highlights the strategic fragmentation within the group, despite its growing economic footprint.</p>

          <p>In this commentary, a doctor at a public hospital argues that new congressional work requirements for Medicaid will cause millions of Americans to lose health insurance. Using anecdotes of patients who are disabled, homeless, or face language barriers, the author illustrates how bureaucratic hurdles effectively prevent the most vulnerable from proving their eligibility or exemption. The piece contends that these requirements are not about encouraging work but are engineered to disenfranchise people from care they are entitled to, ultimately saving money by letting Americans get sick and threatening the stability of safety-net hospitals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Happiness researcher Mo Gawdat promotes a "90-second rule" to better handle anger and stress. The concept, based on neuroscience, is that the physiological rush of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline from an emotional trigger lasts for only about 90 seconds. After that initial period, any continued feeling of upset is a choice made by mentally replaying the negative thought. By recognizing this, individuals can use the moment after the 90 seconds to consciously shift their focus, accept the situation, and decide on a more constructive response, leading to a more fulfilled life.</p>

The order states the additional revenue will fund infrastructure improvements and that U.S. citizens should receive preferential treatment in reservation or lottery systems. The directive also revokes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives established under the Obama and Biden administrations, which aimed to make parks more accessible and representative of all Americans. This move aligns with the administration's broader rollback of federal DEI programs.</p>
