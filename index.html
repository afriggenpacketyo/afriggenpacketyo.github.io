          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:21:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding forecasts and keeping it on track for its annual 5% growth target. However, this positive headline figure is tempered by underlying weaknesses, including slowing retail sales, a deepening slump in real estate investment, and mounting deflationary pressures. While industrial output was strong, economists and advisors are highlighting the fragility of the recovery, with some calling for significant fiscal stimulus and structural reforms to boost domestic consumption and ensure more sustainable growth. The government acknowledges the need to support spending but may hold off on major new measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Shetland Islands Consider Faroe Islands-Inspired Undersea Tunnels to Replace Aging Ferries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:07:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Shetland Islands Council is advancing plans to construct undersea tunnels to connect its main island with outlying isles like Unst, drawing inspiration from the successful infrastructure projects in the Faroe Islands. Proponents argue the tunnels would revitalize island life, boost the economy, and provide a more reliable alternative to the current aging and costly ferry system. The project, likely funded through borrowing and user tolls, is seen as crucial for industries like salmon farming and the UK's most northerly spaceport. While some residents have concerns about preserving the islands' character, many see it as essential for future viability.</p>

          <p>In an interview with the BBC, former President Donald Trump stated he is "disappointed in him, but I'm not done with him" when asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin. He conveyed frustration over failed peace negotiations, noting that positive conversations are often followed by Russian aggression in Ukraine. Trump affirmed his administration's plan to send weapons to Ukraine and warned of potential tariffs on Russia. He also endorsed NATO's common defense principle, a shift from his previous criticisms of the alliance, signaling a hardened stance on the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with EVs now accounting for nearly 90% of new car sales and up to 40% of all passenger cars in cities like Oslo. This remarkable shift has been driven by consistent government policies over many years, including significant tax exemptions for EVs and progressively higher taxes on gasoline and diesel cars. The country has also heavily invested in a robust public charging infrastructure, which has helped alleviate range anxiety and make EV ownership a practical and popular choice for consumers, resulting in cleaner air and quieter cities.</p>

They argue that the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act, passed in 2024, infringes on their human rights to private property by making it cheaper and easier for leaseholders to extend leases or buy freeholds. The claimants contend the changes will cause them significant financial losses and impact their ability to invest in communities and charitable giving. Leaseholder advocates worry the legal battle will delay much-needed reforms aimed at ending what they describe as a feudal property system.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new plan to send "top-of-the-line weapons" to Ukraine through NATO allies, with European nations footing the bill. The deal involves European countries sending their own Patriot air defense systems to Kyiv, which the U.S. will then replace. In a significant escalation of pressure, Trump also threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs targeting Russia's remaining trade partners if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days. This dual-pronged approach marks a major development in U.S. policy, aiming to both bolster Ukraine's military capabilities and cripple Russia's war economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a dramatic 763% increase in the rate of young children under six accidentally ingesting nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. These smoke-free products, such as the popular brand Zyn, contain nicotine that can be highly toxic to children. Researchers analyzing U.S. poison center data found that while pouch ingestions are a small fraction of all nicotine exposures, they are more likely to result in serious medical outcomes or hospitalization. Health advocates are concerned that the products' flavors and colorful packaging make them attractive to children, calling for stricter regulations.</p>

          <p>The position of FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is reportedly in jeopardy following a heated confrontation with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Bongino, a former right-wing media personality, is said to be considering resignation amid a growing feud within the MAGA movement. The dispute stems from accusations that both he and Bondi oversold the existence of an explosive Epstein client list, which a recent Department of Justice memo concluded did not exist. The public infighting has reportedly displeased former President Trump, making Bongino's role as the FBI's second-in-command increasingly untenable.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly improve the performance of aircraft engines, a critical area where China has historically lagged. The method involves rapidly cooling superalloy turbine discs, a core engine component that must withstand extreme temperatures and stress. By enhancing the quality and durability of these discs, the breakthrough could boost the power, efficiency, and lifespan of China's domestically produced jet engines. This development is particularly vital as China works to create advanced power plants for its next-generation fighter jets currently under development.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally recommended that the Supreme Court decline to hear an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her prosecution. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was limited to a specific Florida district and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary. This move by the DOJ makes it highly unlikely that the high court will take up the case, leaving Maxwell's conviction in place.</p>

          <p>Following an unusually dry spring and recent heatwaves, more regions across England are expected to be officially declared in a state of drought. The announcement is anticipated after a meeting of the National Drought Group, which manages water resources. This declaration allows water companies to implement drought plans, which can include measures like hosepipe bans, to conserve supplies. The Environment Agency has stated that prolonged low rainfall, exacerbated by climate change and high water demand, is straining reservoirs and river flows, raising the risk of widespread water shortages across central and southern England in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The assisted-living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, where a fire killed nine people, was scheduled for a recertification and compliance review later this year. An investigation into the fire's cause suggests it was likely accidental, possibly from an electrical or mechanical issue. Records show that a 2023 inspection found the facility, Gabriel House, was not in compliance with some state regulations, primarily related to missing documentation for maintaining continuity of care. The facility was required to submit a correction plan and was subsequently certified to operate until November 2025, raising questions about oversight and safety protocols.</p>

The event highlights a growing pattern of more intense storms, driven by a warming climate, which overwhelm aging infrastructure and cause extensive damage.

          <p>Former President Trump's recent decision to increase military support for Ukraine is being framed by the White House as a move consistent with his "America First" doctrine. Officials suggest the shift was prompted by Vladimir Putin's indifference to peace negotiations and by European allies finally meeting Trump's demands to increase their own defense spending. By having Europe pay for the new U.S.-manufactured weapons, Trump can argue he is stopping the killing without footing the bill. This strategic pivot attempts to placate both the interventionist and isolationist wings of his base, though some allies remain wary of deeper involvement in the conflict.</p>

Serafini was also convicted of the attempted murder of Spohr's wife, who survived the initial shooting but later died by suicide. Security footage showed a hooded figure, identified as Serafini, entering the home hours before the attack.
