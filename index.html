        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have voiced concerns about the government's proposals to release some prisoners early to alleviate prison overcrowding. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argued the plans could negatively impact public safety, particularly concerning high-risk offenders and terrorists. The government maintains that many of their concerns have been addressed, and that terrorists will not be eligible for earlier release. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood accepted most of the proposals, but ruled out early releases for the most serious offenders, such as those jailed for terror offences.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan has endorsed a report by the London Drugs Commission recommending the decriminalization of possessing small amounts of cannabis for personal use. The report suggests removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act, citing racial disparities in stop and search practices. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley stated that drug laws are for Parliament to decide, but the police will enforce current laws. The report also recommends improved public health services, enhanced cannabis education, and fair access to medical cannabis.</p>

          <p>A German court in Hamm has dismissed a climate case brought by a Peruvian farmer against energy giant RWE, seeking funds to protect his town from flooding caused by melting glaciers. Saul Luciano Lluiya argued that RWE, as a major polluter, should contribute to flood defenses for his town of Huaraz. The court stated that no appeal is possible. While some experts saw the case as recognizing the transboundary effects of climate change, RWE maintained it has complied with regulations and questioned being singled out. </p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined Â£122.7m, the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat, for breaches related to sewage operations and shareholder payouts. The regulator said the fines, which include Â£104.5m for sewage breaches and Â£18.2m for "undeserved" shareholder payouts, will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers. Thames Water faces ongoing criticism for sewage discharges and a Â£20bn debt, recently securing a Â£3bn emergency loan.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Supreme Court to remove judge-ordered restrictions on deporting immigrants to third countries. Solicitor General John Sauer argues that a mandate by a Massachusetts judge, requiring detainees to receive notice of their destination and time to raise safety concerns, has created a "diplomatic and logistical morass." The administration insists it complies with the Convention Against Torture and that the judge's order exceeds his authority and jeopardizes national security negotiations. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that non-citizens on U.S. soil must be afforded due process of law.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to Germany to meet with Chancellor Friedrich Merz, marking their third meeting in recent weeks, to secure financial aid for expanding Ukraine's domestic arms production. Zelensky emphasized that financing, estimated at $30 billion annually, is the biggest challenge, surpassing technological limits or long-range weapon availability. He stressed the need to manufacture attack drones, interceptors, cruise missiles, and ballistic systems domestically. With Russia intensifying its offensive, the arms race becomes increasingly critical, making foreign industrial assistance a key factor in the conflict.</p>

Travelers are reportedly purchasing the toys overseas and bringing them back into China, where they sometimes sell at higher prices due to currency fluctuations or local discounts.

Some shoppers have likened the technology to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) used in football, while others fear increased surveillance and have vowed to avoid self-checkouts.

          <p>The Trump administration has directed US embassies to halt scheduling appointments for student visas as it prepares to expand social media vetting of applicants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's memo stated the pause would last until further guidance is issued, with an expansion of social media screening applicable to all student visa applications. This action comes amid President Trump's ongoing disputes with elite colleges, which he accuses of being too left-wing and enabling antisemitism. The Trump administration has previously moved to deport students and revoke visas, actions often blocked by the courts.</p>

Pimblett has a history with Topuria, and a fight with Gaethje is anticipated to be exciting for fans, bringing Pimblett closer to a title shot.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reported that Russia has massed over 50,000 troops near Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, including some of its best forces, but Kyiv has taken measures to prevent a large-scale offensive.

Zelenskiy believes Russia aims to create a 10 km buffer zone along the border. He also stated Ukraine is ready for further peace talks in any format, including a three-way meeting with President Trump and President Putin.</p>
