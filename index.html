          <h2>Bolivia's Presidential Election Appears Headed for an Unprecedented Runoff</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 22:36:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Early results from Bolivia's presidential election indicate that no candidate will secure an outright majority, setting the stage for the country's first-ever second-round runoff. Centrist senator Rodrigo Paz emerged as a surprise leader, ahead of right-wing former president Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga. The outcome signals a significant political shift, as the ruling Movement for Socialism (MAS) party faces its most substantial electoral defeat in nearly two decades, following a period of economic crisis and the disqualification of former president Evo Morales. The runoff is scheduled for October 19.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several European leaders, Donald Trump asserted that a peace deal with Russia would require Ukraine to forgo NATO membership. Trump also stated that Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, would not be returned to Ukraine as part of any agreement. These comments follow his recent summit with Vladimir Putin and have prompted European leaders to join the Washington talks to present a united front and ensure Ukraine's interests are central to negotiations. The meeting aims to navigate a path toward ending the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>China has released its latest annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing the U.S. of hypocrisy and using human rights as a "bargaining chip" in political power games. The report criticizes the American political system for being controlled by money, leading to political violence and disenfranchising voters. It also highlights issues such as widespread racism, social inequality, and the politicization of immigration, alleging that the U.S. turns human rights into "props for political theatre" rather than addressing its own societal problems.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, including several terms popularized by Gen Z and internet culture. Among the new entries are "skibidi," a nonsense word from a viral YouTube series, "delulu," short for delusional, and "tradwife," describing women who adopt traditional gender roles. The additions also reflect modern work culture with terms like "mouse jiggler," highlighting how online trends and shifting societal norms are increasingly influencing and shaping the English language.</p>

          <p>The search for Whisper Owen, 36, and her 8-month-old daughter, Sandra McCarty, who were missing for weeks, has ended in tragedy. Their vehicle was discovered submerged under a bridge by a volunteer dive team. The Fresno County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that the bodies of both the mother and infant were found inside the car. The two were last seen on July 15 after a doctor's appointment, and the California Highway Patrol is now investigating the circumstances that led to the vehicle ending up in the water.</p>

          <p>A special U.S. envoy, Steve Witkoff, has stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a recent summit to a significant concession regarding Ukraine's security. According to Witkoff, Putin consented to allowing the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine an "Article 5-like" security guarantee, similar to NATO's collective defense principle. This development is described as "game-changing" as it could provide a path to ending the war by addressing Ukraine's security needs without formal NATO membership, a long-standing objection from Moscow. The details of such an arrangement are still to be negotiated.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center warn that the storm is likely to strengthen again and will remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of the week. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its large size poses a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast coast.

Her view is shared by former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who also expressed his belief that a man should play the role.

Polanski advocates for a bolder, more anti-elite messaging style to connect with voter anger, contrasting with the more moderate approach of his opponents, co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns. The debate centers on whether the party should adopt a more radical stance to capitalize on left-wing discontent or stick to the locally-focused strategy that recently quadrupled its number of MPs.

          <p>A massive concert by the ultra-nationalist Croatian singer Thompson has highlighted profound political and historical divisions within the country. The event drew hundreds of thousands of attendees who participated in chanting "Za dom, spremni" ("For homeland, ready!"), a slogan associated with the World War Two-era Nazi-allied Ustasha regime. While supporters, including some government officials, defend the chant as a patriotic symbol from the 1990s war of independence, critics and human rights groups condemn it as a neo-fascist salute. The controversy underscores Croatia's ongoing struggle to reconcile with its past.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population shrinking for 15 consecutive years and on track to halve by the end of the century. The country's fertility rate has hit an all-time low, with more than two deaths for every birth recorded last year. In response, the government has launched initiatives like a city-run dating app in Tokyo and a four-day workweek for some employees to encourage marriage and family formation. This decline is attributed to a punishing work culture, economic stagnation, and shifting social norms, posing significant threats to Japan's future.</p>

          <p>Nearly a quarter-century after the September 11th attacks, the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner continues its mission to identify victims, recently naming more individuals using new forensic technology. This tireless effort has provided long-awaited answers to some families, while about 1,100 victims, representing 40% of the total, remain unidentified. Scientists are using advanced methods, such as cryogenic grinding and sophisticated DNA amplification, to re-test the thousands of remains recovered from Ground Zero. For many families, the ongoing work represents a fulfillment of the promise to never forget.</p>

The result also ensured that his former Ryder Cup teammates, Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, avoided relegation from the league for the next season.</p>

The negotiations involve high-level officials from both nations, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng. The discussions aim to manage the complex and often tense economic rivalry between the two global powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The D.C. National Guard has indicated that its members deployed in Washington as part of the Trump administration's expanded policing initiative may carry weapons, a shift from earlier statements. This federal crackdown, which President Trump says is a response to crime, has been met with criticism from local officials and residents who view it as a federal overreach. The move has sparked protests and concerns from legal experts about habituating the public to the presence of armed federal personnel in civilian law enforcement roles, despite data showing a recent drop in violent crime.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued an expanded restraining order preventing Beto O'Rourke's political organization, Powered by People, from sending funds raised in Texas to out-of-state entities. The order is part of a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who claims the group's fundraising for Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a redistricting session was deceptive. The judge found that "harm is imminent to the State," and the order also restrains financial platforms like ActBlue from moving the group's funds out of Texas. O'Rourke's group had raised over $1 million for the lawmakers.</p>
