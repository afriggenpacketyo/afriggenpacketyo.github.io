          <p>Bryson DeChambeau has issued a strong message to Team Europe, stating that the U.S. team is "tired of losing" ahead of the next Ryder Cup. Confirmed as a member of Team USA by captain Keegan Bradley, DeChambeau will likely be a captain's pick due to his ineligibility to earn points while playing for LIV Golf. He emphasized the team's motivation and seriousness about reclaiming the cup after their defeat in Italy in 2023, citing an inspirational message from Bradley.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited notorious gang leader José Adolfo Macías Villamar, known as "Fito," to the United States, marking the first time an Ecuadorian has been sent directly from Ecuador to face U.S. justice. Macías, who leads the violent "Los Choneros" gang, faces federal charges in New York for international cocaine distribution and weapons smuggling. His extradition occurs amid a severe wave of gang-related violence in Ecuador, which authorities are struggling to control following his recent recapture after a prison escape.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Trump's Preference for Tariffs Over Sanctions in 'America First' Policy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 06:36:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the Trump administration's reliance on tariffs as its primary tool for foreign policy, contrasting them with traditional sanctions. Tariffs are presented as a more flexible, unilateral, and revenue-generating measure that aligns with the "America First" agenda to protect domestic industries and address trade deficits, particularly with China. While this approach allows for rapid policy shifts, it also creates significant uncertainty in global markets and raises concerns about escalating trade tensions and destabilizing international relations.

          <p>China's Minister of Transport announced a significant expansion of the nation's high-speed rail network, with 10,000 km of new tracks added since 2021, bringing the total to 48,000 km. This vast network now covers 97% of Chinese cities with populations over 500,000 and accounts for more than 70% of the world's total high-speed rail mileage. Officials reported a record 2.24 billion passenger trips in the first half of 2025, attributing the growth to rising travel demand and improved network capacity.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed that a national inquiry will be held into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the clashes between police and picketing miners in Rotherham on June 18, 1984, as well as the aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what is now considered discredited evidence. This decision fulfills a Labour party manifesto promise and addresses a 40-year call for truth and justice from affected communities.</p>

The discussion comes as the airline reported a more than doubling of its quarterly profits, and it also navigates the broader economic context of potential U.S. tariffs on European-made aircraft.</p>

An analysis of post-2024 election data, including from the Cooperative Election Study, suggests that this group is not a monolithic Republican bloc but is politically complex. These non-voters tend to be more economically populist than typical Democrats but also more culturally moderate or conservative on some social issues, complicating any simple outreach strategy and challenging assumptions on both sides of the party.</p>

          <p>Housing advocates are pushing for a simple legislative fix to ease the housing crisis: eliminating a 50-year-old federal rule that requires manufactured homes to be built on a "permanent chassis." Proponents argue that this outdated mandate makes production more expensive, limits design flexibility, and contributes to zoning discrimination against this form of affordable housing. After decades of inaction, the growing housing shortage has created new urgency in Congress to pass the reform, which could significantly scale up the production of affordable homes.</p>
