          <p>The Department of Justice's antitrust case against Google, initially focused on search engine dominance, has now pivoted to the implications of Google's AI products.  The DOJ argues Google could leverage its AI, particularly Gemini, to further strengthen its search monopoly and stifle competition.  The proposed remedies aim to prevent a future Google AI monopoly by potentially forcing the company to open its search data to competitors. This highlights the intertwined nature of search and AI in the modern digital landscape.</p>
