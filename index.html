          <p>The entire Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board resigned on Wednesday, alleging that the Trump administration meddled in the board's authority to award scholarships. The board stated that the State Department denied Fulbright awards to numerous individuals selected for the 2025-2026 academic year. They also claimed that an additional 1,200 foreign Fulbright recipients are undergoing an unauthorized review process, potentially leading to further rejections. The board believes these actions contradict the Fulbright mission, which promotes free speech and academic freedom. The resignations reflect deep concerns over the politicization of academic scholarships and the integrity of the Fulbright program.</p>

          <p>Two men in Los Angeles, Emiliano Galvez and Wrackkie Quiogue, are facing federal charges for allegedly possessing unregistered destructive devices during recent protest violence. Quiogue is accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail at police officers during a Sunday protest in downtown LA, while Galvez is accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail at LA sheriff's deputies during a protest in Paramount. The protests, sparked by opposition to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, have led to Mayor Karen Bass issuing an overnight curfew in downtown LA. The unrest has also spread to other major cities across the United States, including New York City and Chicago. The severity of the alleged actions and the potential danger they posed to law enforcement officials highlight the tensions surrounding the ongoing protests. Optimism score will be assigned based on the fact that the alleged incident was contained. </p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed tax and immigration bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, faces criticism over its potential impact on the national debt, even from figures like Elon Musk and some Republican senators. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, exacerbating concerns about the country's already high debt levels. Critics, including Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, express worries about mortgaging the future of younger generations. The White House disputes the CBO's estimate, accusing the agency of bias, but experts maintain that the criticism is unfounded. (not investment advice)</p>

The UK government asserts that the deal safeguards British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy, while Spanish officials also hailed the deal as historic.

          <p>President Trump announced that a trade deal with China is "done" following high-level talks in London, signaling a return to a trade framework reached in Geneva last month. China has characterized the talks as "reasonable" and "frank," emphasizing the importance of both sides upholding their commitments. Trump stated that American tariffs on Chinese goods will increase to 55%, while Chinese tariffs on American goods will be set at 10%. As part of the agreement, China will reportedly supply rare earth minerals upfront, addressing a key point of contention between the two countries, according to Trump's statement on Truth Social.</p>

          <p>Despite progress in reducing child labor globally, it remains a significant issue, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, but also in higher-income regions like the EU and the US. In the US, violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act have increased since the pandemic, with minors working too late, for too long, or in hazardous conditions, especially in agriculture. The EU faces challenges related to child labor in its supply chains from outside the bloc, with concerns about a lack of reliable data and reporting. UNICEF and the ILO emphasize the need for continued efforts to eliminate harmful child labor practices.</p>

          <p>Gold has become the world's second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' growing appetite for the precious metal, according to a report by the European Central Bank. Central banks' gold stockpiles are close to levels last seen in the 1960s, making it second only to the U.S. dollar as their biggest reserve holding. Emerging and developing countries are increasingly attracted to gold due to concerns about sanctions and the potential erosion of major currencies. However, there are signs that central bank purchases may cool in the months ahead, despite the many tailwinds that have propelled gold prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump intends to phase out the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) after the current hurricane season, shifting disaster response responsibilities to the states. This decision raises concerns about the preparedness of states, particularly those with fewer resources or less experience in handling major disasters. Experts suggest that states should be responsible for more of the financial burden of catastrophes, but that this would require a major infusion of cash to the states to bolster any FEMA-replacing infrastructure. The article emphasizes the importance of FEMA's experience and resources in disaster response, and warns that its elimination could lead to a highly uneven landscape of disaster safety.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has joined President Trump in criticizing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling the Fed's refusal to cut interest rates "monetary malpractice." Vance echoed Trump's urging for the central bank to ease monetary policy following recent inflation readings. The statement comes after a report showing that the consumer price index increased just 0.1%, with annual inflation levels above the Fed's 2% goal. Administration officials have emphasized easing inflation data and a moderating labor market as reasons to lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>
