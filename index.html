          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old man charged with the murder of conservative figure Charlie Kirk, appeared in court remotely for a hearing. His legal team opted for a preliminary hearing to assess the evidence against him before a potential trial, and Robinson did not enter a plea. Prosecutors, who are seeking the death penalty, have pointed to text messages and DNA evidence they claim link Robinson to the killing. The assassination has intensified political rhetoric, with allies of the former president vowing to continue Kirk's mission and condemning the act as politically motivated violence.</p>

          <p>A survivor of the deadly mass shooting at a Michigan church described the terrifying moments of fleeing the gunman to find his family. Paul Kirby was attending services at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when a man rammed a vehicle into the building and began shooting. Kirby recalled hearing a loud boom, seeing the armed man, and running back inside while being struck by shrapnel, narrowly avoiding a bullet that shattered a nearby glass door. The attack, which is being investigated as an act of targeted violence, left at least four people dead and eight others injured.</p>

          <p>The gunman who attacked a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Michigan has been identified as Thomas Jacob Sanford, a 40-year-old Marine veteran who served in Iraq. Authorities state Sanford drove into the church, opened fire with an assault rifle, and started a fire, killing four and injuring eight. A White House spokesperson, citing the FBI, said Sanford "hated people of the Mormon faith." This motive was echoed by a local political candidate who met Sanford and was told of his deep resentment towards the church, which he said stemmed from a past relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States federal government is on the brink of a shutdown as funding is set to expire at the end of Tuesday. The impasse stems from a disagreement between Republicans and Democrats over a spending bill, with Democrats leveraging their votes in the Senate to push for extensions of healthcare tax credits. This standoff is particularly tense due to the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to reduce the size of the federal government, with officials threatening to use a shutdown to identify and permanently lay off "non-essential" workers. While essential services will continue, many other functions could be curtailed.</p>

          <p>Approximately 58 million pounds of frozen corn dogs and sausage-on-a-stick products are being recalled nationwide due to potential contamination with pieces of wood. The recall, issued by Hillshire Brands, a Tyson Foods subsidiary, affects certain State Fair and Jimmy Dean brand items. The issue was discovered after multiple consumer complaints, including five reports of minor injuries, prompted an investigation that traced the problem to a single facility in Texas. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is concerned that the recalled products, sold to retailers, schools, and military facilities, may still be in consumers' freezers.</p>

          <p>The Taliban has imposed a total internet blackout across Afghanistan, cutting off both high-speed connections and mobile data services in a sweeping crackdown. This move follows weeks of regional internet restrictions and has been framed by a local Taliban spokesperson as a measure ordered by the supreme leader "to prevent immoral activities." The shutdown has disrupted television broadcasts and is expected to have a devastating impact on the country's youth, education, and economy. Critics argue the blackout is a deliberate act to isolate Afghan society and further suppress dissent amid a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The Scottish government has issued new guidance requiring schools to provide separate toilet facilities for boys and girls based on biological sex. This policy shift follows recent court rulings that clarified the legal definition of sex under equality laws. While single-sex toilets are now mandatory, schools are still permitted to offer additional gender-neutral facilities. The updated guidance reverses a 2021 policy that allowed transgender pupils to use the toilets corresponding to their gender identity. Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth stated the new rules provide necessary clarity, though critics have called the guidance contradictory.</p>

This follows similar remarks made in May and comes alongside a new wave of tariffs on other imported goods, such as pharmaceuticals and cabinets.

          <h2>Victims of AI-Generated Explicit Content in Minneapolis Drive Fight for Stronger Laws</h2>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis discovered that their social media photos were used without consent to create explicit deepfake content on a "nudify" website, sparking a local movement for legal reform. After learning the man who created the images had likely broken no existing laws, as the content was not distributed, the women collaborated with Minnesota State Senator Erin Maye Quade. They are now advocating for a bill that would criminalize the creation, not just the dissemination, of such nonconsensual material and impose heavy fines on the tech companies that enable it, highlighting a significant legal gray area in the age of generative AI.</p>

          <p>The UK's COVID-19 inquiry heard that the government had no contingency plans for closing schools and only began planning the day before the decision was made in March 2020. Former education secretary Gavin Williamson's evidence described a "discombobulating 24-hour sea change," as the focus had previously been on keeping schools open. The inquiry, which is examining the pandemic's impact on children, also revealed that Williamson felt the subsequent school closures in January 2021 were a "panicked decision" not centered on children's interests. The session will investigate the severe and lasting disruption to education and wellbeing.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%, offering significant savings for homebuyers. For a $300,000 mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment is now approximately $1,824, which is about $180 less per month compared to rates in January 2025. This reduction translates to over $2,160 in annual savings and nearly $65,000 over the life of the loan. The more favorable rate environment has spurred an increase in both new mortgage applications and refinancing activity as borrowers look to capitalize on the lower costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West African nationals deported from the United States to Ghana are reportedly being subsequently abandoned in neighboring Togo without passports or official documents. This situation is part of a deal where Ghana agreed to accept deportees from the region on behalf of the U.S. Lawyers and deportees state that individuals, some of whom had legal protections against removal to their home countries, were taken from a detention camp in Ghana and left across the border in Togo. The UN has called on Ghana to halt the practice, citing the risk of torture for those sent to third countries where they may be in danger.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Labor has confirmed that it will suspend the release of all economic data, including the crucial monthly jobs report, in the event of a government shutdown. According to its contingency plan, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will cease all operations, meaning that scheduled reports like the nonfarm payrolls and the consumer price index will be delayed. This data blackout would leave investors and Federal Reserve policymakers without key indicators of the economy's direction. The BLS website will not be updated during the shutdown, and all active data collection activities will also be halted.</p>

          <p>A new partnership between Hertz and Amazon Autos will allow the rental car company to sell its used fleet directly to consumers through the e-commerce platform, a move that could disrupt traditional car dealerships. Analysts suggest this direct-to-consumer channel poses a threat to dealers, as rental companies can purchase vehicles in bulk at a discount and potentially sell them for less. While Amazon will not hold inventory, it will provide the online infrastructure for the sales. The deal represents a significant step in Hertz's turnaround plan and another move by Amazon to expand its presence in the automotive retail market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have revealed that Celeste Rivas Hernandez, the teenage girl found in the trunk of a Tesla owned by musician D4vd, had been deceased for several weeks before her discovery. The car had been parked on a Hollywood Hills street long enough to receive a parking citation 11 days before the body was found. The vehicle was eventually impounded, and a tow yard worker discovered the decomposing remains after noticing a foul odor. The medical examiner is now working to determine the cause of death for the 15-year-old, who had been reported missing multiple times this year.</p>

While there is no evidence that customer data has been compromised, order and shipment processes in Japan have been suspended, and there is currently no timeline for recovery. Asahi, Japan's largest brewer, had previously identified cyber-attacks as a major business risk and apologized to its customers and partners for the disruption.</p>
