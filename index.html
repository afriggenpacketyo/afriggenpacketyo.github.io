            <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) surpassed first-quarter profit expectations due to robust demand for AI chips, with net income increasing by 60.3% year-over-year. High-performance computing, driven by AI and 5G applications, significantly contributed to sales. However, the company faces potential challenges from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on Taiwan and export controls on key clients like Nvidia and AMD. TSMC is investing heavily in overseas facilities, including an additional $100 billion in the U.S., to diversify its supply chains in response to these trade pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The prospect of a trade deal between the UK and the U.S. under President Trump is unlikely to significantly boost the UK economy, and may even be detrimental if it comes at the cost of closer ties with Europe. Trump's approach to trade is based on asserting power and demanding concessions, potentially leaving the UK as the loser. A limited trade agreement with the U.S. should be viewed as a defensive measure to protect British trade interests, rather than a strategic solution for economic growth.</p>

            <p>The European Union is drawing lessons from its past interactions with China as it prepares to face off against the U.S. under President Donald Trump, particularly in the context of trade disputes. The EU's experience with China's attempts to influence votes on electric vehicle tariffs has highlighted the bloc's vulnerability to superpower influence and the fragility of EU unity. The EU is now considering using some of the same tactics it employed against Beijing in its dealings with Washington amid escalating trade tensions.</p>

            <p>China is shifting its retaliatory tactics against the U.S. by targeting the services sector and implementing non-tariff measures, after deeming further tariff hikes on goods as "meaningless." Instead of focusing solely on tariffing goods, China is widening export controls on rare-earth minerals and launching antitrust probes into American companies. This strategic shift signals Beijing's intent to exert pressure on U.S. businesses through diverse means, intensifying the decoupling of the two economies.</p>

The program, which employs young adults in projects across the U.S., informed volunteers that they would exit early due to programmatic circumstances beyond their control. The decision reflects the administration's questioning of taxpayer money for the program, leading to concerns about the impact on volunteers and the communities they serve.</p>
