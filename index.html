          <p>A federal judge has overturned a Trump administration order that halted construction on the Revolution Wind project off the New England coast. Danish company Orsted announced it will resume work as soon as possible on the nearly completed wind farm, which is expected to power over 350,000 homes. The ruling is a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry, which it has criticized as being too expensive and unreliable. The Interior Department had previously ordered the work to stop, a move the plaintiffs called arbitrary and unlawful.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has stated his party has a "moral duty" to prevent Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party from gaining power. Speaking at his party's conference, Davey argued that voters are losing trust in both the Conservative and Labour parties, creating an opening for an alternative. He positioned the Liberal Democrats as offering change aligned with British values, contrasting it with what he described as Farage's desire to emulate "Trump's America." Davey also addressed his recent criticisms of the BBC's coverage of Reform UK.</p>

          <p>San Francisco 49ers' star defensive end, Nick Bosa, will miss the remainder of the NFL season after suffering a torn ACL in his right knee. The injury occurred during the first quarter of Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals. Bosa, the 2022 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, is a crucial component of the 49ers' defense, and his absence is a significant blow to the undefeated team. Veteran Bryce Huff is expected to take over as the starter in Bosa's place.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Sacramento District Attorney has suggested that the recent shooting at the KXTV ABC10 station was "politically motivated," citing circumstantial evidence. The suspect, a former lobbyist, allegedly left behind notes expressing animus towards Trump administration officials and referencing Jeffrey Epstein, alongside an anti-Trump book. The DA connected the timing of the attack to the network's recent suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," suggesting a possible link. The suspect faces multiple felony charges for the incident, in which he fired at the building before being arrested at his home.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in the New York City mayoral race, has withdrawn from a scheduled WABC town hall to protest the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". Mamdani stated his decision was a response to corporate leaders at ABC's parent company, Disney, prioritizing their bottom line over press freedom in the face of pressure from the Trump administration. The move highlights the growing backlash against the network's decision to pull Kimmel's show indefinitely. Mamdani argued the suspension sends a chilling message that the First Amendment is under threat.</p>

Kenvue stated that sound science shows no causal link, and medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reiterated that acetaminophen is considered the safest pain relief option for pregnant women.

          <p>A new analysis of 25 studies suggests that efforts to decrease partisan animosity, such as correcting misperceptions about political opponents, yield only small and temporary results. Researchers found that while such interventions could slightly increase warmth towards a rival party, these effects typically faded within two weeks. The study concludes that there is no "magical fix" for deep political divides. The authors suggest that lasting change will likely require altering the incentives that encourage political and media elites to stoke partisan conflict, rather than focusing solely on individual-level interventions.</p>

          <p>American parents are currently navigating mixed messages regarding childhood vaccinations due to diverging recommendations from federal and state health authorities. A CDC advisory panel recently delayed a vote on the hepatitis B shot at birth and voted to stop universally recommending COVID-19 vaccines, leaving the decision to individuals. This has led to confusion and prompted groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics to issue their own, sometimes conflicting, stronger recommendations. Meanwhile, some states are forming coalitions to encourage widespread vaccination, while others are moving to roll back vaccine mandates altogether.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial argues that Donald Trump's recent comments about hating his opponents, made at a memorial for Charlie Kirk, reveal a political strategy that threatens American democracy. The article posits that Trump seeks to criminalize speech he dislikes and is using the assassination to redefine dissent as a security threat. The editorial warns that this approach, combined with the spread of misinformation and threats against media outlets, erodes the conditions for honest public debate. It concludes that Trump is inverting the American model of free speech to reward allies and punish critics.</p>

The restaurant, named for Rosenthal's parents, aims to elevate classic American diner food using high-quality ingredients and expert cooking techniques. The concept was inspired by Rosenthal's visit to a diner in Maine while filming his show "Somebody Feed Phil." The article details their research process, including tasting milkshakes and patty melts across the city, and offers a preview of the menu, which will feature Silverton's refined take on comfort food classics.</p>

          <p>The monthly premiums for Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, can vary significantly in 2025, ranging from as low as $32 for high-deductible plans to over $550 for the most comprehensive coverage. On average, most beneficiaries can expect to pay between $90 and $300 per month for popular mid-level plans. Costs are influenced by factors such as the specific plan chosen, location, age, and tobacco use. To lower costs, consumers are advised to enroll when first eligible, compare plans carefully, and consider options with higher cost-sharing for lower premiums. (not investment advice)</p>

Routh, who is representing himself, has pleaded not guilty to all charges. His witnesses included a former Marine sniper, who testified that the rifle left at the scene malfunctioned during test-firing, and two friends who spoke to his non-violent character. Routh chose not to testify in his own defense, and the jury is expected to hear closing arguments on Tuesday, following the prosecution's seven-day case.</p>

The home, which charges up to £1,800 per week, was already under special measures by regulators.

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has become the top-selling beer in the U.S., overtaking Modelo Especial, according to new sales data. This marks a significant turnaround for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot to Modelo two years ago following a conservative backlash. Modelo's parent company, Constellation Brands, has faced challenges, including tariffs and reportedly weaker demand from its core Hispanic consumer base. The shift in market leadership is reflected in the companies' stock performance, with AB InBev's shares climbing this year while Constellation's have fallen significantly.</p>

Anti-hunger advocates and policy experts strongly criticized the decision, stating the data is critical for understanding the scale of hunger in the U.S. and shaping effective policy.
