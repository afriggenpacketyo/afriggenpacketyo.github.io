          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted over 1,600 points, and the S&P 500 experienced its largest one-day drop since the COVID-19 pandemic.  This significant market downturn followed President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on numerous countries.  Investor concerns centered on the potential negative economic impact of these tariffs, particularly on technology companies and global supply chains.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq also suffered substantial losses, reflecting widespread uncertainty and anxiety.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs have created a significant trade barrier, potentially costing the U.S. economy over $1 trillion.  The impact is felt across various sectors, with companies lacking domestic manufacturing capacity for many goods facing substantial challenges.  Retaliatory measures from other nations are anticipated, further increasing the cost of global trade and potentially dampening economic growth.  Supply chain disruptions and rising inflation are also expected consequences.</p>

          <p>The US Space Force chief warned of China's rapid advancements in space weaponry, urging the US to accelerate its own space militarization efforts.  General Saltzman highlighted China's focused approach and effective resource allocation in the Western Pacific as a key factor in its progress. He argued that the US needs to treat space as a military domain rather than simply a resource, to better counter China's growing capabilities.  This underscores the escalating space race and the growing military competition between the US and China.</p>

The judge expressed skepticism about the government's use of the Alien Enemies Act and its invocation of state secrets privilege. The administration argued that a verbal order to return the planes lacked the weight of a later written order, a claim the judge found unconvincing.  The judge hinted at issuing contempt proceedings next week, highlighting the ongoing legal battle over the legality of the deportations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs are projected to raise the U.S. average effective tariff rate to levels not seen in over a century, potentially exceeding those of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of the 1930s.  Analysts from Evercore ISI and JPMorgan estimate the effective rate to be above 20%, potentially reaching as high as 27% with additional tariffs.  This policy has raised concerns among economists and investors due to its potential to negatively impact economic growth and exacerbate global trade tensions. The historical context of the Smoot-Hawley Act's contribution to the Great Depression is relevant to understanding current anxieties.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping new tariffs represent the most significant change to global trade in a century, causing widespread confusion and market turmoil.  The tariffs include a 10% baseline tax on nearly all imported goods, with additional taxes on countries with large trade surpluses with the US.  The White House's explanation of the tariff calculations has been met with skepticism, and the lack of transparency surrounding the policy has contributed to market uncertainty.

This contrasts with Rob Key's suggestion that it would be "stupid" not to consider Stokes.  The debate highlights the complexities of balancing leadership roles and player well-being within the England cricket team.</p>

          <p>Senators Chuck Grassley (R) and Maria Cantwell (D) introduced bipartisan legislation requiring congressional approval for new tariffs, aiming to curb President Trump's unilateral authority in trade policy.

The bill mirrors the War Powers Resolution, seeking to reassert Congress's role in trade decisions.  The political implications of this legislation are significant, particularly given the potential for a vote that could directly challenge Trump's policies.</p>
