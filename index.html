          <p>Jim Daly, president of Focus on the Family, has responded to the Southern Poverty Law Center's (SPLC) decision to classify his organization as a "hate group," calling the label discouraging and dangerous. Daly argues that the SPLC's classification stems from Focus on the Family's belief in traditional marriage, which they are unwilling to abandon based on their scriptural roots. Daly also recalled the 2012 shooting at Family Research Council (FRC), another Christian nonprofit SPLC labeled as hateful, as he warned that the implications are not just reputational. Despite the hostility, Daly says Focus remains committed to its mission, including foster care and pregnancy resource services, and he questions why an organization doing good would be targeted with such a label. The organization is considering a legal response to the SPLC's designation.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, an Australian woman, is on trial for allegedly serving poisonous death cap mushrooms to her guests, resulting in the deaths of three people. Patterson claims she unknowingly used the toxic fungi while trying to improve the flavor of a "bland" beef Wellington dish. She says she believed she was using dried mushrooms from an Asian supermarket but now suspects foraged mushrooms may have been mixed in. Patterson admits to lying about having cancer to her in-laws, stating she was embarrassed about wanting weight loss surgery, and she also claims she vomited after the meal, which may have lessened the effects of the poison.</p>

Isaacman, who has led private spaceflights through SpaceX, noted that Musk's official government service ended in May.

          <p>Confidence in higher education has declined in recent years, with many Americans questioning the value of a four-year college degree. A report noted that only one in four Americans believes a college degree is essential for a well-paying job, and recent graduates face challenges in finding employment. While immediate post-pandemic trends have impacted the job market, the college wage premium remains high, although it has stopped widening since 2010. The value of college for lower-income students has declined, partly due to their enrollment in community or for-profit colleges and state investments in flagship schools rather than local public universities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to provide due process to over 100 Venezuelan men sent to a supermax prison in El Salvador. Judge James Boasberg found that the men, deported under the Alien Enemies Act, were "plainly deprived" of their rights. The Justice Department has one week to outline how it will allow the men to seek relief under habeas corpus. Boasberg expressed concerns that many of the men have no connection to the gang they are accused of belonging to.</p>

Hiring was "little changed" across most districts, with lower labor demand, declining hours worked, and staff reduction plans reported.
