          <p>Seven men have been charged with grievous bodily harm after an alleged assault of two people outside the Iranian embassy in London during a protest. Officers responded to reports of an altercation in Princes Gate, Knightsbridge, and intervened, deploying additional police to the scene. Two men, aged 37 and 39, were hospitalized with serious but not life-threatening injuries, according to a Metropolitan Police spokesperson. The incident occurred shortly before 10:00 BST on Friday, prompting a swift response from law enforcement to manage the situation and provide medical assistance to the injured. The investigation is ongoing to determine the full circumstances surrounding the alleged assault and the motivations behind the protest. Optimism here is relatively low due to the nature of the incident involving physical harm.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States has conducted a bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, claiming they have been "obliterated." Israel stated they were in "full co-ordination" with the US in planning the strikes. Iranian officials confirmed the facilities were struck but denied it had suffered a major blow. The strikes mark a significant escalation in the ongoing war between Iran and Israel, and the US reportedly used GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) in the attack. This action has drawn condemnation from Iran, which warns of "everlasting consequences," while international bodies like the IAEA are assessing the situation.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have created a two-kilowatt fibre laser capable of operating without cooling systems in extreme climates, from the Arctic to the Sahara Desert. Designed for rapid deployment for both defense and industrial uses, it contrasts with similar lasers that require large cooling units. The team overcame challenges by using 940-nanometre pump lasers and isolating heat-sensitive components. The laser features a dual-clad optical resonator and ytterbium-doped fibres to amplify photons into a lethal beam. This innovation marks a technological breakthrough in wide-temperature operating fibre lasers.</p>

          <p>As the use of artificial intelligence expands rapidly, concerns about potentially harmful responses are growing. Researchers emphasize the need for more regulations and thorough testing of AI models to address issues like hate speech and copyright infringements. Red teaming, a practice involving individuals testing AI systems to uncover potential harm, is suggested as a way to evaluate risks. Experts advocate for standardized AI flaw reports and incentives to disseminate information on these flaws. Marrying user-centered practices with governance and policy is crucial for understanding the risks posed by AI tools and users.</p>

          <p>Following President Donald Trump's strikes on Iran, concerns have arisen regarding potential retaliatory actions against the American homeland. A primary worry is cyberattacks by Iranian state actors targeting critical infrastructure like the banking system and energy grid.
