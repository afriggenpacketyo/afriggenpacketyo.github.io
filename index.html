        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's coal-fired electricity generation saw a substantial decrease in May, marking the fastest decline in five years, according to a Reuters analysis of government data. This drop is attributed to a decrease in overall power demand and a rise in renewable energy generation, which reached a record high. The decline in fossil fuel demand for electricity generation occurs amid pressure on benchmark fuel prices, which could assist India in slashing emissions. Increased generation from hydro and nuclear sources also contributed to a decline in natural gas-fired power output. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Australia's Lynas Rare Earths experienced a significant surge, reaching a two-year high, following warnings from global automakers regarding potential production delays due to China's rare-earth export restrictions. As the largest rare-earth producer outside China, Lynas is expected to benefit from concerns over global supply stability. China, responsible for approximately 90% of global rare-earth production, implemented export restrictions on strategic minerals in April. This move has raised concerns across industries reliant on these elements, which are critical for various sectors, including defense, electric vehicles, and clean energy.</p>

          <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein have experienced a significant slowdown in U.S. demand, influenced by President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the 'de minimis' loophole. Data from Sensor Tower indicates a substantial drop in daily active users (DAUs) and monthly active users (MAUs) for both platforms in May compared to March. This decline is also reflected in the platforms' Apple App Store rankings, which have fallen since the Trump administration's tariff announcements. The changes include the end of the "de minimis" tariff exemption, which previously allowed companies to ship low-cost goods worth less than $800 to the U.S. tariff-free.</p>

Despite border disputes and strained relations, some analysts believe that aggressive policies from the United States could potentially unite the three nations.

          <p>Japanese police investigated over 1,300 stalking cases in 2024, marking the highest figure since the enactment of the anti-stalking law in 2000. The increase is attributed to the National Police Agency's instructions for closer coordination between prefectural headquarters and local stations. The rise in stalking investigations follows the discovery of Asahi Okazaki, who had reported abuse from her former partner prior to her death. Police also issued a record 2,415 restraining orders in 2024, reflecting heightened efforts to address stalking-related issues.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the 2018 Boeing 737 Max crash in Indonesia has criticized the deal between Boeing and the US Justice Department (DOJ) as "morally repugnant." The deal, which includes Boeing paying $1.1bn to avoid prosecution over two crashes that killed 346 people, is seen as insufficient accountability. The agreement involves Boeing paying $444.5m to families of crash victims and $455m towards improving compliance, safety, and quality programs. Two 737 Max aircraft crashed in separate but almost identical accidents linked to faulty flight control systems.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden's actions during his presidency, accusing aides of a "conspiracy" to "deceive the public about Biden's mental state." Trump's move targets the use of an autopen to sign executive actions, alleging that the public was shielded from discovering who wielded executive power. Trump and his Republican allies have long questioned Biden's mental acuity, attempting to overturn presidential pardons and federal rules issued at the end of his term.

          <p>According to Eswar Prasad, President Trump's tariffs are disrupting the global trading system and weakening economic links that stabilize international relations. By disregarding free trade agreements and shredding rules governing trade, Trump has undercut the international rules-based order. Denying low-income countries opportunities to develop through trade could lead to increased migration. A retreat from free trade will hurt consumers worldwide through higher prices and limited choices, potentially leading to political discontent.</p>
