          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 20:49:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James, focusing on accusations of misrepresenting her primary residence to secure favorable loan terms, as well as inflating the number of livable units in a Brooklyn property for similar benefits. This investigation follows a criminal referral from the Trump administration's Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte. James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, contends these allegations are politically motivated, stemming from James' history of suing Trump and the Trump Organization. The investigation adds another layer of complexity to the already fraught political landscape surrounding James and her past legal battles with Trump.</p>

          <p>Columbia University faced a pro-Palestinian demonstration where protesters occupied the main library, leading to a swift response from campus security and subsequent arrests. Unlike a similar event a year prior, campus security intervened aggressively, reflecting a shift in the university's approach to disruptive protests. Acting President Claire Shipman praised the security officers' efforts, while critics argued that unarmed demonstrators should not be met with force. The library sustained vandalism, and the incident resulted in injuries to both protesters and security personnel, with the university initiating disciplinary procedures and the State Department considering visa reviews for international students involved.</p>

          <p>China's recent efforts to stimulate its economy through interest rate cuts and liquidity injections have not boosted its stock market, as investors remain concerned about the ongoing trade war with the U.S. The stimulus package, announced by People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng, aims to support technology, elderly care, and services consumption. However, analysts suggest that markets had already anticipated these policies, and investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures to improve consumer sentiment and stabilize the real estate sector. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this round is more focused on industrial and social needs rather than direct financing for investments and share buybacks.</p>

          <p>Josh Raffaelli, a former fund manager at Brookfield Asset Management, has filed a lawsuit against the company alleging fraud and attempted bribery.

          <p>President Trump has proposed including a tax increase on high-income earners in an upcoming fiscal package, a move that would partially reverse the 2017 tax cuts. He suggests creating a new top income bracket for individuals earning over $2.5 million, taxing income above that level at 39.6%. This proposal aims to offset the costs of extending the 2017 tax cuts and protect Medicaid from potential spending reductions. Republicans are also considering other tax hikes with a populist angle, such as increasing taxes on stock buybacks and limiting executive compensation deductions.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a major shift from its protectionist policies. This potential deal, driven by President Trump's tariffs on Indian exports, aims to boost bilateral trade, which reached $129 billion in 2024. While some experts believe the deal won't significantly harm domestic industries, others caution about the impact on India's manufacturing ambitions. A trade deal could benefit logistics companies and consumer staples, with potential downsides for financials, materials, and healthcare sectors if an agreement is not reached.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed military academies to remove ideologies deemed "divisive" by President Trump, leading to curriculum changes at West Point. The academy removed readings focusing on race, gender, and darker moments in American history, resulting in scrapped classes and faculty resignations. This decision has ignited debate over academic freedom and the influence of political agendas on educational institutions. Some faculty members have resigned in protest, questioning the school's commitment to intellectual exploration.</p>

          <p>The new film “Pavements” combines documentary footage, scenes from a stage musical, an art gallery, and a parody of a biopic to explore the band's legacy. The director, Alex Ross Perry, aims to capture the band’s essence and its influence on its dedicated fanbase. Perry invented a stage show, “Slanted! Enchanted! A Pavement Musical,” and a movie-within-a-movie. With the trappings of an actual film premiere, “Range Life” consisted of about 60 minutes of footage, assembled specifically for the event by the film’s editor, Robert Greene.</p>
