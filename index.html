          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a candidate for New York City mayor, has denounced reports of potential White House meddling in the local election as an "affront to our democracy." The New York Times reported that President Trump's advisers discussed offering administration jobs to Mayor Eric Adams and another candidate, Curtis Sliwa, potentially to clear the field for a race between Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani asserted that this represents an attempt by Donald Trump to influence the city's leadership and that New York's future should be decided by its residents, not through "backroom deals" in Washington.</p>

Nio's CEO, William Li, stated the company aims to deliver 50,000 vehicles per month in the fourth quarter, a target double its current output, to survive the highly competitive landscape.

          <p>An 18th-century Italian painting titled "Portrait of a Lady," which was looted by the Nazis during World War II, has been recovered by authorities in Argentina. The artwork by Giuseppe Ghislandi had been missing for 80 years until it was unexpectedly spotted in an online real estate listing posted by the daughter of the fugitive Nazi officer accused of stealing it. The discovery, prompted by Dutch journalists investigating the officer's past, has thrilled historians and the heirs of the original owner, who are seeking to recover over a thousand other missing works.</p>

          <p>The mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old girl allegedly killed by two Venezuelan illegal immigrants, has voiced her support for President Trump's use of military force against narco-terrorist groups. Following a U.S. strike that killed 11 alleged gang members, Alexis Nungary stated the action shows "real strength" and hopes it continues until the criminals are removed. The suspects in her daughter's case, who were released into the U.S. earlier in the year, are believed to be associated with the Tren de Aragua gang, which the administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade, showcasing advanced weaponry, is interpreted as a clear message of its growing global power, directly challenging the U.S.-led international order. President Trump acknowledged the display as "very, very impressive," but his "America First" trade policies are seen as inadvertently fostering new alliances, such as a potential thaw in relations between China, Russia, and India. This geopolitical realignment, combined with domestic legal challenges to his tariffs, poses significant risks to his strategy, which aims to protect American industry but may be creating powerful economic and political counterweights.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S. military strike against alleged "narco-terrorists" in the Caribbean highlights a significant policy shift under the Trump administration, increasingly using armed forces for roles traditionally handled by law enforcement. This expansion of the military's mission, which includes deploying the National Guard to U.S. cities and targeting drug smugglers with lethal force, moves away from the long-held principle of separating military and domestic policing. Critics express concern that this redefines national threats to include drug trafficking and migration, setting a dangerous precedent by applying counterterrorism tactics without clear legal justification.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants, stating there is no evidence of an "invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had used the obscure wartime law to expel hundreds of individuals accused of being gang members, arguing their presence constituted an incursion. The court rejected this, finding that encouraging illegal immigration is not equivalent to an armed invasion, thereby granting an injunction that blocks the use of this specific law for removing the migrants who filed the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Drawing from personal experience as both a former police detective and a recent car crash victim, an article outlines six crucial steps to take immediately following a collision. The first priorities are to stop the car, turn off the engine, and check for injuries, as failing to stop is a legal offense. If possible, vehicles should be moved to a safe location with hazard lights on. The article stresses the importance of calling 999 if anyone is injured, if the other driver leaves the scene, or if the accident is causing a major road obstruction.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been negotiated to prevent approximately 98,000 voters in North Carolina from being removed from the rolls, marking a victory for Democrats and voting rights groups against the Department of Justice. The DOJ, under the Trump administration, had sued the state to disqualify voters who registered without providing a driver's license or partial social security number. The new settlement allows these voters to provide the missing information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue without disenfranchising them, pending a judge's final approval.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has selected seven new members to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s influential vaccine advisory committee. This move follows his decision in June to fire all 17 previous members of the panel and replace them with his own handpicked advisers. The new appointees include a semi-retired transplant surgeon, an emergency medicine specialist, and a pediatric neurologist, among others. The restructuring of this key public health body comes amid ongoing debates about vaccine policy and guidance under the current administration.</p>

          <p>An Afghan family, including a father who worked with U.S. troops, is caught in a bureaucratic stalemate, held in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center for months. The family is eligible for asylum in Canada, where they have relatives, but can only make their claim at a land border. However, U.S. officials will only release them for air travel to Canada, for which they lack the necessary visas. Their lawyers argue the case highlights how asylum seekers are trapped by shifting immigration policies, leaving the family at risk of deportation back to Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>Parents in the UK are raising alarms about a lack of adequate healthcare services for children suffering from constipation, a condition that led to over 44,000 hospital admissions for those under 16 last year. One mother described how her son's severe, untreated condition was not taken seriously until he reached a crisis point, with his weight comprised significantly of stool. Experts and charities state that children are being failed by a "postcode lottery" of care, with a disparity in dedicated bladder and bowel services across the country, leading to preventable hospitalizations and significant family distress.</p>

This decision affects a group of Venezuelans who have been in the U.S. since a 2021 designation and makes them eligible for deportation unless they have other legal means to remain. The Department of Homeland Security argued that maintaining the program incentivizes illegal immigration and urged those affected to self-deport using a government app, continuing the administration's policy of revoking humanitarian protections for various nationalities.</p>
