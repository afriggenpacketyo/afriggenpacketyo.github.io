            <p>Vice President JD Vance made headlines after fumbling the Ohio State football team's national championship trophy during their White House visit with President Trump. The incident occurred after speeches and caused audible gasps from the crowd as the trophy separated into two pieces. Vance later joked about the mishap on X, while Trump credited the team's victory despite facing adversity, including a loss to Michigan. The event also included Vance singling out a Michigan fan in the audience, adding a touch of rivalry to the celebration.</p>

            <p>A report by the Fair Tax Foundation alleges that major American tech firms, dubbed the 'Silicon Six,' avoided nearly $278 billion in US corporate taxes over the past decade.

The report also highlights the companies' use of 'aggressive tax practices' and lobbying efforts.

Goldstein emphasizes the risks of remaining on dialysis and encourages patients to consider accepting less-than-perfect organs.

            <p>The Trump administration asserts it lacks the authority to compel El Salvador to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported, despite court orders. This statement came after El Salvador's President Bukele dismissed the idea of returning Abrego Garcia. The administration maintains that while it can remove domestic obstacles to Garcia's return, it cannot forcibly extract him from a sovereign nation's custody. Garcia's lawyers insist he has no gang affiliations, and his deportation was acknowledged as an administrative error.

            <p>China's economy, traditionally starting strong with an 'open door red' in the first quarter, often experiences a 'summer blue' period with declining growth in the second quarter. This trend, observed in previous years, raises concerns about whether China can sustain its economic momentum. The upcoming release of China's first-quarter GDP is expected to show impressive growth, but the challenge remains whether this can be maintained throughout the year. Economists will be watching closely to see if China can avoid another second-quarter slowdown.</p>

            <p>Families of victims of the Manchester Arena bombing have expressed 'absolute disbelief' that Hashem Abedi, the bomber, was able to attack prison officers in HMP Frankland. Abedi, serving a life sentence, attacked three officers with improvised blades and hot cooking oil. The families are urging the government to ensure Abedi 'cannot be allowed to hurt anyone else,' calling for permanent solitary confinement. The Ministry of Justice has launched a full review and suspended access to kitchens in separation centers.</p>

            <p>A group of small businesses has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, seeking to block new tariffs imposed on foreign imports. The lawsuit argues that Trump illegally usurped Congress' power by claiming trade deficits constitute an emergency. The businesses assert that trade deficits, which have persisted for decades, do not represent an unusual or extraordinary threat. The Liberty Justice Center, representing the companies, contends that the tariffs are devastating small businesses across the country.</p>
