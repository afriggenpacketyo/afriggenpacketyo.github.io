          <p>This archive article from July 2005 reports on Macau's historic center being added to Unesco's World Heritage list. The designation of 29 landmarks, significant for their role in East-West encounters and featuring Portuguese architecture, was announced in Durban, South Africa. This move aimed to broaden Macau's appeal beyond its gambling industry, with then-Chief Executive Edmund Ho Hauwah calling the sites a "unique, peerless jewel." The inclusion placed Macau's heritage alongside global landmarks like the Great Wall of China.</p>

          <p>A new report by the Board of Deputies of British Jews outlines 10 recommendations to address a significant increase in antisemitism in the UK since October 7, 2023. The findings highlight unaddressed issues within the NHS, with some Jewish employees and patients feeling unsafe. Recommendations include antisemitism training qualifications, integrating antisemitism into Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) training, and recognizing Judaism as an ethnicity. The report also suggests a consistent approach to antisemitic crimes by police and calls for similar protections afforded to other vulnerable groups to be extended to Jewish people.</p>

          <p>New UK government guidance for Relationships, Sex and Health Education (RSHE) will introduce teaching on recognizing misogyny, the dangers of deepfakes, and healthy attitudes towards consent. Schools in England will also educate pupils on identifying positive male role models and proactively engage parents on curriculum content. While specific age limits for topics like sexual harassment and pornography are dropped, the guidance outlines what should be taught by primary and secondary school completion. This update, effective from autumn and legally binding by September 2026, aims to address contemporary challenges faced by young people, including online influences and mental health.</p>

          <p>Bronny James, son of LeBron James, was a major draw at the NBA Summer League game between the Lakers and Clippers, despite the Lakers' 67-58 loss. James had one of his best games, scoring 17 points, five rebounds, and five assists in 24 minutes, shooting efficiently from the field and three-point range. His performance, marked by growing confidence and energy, was a highlight for the Lakers, who showed signs of fatigue in their sixth summer game.

          <p>Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond yield climbed to its highest level since 2008, reaching 1.599%, with 30-year yields also hitting a record high. This surge is driven by mounting concerns over fiscal spending ahead of an upcoming upper house election, where politicians are discussing consumption tax cuts. Analysts warn that such tax cuts would be "suicidal" given Japan's already high public debt. The bond market's reaction reflects doubts about the government's fiscal discipline and could potentially accelerate the Bank of Japan's next rate hike. (not investment advice)</p>

The lightning-caused fire, initially managed by the National Park Service, unexpectedly spread towards the lodge, leading to evacuations.

          <p>Tesla is facing a rare jury trial to determine its culpability in the 2019 death of Naibel Benavides, who was struck by a Tesla on autopilot while stargazing.

This builds on earlier findings that plants "scream" when distressed. Researchers plan to investigate other plant sounds and species' responses, and explore if plants communicate through sound to conserve resources, emphasizing that while plants aren't sentient, these sounds are physically produced and convey useful information.</p>
