          <p>During a rain delay at a Washington Nationals game against the New York Mets, a member of the Nationals grounds crew narrowly avoided serious injury. As the crew deployed the tarp, the individual lost balance and fell onto the tarp as it was being rolled out. Fortunately, fellow crew members quickly stopped the tarp, preventing a potentially severe incident. The game, which was delayed due to inclement weather, resumed after less than an hour. The Mets ultimately defeated the Nationals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, survivors and families gathered to commemorate the horrors of the Nazi concentration camp. British and Canadian troops liberated the camp in April 1945, finding thousands of unburied corpses and emaciated survivors. Belsen's notoriety stemmed from the chilling accounts of journalists, soldiers, and photographers who witnessed the camp's grotesqueness, where tens of thousands died due to cruelty, overcrowding, and disease.</p>

This move provides the Rams with significant draft capital to potentially replace their veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford in the future.
