          <p>Police have identified the 24-year-old victim of a fatal stabbing in Knightsbridge as Blue Stevens. The incident occurred on Wednesday evening outside the five-star Park Tower Hotel, where emergency services found Mr. Stevens with knife wounds, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. No arrests have been made, and authorities are actively investigating the circumstances surrounding the attack. Tributes, including flowers and cards, have been left at the location as the victim's family requests privacy during this difficult time.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports starting August 1, escalating a trade dispute with Ottawa. In a letter, President Trump cited Canada's retaliatory duties and linked potential tariff adjustments to Canada's cooperation in stopping the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. This new levy is separate from existing sectoral tariffs on items like steel, aluminum, and autos, and the administration has warned of further increases if Canada retaliates. The move comes despite ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arkansas Department of Corrections officials revealed how a convicted murderer and perpetrator of sexual assault, Grant Hardin, escaped from a state prison in May. During a hearing, officials stated that a kitchen supervisor violated policy by allowing Hardin to work unsupervised on a back dock, while a tower guard improperly opened a gate for him. Hardin, who was serving an 80-year sentence, disguised himself in a makeshift uniform and used a soup can lid to create a fake badge. He was recaptured on June 6 after a 13-day manhunt involving multiple law enforcement agencies.</p>

          <p>The Unite union has suspended Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's membership amid a dispute over long-running bin strikes in Birmingham. The action was taken after Rayner encouraged striking workers, who are Unite members, to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council. The union, a major Labour funder, warned it would also re-evaluate its relationship with the party if the council makes any members redundant. The dispute, which began in January over proposed role downgrades and potential pay cuts, has left piles of uncollected rubbish across the city.</p>

He is one of 15 defendants accused of using confidential information to place bets, a criminal offense of cheating under the Gambling Act that carries a potential two-year prison sentence. Due to the number of defendants, the case will be split into two trials, scheduled for September 2027 and January 2028. The charges stem from "Operation Scott," an investigation by the Gambling Commission into alleged insider betting by politicians and Conservative Party employees.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Bipartisan Policy Center highlights the financial benefits of delaying Social Security claims until age 70, which can increase monthly payments by up to 77% compared to claiming at 62. To help retirees afford this delay, the report suggests using a "bridge strategy," such as drawing from investment portfolios or using annuities to cover expenses in the interim years. While most beneficiaries would gain wealth by waiting, only about 10% currently do so. Experts emphasize that delaying provides a guaranteed, inflation-protected income stream, which is a significant advantage for long-term financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Families are facing higher costs for back-to-school supplies this year, with rising inflation and the threat of new tariffs driving up prices on essential items. A Deloitte survey estimates that K-12 spending will average $570 per child, slightly down from last year, suggesting families are cutting back despite higher prices. Many parents plan to shop earlier to avoid potential price hikes from President Trump's proposed tariffs, which have not yet fully impacted consumer goods. Retail experts note that while economic fundamentals appear solid, this uncertainty is causing consumers to be more cautious with their spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Reform MP Rupert Lowe is under investigation by Parliament's standards commissioner for allegedly failing to register donations for his independent "Rape Gang Inquiry." Lowe raised over £600,000 through a Crowdfunder for the project but has not yet declared the funds on his register of interests. In a statement, Lowe asserted that he received the donations on June 23 and has until July 21 to register them, claiming he has followed all rules. Under parliamentary regulations, MPs must declare donations exceeding £1,500 within 28 days of receipt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview with Tucker Carlson, financial personality Dave Ramsey strongly advised against using credit cards, calling the idea of paying them off monthly "the great lie." Ramsey cited data showing that 78% of users carry a balance month-to-month and argued that the psychological effect of using plastic leads to 12-18% more spending than using cash. He contends that debit cards offer the same functionalities without the risk of accumulating high-interest debt, which currently averages $37,000 for American households. Ramsey attributes widespread credit card use to decades of sophisticated and repetitive marketing. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this optimism, Levi's acknowledged that new tariffs could impact its business by $25 million to $30 million this year.

          <p>Sumy, a northern Ukrainian city near the Russian border, is bracing for a potential major offensive, with Ukrainian officials reporting a massing of 50,000 Russian troops nearby. The city, a center of Ukrainian culture and resistance, has endured frequent missile and drone attacks, including a recent strike that killed a celebrated local organist. The escalating attacks and the dismantling of USAID funding by the Trump administration have created a precarious situation for residents and local institutions. Despite the constant threat, the community continues to show resilience, though the human cost of the conflict remains devastatingly high.</p>

          <p>A new CDC estimate indicates that nearly one in three U.S. youth aged 12 to 17 had prediabetes in 2023, a significant increase from previous figures. However, some experts are questioning the findings, noting that the CDC released the information in a brief summary without a peer-reviewed paper or the raw data. The agency also changed its calculation methodology without a detailed explanation, leading to concerns about transparency and data quality following recent staff cuts. While the rise in youth prediabetes is a serious health concern, scientists are calling for more clarity to validate the new estimate.</p>

The voucher program is designed to incentivize development in areas of national interest, such as cures for Type 1 diabetes and treatments for late-stage cancer. It remains unclear how the FDA will assess affordability, as drug prices are typically set after approval, raising questions about the program's implementation. (not investment advice)</p>

A 45-day consultation with staff has begun, and the Trust is working with the Prospect union to minimize compulsory redundancies through a voluntary scheme.

          <p>Despite the high cost and difficulty of finding quality childcare in the US, a sustained mass movement demanding systemic change has failed to materialize. An article in The Guardian explores the historical and cultural reasons for this, pointing to a long-standing view of childcare as a private family issue rather than a public responsibility. While parent-led movements have been effective on other issues, childcare advocacy has been under-resourced and fragmented. However, recent organizing efforts and increased state-level investment suggest a potential shift, as more families question why the US system remains so challenging compared to other developed nations.</p>

Instead of just issuing strong warnings, Beijing is being advised to offer tangible benefits like broader market access and greater regional integration to its own trade partners. This approach aims to build a more unified regional market and fortify China's position ahead of further trade talks with Washington. The strategy involves projecting a firm diplomatic stance while simultaneously strengthening economic ties with neighboring countries to collectively push back against US policies.
