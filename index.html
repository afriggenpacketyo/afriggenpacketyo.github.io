          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers 123-107 in Game 2 of the NBA Finals, tying the series at one game apiece. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 34 points, supported by strong performances from Alex Caruso and Aaron Wiggins off the bench. The Pacers struggled with their three-point shooting, which allowed Oklahoma City to take control of the game. Every Indiana starter scored in double figures, but their combined efforts were not enough to overcome the Thunder's strong offensive showing as the series now heads back to Indiana for Game 3.</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline in May, dropping 34.5% year-on-year, marking the steepest fall since February 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted global trade. Overall exports rose 4.8%, falling short of expectations, while imports declined 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. This was offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, the European Union, and Africa. Rare earth exports decreased by 5.7% as Beijing tightened export controls, while car and ship exports increased and smartphone and home appliance exports decreased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on destructive bottom trawling across UK waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. This announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France and warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on the seabed and marine life. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats. Environmental groups like Greenpeace UK and The Wildlife Trust have welcomed the proposal, emphasizing its potential benefits for both nature and the climate.</p>

          <p>The deployment of federal agents and the National Guard in Los Angeles to enforce immigration policies has raised concerns about the establishment of a police state. Critics argue that these actions, including raids, warrantless arrests, and the creation of detention camps, are eroding civil liberties. The author contends that this infrastructure could be turned against anyone, not just immigrants. The response to these policies will be a test of the nation's commitment to resisting tyranny and upholding democratic values.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating weak domestic consumption and deepening deflation worries. The consumer price index (CPI) declined by 0.1% year-on-year, while factory-gate prices dropped 3.3%, the steepest decline since July 2023. A bruising price war in the automotive industry and falling property prices have contributed to the downward pressure. Chinese policymakers are urged to implement more forceful stimulus measures to boost consumption as the temporary trade truce with the U.S. appears shaky. (not investment advice)</p>
