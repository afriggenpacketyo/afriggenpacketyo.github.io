            <p>A cable car crash near Naples, Italy, has resulted in the deaths of four tourists, with another person seriously injured. A second cabin was also on the line at the time but located near the bottom of the valley where 16 people were rescued. The incident occurred when a cable snapped on Mount Faito, causing the cabin to plunge to the ground. Poor weather conditions hampered rescue efforts, and investigations are underway to determine the exact cause of the accident, which the cable car company has called an "unimaginable, unforeseeable tragedy."</p>
