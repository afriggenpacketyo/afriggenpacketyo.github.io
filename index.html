          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has requested an inspector general review of a controversial $2.5 billion building renovation project. The move follows sharp criticism from the White House, with officials calling it "fundamental mismanagement" and an example of "excess spending." The Fed, which is not taxpayer-funded, has defended the project, stating it is necessary to remediate hazardous materials like asbestos and bring the buildings up to modern code. Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh also criticized the costs, calling them "outrageous." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major wildfire near the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed over 70 structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge. The fire's rapid growth, fueled by strong winds, also damaged a water treatment facility, causing a chlorine gas leak that complicated firefighting efforts. Officials and politicians are now calling for an investigation into the fire's management, questioning the initial "confine and contain" strategy. Meanwhile, smoke from separate Canadian wildfires is causing poor air quality across the Upper Midwest.</p>

One local official described the floodwaters moving at 1.5 million gallons per second and reaching 36 feet in some areas. The disaster has prompted calls for improved infrastructure, including better cell service and diversion dams, to mitigate future events.</p>

This article analyzes the potential impact of such a move, noting it would be far more severe than previous measures and could significantly harm Russia's war-fueled economy, which is already showing signs of slowing. The effectiveness of these sanctions would heavily depend on the compliance of major Russian trade partners like China, India, and Turkey.

          <p>The U.S. housing market is continuing to cool, with nearly a third of the 100 largest markets now seeing annual home price declines of at least one percent. According to mortgage technology firm ICE, annual price growth slowed to just 1.3% in June, the slowest rate in two years. A combination of high mortgage rates, rising inventory, and falling demand is contributing to the trend. While prices are still rising in the Northeast and Midwest, they are softening in the South and West, with markets in Florida and Texas seeing notable drops. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 12:21:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new federal spending bill is expected to spur private jet sales by reinstating "bonus depreciation," a significant tax benefit. The provision allows businesses, including individuals who own jets through a holding company, to write off 100% of the purchase price of a new or used jet in the first year. This revives a part of the 2017 tax cuts and comes as the private jet market has been normalizing after a post-pandemic surge. Jet brokers anticipate a spike in purchases, particularly toward the end of the year as buyers look to finalize their tax positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining high, this article explores whether a long-term or short-term certificate of deposit (CD) is more profitable for savers. It calculates that while short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage yields (APYs), long-term CDs ultimately generate substantially more interest due to the extended compounding period. For example, a $5,000 five-year CD could earn over $1,100 in interest, far outpacing the $220 from a one-year CD. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals, balancing the higher total return of long-term CDs against the flexibility of short-term options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A British jury has found Constance Marten, an aristocrat, and her partner, Mark Gordon, guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence in the death of their newborn daughter, Victoria. The couple was arrested in early 2023 after a seven-week manhunt, during which they lived off-grid in a tent in freezing temperatures. The baby's body was later found in a shopping bag. The prosecution argued the baby died from the cold or being smothered, a result of the couple's selfish and reckless actions to avoid authorities after their four other children had been taken into care.</p>
