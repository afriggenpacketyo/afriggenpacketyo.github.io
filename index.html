After failing to appear in court, he posted videos from Qatar before being arrested on October 10. Sullivan entered his plea at Staines Magistrates' Court and will remain in custody until his sentencing on November 14.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index for September revealed an annual inflation rate of 3%, slightly below economists' expectations of 3.1%. This data, released during a government shutdown specifically for Social Security adjustments, suggests that the inflationary impact of the Trump administration's tariffs has been somewhat muted. The report complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, as rising inflation conflicts with a slowing job market, though markets still anticipate a rate cut. The data provides a rare glimpse into the economy amid the suspension of most other federal data releases. (not investment advice)</p>

Billups, along with over 30 others, was charged in connection with rigged poker games allegedly tied to La Cosa Nostra crime families. His attorney stated that Billups would never jeopardize his legacy or integrity for a card game and intends to fight the allegations.

          <p>The recent indictment of current and former NBA figures in a Mafia-driven gambling scheme is being framed as an inevitable consequence of the 2018 Supreme Court decision that legalized sports betting. The proliferation of betting apps and micro-bets on specific in-game events has created new avenues for compromising the integrity of sports. While leagues once opposed legalization over corruption fears, they now have lucrative partnerships with the betting industry. This scandal, involving alleged inside information for prop bets, underscores the growing concerns about problem gambling and the potential for widespread erosion of fan trust.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United forward Anthony Gordon has been a standout performer in the Champions League, recently scoring in his third consecutive game in the competition. However, the 24-year-old has struggled to replicate this form in the Premier League, where he has yet to score or register an assist this season. Manager Eddie Howe and Gordon himself acknowledge the challenge of translating his big-game performances against top European clubs to consistent domestic success. As Newcastle prepares to face Fulham, the focus is on Gordon delivering his high-intensity play week in and week out.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a halt to all trade negotiations with Canada, citing an anti-tariff ad campaign from the province of Ontario that featured the voice of former President Ronald Reagan. The ad used excerpts from a 1987 speech where Reagan criticized trade barriers, which Trump labeled as a "FAKE" ad intended to interfere with U.S. policy. The move escalates trade tensions between the two closely linked economies, which have been strained by U.S. tariffs and Canadian retaliatory measures. Canada is the second-largest trading partner for the United States.</p>

          <p>New research based on fossils from New Mexico suggests that dinosaur populations were diverse and thriving in North America right up until the asteroid strike 66 million years ago. By accurately dating the rock formations, scientists determined the fossils are from just 400,000 years before the mass extinction event. The findings, which include the colossal plant-eater Alamosaurus, challenge the long-held theory that dinosaurs were already in decline. However, some experts caution that this is evidence from a single location and may not represent the global state of dinosaur populations at the time.</p>

This disclosure comes amid a political dispute over why the espionage case against two men was dropped, with the current Labour government being accused of weakening the case. Collins' letter to MPs indicates that the assessment of China as a threat, not an "enemy," was established before the change in government, shifting focus onto the Crown Prosecution Service's handling of the case.</p>

Citing a complaint by former FBI officials and mass resignations at the DOJ, the piece argues that a pattern of political interference has become a routine injustice.

          <p>A detailed examination of the U.S. tax system reveals how many of the wealthiest Americans legally minimize their tax burdens by avoiding traditional taxable income. Instead of taking large salaries, they build wealth through untaxed stock value growth, borrowing against these assets for cash flow and passing gains to heirs untaxed. This strategy, coupled with the erosion of the estate tax through various loopholes, has contributed to growing wealth concentration. The shift from corporate dividends to stock buybacks since the 1980s has further enabled this tax avoidance playbook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reliance Industries, India's largest private oil refiner, is reportedly ceasing its purchases of Russian crude oil following new U.S. sanctions against Russian energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil. Reliance had become a major buyer, with Russian oil constituting a significant portion of its crude imports due to discounted prices. This move could impact the refiner's profit margins, as it will likely need to source more expensive crude from other regions like the Middle East or the Americas. India's overall reliance on Russian oil has surged since the war in Ukraine, accounting for a third of its total crude imports. (not investment advice)</p>

Meta was also cited for not providing simple mechanisms for users to report illegal content and challenge moderation decisions. If the findings are upheld, the companies could face fines of up to 6% of their global annual turnover.</p>

The breakthrough came after investigators used genetic genealogy to identify Smerk as a potential suspect from DNA left at the scene. Smerk told detectives he had an uncontrollable compulsion to kill and chose his victim at random, chillingly describing himself as "a serial killer who's only killed once." He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 70 years in prison, bringing a long-awaited but painful closure to the victim's family.</p>

          <p>The role of a bridesmaid has evolved into a significant financial and time commitment, with costs for events like bachelorette parties soaring into the thousands of dollars.

The trend also includes larger bridal parties and multi-day destination events, increasing the pressure and expense.

          <p>This opinion article offers a contrarian take on the recent jewelry heist at the Louvre, framing the crime as a thrilling and clever caper rather than a national tragedy. The author argues that the non-violent theft, executed with apparent simplicity by accessing an unmonitored balcony, is a gift to the world, providing entertainment and a reminder of human ingenuity. The piece contrasts this event with more violent robberies and notes the irony that the theft has made the jewels more famous than they ever were on display. The author suggests the crime was a blithe occurrence where no one was hurt.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation, savers are turning to certificates of deposit (CDs) to protect and grow their money, as top accounts offer rates that outpace inflation. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 1.97%, competitive online banks are offering rates well over 4% for terms ranging from six months to five years. Due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs currently provide some of the highest returns. To secure the best rates, savers should compare offers from online banks, which typically have lower overhead costs and can provide more competitive yields than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions.

As of late October, the average interest rate for a 10-year home equity loan is 8.28%, while the average HELOC rate is 7.85%. These financial products allow homeowners to borrow against their property's value, often with the benefit of tax-deductible interest for eligible home improvements.
