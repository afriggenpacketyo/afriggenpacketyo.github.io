          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June Amid Declining Rice Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 19:50:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, decreased to 3.3% in June, aligning with economists' expectations. This marks a cooling from a 29-month high, largely driven by an easing in the rapid rise of rice prices. Despite this, the "core-core" inflation rate, which also excludes energy, edged slightly higher to 3.4%. The data comes as the Bank of Japan faces pressure to consider raising interest rates, although analysts believe a hike is unlikely until 2026, citing inflation expectations that remain below the central bank's 2% target.

The lawsuit alleged that company leaders failed to disclose the risks associated with the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, leading to significant financial losses for the company, including a $5.1 billion FTC fine. Shareholders were seeking to have the executives personally reimburse Meta for these costs. The terms of the settlement, reached just before the second day of the trial, have not been publicly disclosed by either party.</p>

This move is part of a broader push to support the cryptocurrency industry and is expected to encourage wider adoption of stablecoins for faster, lower-cost financial transactions.

          <p>Consumers are facing record-high prices for beef, with the average cost of ground beef and steaks rising significantly over the past year. The price surge is attributed to a long-term decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include prolonged drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices. The situation is further exacerbated by a ban on cattle imports from Mexico and the potential impact of widespread tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Florida Supreme Court has upheld the state's congressional map, rejecting a challenge that argued it illegally diminishes the voting power of Black residents. The lawsuit centered on Governor Ron DeSantis's move to dismantle a North Florida district where Black voters had consistently elected their preferred candidate. In its ruling, the court determined that while the new map does reduce minority influence, the plaintiffs failed to prove a compliant district could be drawn without race being the predominant factor. The decision is a significant win for Republicans and is seen as weakening the state's anti-gerrymandering protections.</p>

During a BBC interview, Abbott reiterated controversial views she had previously expressed, suggesting that racism against Black people is distinct from and more visible than prejudice against Jewish or Traveller communities. The party has withdrawn the whip, meaning she will now sit as an independent MP. The move has sparked debate within the party, with some defending her right to discuss different forms of racism.</p>

          <p>Legal experts are expressing growing concern over the Supreme Court's increasing use of its "shadow docket" to issue major rulings with little or no explanation. This emergency docket allows the court to make decisions on an accelerated basis, often allowing controversial government policies to take effect while legal challenges are still pending. The Trump administration has frequently used this path, and the conservative majority on the court has often granted its requests. Critics argue this practice undermines the court's legitimacy by sidestepping the traditional process of oral arguments and reasoned opinions.</p>

          <p>Analysts predict that the issue of fentanyl trafficking will likely be placed back on the agenda for upcoming U.S.-China trade talks. The powerful synthetic opioid has become a leading cause of death for young adults in the United States, making it a politically significant issue for Washington. While not a traditional trade matter, its elevation to a national security concern means it could be used as leverage in broader bilateral negotiations. Addressing the crisis could potentially serve as a point of cooperation, helping to ease ongoing tensions between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's exports of rare earth compounds to China increased threefold, signaling a potential realignment of global supply chains for strategic minerals. This surge coincides with record-high Chinese imports of these materials, which are crucial for high-tech manufacturing. Analysts suggest this trend reflects both China's efforts to diversify its sources and the ripple effects of U.S.-China trade tensions. As the two superpowers erect trade barriers, emerging economies like Brazil appear to be playing an increasingly important role in strategic resource trade.</p>

This plan faces significant legal hurdles, as California voters gave redistricting power to an independent commission over a decade ago.
