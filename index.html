          <p>Authorities in Hawaii are conducting a large-scale search for a 44-year-old diver, Bryson Higashi, who went missing near Hanalei Bay, Kauai. He was last seen on Tuesday, and a multi-agency effort involving the U.S. Coast Guard, local police, and fire departments was launched after his truck was found unattended. The search operation includes boats, a helicopter, and an airplane, but is being hampered by challenging weather conditions, including 15 mph winds and reduced visibility from showers. Officials have described Higashi as 5 feet, 11 inches tall and weighing 180 pounds, and are urging anyone with information to contact the Coast Guard immediately to assist in the ongoing search and rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>Technology consulting firm Accenture has announced plans to dismiss employees who are unable to be reskilled in artificial intelligence as part of a major corporate restructuring. CEO Julie Sweet stated that as AI becomes integral to all company operations, employees are expected to retrain, and those for whom reskilling is not a viable path will be exited on a compressed timeline. This move is part of an $865 million business optimization program intended to save over $1 billion, which will be reinvested into the company's AI talent and growth. Despite the planned staff reductions, Accenture is actively hiring AI specialists, having increased its AI and data professionals from 40,000 in 2023 to 77,000 in 2025.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has publicly denied the charges against him after being indicted for allegedly making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. In a video statement, Comey declared he is "not afraid" and expressed his intent to contest the allegations in court, stating his confidence in the federal judicial system. The indictment stems from a probe into his 2020 testimony regarding the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation, known as "Crossfire Hurricane." In response, former President Trump celebrated the indictment on social media, while Comey's legal representative, Patrick Fitzgerald, affirmed his client's innocence and readiness for trial.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, is planning to introduce a digital ID system that will be mandatory for anyone seeking employment in the country. The app-based system, stored on smartphones, will contain information such as residency status, name, and nationality to verify an individual's right to work and is aimed at curbing illegal immigration. While the digital ID will be compulsory for workers, it will remain optional for non-working individuals like students and pensioners, and officials have stated it will not be required for accessing healthcare or welfare. The government plans to consult on inclusive alternatives for those without smartphones and will draw on systems already in place in countries like Estonia and Australia.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive overview of how financial advisors are compensated reveals two main structures: commission-based and fee-based relationships, each with distinct implications for investors. Commission-based advisors earn money by selling specific financial products, which can create potential conflicts of interest, while fee-based models include charges based on assets under management (AUM), flat annual fees, or subscription models. Experts suggest that understanding an advisor's payment structure is crucial for protecting returns and ensuring their recommendations align with the client's best interests. The article advises prospective clients to directly ask about service costs, how fees are charged, and any potential conflicts of interest before entering into a professional relationship.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new set of tariffs targeting specific industries, including a 100% levy on imported branded drugs unless the manufacturer is building a factory in the U.S. Additionally, the administration will impose a 25% tariff on heavy-duty trucks and a 50% tariff on kitchen and bathroom cabinets to protect domestic manufacturers from what the president described as a "flooding" of foreign products. The move has prompted concern from international partners, with the European pharmaceutical industry calling for urgent discussions to prevent harm to patients. Despite business opposition, the tariffs are part of Trump's broader strategy to boost American manufacturing and jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

He was accused of displaying a flag supporting the proscribed organization Hezbollah at a London concert but denied the charge, which his defense argued was not brought within the required six-month time limit. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" because the Director of Public Prosecutions had not consented to the prosecution until after the deadline had passed, rendering the proceedings void. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was politically motivated and an attempt to silence advocacy for Gaza.</p>

This preference is attributed to more reasonable valuations in public markets and the significant presence of AI-driven companies within major stock indices like the S&P 500. The report also noted a strong interest in secondary beneficiaries of the AI boom, such as energy and materials companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Judy Blume's groundbreaking young adult novel, "Forever...," celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, marking a half-century of its role as a cultural touchstone for teenage sexuality. First published in 1975, the book offered a candid and realistic portrayal of a young woman's first sexual relationship, complete with discussions of birth control and emotional complexity. For generations of young readers, it served as a rite of passage, often shared secretly, providing validation and normalizing female desire in an era when such topics were largely taboo. Despite attracting controversy and book bans over the decades for its explicit content, the novel remains a significant work for its pioneering depiction of female agency and its lasting impact on literature for adolescents.</p>

In a 911 call, Elliott claimed he thought he was dreaming and later told investigators he was sleepwalking, a defense supported by a family history of parasomnia. Prosecutors are skeptical, questioning his demeanor and pointing to the medical examiner's finding of two stab wounds, which they argue should have produced more blood spatter. A sleep disorder expert who conducted two studies on Elliott believes he was in a state of slow-wave sleep and acted unintentionally, creating a complex and tragic case that has left his family grappling with the loss of both children.</p>

          <p>An Arizona jury has convicted Cleophus Cooksey Jr. on eight counts of first-degree murder for a series of random shootings that occurred over a three-week period in late 2017. The victims of the killing spree in the metro Phoenix area included his own mother and stepfather, as well as strangers. Cooksey, 43, now faces a potential death sentence for the murders, along with additional convictions for kidnapping, sexual assault, and armed robbery. The killings had not been publicized as the work of a serial killer until his arrest in 2018, which was aided by advanced ballistic technology that linked the various crime scenes. Family members of the victims expressed relief and sought closure following the long-awaited verdict.</p>

          <p>China is leading a coalition of nations, including Russia, Pakistan, and Iran, in opposing any potential move by the United States to reclaim the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. Following remarks by former President Donald Trump about retaking the base due to its strategic proximity to China's nuclear facilities, the four countries issued a joint statement emphasizing the need to respect Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The statement, released after a meeting at the UN General Assembly, reiterated their firm opposition to the establishment of foreign military bases in the region. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman affirmed China's commitment to assisting in Afghanistan's peaceful reconstruction.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Faith in Housing Act, has been introduced in the U.S. Congress to override local zoning laws that often prevent religious institutions from developing affordable housing on their property. This initiative is part of a growing national movement known as "Yes in God's Backyard" (YIGBY), which aims to utilize the vast amounts of land owned by faith-based organizations to address the nationwide housing crisis. The proposed federal legislation would require that any new housing primarily serves low-income families and would streamline the approval process, building on the success of a similar state law passed in California in 2023. Proponents argue it's a win-win, allowing religious groups to fulfill their missions while creating new income streams.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, health officials are preparing for a seasonal increase in both influenza and COVID-19 cases, prompting questions about how to differentiate between the two respiratory viruses. While both share symptoms, the flu often presents suddenly with fever, body aches, and severe exhaustion, whereas COVID-19 symptoms have evolved to often include cold-like signs such as a runny nose and sore throat, with a hoarse voice becoming a hallmark of recent variants. Both viruses can cause serious illness, particularly in vulnerable populations, and health authorities are strongly recommending vaccination as the most effective defense. The UK Health Security Agency has already noted a rise in coronavirus cases, urging eligible individuals to get their booster shots.</p>

          <p>A group of hackers has threatened to publish more private data of children and staff from the Kido nursery chain unless a ransom is paid. The criminals, calling themselves Radiant, have already posted profiles of 10 children on the dark web, including photos, birthdates, and family details. They have now outlined a plan to release information on 30 more children and 100 employees. The data breach occurred through a third-party software service called Famly, which is widely used in the childcare sector. In an unusual and distressing tactic, the hackers have also been directly contacting parents, threatening them to pressure the nursery into paying the ransom.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre is demanding that Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, be stripped of her courtesy royal title following the emergence of a 2011 email in which she referred to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a "supreme friend." The email, sent shortly after she publicly claimed to have cut ties with him, has led to seven charities severing their relationships with the duchess. Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault and died by suicide earlier this year, was one of Epstein's most prominent accusers. Her sister-in-law argued that those who do not safeguard the vulnerable should not hold positions of power, while a spokesperson for the duchess stated the email was sent to avert a defamation lawsuit from Epstein.</p>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power in Africa through a network of government-run Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture across the continent. With institutes now in 49 African countries, Beijing is investing heavily in cultural exports as a complement to its economic and political interests, offering scholarships and language training to thousands of students. However, critics raise concerns about the institutes' role in spreading Chinese political ideology and interfering with academic freedom at host universities. Some analysts argue that this cultural expansion is intertwined with China's strategic goals, including securing access to Africa's natural resources and bolstering its geopolitical influence.</p>

          <p>In a surprising discovery, scientists have found dense ecosystems of marine life flourishing on unexploded Nazi-era bombs at the bottom of Germany's Luebeck Bay. An unmanned submersible exploring a munitions dump site captured footage of ten V-1 flying bombs covered in animals, including marine worms, crabs, and sea anemones. Most remarkably, the team observed over 40 starfishes congregated directly on an exposed chunk of TNT, a highly toxic explosive. The study highlights how these deadly weapons, which litter the Baltic Sea, have inadvertently become artificial reefs, providing crucial hard surfaces for marine organisms to colonize in an environment where natural rock habitats have been depleted.</p>

          <p>A data analysis has revealed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is transferring detained immigrants between facilities more frequently and at a faster pace than in the previous year. This practice often moves individuals far from their families and legal resources, sowing fear and complicating their ability to fight their cases. Advocacy groups argue that these transfers are sometimes used as a retaliatory tactic against detainees who file complaints or protest conditions, effectively isolating them in locations with fewer support networks. The transfers, which can involve cross-country flights, disrupt legal proceedings and create significant emotional and logistical hardships for detainees and their loved ones.</p>

Among the challengers is former Sheriff Alex Villanueva, whom Luna defeated in 2022, who is now seeking a rematch and has been a vocal critic of Luna's leadership. Other candidates, including current and former law enforcement officers, are also criticizing Luna's tenure as ineffective and lacking transparency, particularly concerning jail conditions and deputy gangs. Luna defends his record, arguing for stability and citing his experience as essential for the county as it prepares to host major international events like the World Cup and the Olympics.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Army veteran, George Retes Jr., has accused federal agents of wrongful arrest and subsequent retaliation after he was detained during a large-scale ICE raid at a cannabis farm in California where he worked as a security guard. Retes claims he was forcefully arrested, jailed for three days without cause, and denied access to a lawyer. After he published an opinion piece detailing his experience, the Department of Homeland Security accused him of assault during the raid, a claim he denies and which he believes is retaliation for speaking out. Represented by the Institute for Justice, Retes is now taking legal action against the government, warning that if his rights can be violated, any citizen could be at risk.</p>
