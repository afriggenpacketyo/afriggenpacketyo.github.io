          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third significant heatwave of the year, with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland all recording their warmest days so far. Amber heat health alerts remain active for the Midlands and southern England, warning of health risks, particularly for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The extreme weather has prompted hosepipe bans for millions and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland. A cooler weather system bringing rain is expected on Monday, which should provide relief and much-needed precipitation to many areas.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has announced that the government will introduce measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers. While specific details on grants are still forthcoming, the plan aims to address the high upfront cost, which is a primary barrier to wider adoption. The government will also invest £25 million to help councils install "cross-pavement gullies" for charging points, benefiting residents without private driveways. These initiatives are part of a broader effort to meet mandated targets ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team conducting a sonar survey of Wisconsin's Fox River has accidentally discovered a 19th-century shipwreck. Researchers from the Wisconsin Historical Society and the Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association were mapping other known cultural sites when they found the partially buried hull of a different vessel. The wreck is believed to be the L.W. Crane, a wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank in 1880. The discovery highlights the potential for unexpected archaeological finds, and further investigations are now underway to learn more about the vessel's history.</p>

          <p>Ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas are reportedly stalling, with a key point of contention being the control and distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza. The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) claims its method is more secure from Hamas interference than UN efforts, but it faces backlash, with its chairman accusing the UN of acting like a "mafia." The UN has raised concerns about a high death toll near aid sites, a claim the GHF disputes, highlighting the deep mistrust and political maneuvering complicating relief efforts for Palestinian civilians.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have created a biotransformation system that can turn methanol, which can be derived from captured carbon dioxide, into sucrose. This innovative process bypasses the need for traditional agriculture like growing sugar cane, which requires significant land and water resources. The team from the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology states this method could help address both environmental challenges and food security issues. The technology has also been adapted to produce other complex carbohydrates, offering a potential new avenue for sustainable biomanufacturing.</p>

          <p>The medical field is increasingly acknowledging and addressing the significant pain many individuals experience during IUD insertions, a topic historically minimized in clinical practice. Prompted by patient advocacy on social media, major health organizations like the CDC and ACOG have recently issued new guidelines for pain management. These recommendations encourage doctors to discuss and offer options beyond standard ibuprofen, such as topical anesthetics or nerve blocks. The shift reflects a broader conversation about taking women's pain seriously and improving care for a popular form of birth control.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods, this article explores Texas's recurring pattern of prioritizing disaster recovery over preventative measures. Despite being the most disaster-prone state, Texas has a political culture that often resists government spending on mitigation, as seen with the recent failure of a bill to fund a statewide emergency siren network. This resistance is attributed to a small-government ideology and skepticism of climate change science, influenced by the powerful fossil fuel industry. This approach leaves the state's rapidly growing population increasingly vulnerable to the escalating frequency of extreme weather events.</p>

Experts explain that while such duties have always existed, the higher tariff rates under the Trump administration make it more likely for carriers and retailers to pass these significant costs directly to the consumer.

          <p>A child who had contracted measles has died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, which has seen a surge in seriously ill children with the virus. While the hospital did not release specific details, it confirmed the death and noted that 17 children have been treated for measles since June. The tragic event highlights a concerning rise in measles cases in the region, which health officials attribute to a decline in MMR vaccination rates. The UK Health Security Agency has warned that measles is highly infectious and can lead to serious complications or death, especially in vulnerable children.</p>

The attack reportedly involved a drone firing a missile into a crowd queuing by a water tanker in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp. This strike is part of an escalation of Israeli aerial attacks across the Gaza Strip. Separately, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported a dramatic increase in mass casualty events at its Rafah field hospital, underscoring the horrific conditions civilians are currently enduring.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, this article examines the security breakdowns that allowed the attack to occur. The incident, which killed fire chief Corey Comperatore, prompted multiple investigations that revealed significant lapses in intelligence sharing and coordination by the U.S. Secret Service. The analysis traces some of these systemic issues back to the post-9/11 restructuring that expanded the agency's mission without a proportional increase in resources. While the Secret Service has outlined numerous reforms, many require congressional action, echoing recommendations made nearly a decade ago that were never fully implemented.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the profound political impact of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump one year ago, an event that upended the 2024 election. Trump's survival and defiant response, raising a bloodied fist, galvanized his supporters and was framed as divine intervention, contributing to a zealous tone in his presidency. The event created a stark contrast with then-President Joe Biden, whose subsequent withdrawal from the race is seen by many Democrats as a critical failure. The shooting is presented as a watershed moment that intensified political polarization and continues to shape the nation's turbulent political landscape.</p>

          <p>Relations between China and India have become strained following a dispute over the succession plan for the 14th Dalai Lama. An Indian minister stated that only the Dalai Lama and his institution could identify his successor, prompting a formal protest from Beijing, which insists the process must follow Chinese law. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi further angered Beijing by extending birthday greetings to the exiled spiritual leader.

          <p>At Caltech, researchers are creating "biohybrid" robots by embedding microelectric controllers into live jellyfish, allowing them to be remotely controlled for environmental data collection. This innovative approach could redefine ocean monitoring at a fraction of the cost of conventional underwater robots. Jellyfish are ideal candidates as they lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, and they can heal quickly after the device is removed. The team hopes this low-cost, scalable technology will make sophisticated ocean research more accessible to smaller labs and conservation groups worldwide.</p>

          <p>California is creating its first-ever state agency dedicated exclusively to housing and homelessness, a move supporters say is long overdue given the state's severe affordability crisis. Governor Gavin Newsom's reorganization plan splits the current Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency into two, elevating housing to a cabinet-level priority. The primary goal is to streamline the state's complex network of affordable housing financing programs, which are currently spread across multiple departments and even different constitutional offices. While a step toward efficiency, experts note that unifying the fragmented system will require further coordination and diplomacy.</p>

While the government insists it cannot improve the offer, the BMA has expressed hope for constructive discussions.
