          <p>Police in Atlanta are investigating the theft of unreleased music and tour materials belonging to superstar Beyoncé. The items, stored on five hard drives, were stolen from a rental vehicle being used by her choreographer, Christopher Grant. The theft occurred last week in a parking deck near Krog Street Market, with suitcases, laptops, and other valuables also taken from the vehicle. Authorities have reportedly secured an arrest warrant for a suspect, though no arrests have been made yet.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a significant shift in his approach to the war in Ukraine, threatening to impose 100% tariffs on countries trading with Russia if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days. This marks a move toward secondary sanctions as his frustration with Vladimir Putin's continued aggression grows. The administration also confirmed a deal where NATO allies will purchase U.S.-made weapons to send to Ukraine, with European nations footing the bill for the armaments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4th flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, have been intermittently suspended due to new flooding threats. Heavy rains have caused the Guadalupe and San Saba rivers to rise again, creating dangerous conditions for volunteer and official search crews. The original flooding event killed at least 130 people, including many children at a summer camp, and approximately 160 people remain missing in the region.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who has publicly broken with President Trump on key issues, has reported a strong fundraising haul for his re-election campaign. His campaign announced it has stockpiled over $1.7 million, a formidable sum that will aid his defense against a primary challenge backed by Trump's political operation. A pro-Trump super PAC was recently launched with the explicit goal of unseating Massie, signaling a significant intra-party battle ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

          <p>Andrew Cuomo, who resigned as New York's governor in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations, has announced he will run for mayor of New York City as an independent candidate. The move comes after he lost the Democratic primary to progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo's entry creates a crowded field, joining the current mayor Eric Adams, who is also running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, setting up a complex and potentially fractured general election.</p>

While any structural change is not expected until 2030, the government is exploring new models to restore trust and stability after the wrongful conviction of hundreds of postmasters.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can move forward with its plan to fire more than half of the workforce at the U.S. Department of Education. The decision, issued on the court's "shadow docket," lifts a lower court's block on the terminations while the underlying lawsuit proceeds. Critics argue the mass firings are a method to effectively dismantle the department and unconstitutionally cancel federal programs without congressional approval, a move they liken to the illegal impoundment of funds.</p>
