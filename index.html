          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit marks his first in seven years, following strained relations due to border clashes. Both nations, facing U.S. tariffs and shifting supply chains, are exploring reluctant cooperation despite deep-seated suspicions and India's significant trade deficit with China. Experts remain cautious about a lasting friendship, citing China's close ties with Pakistan and India's reliance on Chinese imports for key industries like EVs and pharmaceuticals. The summit offers a chance to find common ground, but historical disputes and economic imbalances pose ongoing challenges to the "elephant-dragon tango."</p>

          <p>South Korea has reportedly indicted former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo for abetting the short-lived martial law bid by ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol, and ex-first lady Kim Keon Hee on corruption and bribery charges. Han faces multiple offenses including insurrection and falsifying documents, while Kim is accused of stock manipulation, receiving illicit gifts, and benefiting from free opinion polls. These indictments follow President Lee Jae Myung's approval of investigations into Yoon's administration, which Yoon had previously vetoed. The legal actions highlight a significant political crisis and ongoing efforts to hold past leaders accountable, marking the first time a South Korean first lady has been indicted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has officially ended its tariff exemption for global parcel shipments valued under $800, a move expected to increase costs and disrupt supply chains for various businesses. This change, which the Trump administration deems permanent, expands on earlier cancellations for China and Hong Kong. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro stated the policy aims to save American lives by restricting narcotics flow and generate up to $10 billion annually in tariff revenues. The exemption, in place since 1938 and raised in 2015 to foster e-commerce, saw a tenfold increase in packages, raising concerns about unchecked imports and the entry of illicit substances like fentanyl.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina made its second and most destructive U.S. landfall, this article reflects on the enduring legacy of the catastrophic storm, particularly in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. The historic Lower 9th Ward, a predominantly Black community with high multi-generational homeownership, was almost entirely inundated due to multiple levee breaches, resulting in significant loss of life and widespread destruction. Katrina remains the costliest storm in U.S. history, with nearly 1,400 deaths and an estimated $200 billion in damages. The visual narrative captures the immense devastation and the subsequent determination to rebuild and remember the event.</p>

          <p>UK firms are voicing strong concerns over new U.S. taxes on low-value parcels, warning of significant uncertainty and potential price hikes for their businesses. The end of the U.S. "de minimis" exemption means parcels valued under $800 will now be subject to tariffs, specifically a 10% rate for goods from the UK. This policy shift, championed by President Trump, is pushing up costs and creating new barriers for small UK companies competing with larger brands. Many small businesses, like Nellie and Eve, have already halted shipments to the U.S. due to a lack of clear information on upfront costs, leading to fears of lost sales and increased marketing efforts to offset the impact.

          <p>Tencent Holdings is targeting "aggressive" expansion in the international cloud computing market, fueled by a growing global appetite for Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) models. Senior executive Dowson Tong Tao-sang noted that overseas cloud operations are Tencent's fastest-growing segment, achieving "high double-digit growth" in recent years, with AI being a major driver. The company sees significant opportunities in bringing Chinese open-source AI models to international clients, especially as some markets prefer hosting large language models within their own regions. This strategic focus aims to keep pace with intense competition in the AI field and leverage Tencent's expertise in AI product implementation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Large, brown cage-free eggs from Country Eggs LLC in Lucerne Valley, California, have been identified as the source of a salmonella outbreak that has sickened at least 95 people across 14 states. The "sunshine/omega-3 golden yolk" eggs, sold under various brand names, were found to be contaminated during an FDA and CDC investigation. This trace-back effort led to the company agreeing to recall the affected products, distributed between June 16 and July 9 with specific codes and sell-by dates. Public health officials advise consumers to discard or return the recalled eggs and practice thorough hygiene to prevent further spread of the infection.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Tennessee has mandated a new trial for three former Memphis police officers convicted on charges related to the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in 2023. Judge Sheryl Lipman cited concerns of bias, stemming from allegations that the original presiding judge suggested one defendant was a gang member following a separate incident. Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, Jr. were convicted of witness tampering but acquitted of violating Nichols's civil rights by causing his death. This development means the officers, who were previously acquitted of state charges, will face another federal trial, prolonging the legal process in a case that sparked nationwide protests over police brutality.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Biloxi, Mississippi, continues its struggle to rebuild, with Mayor Andrew "FoFo" Gilich citing a persistent battle with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) over crucial funding. The city needs $4 million to rebuild its pier and $111 million for sewage and stormwater system upgrades, but FEMA has offered significantly less and denied additional requests, demanding work begin before full assurance of funds. Gilich described FEMA's actions as "ridiculous" and "unacceptable," noting that 254 other post-Katrina projects in Louisiana and Mississippi remain unfinished. This situation is further complicated by the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul FEMA and recent staff reductions, raising concerns about the agency's future disaster response capabilities.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany (E3 nations) have begun the process of restoring major UN sanctions on Iran, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, amidst escalating tensions over Tehran's nuclear program. This move triggers a "snapback mechanism" that could reinstate sanctions within 30 days, following Iran's "clear and deliberate" non-compliance, including high enriched uranium stockpiles. Iran's foreign minister rejects the E3's legal jurisdiction, asserting readiness for "fair and balanced" negotiations if seriousness is shown. The U.S., which withdrew from the deal in 2018, supports the snapback and remains open to direct engagement, but talks have not resumed since June after U.S. bombings and Iran's barring of inspectors.</p>

          <p>California fire investigators are examining whether a prestigious Napa Valley winery, Hundred Acre, played a role in igniting the nearly 7,000-acre Pickett fire. A spokesperson for the Calistoga-based winery confirmed discussions with investigators, who are reportedly looking into the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard sparked the blaze. The fire, which began on August 21 at an address part of the Hundred Acre property, continues to threaten hundreds of buildings and dozens of wineries amidst a major heat wave. While the cause remains under investigation, the winery stated no controlled burn occurred. Over 2,500 personnel are battling the fire, which has not grown in several days, with 33% containment.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is modifying its "customer of size" policy, ending the guaranteed refund for an extra seat purchased by plus-size travelers, a change effective January 27. Previously, travelers encroaching on neighboring seats could buy an extra seat and receive a refund if requested after travel. The updated policy makes refunds conditional on the flight having at least one open seat and specific fare class purchases, prompting advocates to call the shift "heartbreaking." This policy revision, alongside the upcoming implementation of assigned seating, is seen as a significant reversal for an airline previously lauded for its compassionate approach, raising concerns about financial burdens and accessibility for plus-size passengers.</p>

          <p>New video analysis by BBC Verify indicates Israel struck Gaza's Nasser Hospital at least four times during a deadly attack, not twice as initially reported, killing at least 20 people including five journalists. The analysis found two staircases were hit almost simultaneously in the first wave, and what was believed to be a single later strike was actually two projectiles hitting the same spot milliseconds apart. Satellite images show IDF forces within firing range. While Israel initially expressed regret for a "tragic mishap" and later claimed a Hamas camera near the hospital, international legal experts suggest the repeated strikes on a protected medical facility may violate international law.</p>

          <p>Conservation scientists are studying the DNA of the 800-year-old Druids Oak in Buckinghamshire, aiming to unlock the secrets behind its remarkable resilience to climate change, disease, and other environmental threats. The Woodland Trust charity believes the genes of such ancient oaks, which can live for over 1,000 years, hold vital knowledge for restoring Britain's depleted woodlands. By exploring the genome of about 50 well-known ancient oaks, experts hope to identify traits for long life and survival in extreme climates. This information will guide the selection of future oak trees for planting, contributing to woodland restoration and a resurgence of diverse wildlife, including rare species like the Moccas Beetle.</p>
