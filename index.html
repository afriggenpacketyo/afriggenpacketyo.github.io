          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart is intensifying its global expansion, aiming to become a worldwide brand rather than just China's version of Disney. The company's CEO, Wang Ning, highlighted a strategy of incubating international artists using China's manufacturing capabilities and then promoting their creations globally. Propelled by the massive popularity of its Labubu dolls, Pop Mart's overseas revenue has surged dramatically. The company anticipates that its international sales will soon surpass domestic sales, with significant growth expected in North America.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a free trade agreement projected to boost their annual bilateral trade by over $34 billion in the long term. The deal significantly reduces or eliminates tariffs on a wide range of goods, including textiles, automobiles, and alcohol. Under the agreement, 99% of Indian goods will enter the UK tariff-free, while 92% of UK exports to India will see reduced duties. Leaders from both nations have praised the pact as a historic move that will enhance economic prosperity, lower consumer prices, and create jobs in both countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Resident Doctors in England Begin Five-Day Strike Amid Pay Dispute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 04:18:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Resident doctors in England have commenced a five-day strike over a long-standing pay dispute, marking the twelfth such walkout. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has pledged to minimize disruption, instructing hospitals to continue non-urgent services where possible by having senior doctors provide cover. The British Medical Association (BMA) argues that despite recent raises, doctors' real-term pay has fallen by a fifth since 2008 and warns that the current plan risks stretching staff too thin. The strike follows a breakdown in talks, with the government stating pay is not up for further negotiation.</p>

          <p>German sportswear company Puma experienced an 18% drop in its share price after significantly cutting its full-year sales and profit outlook. The company cited the adverse impact of U.S. trade tariffs, which are expected to cause a negative gross profit impact of around 80 million euros in 2025. Puma now anticipates a low-double-digit sales decline for the year and an operating profit loss, a stark reversal from its previous forecasts. This downturn reflects broader industry challenges, including volatile macroeconomic conditions and muted consumer demand in key markets like North America. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Tour de France Femmes brings attention to the significant disparities in pay and prize money between male and female professional cyclists. While the women's race has grown, its winner receives only €50,000, a fraction of the €500,000 awarded to the men's champion. Race director Marion Rousse defends the gap by comparing it to shorter men's races, but top female cyclists like Demi Vollering point to a persistent and disappointing inequality. Despite progress, including the introduction of a minimum wage, a substantial gap in salaries and media coverage remains a major challenge for the sport.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move amplified by France's recent commitment to do so. A report from the Foreign Affairs Committee, supported by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, described statehood as an "inalienable right" that should not be conditional on a long-term peace deal. While Starmer has called the right to statehood inalienable, his government's official position is to wait for a moment when recognition would have the "greatest impact." The debate intensifies as Starmer is set to hold emergency talks on the Gaza crisis with French and German leaders.</p>

The cancellation is a major setback for the region of Saxony-Anhalt, which had already made significant infrastructural preparations.

According to former senior public prosecutor Anne Brorhilker, these schemes, which exploit legal loopholes in dividend tax refunds, are ongoing due to a lack of specialized investigators and inadequate resources within tax authorities. The financial industry's heavy lobbying efforts are also cited as a major obstacle to closing the loopholes. This allows banks to engage in what experts call risk-free trades that generate profits purely from tax arbitrage. (not investment advice)</p>

It addresses the debate over her ranking in All-Star voting, concluding that while fan votes were high, player votes were more critical, reflecting her high turnover rate despite her impressive assist numbers. The article argues that the league is not overly dependent on Clark, citing its overall attendance growth and the rise of other young stars. It also dismisses the ideas that a lack of dunking holds the league back and that refereeing is uniquely substandard, pointing to the WNBA's strong fundamentals.</p>

It also raises practical concerns, including potentially siphoning revenue from the city's future casino and facing opposition from the nearby Rivers Casino in Des Plaines.

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom saw a 0.9% increase in June, a rebound attributed largely to a period of hot weather. According to the Office for National Statistics, the sunny conditions spurred consumer spending on fuel, supermarket drinks, and summer clothing. This rise followed a significant 2.8% drop in May, and while a rebound was expected, some economists found the increase to be smaller than anticipated. The data suggests that overall retail spending momentum has slowed, with only a 0.2% increase in the second quarter compared to the first three months of the year.</p>

          <p>NASA is experiencing a period of significant turmoil, marked by budget constraints, leadership changes, and potential program cancellations, leading to employee dissent. A group of over 360 current and former employees signed the "Voyager Declaration," a letter criticizing "rapid and wasteful changes" that they claim undermine the agency's mission and workforce. The unrest comes as NASA operates with an interim administrator, faces a reduced budget, and has seen high-level departures. The agency maintains that it will not compromise on safety while evaluating its mission priorities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has stepped in to mediate the escalating border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, urging both nations to "exercise restraint." The statement from China's foreign ministry came after clashes involving artillery and rockets erupted along their shared border, resulting in multiple deaths. As a friendly neighbor to both countries and a key player in the region, China emphasized the long-standing tradition within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) of resolving disputes peacefully. Beijing expressed its hope that peace would prevail and offered to play a constructive role in stabilizing the situation.</p>

Bullingham argued that the current model already causes "enough interruptions to the game" and that the FA's position is that the system is in a "good place now."

          <p>Ranchers in southern Mexico are struggling to contain an outbreak of the New World screwworm, a parasite whose larvae eat the flesh of living animals. The rapid spread of the parasite in states like Chiapas has led the U.S. to bar imports of Mexican cattle over fears of it spreading north. While a plant to produce sterile flies, an effective eradication method, is being built with U.S. support, it won't be ready until next year. In the meantime, ranchers are facing soaring medicine costs and resorting to home remedies, as the government has provided limited assistance in combating the devastating pest.</p>

The card will be accepted at most retailers selling gluten-free products, aiming to "de-medicalise" the process and provide more choice.

In response, Hamas expressed surprise at the "negative remarks" and insisted it had shown flexibility.

          <p>The United Kingdom and Australia have agreed to a 50-year treaty to deepen their defense cooperation under the AUKUS security pact, which also includes the United States. The agreement is designed to support both nations' nuclear-powered submarine programs and is expected to generate tens of thousands of jobs and significant British export revenue. The move reinforces the trilateral agreement at a time of uncertainty regarding the long-term commitment of the U.S. The pact is seen by both the UK and Australia as crucial for ensuring collective security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
