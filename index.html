          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates are forging a stronger alliance in artificial intelligence, driven by the U.S.'s desire to lead the global AI race and the UAE's ambition to diversify its economy beyond oil. The partnership involves significant investments, with U.S. tech companies like OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia collaborating on projects in the UAE. This collaboration gives the UAE access to advanced American technology while providing the U.S. with resources needed to power AI data centers. The UAE has shifted its geo-economic focus from China to the U.S. to secure access to Nvidia chips, with the goal of becoming a major AI hub for emerging markets.</p>

          <p>Japan's bond market is raising alarms about potential capital flight from the U.S. and a carry trade unwind, as long-dated yields rise. Higher Japanese government bond yields could entice Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering global financial market instability. Some analysts warn that this could lead to increased borrowing costs and a contraction in global growth. Others suggest the impact may be gradual due to the erosion in confidence in the U.S. dollar, with funds flowing out of equities first. (not investment advice)</p>

The improved heat resistance is expected to deliver greater engine thrust, better fuel efficiency, and longer service life. The Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) received the patent for advanced turbine blade manufacturing in late April. High-temperature alloy turbine blades are critical for modern jet engines, and this innovation aims to improve their thermal tolerance.</p>

          <p>European companies operating in China are finding it increasingly difficult to do business due to weak economic demand and opaque government regulations. A recent survey by the European Chamber of Commerce in China found that nearly three-quarters of companies reported increasing operational challenges. Despite these difficulties, some European businesses are buying more components from Chinese companies, increasing their supply chain dependence on China. This trend is partly driven by lower prices and the weakening of China's currency, making Chinese components more attractive.</p>

          <p>Izzy Vine, a former 999 call-handler, resigned from the Met Police after a colleague she reported for making offensive comments, including describing a sexual assault victim as a "slut," was reinstated on appeal. Vine is suing the force, claiming constructive dismissal, after the colleague was initially sacked for gross misconduct. She accuses the Met Police of "box-ticking" with its internal campaigns and demands "meaningful change." Sir Mark Rowley has promised to "root out rogue officers" and improve leadership, but Vine says her experience means she no longer trusts the force.</p>

          <p>A new Covid variant, NB.1.8.1, is proliferating around the U.S. following a surge in China, though it is not yet tracked on federal dashboards. The WHO has designated NB.1.8.1 as a variant under monitoring, noting its spread throughout 22 countries. While the variant may be more transmissible, current data does not indicate that it leads to more severe illness than other variants. The Trump administration has limited access to vaccines, with the Food and Drug Administration requiring major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use.</p>

          <p>The trial of health care workers who treated Diego Maradona shortly before his death is in doubt after a judge stepped down due to her involvement in a documentary about the case. Judge Julieta Makintach recused herself after it was revealed that she has been taking part in the "Divine Justice" miniseries. The two remaining judges will decide whether the trial will proceed or if a new trial will be ordered. Seven members of Maradona's medical team are on trial for alleged negligent homicide.</p>
