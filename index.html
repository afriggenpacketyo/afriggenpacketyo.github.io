        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission's proposal to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy, and LNG imports by 2027 has been met with resistance from Eastern European nations like Slovakia and Hungary. These countries, traditionally reliant on cheaper Russian energy, view the plan as "economic suicide" and a threat to their energy security. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico expressed concerns about building a new "Iron Curtain" between the West and Russia, warning of higher energy prices for consumers. The EU aims to achieve full energy independence from Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, although nearly 19% of its gas imports still came from Russia in 2024.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has accused India of launching a drone attack, which it claims resulted in the death of a civilian and injuries to soldiers, further escalating tensions in the disputed Kashmir region. This follows India's missile strikes on locations inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which Pakistan deemed an "act of war". The U.S. State Department has issued an alert for its consulate in Lahore, advising personnel to shelter in place. The current crisis was triggered by a tourist massacre in Indian-administered Kashmir, with India accusing Pakistan of backing the terrorists, a claim Pakistan denies. The two countries have fought multiple wars over Kashmir, raising fears of a broader conflict.</p>

          <p>New York police arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University after they occupied Butler Library, leading to injuries of two university security officers. The protesters, who were defying a ban imposed after previous campus demonstrations, were accused of vandalism, including writing "free Palestine" on bookshelves. University President Claire Shipman requested NYPD assistance, noting that many protesters were not students. The incident marks the first time Columbia has called the NYPD for an on-campus protest since April 2024, highlighting the ongoing tensions surrounding pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk has revised its global container market volume growth forecast for 2025 from 4% to -1% to 4%, citing increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty stemming from U.S.-China trade tariffs. Despite posting stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profits, the company, a key indicator of global trade, expressed concern that current tariff policies, including 145% import duties on products from China, could restrict container market volumes. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc noted that the first quarter reflected robust demand from the previous year, but the evolving tariff landscape presents challenges for the shipping industry. Maersk kept its 2025 profit guidance unchanged at between $6 billion and $9 billion.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times interview, Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) discusses the challenges facing the Democratic Party under the second Trump administration, arguing that the party was unprepared for Trump's coordinated assault on the rule of law. Murphy suggests Democrats need to respond with more urgency and risk-tolerant tactics, advocating for campaign finance reform and addressing economic inequality to regain credibility with voters. He emphasizes the need for Democrats to unrig both the economy and the government to counter Trump's appeal, suggesting the party should be more tolerant on social issues to build a broader coalition. The conversation also touches on the spiritual crisis in America and the role of technology in disconnection.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge in Boston has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deport migrants to Libya, citing a violation of their due process rights. The order restricts the administration's ability to quickly deport migrants, requiring officials to provide written notice in their language and an opportunity to file a claim to prevent removal. The plan to deport migrants to Libya, a country mired in conflict, has sparked controversy, with the U.S. State Department advising against travel there due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest. The judge's ruling came in response to a filing by immigration lawyers seeking to prevent the deportations.</p>

The deal would be the first since Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, and comes as Britain seeks to strengthen its economic ties post-Brexit.

          <p>Political scientists Steven Levitsky, Lucan Way, and Daniel Ziblatt argue that the U.S. has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, where opposition comes with a price. They cite the Trump administration's weaponization of government agencies, punitive actions against critics, and attacks on the media and universities as evidence. The authors propose that the cost of opposing the government has risen markedly, with citizens fearing criminal investigations, lawsuits, and other punitive measures. They argue that a collective defense of democracy is needed, involving prominent individuals and organizations willing to share the costs of defiance.</p>

President Koji Sato acknowledged the difficulty in forecasting the outlook due to the fluid nature of tariffs, while CFO Yoichi Miyazaki stated there are no immediate plans to pass the levies onto customers.

          <p>The impending trade deal between the UK and the US is being hailed as a significant achievement for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, especially following a challenging set of local election results. This news, combined with the free trade agreement with India, provides a political boost for Starmer. The UK has been seeking such a deal with the US since President Trump's global tariffs were announced, making this a highly significant development. The UK-India agreement is estimated to bring in a Â£25.5bn boost to bilateral trade and a Â£4.8bn annual increase in UK GDP.</p>

          <p>Chinese defense stocks are surging after Pakistan's apparent use of China-made weapons to down Indian jets. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar claimed on Wednesday that Pakistan deployed Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets in a clash with India's air force. AVIC, through its subsidiary AVIC Chengdu Aircraft, manufactures the J-10C fighter jets reportedly used by Pakistan in the recent conflict. Another subsidiary, AVIC Aerospace, which produces military aircraft and helicopters, saw its Hong Kong-listed shares rising over 6%.</p>

          <p>The popular regional Mexican band Los Alegres del Barranco has been charged with promoting crime after projecting images of CJNG cartel leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as "El Mencho," during a concert in Jalisco. This controversial act led to the revocation of the band's U.S. visas, and prosecutors are seeking pre-trial detention for the band members and concert organizers. The charges mark the first time a musical group in Mexico has faced judicial proceedings for disseminating content related to drug trafficking, as the government aims to discourage music glorifying violence and drugs. The band has continued to perform the controversial song, leading to further investigations.</p>

          <p>As India contemplates military action against Pakistan, it also explores non-military strategies to pressure its rival, particularly focusing on Pakistan's economic vulnerabilities. India is considering opposing the extension of a crucial IMF loan to Pakistan and has withdrawn from a river-sharing treaty, impacting Pakistan's water supply. Additionally, India has severed trade relations and internet access for Pakistani artists. These actions reflect India's growing economic and political influence, particularly its relationships with Gulf monarchies and the United States, which contrasts with Pakistan's economic struggles and international isolation.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports on Toyota's challenges as it navigates President Trump's tariffs and shifts to electric vehicle production. The automaker projected a decline in operating profit for the fiscal year, citing a significant hit from tariffs. Despite these challenges, Toyota remains a leader in the auto industry, with its hybrid models performing well. The company's remarks underscore the difficulties facing the Japanese auto industry amid trade uncertainties. Smaller automakers are more vulnerable due to their reliance on imported vehicles.</p>

          <p>BBC Maestro has launched an online writing course featuring an AI-enhanced avatar of the late Agatha Christie, sparking debate about the ethics of using AI to resurrect historical figures. While Christie's family approved the project and her actual words were used in the script, some ethicists question whether it's appropriate to put words in the mouth of someone who cannot consent. The course combines academic research with a "digital prosthetic" over a real actor, aiming to teach Christie's craft without inventing her views. The project highlights the growing trend of using AI to create posthumous representations of artists and celebrities.</p>

The woman, identified as Victim-3 in the federal indictment, was "set to testify" that Combs had "coerced her into sexual acts," but prosecutors have been unable to contact her or her lawyer. While three other women are still expected to testify, the absence of this key witness could weaken the prosecution's case. Combs has denied the accusations, which include allegations of sexual assault, forced labor, and sex trafficking.</p>
