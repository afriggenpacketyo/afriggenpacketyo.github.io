            <p>Three former Department of Defense aides, Dan Caldwell, Darin Selnick, and Colin Carroll, claim their reputations have been unfairly damaged following their dismissal amid concerns about unauthorized leaks. In a joint statement, the aides, all military veterans, expressed disappointment and questioned the lack of transparency surrounding the investigation, stating they were given minimal information regarding the allegations. They maintain their commitment to information security and support for the Trump-Vance administration, despite the circumstances. The Department of Defense has not yet responded to requests for comment on the situation. Optimism Score: 50</p>

However, video evidence contradicted initial claims that the convoy approached without lights. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete report.

            <p>The article questions the reliability of commonly cited economic indicators, including consumer sentiment, unemployment, and GDP, in predicting recessions. The author argues that economists and academics have often been wrong in their predictions and that no single metric is a foolproof predictor. The best approach to gauging the economy's health is to monitor actual data from key companies in the consumer, capital, and labor sectors. By focusing on real-time data from retailers, banks, and payroll companies, one can gain a more accurate understanding of the economy's trajectory. (not investment advice) Optimism Score: 60</p>
