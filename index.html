          <p>President Trump declared that the US will double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, raising them from 25% to 50%, in a move intended to bolster the domestic steel industry and decrease reliance on China. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump asserted that this action would stimulate local steel production and national output, while also securing the survival of US Steel. Trump highlighted a $14 billion investment into the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, though details remain unclear. Trump emphasized that the increased tariffs would prevent foreign steel from undercutting American manufacturers, ensuring the industry's resurgence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North and South Korea are engaged in an ongoing information war, with South Korea attempting to introduce outside information into the isolated North, while Kim Jong Un's regime tries to block it. South Korea uses loudspeakers to broadcast pop songs and subversive messages across the border, while also smuggling USB sticks and micro-SD cards loaded with foreign films, TV dramas, and news into North Korea. Kim's government has responded with increased crackdowns, new electric fences along the border with China, and harsher punishments for those caught consuming foreign media. Recent funding cuts to aid organizations and federally financed news services by the Trump administration have inadvertently aided North Korea in this information war.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has decided to end funding for a significant portion of HIV vaccine research, choosing to focus on current HIV prevention strategies instead. This decision will lead to the closure of major research efforts at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, and pause clinical trials by Moderna through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network. HHS claims this is to maximize the impact of taxpayer dollars and avoid duplication of efforts, while scientists warn that this move could set back HIV vaccine research by a decade. While new drugs like lenacapavir show promise, researchers argue that a vaccine is still essential for ending the HIV epidemic.</p>

          <p>Two men from Sandy, Utah, Maxwell Sterling Jensen and James Lael Jensen, have been charged with conspiring to support the Jalisco New Generation cartel, a Mexican cartel designated as a terrorist organization. They are accused of conspiring to launder money and aiding the fraudulent entry of crude oil shipments, operating an enterprise named Arroyo Terminals in Rio Hondo, Texas. Authorities seized tank barges containing crude oil, commercial tanker trucks, and vehicles during the arrests. The charges have profound implications for both the United States and Mexico, with prosecutors seeking a $300 million judgment if the men are convicted.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times explores a possible link between the rise of therapy culture and declining childbirth rates among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that the redefinition of "harm," "abuse," and "trauma" has led to increasingly high standards for parenting, making the prospect of parenthood daunting for many. The author posits that the fear of failing to meet these standards may be contributing to the trend of childlessness. This cultural shift has contributed to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting, making potential parents dread parenthood.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the termination of Kim Sajet, the first female director of the National Portrait Gallery, citing her support for diversity initiatives and alleged partisanship. Trump claims Sajet is a strong supporter of diversity initiatives his administration opposes and is highly partisan, though he provides no evidence. The gallery contained a caption referencing the attack on the US Capitol carried out by Trump's supporters in early 2021. Legal experts suggest Trump may not have the authority to fire Sajet, as the gallery is part of the Smithsonian, which is not directly run by the executive branch.</p>

Legislation like the GENIUS Act and efforts in the House are aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, with potential implications for the U.S. dollar's dominance as the world's reserve currency. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino anticipates commodity trading firms will be major drivers of stablecoin adoption, while the SEC is shifting towards a more industry-friendly approach.</p>

Since President Trump took office, the SEC has been rolling back enforcement in crypto, leading to concerns about conflicts of interest as the Trump family deepens its involvement in the crypto market.

The judges argue that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to members of the legislative and executive branches.

          <p>The Army has circulated guidelines for expelling transgender troops from the military, requiring them to voluntarily leave active-duty service by June 6, with involuntary separations expected to follow. The guidelines instruct personnel to address transgender troops by their medical assignment at birth rather than their preferred pronoun, and outline criteria for identifying soldiers with gender dysphoria. Army Maj. Kara Corcoran, a transgender officer, criticized the policy as worse than "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," arguing that it actively hunts down and identifies transgender service members. The Army's spokesperson stated that pronoun usage must reflect biological sex and that the Army recognizes the selfless service of all who have volunteered.</p>

Despite a temporary halt to the decision by a federal appeals court, the administration is considering options such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930.

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has filed a lawsuit against President Trump to block his attempt to cut off its federal funding, accusing him of retaliating against the public broadcaster over "perceived political slights in news coverage." PBS argues that Trump's executive order violates the Constitution and a half-century-old law governing public television, which prohibits him from defunding PBS or serving as the arbiter of its programming. The lawsuit contends that the order infringes on PBS's editorial independence and violates the Constitution's protections of speech and press freedom. The White House claims the CPB was creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime.</p>

          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging his executive order that targets public broadcasting. The lawsuit accuses the administration of unlawfully interfering in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and violating the First Amendment. Trump's executive order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to "cease direct funding to NPR and PBS," blocking federal funding and preventing indirect funding through local stations. The suit also alleges the administration has violated the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
