          <p>Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the president's executive order that places the city's police force under federal control. The suit argues the action is unlawful, infringes on the district's right to self-governance, and endangers residents. This legal challenge follows an order from Attorney General Pam Bondi to further centralize control under the DEA, which D.C.'s mayor has instructed the police chief to ignore. The lawsuit names President Trump, AG Bondi, and several federal agencies as defendants in the escalating conflict over policing authority.</p>

He stated that a successful outcome would be securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, which would serve as a preliminary step for more complex negotiations involving territorial issues and security guarantees with European allies. Sullivan argued that Putin is coming to the negotiating table due to the pressure of U.S. sanctions and that holding the summit in Alaska projects American strength. He commended the administration's focus on achieving peace while acknowledging the risks of high-level diplomacy with an adversary.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is strengthening in the Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to become the season's first hurricane, potentially reaching major hurricane status by the weekend. With maximum sustained winds currently near 70 mph, the storm is moving west-northwest and is expected to pass near or north of the Leeward Islands. While it does not currently pose a direct threat to the United States, its projected path has prompted attention in the Caribbean. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-normal hurricane season this year, with Erin being the fifth named storm to develop so far.</p>

          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard across parts of southeastern England after the Royal Air Force scrambled Typhoon fighter jets from RAF Coningsby. The jets were launched to intercept a civilian aircraft that had lost communication with air traffic control while traveling from Nice. The RAF confirmed that communications were re-established and the plane was safely escorted to Stansted Airport. The explosive sound, which occurs when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, caused widespread alarm among residents who reported shaking houses and what sounded like an explosion.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced the opening of a new immigration detention facility, named the "Deportation Depot," at a closed prison in north Florida. The center will initially house 1,300 individuals and is part of a broader state-led effort to enforce federal immigration laws, building on the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" facility in the Everglades. DeSantis stated the new site was chosen for its ready-made infrastructure, allowing it to become operational quickly and at a lower cost. This expansion aims to detain and deport undocumented immigrants who have final orders of removal, amidst ongoing legal challenges to the state's other detention facilities.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that U.S. homeowners have seen their home equity increase by an average of 142% since early 2020, boosting household wealth nationwide.

States in the South and Midwest generally saw the largest gains, while Louisiana was the only state to see a decline in home equity. The report highlights how housing market dynamics over the past five years have reshaped personal wealth for homeowners across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The King and Queen joined World War Two veterans at the National Memorial Arboretum to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day, which ended the conflict. In a commemorative message, the King paid tribute to the "courage and sacrifice" of the British, Commonwealth, and Allied forces who fought in the Far East, often referred to as the "Forgotten Army." The service honored the 33 surviving veterans present and included wreath-layings and a flypast by the Red Arrows. The King also acknowledged the immense suffering of civilians and prisoners of war, vowing that their contributions shall never be forgotten.</p>

          <p>A Labour councillor, Ricky Jones, has been found not guilty of encouraging violent disorder after he made inflammatory remarks at an anti-racism rally last year. During the protest, Jones called far-right demonstrators "disgusting Nazi fascists" and made a throat-slitting gesture, which he later told police was "ill-advised" but not intended to incite violence. The jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court deliberated for just over half an hour before reaching its verdict. The decision has drawn criticism from some political figures who argue it represents an example of "two-tier justice" when compared to other recent convictions for online hate speech.</p>

          <p>In Bihar, India, where inadequate infrastructure and extreme heat cause significant crop spoilage, solar-powered cold storage facilities are emerging as a potential solution for small-scale farmers. These units allow farmers to preserve perishable produce like potatoes, fruits, and vegetables for longer, enabling them to sell at better market prices and reduce waste. While companies are installing these systems and the government is offering subsidies, challenges remain, including high upfront costs and the need for community-based sharing models to make them affordable. Experts believe that a collaborative approach between government, NGOs, and farmers is crucial for the technology's widespread success.</p>

The report highlights that many of these Republicans represent districts that have benefited from green energy investments, suggesting a conflict between their constituents' interests and their donors'.

          <p>At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a growing number of engineering and science students are forming arts collectives to write and critique poetry, exploring human expression in an age of artificial intelligence. This article reflects on how poetry, an ancient art form, serves as a vital counterpoint to the predictive and data-driven nature of large language models. While AI optimizes for probability, poetry thrives on surprise, originality, and the preservation of specific human experiences. The author, a literature professor at MIT, notes how students use poetry to process complex emotions and are even integrating it with technology to create innovative, human-centered art projects.</p>

Guibert shares intimate details of their life, her struggles as a young single mother, and their powerful bond.

          <p>The United Kingdom's bioethanol industry is facing imminent collapse after the government decided against providing a rescue package to its two major producers, Vivergo Fuels and Ensus. The companies warned that their businesses became commercially unviable following a UK-US trade deal that allowed for tariff-free imports of American ethanol. Associated British Foods, Vivergo's owner, called the government's decision "deeply regrettable," stating it has thrown away potential growth and a sovereign clean fuel capability. The government defended its decision, arguing that direct funding would not provide value for taxpayers or solve the industry's long-term issues.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. Social Security program celebrates its 90th anniversary, it faces increasing concerns over its long-term financial stability and operational capacity. The program, which provides benefits to nearly 70 million Americans, is projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, which could lead to a 23% cut in benefits if no legislative action is taken. Compounding these financial woes are recent staffing cuts under the Trump administration, which critics argue have hampered the agency's ability to serve a growing number of retirees. Despite these challenges, the White House maintains that the program has become more efficient under its leadership.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering nearly a dozen candidates to replace Jerome Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve. The list includes a mix of current and former Fed officials, economists, and market strategists, many of whom have publicly expressed their views on monetary policy. A common theme among several potential nominees is the belief that the Fed should lower its benchmark interest rate to stimulate the economy. Candidates like former Governor Kevin Warsh have called for significant "regime change" at the central bank, while others have emphasized the need for greater transparency and intellectual diversity in its decision-making processes.</p>

          <p>The series finale of 'And Just Like That' reinforces the show's consistent theme of humiliation, a departure from the more complex cynicism of its predecessor, 'Sex and the City.' This review argues that across its three seasons, the sequel has been squeamish about physicality and often treated its aging characters with a kind of cruelty, using their bodies as punchlines for cringe-worthy gags. The show's fixation on extreme wealth insulated its characters from real-world stakes, leaving physical degradation as the primary source of conflict. Ultimately, the series finale demonstrates how out of touch the characters have become, making it easier for viewers to say goodbye.</p>

UnitedHealth's shares surged in after-hours trading following the disclosure. The filing also showed Berkshire taking new positions in several other companies, including homebuilders and a steel manufacturer, while slightly trimming its large stakes in Apple and Bank of America.

Employees raised alarms that the institute is at risk of collapse after being directed by the Technology Secretary to prioritize defence research, a significant pivot from its broader mission. In a letter to staff, the institute's chair confirmed a new focus but stated that work on healthcare and environmental issues would continue. Whistleblowers remain skeptical, describing the management's response as "performative" amid ongoing restructuring and redundancies.</p>

This move effectively ends the capital's status as a "sanctuary city" and allows the Metropolitan Police Department to fully assist agencies like ICE with immigration enforcement. The order is part of President Trump's broader anti-crime crackdown in the district, which is being carried out under an emergency declaration that places the city's police under temporary federal control.

While analysts describe the gains as limited, they represent a dangerous moment for Ukraine, creating a negative information backdrop for the high-stakes talks. Ukrainian officials believe the offensive is timed to strengthen Putin's negotiating position by suggesting that Kyiv is losing ground on the battlefield.
