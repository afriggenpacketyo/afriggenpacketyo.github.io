          <p>A cyberattack targeting software from Collins Aerospace has caused significant disruptions at several major European airports, including London Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack affected electronic check-in and baggage systems, forcing airlines to resort to manual processing and leading to long queues and flight delays. The provider acknowledged the "cyber-related disruption" to its Multi-User System Environment software, which allows multiple airlines to share airport resources. While backup systems were deployed where possible, the incident highlights the vulnerability of the highly interconnected global aviation industry to digital threats.</p>

          <p>Estonia has formally requested urgent consultations with NATO allies under Article 4 after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland. The incursion, which Russia denies, is described as part of a pattern of escalating provocations testing the alliance's defenses on its eastern flank. The incident has heightened geopolitical tensions, prompting a response from NATO jets and raising strategic questions about how the alliance should respond to such actions without triggering a wider conflict, especially given the current political climate.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic. Currently, the storm is tracking northwest with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and is not expected to pose an immediate threat to land. However, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict it will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday. The storm's projected path could bring it east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to intensify over open waters.</p>

          <h2>Key Considerations for Consumers Before Purchasing Refurbished Electronics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 06:37:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article offers practical advice for consumers considering buying refurbished technology, emphasizing that 'refurbished' does not uniformly mean 'like-new.' It advises buyers to scrutinize the seller's reputation, warranty and return policies, and what accessories are included, as these can vary widely. Key points include verifying battery health, ensuring the device still receives software updates for security, and thoroughly testing the product upon arrival. Following these steps can help consumers find genuine value while avoiding common pitfalls associated with secondhand electronics.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched a major overnight assault targeting infrastructure and residential areas in numerous Ukrainian regions, including a cluster munition strike on an apartment building in Dnipro. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as a deliberate strategy to terrorize civilians, resulting in at least three deaths and dozens of injuries. Ukrainian air defenses, reportedly including F-16 fighters, intercepted a significant number of the over 600 projectiles launched. Zelenskyy plans to discuss long-term security guarantees during upcoming meetings at the United Nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order introducing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, citing a need to prevent "abuse" of the program and encourage hiring Americans. The move has been sharply criticized by immigration lawyers and business groups, who argue it will price out small and medium-sized businesses and harm American competitiveness in the tech sector. The administration contends that the high fee will force companies to carefully consider the value of foreign talent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has highlighted a deep schism in how Americans understand major news events, a divide dangerously amplified by social media. Immediately following the shooting, disparate narratives emerged online, with different political communities interpreting the killer's motives to fit their pre-existing worldviews. Experts note that while official documents provide a more nuanced picture, the algorithms and incentive structures of social media platforms reward rapid, often speculative, takes over complex realities, further fragmenting public understanding.</p>

          <p>The intense, all-consuming infatuation known as "limerence" is explored in a new book by neuroscientist Tom Bellamy, who describes it as a state of romantic obsession that can create an extraordinary natural high. However, this feeling can devolve into anxiety and craving if the feelings are not reciprocated or a stable bond cannot be formed, particularly with an unsuitable or unavailable person. The book offers practical, science-based strategies to break the cycle, such as limiting contact and reframing daydreams to regain emotional control.</p>

          <p>Small-town water and wastewater systems across the United States are becoming increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks from foreign entities, including hackers linked to Iran, Russia, and China. With limited resources and cybersecurity expertise, these critical infrastructure operators are often the only line of defense against attacks that could disrupt clean water supplies. A new pilot program, Project Franklin, is now connecting volunteer cybersecurity experts with these facilities to help them secure their antiquated and increasingly internet-connected systems against this rising threat.</p>

          <p>The Turkish government is intensifying its crackdown on female artists, with the popular girl band Manifest being the latest target of an investigation for "indecent and immoral acts" related to their stage performance. This follows similar legal actions against other prominent female musicians and writers, often initiated by pro-government media and culminating in official charges. Critics argue this is part of a broader political strategy by the ruling AKP party to enforce conservative religious values, silence dissent, and oppress women who challenge traditional norms.</p>
