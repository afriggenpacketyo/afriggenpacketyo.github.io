          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on former President Donald Trump to join him in Turkey for peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelensky stated that Trump's presence would put pressure on Putin to engage in face-to-face discussions. The Kremlin has not confirmed Putin's attendance, and Zelensky expressed skepticism about Putin's genuine desire for either talks or peace. This article highlights the increasing importance of the talks amid escalating tensions between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States, with each side raising the stakes. The Ukrainian president is eager to agree on a cease-fire and end the war, so he wants to meet Putin face to face, which he can do if Trump attends.</p>

          <p>Peter Coker Jr. received a 40-month prison sentence, while his father, Peter Coker Sr., was sentenced to six months in jail followed by six months of home confinement for their involvement in a $100 million securities fraud. The scheme involved fraudulently inflating the share price of two companies, including Hometown International, which owned a small, money-losing deli. Coker Jr.'s lawyer cited his client's harsh experiences in a Thai prison and his severe cirrhosis of the liver as mitigating factors. Coker Jr. expressed remorse for his actions, acknowledging the impact on his parents and renouncing his U.S. citizenship, while Coker Sr. was ordered to pay a $500,000 fine and restitution.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee's Credentials subcommittee has suggested a revote for vice-chair elections, potentially endangering the positions of current vice chairs David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta due to concerns about the original balloting process. The recommendation follows a challenge by vice-chair candidate Kalyn Free, who alleged voting irregularities that unfairly benefited Hogg and Kenyatta. Hogg claims the vote is tied to his reform efforts within the Democratic Party, while Kenyatta expressed frustration that Hogg is making the issue about himself. DNC Chair Ken Martin voiced disappointment over the procedural error in the February elections and thanked the officers for their service.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, the White House announced $600 billion in deals with the Saudi government and firms, but the actual details provided totaled around $283 billion. The largest agreement included a $142 billion defense sales deal and a $20 billion investment from DataVolt in U.S. infrastructure. Trump hailed Saudi Arabia's rapid development and criticized the Biden administration's efforts in the region, also advocating for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords. Despite the announcements, some projects were already underway before Trump took office, and economists doubt Saudi Arabia's capacity to invest $1 trillion as requested by Trump.</p>

          <p>Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, have dismissed traffic charges against Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born student, leading to her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Police determined the officer stopped the wrong vehicle after reviewing dashboard camera footage. Despite the dismissal, Arias Cristobal, who lacks legal authorization to be in the U.S., remains in ICE custody and faces deportation, along with her father, who was also arrested following a traffic stop. Local officials expressed regret over the mistake but did not notify ICE, and Arias Cristobal's lawyers anticipate she will remain detained pending a bond hearing.</p>

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be 2.4%, the lowest annual benefit increase in five years, but this projection could change based on future inflation rates. The COLA provides an annual inflation adjustment to Social Security beneficiaries, including retirees and disabled individuals. The adjustment is calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year, using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The CPI-W has increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months.</p>

German law prohibits the public display or dissemination of Nazi symbols and slogans, punishable by imprisonment or a fine.

Dramatic hearings are expected as Democrats challenge Republican efforts, and protests against Medicaid cuts have occurred at the Capitol. The GOP plan proposes Medicaid cuts through work requirements and stricter eligibility checks, facing opposition from hardliners and moderates. The bill also includes tax provisions, such as extending Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act, but faces resistance over state and local tax deduction caps.

While stocks have risen and bond market volatility has subsided, the lack of clarity on final tariff levels leaves investors in a difficult position. The Federal Reserve is also adopting a wait-and-see approach, delaying interest rate cuts until the inflationary effects of tariffs are clearer. Despite the de-escalation of tariffs, concerns persist about the impact on consumer spending and corporate profits, with some analysts warning that the U.S. is not yet "out of the woods."</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have arrested Jerry Wimbley III, a reputed member of the Pasadena Denver Lanes Bloods street gang, for his alleged involvement in a shooting spree in Lancaster last summer that resulted in two deaths. Wimbley and two other alleged gang members are charged with murder and attempted murder in aid of racketeering. The shootings were allegedly committed to enhance the power and influence of the PDL Bloods street gang. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department had previously deployed more deputies to the city following the shootings.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has removed New York City's control over Rikers Island, appointing an outside official to manage the troubled jail complex. Judge Laura Taylor Swain stated the official will report directly to her and have broad powers to implement necessary changes. The order comes after nearly a decade of federal oversight due to persistent violence and dysfunction, as New York City has struggled to improve conditions despite spending over $500,000 per inmate annually. The city's jail population has increased, and recent deaths have highlighted ongoing issues, leading to calls for a receiver.</p>

          <p>The Qatari royal family has proposed gifting President Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 for use as Air Force One, which would then be donated to his presidential foundation, raising concerns about potential corruption. Democrats have criticized the plan, with some Republicans also voicing security and legal concerns. While presidents often exchange gifts with foreign governments, laws are in place to prevent undue influence. This proposed gift raises questions about Qatar's motives and the potential for conflicts of interest, given Trump's history of foreign governments spending millions at his private businesses.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of large tariffs on goods from every country, inflation slowed in April, prompting questions about the economy's trajectory. The Trump administration also lowered tariffs on China, leading to speculation about the end of a manufactured economic crisis. While tariffs reliably increase consumer prices, companies had stocked up on foreign goods in anticipation, delaying the impact on inflation. The risk of a severe economic crisis has fallen, but price hikes are still expected as companies exhaust their pre-trade war inventories, leading to potential disruptions in supply chains and inflationary cycles.</p>
