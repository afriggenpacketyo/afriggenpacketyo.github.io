        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court extended its injunction, preventing the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act. The court cited inadequate time and information provided to migrants to contest their removals, emphasizing the importance of due process. The case has been remanded to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the appropriate process for these cases. Justices Alito and Thomas dissented, while President Trump criticized the decision, and the ACLU praised the pause on deportations to what they called brutal foreign prisons. </p>

          <p>Eric Council Jr. from Alabama received a 14-month prison sentence for his involvement in the January 2024 hack of the Securities and Exchange Commission's X account. Council executed a SIM swap attack to help conspirators gain control of the SEC's account, which was used to falsely tweet that Bitcoin ETFs had been approved, briefly inflating Bitcoin's price. Prosecutors requested a longer sentence, citing a video where Council diminished his culpability and blamed the SEC's cybersecurity practices.

          <p>A fire destroyed much of the historic Nottoway Plantation House in White Castle, Louisiana, a significant antebellum mansion and tourism site. The fire, which required nearly a dozen fire departments to battle, resulted in a "total loss" for the owner, attorney Dan Dyess, though no injuries were reported. The structure, built in the 1850s, was a 53,000-square-foot building used as a museum and event venue and was considered the South's largest remaining antebellum mansion. The local Parish President acknowledged the building's history of racial injustice while emphasizing its more recent role as a place of reflection and education.</p>

          <p>A Consumer Reports investigation revealed that Kroger shoppers are frequently overcharged for items marked as being on sale due to price tag errors. The investigation found expired discount tags on numerous grocery items, resulting in an average overcharge of $1.70 per item, or 18.4%. Kroger disputes the findings, claiming the errors are minimal compared to the billions of annual transactions, however, customers have filed complaints and class-action lawsuits alleging pricing errors at Kroger locations. The report also suggests potential staffing issues may contribute to the problem.</p>

The controversy stems from a transgender softball pitcher dominating a girls' softball season, sparking debate about fairness and safety in women's sports.

          <p>Tens of millions of Americans are at risk of severe weather this weekend, with high winds, tornadoes, heavy rain, and extreme temperatures expected across the country. The National Weather Service warned of a "very active and complex mid-May weather pattern," with primary risks including large hail, damaging wind gusts, and tornadoes. Simultaneously, an unusual early-season heat wave is expected in south Texas, with temperatures reaching record-breaking levels, making Texas hotter than Death Valley. The severe weather events occur amid a growing global climate crisis and the Trump administration's rollbacks on environmental regulations.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is considering dropping its criminal case against Boeing over the two fatal 737 Max crashes, despite outrage from families of the victims. Boeing had previously agreed to plead guilty to defrauding regulators, but a federal judge rejected the proposed plea deal. The new agreement would allow Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution by agreeing to a non-criminal settlement, including $444.5 million for a crash victims' fund. Lawyers for the family members are outraged by the proposed deal and plan to fight it in court, arguing it allows the rich and powerful to avoid accountability.</p>

The conservatives seek changes to the bill, arguing that their leaders did not go far enough to cut federal spending, and that the bill would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Andry HernÃ¡ndez, a Venezuelan asylum seeker, was deported from the US to El Salvador based on a "points system" that flagged him as a suspected gang member due to his crown tattoos. Despite claiming persecution for his political beliefs and sexual orientation, HernÃ¡ndez was assessed using criteria that associated crown tattoos with the Tren de Aragua gang. His lawyers argue that this is insufficient evidence and that he was not given the opportunity to contest the charges before being deported to El Salvador's mega-prison. The case raises concerns about the reliability and fairness of using tattoos as a primary indicator of gang affiliation.</p>
