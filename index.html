          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still addressing police reform efforts, according to Police Chief Brian O'Hara, who assumed his role in November 2022.

O'Hara is focused on restoring trust within the community by emphasizing basic policing principles and changing the department's culture. He aims to reduce crime while building community relationships, even as federal oversight diminishes.</p>
