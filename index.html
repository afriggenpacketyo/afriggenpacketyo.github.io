          <p>During a contentious Senate Finance Committee hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. affirmed his agreement with false claims that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk. He clashed with Democratic senators over whether his policies are limiting access to COVID-19 shots and defended his decision to replace the entire membership of a key government vaccine advisory panel. Kennedy's testimony comes amid a leadership shake-up at the CDC and accusations from its former director that he is deliberately weakening the nation's public health system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's petition to the Supreme Court to rule on its tariff policy may have created a legal paradox, according to a new analysis. The article argues that by describing the tariffs as a initiative of vast 'economic and political significance,' the administration's lawyers may have inadvertently invoked the 'major questions doctrine.' This is the same legal standard the court's conservative majority recently created and used to strike down significant Biden-era policies, suggesting a consistent application of the doctrine would compel the justices to invalidate the tariffs.

The call took place during a 'Coalition of the Willing' summit in Paris, which aimed to coordinate further support for Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>Nadine Dorries, a former culture secretary and a staunch ally of Boris Johnson, has announced her defection from the Conservative Party to join Reform UK. In her statement, she declared that the Tory Party is 'dead' and no longer aligns with her core beliefs, criticizing her former colleagues for ousting Johnson. This move represents another high-profile departure from the Conservatives to the populist party led by Nigel Farage, signaling continued fragmentation on the right of British politics.</p>

The accusations include the misuse of vouchers donated by a sponsor to buy luxury perfumes and fostering a 'bullying culture' toward volunteer staff. Current and former volunteers have expressed deep concern that the scandal could harm the reputation and financial viability of one of Europe's largest Pride events during an already precarious time for such organizations.</p>

          <p>Northwestern University President Michael Schill has announced he is stepping down after a turbulent three-year period. His tenure was marked by intense scrutiny from conservative lawmakers over the university's handling of campus protests, which led to the Trump administration slashing nearly $800 million in federal research funding. This severe financial blow forced the university to undertake widespread layoffs, eliminating approximately 425 jobs over the summer, a move administrators called a 'drastic step.'</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), has suggested that university tuition fees could be linked to teaching quality in the future. The proposal of 'differential fee levels' would be based on the regulator's four-tier rating system, potentially creating an incentive for institutions to improve their standards. While any decision on fee limits is ultimately up to the government, the idea is being floated as universities across the country face increasing financial pressure and await new funding plans.</p>

          <p>A judge has denied a request for bond reduction for Stanley Burkhardt, a disgraced former New Orleans child abuse detective and convicted child molester. A prosecutor argued vehemently against his release, labeling Burkhardt the 'worst kind of offender' who consistently finds ways to circumvent the terms of his parole.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has confirmed for the first time that the UK government is actively considering the implementation of a digital ID system to help tackle illegal working. Starmer stated that societal attitudes have 'moved on' since the highly contentious debate over physical ID cards under the last Labour government, suggesting a digital version could play an 'important part' in policy. The proposal is expected to renew discussions about civil liberties and government surveillance, with opposition leaders already expressing skepticism about its effectiveness.</p>

Concerns were amplified by Miran's confirmation that he would take an unpaid leave from his current White House job rather than resigning if confirmed. (not investment advice)</p>
