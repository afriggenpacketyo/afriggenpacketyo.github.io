          <h2>Chinese Scientists Link Modern Tibetans to Ancestors in Yunnan Province</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 08:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by Chinese scientists has traced the origins of modern Tibetans' "ghost ancestors" to Yunnan province through ancient DNA analysis. The research, published in *Science*, verifies a long-held hypothesis that a Yunnan archaeological site is linked to the Tibetan Plateau's population origins. This discovery fills a critical gap in the genetic data of prehistoric East and Southeast Asian populations, identifying one of the Tibetan Plateau's "ghost ancestors" from a genetic perspective, shedding light on the mystery of how ancestors migrated and settled in the oxygen-poor land. The study involved scientists from institutions including the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aviation safety writer Darryl Campbell discusses the systemic issues plaguing American air travel, using Newark Liberty International Airport as a prime example. Newark has faced multiple frightening incidents due to radar and radio system failures, leaving air traffic controllers overworked and understaffed. Campbell notes that Newark's problems, including infrastructure issues and a closed runway, foreshadow challenges that every airport in the country will likely face in the next decade. While the FAA has announced funding and hiring improvements, Campbell argues that these are short-term fixes and that the cost of living outpacing air traffic controller salaries exacerbates staffing shortages.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that "tough choices" are unavoidable as the government finalizes spending plans for various sectors. The level of spending on health will dictate whether cuts are made to "unprotected" areas outside of the NHS, defense, and schools. While funding increased sharply in 2024, it will no longer increase year on year, given the government's commitments. The government said the Spending Review on June 11 would "scrutinize every single pound the government spends".</p>

          <p>National police chief Dieter Romann has given a favorable initial assessment of the tightened border controls in Germany, dismissing concerns about overburdened personnel. Since September 16, 2024, Germany reintroduced temporary checks at all nine of its land borders, reinforcing personnel by almost 1,200 colleagues. Romann rejected the assumption that personnel would be withdrawn from other operational areas, such as train stations, for border controls. The Federal Police permanently has around 9,800 officers in their regular stations along the national borders.</p>

          <p>Orthorexia, an unhealthy preoccupation with healthy eating and the purity of food, is becoming increasingly common, potentially fueled by social media pressures. Dietitians note that while not officially recognized in the DSM-5, it's a widely recognized form of disordered eating. Signs include extreme food restrictions unrelated to allergies, social life interference due to food-related stress, compulsive ingredient analysis, and anxiety or guilt after breaking self-imposed food rules. Experts recommend seeking support from a dietitian or mental health professional specializing in disordered eating to address concerns and ensure a balanced approach to nutrition.</p>

          <p>As Trump's administration proposes legislative cuts impacting Medicaid and Snap, Rev Dr Liz Theoharis and Noam Sandweiss-Back advocate for a new social contract that uplifts society from the bottom. Drawing from the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), they emphasize the need for the poor to unite across differences, assume leadership, and build visionary projects of survival. The Johnnie Tillmon model proposes strategic principles relevant today, including grassroots movements operating independently, attending to community needs, and utilizing survival projects as bases for organizing and leadership development.</p>

          <p>Some Social Security beneficiaries may see smaller checks in June as student loan garnishments resume. The Trump administration announced that the U.S. Department of Education would restart collection activity on defaulted student loans. Over 450,000 federal student loan borrowers age 62 and older are in default and likely receiving Social Security benefits. While this may cause panic for those relying on these checks, there are multiple options for borrowers to stop the payment offsets.</p>

The new Republican proposal would limit federal student loans for “professional programs” – such as medical school – to $150,000, eliminate a federal graduate loan program and put limits on loan forgiveness. Advocates warn the curtailing or eliminating federal student loan programs could drive low-income students away from pursuing medicine as a career, make loans harder to repay, or push students into the arms of expensive private lenders.</p>
