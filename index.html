          <p>President Trump stated it would be a "great thing" if Border Czar Tom Homan arrested California Governor Gavin Newsom, leading Newsom to accuse Trump of authoritarianism. This exchange occurred amidst ongoing protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles. Newsom has also sued the Trump administration, claiming Trump illegally federalized the National Guard. The situation underscores the long-standing political tensions between Trump and California's leadership, particularly regarding immigration and states' rights.</p>
