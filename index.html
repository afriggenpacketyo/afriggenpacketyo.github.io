          <p>Germany and Nigeria have committed to enhancing their partnership across various sectors, including the economy, energy, and migration. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul emphasized Nigeria's importance as a key partner in Africa, highlighting opportunities for expanding economic cooperation, particularly in rare earths. Discussions also addressed managing migration flows to Europe, with both countries agreeing to collaborate closely on addressing this issue. Nigeria seeks to export talent rather than people, focusing on job creation and structured solutions to irregular migration through partnerships with countries like Germany, and the article highlights that Nigeria is Germany's second-largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

          <p>Germany's economy is struggling with a prolonged recession, marked by declining competitiveness and company closures, according to economic experts. High energy prices, labor shortages, and bureaucracy are major factors hampering business. The government plans to introduce measures like reducing electricity tax and reforming the labor market to stimulate growth. The panel of economic experts suggests a realistic view of the future, promoting new business models instead of subsidizing unviable jobs. The article concludes by saying that a large financial package aims to modernize infrastructure, but its positive effects are not expected until 2026 at the earliest.</p>

          <p>A former EU trade negotiator suggests that current tensions between China and the European Union over electric vehicles are not critical, as both sides seek closer cooperation on trade and green initiatives in response to potential disruptions from a second Trump presidency. John Clarke emphasized the potential for collaboration in sectors like energy, space, and pandemic preparedness, particularly focusing on the green transition. Clarke highlighted the need for Chinese environmental technology, including vehicles and renewable energy components, to achieve the EU's net-zero emissions target by 2050.

          <p>A High Court injunction has temporarily blocked the UK government from finalizing talks on the Chagos Islands deal, following a legal challenge by two Chagossian women. The deal would transfer the Chagos Islands to Mauritius while allowing the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years. The women, Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, seek to return to the islands but are prevented from doing so under the current and proposed arrangements. The court will hear the case again, while representatives of the Chagossian community are meeting with Foreign Office officials to discuss the sovereignty of the territory.</p>

          <p>Global bonds are experiencing a sell-off driven by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and concerns over President Trump's tax bill, which could significantly increase U.S. debt. Investors are reevaluating long-term risk, leading to a rise in the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield, which surpassed 5%. Market watchers suggest that this sell-off reflects declining confidence in U.S. assets, prompting investors to exit bonds across major markets.

          <p>President Trump is hosting a dinner with investors in his $TRUMP meme coin, raising ethical concerns about the intersection of cryptocurrency and presidential influence. The event involves 220 of the largest investors in the meme coin, which surged in value after its launch. Experts cite the Emoluments Clause, suggesting the dinner could violate constitutional provisions against accepting gifts from foreign governments. The article suggests that the event may present ethical challenges, with some critics viewing it as a potential exploitation of Trump's presidency for financial gain.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariff Strategy: How a 30% Tariff Feels Like a Relief</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This NPR article examines President Trump's tariff policy, noting how his initial suggestions of high tariffs often make subsequent lower tariffs seem like a relief. The article uses the example of a kitchenware business owner who felt relief when tariffs were lowered to 30%, despite it still being significantly higher than pre-trade war rates. Experts suggest this is a negotiation tactic known as the anchor effect, but it creates uncertainty and problems for businesses. The article concludes by saying that while Trump justifies tariffs as creating long-term gains, the uncertainty hinders long-term planning for businesses.</p>

The article reveals that D.H.S. officials considered portraying Mr. Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 leader and downplaying the danger he faced in a Salvadoran prison. A Justice Department lawyer, Erez Reuveni, who advised bringing Mr. Abrego Garcia back to the United States, was fired for not zealously advocating on behalf of the United States.

While intended to curb China's military advancement and protect U.S. dominance in AI, the restrictions have led to a decline in Nvidia's market share in China. Experts say the curbs have incentivized China to become self-sufficient in chip production, accelerating innovation and closing the gap between Chinese and U.S. AI capabilities.
