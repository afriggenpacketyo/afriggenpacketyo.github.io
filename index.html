        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to dismiss all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has sparked controversy among health policy experts. Critics like Georgetown University's Lawrence Gostin argue that this move politicizes science and erodes public trust in federal health agencies. Experts fear that replacing the panel with individuals holding anti-vaccine views could lead to biased recommendations, potentially decreasing immunization rates and increasing vulnerability to vaccine-preventable diseases. The potential impact on vaccine manufacturers remains uncertain, but the action introduces more regulatory uncertainty. The action is seen as part of a broader effort by Kennedy to dismantle established vaccination policies, raising concerns about public health. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a federal judge to promptly block the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles, citing concerns about escalating tensions and undermining state sovereignty. Attorney General Rob Bonta argued that the deployment poses an imminent threat to the state's resources and promotes civil unrest rather than quelling it. Newsom has described Trump's actions as tyrannical and unlawful, emphasizing the unprecedented nature of sending trained warfighters onto city streets. Trump defended the deployment, claiming it was necessary to prevent Los Angeles from burning, while Newsom's lawsuit alleges that the federal government's actions are stoking further unrest. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large international study involving nearly 300,000 children has found a correlation between increased screen time and negative emotional and social outcomes. The study revealed that children who spend more time on devices like TVs, tablets, computers, and gaming consoles are at a higher risk of developing aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Gaming consoles were particularly linked to emotional problems, regardless of the specific type of game. Researchers suggest that children should learn to manage their emotions through interactions with friends and family rather than relying solely on screens. Moderate screen time, especially for educational purposes, carries a lower risk, but excessive screen time can interfere with sleep and physical activity. </p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are warning that dirty hummingbird feeders can be harmful or even deadly to the birds. Sugar water left out too long can spoil and grow harmful microbes, leading to infections like candida, which causes tongue swelling and starvation. While not all microbes are dangerous, it's common for individual birds to get sick from dirty feeders. To prevent this, feeders should be cleaned every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily or every other day in summer. The solution is to mix one part refined white sugar with four parts water, avoid food coloring, and use purified water. </p>
