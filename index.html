        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rising trend of consumers using "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans to finance grocery purchases suggests a shift in consumer behavior and potentially highlights financial strain. This increased reliance on BNPL options for essential goods like groceries may indicate that some individuals are struggling to manage their household budgets amidst economic uncertainty. While BNPL services offer flexibility, their growing use for basic necessities raises concerns about potential debt accumulation and financial vulnerability among consumers. The trend warrants attention as it could reflect broader economic challenges and changing consumer habits, particularly with continued inflation.</p>

          <p>A recent study in Germany has revealed that over 20% of women aged 18-59 experienced sexual assault before the age of 18, highlighting the alarming prevalence of such offences. Psychiatrist Harald Dressing, the study's author, emphasized that these offences occur in environments where children should feel safe, with up to 95% of perpetrators being men. The study also found that over a third of respondents had never previously disclosed the abuse, while only 7% had filed charges against their perpetrators. The findings underscore the devastating impact of sexual assault on victims and the need for increased awareness and support systems to address this issue.</p>

          <p>With average credit card debt balances around $8,000 and cumulative balances exceeding $1 trillion, June presents a crucial opportunity for borrowers to address their debt.

          <p>The House Republicans' tax cut package is projected to increase the U.S. debt by trillions, sparking concerns as the Senate begins its consideration. Economists warn that rising national debt could lead to higher interest rates for consumer loans and negatively impact Treasury yields. The bill's potential to spook investors and reduce Treasury demand may drive up borrowing costs for consumers and affect bondholders. The debate centers on the fiscal responsibility of implementing such measures and the potential consequences for household finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain's defence review, while ambitious, requires more funding than the current commitment of spending 2.5% of GDP on defence to achieve its goals of transforming the armed forces and preparing for war. The review welcomes the government's "ambition" to spend 3% by 2034, but suggests it may be necessary to increase spending faster given the turbulent times. The war in Ukraine highlights rising threats and the need for Britain's military to undergo a revolution to adapt to new ways of fighting. The review emphasizes the importance of addressing immediate threats from Russia and sophisticated challenges from China.</p>
