          <p>Former President Donald Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America rejected him as a customer, forcing him to use smaller banks for his finances. He alleged the banks informed him they could not provide him an account for "hundreds of millions of dollars," which he attributed to regulatory pressure from the Biden administration. The claim comes as the Trump administration reportedly prepares an executive order to penalize banks for denying services based on political beliefs. JPMorgan responded by stating they do not close accounts for political reasons and agree that regulatory change is needed. (not investment advice)</p>

AI-powered tools and autonomous agents are expected to handle most operational tasks, from client onboarding to portfolio adjustments, allowing a single human advisor to serve hundreds of clients. This increased efficiency will not only improve the quality and personalization of financial advice but also democratize access for middle-income families by lowering costs.

          <p>Over 240 supporters of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan were arrested across the country as they rallied on the second anniversary of his detention. Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), called for nationwide peaceful protests demanding his release from prison, where he is serving sentences on multiple convictions he claims are politically motivated. Security forces used tear gas to disperse crowds in major cities like Karachi and Lahore, where the majority of arrests occurred.

          <p>A House congressional committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The House Oversight Committee, led by Republican James Comer, also subpoenaed eight other high-profile individuals, including former attorneys general and FBI directors from the Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations. The move follows the Trump administration's decision not to release more federal files on Epstein, prompting bipartisan demand for more information. The committee is seeking documents and depositions related to the government's handling of the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Rupert Murdoch has agreed to give President Donald Trump regular, sworn updates on his health to postpone being deposed in Trump's $10 billion defamation lawsuit against him. The lawsuit stems from a Wall Street Journal article about Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump alleges was defamatory. Trump's lawyers had sought an expedited deposition, citing the 94-year-old media executive's age and health. This unusual agreement pauses the deposition until a judge rules on a motion to dismiss the case, highlighting a tense legal battle between the two powerful figures despite their historically cozy political relationship.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent comments have intensified speculation about who will next lead the Federal Reserve, with prediction markets elevating the odds for Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh. In a CNBC interview, Trump praised "both Kevins," referring to his National Economic Council Director Hassett and former Fed Governor Warsh, while noting that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is not interested in the job. Following the interview, wagers on the prediction market Kalshi gave both Hassett and Warsh a 35% chance of being nominated. The discussion is fueled by the upcoming expiration of current Chair Jerome Powell's term in May 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers noted that consumers may have overextended themselves due to inflation, with subprime borrowers showing particular signs of financial strain.

Burgum stated this "commonsense order" aims to optimize land use and minimize environmental harm, echoing President Trump's criticism of wind farms as "bird cemeteries."

          <p>Despite predictions of a resurgence after President Trump pardoned January 6 convicts, far-right groups like the Proud Boys have been surprisingly quiet. An analysis suggests this is partly due to internal fractures and the fact that the Trump administration's aggressive policies, particularly on immigration, align with their goals, leaving them with less to protest. With agencies like ICE enacting a mass-deportation campaign, the government itself is pursuing the actions these groups once advocated for.

In protest, Democratic lawmakers have fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to vote on the map.

While the overall job market remains largely unaffected, a notable pullback in hiring within the technology sector is disproportionately impacting younger employees. The unemployment rate for tech workers aged 20-30 has jumped by three percentage points this year, a much larger increase than for other groups. This trend suggests companies are pausing junior hires as they begin to integrate AI, which can automate many entry-level tasks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has announced it will restore and reinstall a statue of Confederate General Albert Pike in Washington D.C. The bronze statue was the only one of a Confederate general in the capital and was toppled by protestors during the 2020 social justice movements. The NPS stated the restoration aligns with federal preservation law and recent executive orders from President Trump to "beautify the nation’s capital" and reinstate removed statues. The decision has been criticized by civil rights activists and local officials, who have long campaigned for the statue's permanent removal due to Pike's controversial legacy.</p>

          <p>The Florida Department of Health is warning of the dangers of consuming unpasteurized raw milk after an outbreak linked to a single farm sickened 21 people, including six young children. The individuals were infected with E. coli and campylobacter bacteria, leading to seven hospitalizations and two cases of severe complications. While it is illegal to sell raw milk for human consumption in Florida, it can be sold as pet food. Public health agencies like the FDA and CDC consistently advise against drinking raw milk, as it can carry life-threatening bacteria that are eliminated through pasteurization.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was "preventable" and resulted from OceanGate's use of "intimidation tactics" to evade safety regulations. The 300-page report found the company operated outside established protocols, had a "toxic" safety culture, and ignored warnings about the vessel's compromised hull. The investigation faulted the sub's flawed design and placed significant blame on CEO Stockton Rush, whose "overconfidence" led to safety concerns being ignored. The incident in June 2023 killed all five people aboard during an expedition to the Titanic wreckage.</p>

          <p>A recent American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and the pun "great genes/jeans" has ignited a culture war debate, which an analysis from Vox suggests is rooted in the potent symbolism of the "blonde bombshell" archetype. The article argues that Sweeney's image evokes this classic Hollywood persona, a figure that historically embodies complex and often fraught American ideas about white femininity, sexuality, and innocence. This archetype, with its retro and racialized undertones, is so politically charged that it invites scrutiny of Sweeney's personal politics and turns a simple ad into a flashpoint for broader cultural anxieties.</p>

The article also notes that gold has historically served as a hedge against inflation, which has been ticking upward again.

The comments reflect souring relations between Washington and Moscow, with Trump recently shortening a deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal with Ukraine or face major secondary sanctions.
