        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, prompted Acting Governor Tahesha Way to declare a state of emergency after the fire rapidly consumed 8,500 acres and threatened over 1,000 structures, leading to mandatory evacuations for 3,000 residents. The Garden State Parkway and Route 9 were temporarily shut down, and power was cut to approximately 25,000 homes and businesses as a safety measure for firefighters. While evacuation orders have been lifted and roads reopened, the fire remains only partially contained, and officials are working to establish containment lines and conduct backfiring operations. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service continues to monitor the situation and provide updates, with no injuries reported so far.</p>

          <p>The European Union is actively seeking to attract American scholars facing funding cuts in the US, presenting itself as a haven for academic freedom and offering substantial grants. The EU Commission and several European universities have launched programs aimed at providing opportunities for US researchers, particularly in fields like immunology, climate change, and social sciences. With the US government freezing funds for critical research, the EU is doubling grant money and streamlining visa processes to encourage American academics to relocate and continue their work in Europe, with several universities already receiving inquiries from interested scholars.</p>

          <p>The town of Purcellville, Virginia, reversed its decision to dissolve the local police department after facing strong opposition from residents, who criticized the move as a cost-cutting measure to address a budget shortfall. The town council initially sought to replace the police force with the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office to save money, but the decision sparked recall petitions and accusations of violating conflict of interest laws against the Vice Mayor. At a packed town council meeting, residents voiced their concerns, leading to a vote to fund the police force at $3.2 million for 2026, effectively reinstating the department.</p>

          <p>The surge in artificial intelligence is driving significant demand for data centers, which in turn increases energy consumption, prompting concerns about climate change goals. While AI applications like ChatGPT consume considerably more energy per query than traditional search engines, the overall impact on global electricity demand remains relatively small, accounting for only a fraction of total use. However, the increasing efficiency of computer processors, particularly GPUs, and the potential for AI to optimize energy use in other sectors offer opportunities to mitigate its environmental impact, requiring deliberate action from tech companies and policymakers to ensure sustainable growth.</p>

Cave explorer Zhao Jieyu fears the fragile structures are under threat from visitors, particularly social media influencers, who are entering the cave and causing irreversible damage. The cave features crystal flowers, luminescent "cave pearls," and cone-shaped formations, with calcite deposits never before seen in real life. Despite efforts to protect the cave, increased attention from state media and online influencers has led to trampling and the removal of crystals.</p>

The letter involves a request for money for an orphan boy, with Anne standing by her husband's decision not to provide it, and could contain the first piece of writing attributed to Anne Hathaway.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein's retrial for alleged sex crimes has commenced in New York, following the overturning of his previous conviction due to the admission of testimony from women about uncharged conduct. The retrial will feature testimony from two women from the 2020 trial, as well as an unnamed woman alleging sexual assault in 2006. Weinstein, who has pleaded not guilty and faces numerous medical issues, is already serving a 16-year sentence in California and faces numerous medical issues; the decision by his accusers to come forward previously galvanized the #MeToo movement.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Beradt, a German Jewish journalist, documented the dreams of people living under Nazi rule in her book, "The Third Reich of Dreams," revealing the psychological impact of authoritarianism. These dreams, which she called "nightaries," exposed the immense political stress and fear experienced by individuals, as well as a disturbing desire to conform to the regime. Beradt interprets these dreams as the subconscious mind attempting to make sense of a waking reality full of propaganda and spin, highlighting the ways in which authoritarianism hijacks people's brains.</p>

          <p>Documentaries like 'Kiss the Ground' and 'Common Ground' promote regenerative agriculture as a solution to climate change and food system problems, arguing that improving soil health can draw down massive amounts of greenhouse gases. While regenerative practices have environmental benefits, the films oversimplify the complexities and tradeoffs of agriculture, such as increased land demand and the limitations of carbon sequestration. Critics argue that the films engage in a kind of nostalgic utopianism, ignoring the nuanced and difficult tradeoffs of agricultural production.</p>

Despite recent threats from the U.S. to withdraw from negotiations if progress is not made, the talks are proceeding, but with a downgraded level of participation from key ministers. The main challenge remains the differing expectations between the U.S., which anticipates major concessions from Ukraine, and European nations, which insist on continued support to force Russia to negotiate on more equal terms.</p>

          <p>The anti-abortion movement in the United States has increasingly embraced more punitive measures, with lawmakers introducing legislation in several states that would treat fetuses as people and subject women who have abortions to homicide charges. This shift, driven by the belief in fetal personhood, has seen the movement take cues from Republican politicians and prioritize punishment over support for pregnant women. While mainstream anti-abortion groups have historically focused on providers, the rise of "abolitionists" advocating for punishing abortion patients reflects a growing disregard for public opinion and democratic norms within the movement.</p>

          <p>No current members of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet visited the war-linked Yasukuni shrine during a three-day spring festival, partly due to diplomatic considerations with China and South Korea. While Ishiba sent a ritual offering, the absence of ministerial visits reflects an effort to avoid escalating tensions over the shrine, which is seen as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Some members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party still visited the shrine, but the government's overall approach signals a desire to maintain thawing relations with neighboring countries.</p>
