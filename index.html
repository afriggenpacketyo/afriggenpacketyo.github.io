          <p>Over a decade after 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru was murdered in Kenya, a local court has issued an arrest warrant for a British national, allegedly a soldier. This development could lead to the first-ever extradition of a serving or former British soldier to face a murder trial abroad for a civilian's death. The case highlights long-standing tensions surrounding the British Army's presence in Nanyuki and the perceived mistreatment of local women. Wanjiru's family and friends continue their long pursuit of accountability and justice for her killing in 2012.</p>

          <p>A significant cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace's 'Muse' software has caused extensive travel disruption at several major European airports, including Heathrow and Brussels. The system failure, which affects check-in and baggage handling for multiple airlines, has led to hundreds of delays and forced staff to resort to manual, paper-based processing. With no clear timeline for resolution, airports are advising passengers to expect continued long queues and to check their flight status before traveling, while the UK's National Cyber Security Centre investigates the incident.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has appointed his former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, as the new US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia. This move follows the resignation of the previous prosecutor, Erik Siebert, who had reportedly faced pressure from the administration to pursue a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James but found insufficient evidence. The appointment has intensified concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice, as Trump had publicly expressed frustration with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the pace of investigations into his political rivals.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is strengthening over open waters and is forecast to become a hurricane by Sunday. The storm is currently tracking northwest and is expected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday, though no watches or warnings are in effect for land areas. While it is not projected to make landfall, swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to reach the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward, as well as Atlantic Canada, early next week.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Discover Recent Lunar Landslides Triggered by Moonquakes</h2>

          <p>A team of Chinese researchers has found evidence of recent landslides on the Moon, challenging the long-held belief that the celestial body is geologically inactive. By comparing high-resolution images taken since 2009, the scientists identified 41 new landslides that they believe were triggered by moonquakes. This discovery has significant implications for future lunar missions and the establishment of permanent bases, as it highlights previously unconsidered geological hazards that could pose a risk to infrastructure and personnel on the lunar surface.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Signs Law Banning On-Duty Federal Officers from Wearing Masks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 23:22:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed the "No Secret Police Act," a new law that prohibits on-duty federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings. The legislation, which also requires officers to be identifiable by name and badge number, is a direct response to ongoing federal immigration enforcement operations in the state. While supporters call it a necessary check on authoritarian tactics, a Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney has stated that the state law has no jurisdiction over federal agents, who will continue to protect their identities.</p>
