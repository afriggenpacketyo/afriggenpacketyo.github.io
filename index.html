          <p>Overnight Russian drone and missile attacks have resulted in at least eight deaths and over 30 injuries across various regions of Ukraine, including Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, and Mykolaiv. These attacks follow one of the heaviest assaults on Kyiv since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February 2022. Russia's defense ministry claims its air defense units intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions, including Moscow, which caused a temporary suspension of flights at Moscow's airports. The ongoing conflict has left approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory under Russian control, including Crimea, which was annexed in 2014.</p>

The Sunday Mirror and Daily Mail cover a new angle in the arson attacks linked to Sir Keir Starmer's properties, investigating possible Kremlin involvement.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has indicated that Shohei Ohtani is likely to return to pitching after the All-Star break. Ohtani is scheduled to face batters for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023, with plans for him to participate in a simulated game. The Dodgers had initially considered an earlier return to the mound for Ohtani, but they ultimately decided to prioritize his hitting during spring training while slowing down his pitching rehabilitation. Ohtani recently incorporated all his pitches, including a slider, into his practice sessions.</p>

While some locals express concerns about increased traffic and insensitive tourists, businesses are hopeful for a robust summer season after enduring significant losses due to the fire and road closure. The fire killed 12 people and burned over 23,000 acres, leaving visible scars along PCH, including twisted metal and charred trees. Despite the progress in debris removal, some residents worry about the long-term impact on the community.</p>

          <p>A major Japanese tutoring company, Trygroup Inc., has issued an apology for inaccurately portraying Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study materials. The false information appeared in a video lesson for junior high school students, which incorrectly labeled the condition as "inherited" when it is caused by mercury poisoning through seafood consumption. The company has since removed the video and stated that it has corrected the inaccurate phrasing, following criticism from patients, victims, and the Environment Ministry. Minamata disease is a neurological disorder caused by mercury in wastewater from a chemical plant, affecting thousands around Minamata Bay.</p>

Rail unions have welcomed the takeover, citing the failures of privatization, while the government anticipates saving up to Â£150 million in compensation fees to rail operators.

          <p>Doctors in Japan are denouncing the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions in hospitals, citing them as a violation of human rights, as these restrictions limit patient visitations, even for terminally ill patients. Despite the government downgrading the threat level of COVID-19, many hospitals continue to enforce strict measures such as mask requirements, temperature checks, and limited visitation times. A group of physicians and social workers is advocating for the abolishment or reduction of these restrictions, arguing there is no scientific evidence that they effectively prevent infection spread. The health ministry has recommended balancing visitation opportunities with infection control measures, but the implementation is left to individual facilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass anxiety to their dogs. The research found that when owners dwell on work problems after hours, their pets show more signs of stress, such as whining, pacing, and restlessness. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," suggests that stress can spill over from humans to their pets. Dogs are particularly sensitive to their owners' moods and may also experience stress due to changes in care routines caused by their owners' focus on work.</p>

          <p>A house fire in Brent, north-west London, has tragically resulted in the deaths of a 43-year-old woman and her three children, aged 15, eight, and four. A 41-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody as police and fire services investigate the cause of the blaze. Two other family members, a woman in her 70s and a teenage girl, were taken to the hospital for treatment, with their conditions currently undisclosed. The fire, which engulfed two terraced three-storey homes, prompted a large response from emergency services.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough behind what they claim is the worldâ€™s fastest coilgun. This coilgun is capable of firing at 3,000 rounds per minute, which far surpasses traditional firearms and current US commercial models. The key innovation is the elimination of capacitors, traditionally a limiting factor in electromagnetic weapons, by powering the coilgun directly with lithium batteries. This advancement is detailed in Chinaâ€™s Journal of Gun Launch & Control, potentially redefining future combat capabilities.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly's racist tweet, prompted by a false rumor about an illegal immigrant, resulted in a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred, sparking a debate over free speech in the UK. While some view the sentence as "tyrannical" and an example of "police overreach," others argue that it's a necessary consequence for inciting violence. Connolly's husband, a Conservative town councillor, maintains she is not a racist and made a mistake, while her local Labour MP defends the police action. The case has raised concerns about the limits of online expression and the increasing scrutiny of online activity by law enforcement.</p>

The agency argues that carbon emissions from these plants do not significantly contribute to climate change, a view that contradicts scientific consensus. This proposal is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to undermine policies aimed at curbing climate change, which scientists warn poses a threat to human health and the environment.
