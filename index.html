          <p>Two elementary schools in Allegany County, Maryland, were evacuated due to a flash flood emergency after the area received up to 5 inches of rain. Approximately 200 students and teachers were rescued from Westernport Elementary School by motorized boats and taken to a nearby church. Students at Georges Creek Elementary in Lonaconing were also evacuated to a nearby high school, while students at Westmar Middle School sheltered in place.

          <p>Mariangela Hungria, a Brazilian microbiologist, has been awarded the World Food Prize for her decades-long research on soil bacteria that act as natural fertilizers, enhancing crop yields. Her work, initially met with skepticism, has transformed Brazilian agriculture, making the country a leading exporter of soybeans. Hungria's research focused on isolating strains of rhizobia bacteria, which convert atmospheric nitrogen into a plant-usable form, and Azospirillum, which stimulates root growth. Her work is widely credited with turning Brazil into an agricultural superpower, saving farmers money and reducing environmental burdens.</p>

          <p>Judge Hannah C. Dugan of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court has been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction of proceedings. The charges stem from accusations that she helped an undocumented immigrant evade federal agents who were waiting to arrest him outside her courtroom. Judge Dugan has been temporarily removed from the bench by the Wisconsin Supreme Court and intends to fight the charges. This case has sparked debate, with some defending it as upholding the law and others denouncing it as an attack on the judiciary.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration, under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership, is moving to ban prescription fluoride supplements for children, citing concerns about their impact on the gut microbiome. This decision contradicts recommendations from the CDC and professional medical groups, which advocate for low-dose fluoride supplements for children in areas without fluoridated water. The FDA claims ingested fluoride alters the gut microbiome, although research is inconclusive. Critics argue this move removes a valuable tool for dentists in preventing cavities and is based on unsubstantiated claims about harm to gut health.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed not to cut Medicaid, but a House Republican bill aims to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from the program. The bill proposes imposing work requirements for recipients, making more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposal would save $880 billion over the next decade, but also leave 8.6 million more Americans uninsured. Trump has countered that his administration is looking for "fraud" and "abuse" in the benefits program, but maintains he will veto the bill if it includes cuts to Medicaid.</p>

The visit included meetings with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with Trump lauding the U.S.-Saudi relationship as "more powerful than ever before."

Key changes involve the appointment of a new foreign minister and ministers for housing, immigration, and energy. Carney emphasized that the new ministry is designed to address the changes Canadians want and deserve, particularly in managing the strained relationship with the U.S. after recent meetings with President Trump.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.3% in April on an annual basis, slightly below economists' expectations, but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Housing costs were a major contributor to the increase, along with rising energy costs, while grocery prices saw a slight decrease. Economists are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, though the April data is unlikely to reflect these effects due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases. The Fed may now consider only two rate cuts in 2025 due to the anticipated rise in inflation later this year.</p>

Disney's bundling strategy is proving successful, with a stand-alone ESPN streaming service offered at $29.99 per month but heavily discounted when bundled with Disney+ and Hulu.

Rose was banned for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame's rules require consideration of a player's "integrity, sportsmanship, character and contribution to the game," which may impact their chances of induction.

However, she stipulated that individuals must be given at least 21 days' notice and an opportunity to challenge their removals.
