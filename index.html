          <p>President Trump announced he is withdrawing Jared Isaacman's nomination to lead NASA after a review of his "prior associations." Isaacman, a tech billionaire and associate of Elon Musk, was nominated in December. He has collaborated closely with Musk, buying spaceflights from SpaceX and conducting the first private spacewalk, while SpaceX has extensive contracts with NASA. Musk expressed disappointment, calling Isaacman competent and good-hearted, while the White House has yet to clarify the reasons for the withdrawal, with Trump promising a new nominee aligned with his space agenda. The decision came after Isaacman's nomination had already been approved by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Optimism regarding the future of NASA with a new leader is slightly diminished with the nomination's withdrawal.</p>

          <p>Two people died and hundreds were arrested in France following PSG's Champions League final victory. A 17-year-old boy died from a stabbing in Dax, while a 23-year-old man was killed in Paris after being hit by a vehicle. Celebrations turned violent with flares, fireworks, smashed bus shelters, and torched cars. Despite the unrest, many fans celebrated peacefully, with the Eiffel Tower lit in PSG's colors, and President Macron congratulating the team, while Interior Minister Retailleau condemned the violence as intolerable. The events highlight the complex mix of joy and disorder that can accompany major sports victories, with authorities struggling to manage crowd behavior. Despite the positive sporting result, the tragic events dampen the overall mood.</p>

          <p>China adopted a low-key approach at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premier security summit, marked by the absence of the defense minister and the cancellation of a plenary session on China's security. Traditionally, Chinese military delegations actively countered American messaging at this forum. However, this year's response was led by military academic institutions, signaling a shift in strategy. The absence of Defence Minister Dong Jun also meant that there were no bilateral talks between China and other countries, including the U.S., which disappointed many nations seeking discussions on the sidelines. The Chinese delegation communicated that they would not be conducting bilateral engagements during the dialogue.</p>

Local witnesses reported that the shooting occurred approximately 1,000 yards from the aid site, managed by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, while the GHF stated that aid was distributed without incident earlier in the day.

          <p>Iranian Foreign Minister spoke with the head of the IAEA after a report indicated Iran is increasing its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. The Foreign Minister stressed Iran's "continuous cooperation" with the IAEA, while the IAEA has reported that Iran's cooperation regarding uranium traces at undeclared sites has been "less than satisfactory." Iran maintains that all nuclear activities are within agreements and monitored by the IAEA, with a deputy foreign minister noting that Iran has undergone a significant portion of the IAEA's inspections. The conversation occurred after the Omani Foreign Minister visited Tehran to present a U.S. proposal for ongoing talks aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The ongoing negotiations could influence the trajectory of Iran's nuclear activities.</p>

The recent finalization of negotiations for an upgraded free-trade agreement with China aims to deepen economic integration through digital trade, green initiatives, and supply chain connectivity. Concurrently, Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim seeks a US-Asean meeting with President Trump to address tariffs. Asean can capitalize on the US-China rivalry by fostering a neutral trade ecosystem that prioritizes regional resilience and strategic autonomy. This requires navigating internal divisions and external pressures with unprecedented cohesion to shape trade rules rather than merely adapting to them.</p>

          <p>China has accused the U.S. of destabilizing the Asia-Pacific region and turning it into a "powder keg" due to its stance on Taiwan. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman warned the U.S. against interfering in China's conflict with Taiwan, asserting that the island's future is an internal affair. The statement was a response to remarks by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who stated that China is building its military to invade Taiwan. China claims the U.S. is promoting a Cold War mentality, while the U.S. insists on protecting its allies and maintaining stability in the region.</p>

PSR limits clubs to losses of Â£105m over three years, with adjustments for time spent outside the top tier. The analysis, conducted with football finance expert Kieran Maguire, assesses which clubs have the financial flexibility to invest in their squads and which face PSR constraints. The report provides insight into the financial health of Premier League teams as they prepare for the upcoming season. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that parents in Europe generally find their lives more meaningful compared to childfree individuals, but report lower levels of life satisfaction. This disparity is particularly pronounced for mothers, with their life satisfaction being more influenced by factors such as their living situation and family policies in their respective countries. Scandinavian countries show smaller differences in life satisfaction between parents and childfree individuals due to robust childcare, financial support, and parental leave policies, while greater gender equality also contributes to higher parental satisfaction. The research emphasizes that children are a societal responsibility, necessitating comprehensive support from policymakers to ensure both parental and societal wellbeing.</p>
