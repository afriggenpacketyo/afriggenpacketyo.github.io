          <p>Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was arrested and charged in a federal sports betting and money laundering case, accused of using nonpublic information about NBA players' injuries to place illegal wagers. Prosecutors allege Rozier is one of six defendants in a "wide-sweeping criminal enterprise" that blurred lines between the NBA and organized crime. This case also implicates former NBA player Damon Jones and relates to a separate investigation involving Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and illegal poker games run by crime families. The NBA has placed Rozier and Billups on immediate leave as it cooperates with authorities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the termination of all U.S. trade negotiations with Canada, citing a Canadian advertisement featuring former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. Trump, in a Truth Social post, labeled the ad as "FAKE" and accused Canada of using it to interfere with U.S. court decisions. He asserted that tariffs are crucial for U.S. national security and economy, concluding the negotiations due to Canada's "egregious behavior." This sudden move escalates trade tensions between the two neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines flights were grounded nationwide following an IT outage affecting operations, later identified as a failure in its primary data center. The issue was not a cyberattack, but it impacted key systems, leading to numerous cancellations for both Alaska Airlines and its regional carrier, Horizon Air. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop at the airline's request, and officials apologized for the widespread travel disruptions. This marks the second such IT outage for the airline this year, highlighting ongoing operational challenges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is weighing export curbs on software-related products to China, a move considered in retaliation for Beijing's rare-earth export controls. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that "everything is on the table," indicating potential coordination with G-7 allies on these measures. This development precedes highly anticipated talks between Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, setting the stage for a possible meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping. The ongoing tit-for-tat actions underscore deep mistrust and a new norm of "breakdown of trade truces" between the two economic powers.</p>

While both parties aim to gain electoral advantage, legal challenges and political volatility make outcomes uncertain.

          <p>Indian exporters, particularly in the labor-intensive textiles and gems and jewelry sectors, are struggling under punishing 50% U.S. tariffs, dampening Diwali festivities. The U.S. is India's largest export destination, and the tariffs have jeopardized billions in revenue and millions of jobs. Textile exports plummeted, and many manufacturers face unsold inventory and idle machines. While some diamond exporters have a slight advantage due to India's processing role, the overall industry anticipates a $9 billion hit. Indian businesses hope for a trade deal to reduce tariffs, warning of catastrophe if relief doesn't come soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House East Wing has been demolished, with new images showing rubble where the structure once stood, a move that surprised many given President Trump's earlier assurances. Trump announced plans to personally donate "millions of dollars" for a new ballroom, estimating the project cost at $300 million, with donations reportedly exceeding this figure. The White House press secretary stated that demolition did not require approval, only "vertical construction," citing a National Capital Planning Commission legal opinion.
