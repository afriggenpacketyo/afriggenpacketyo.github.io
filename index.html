        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed at a fresh record high, gaining 1.15% on Thursday, propelled by strong performances in real estate and technology sectors. This occurred amidst mixed trading across other Asia-Pacific markets, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's anticipated 25-basis-point interest rate cut, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell described as a "risk management" measure. The Fed also signaled two more potential reductions this year and one in 2026. Concurrently, the Bank of Japan began its two-day policy meeting, with most economists expecting rates to remain unchanged, while Australian gas producer Santos experienced an over 11% decline after an $18.7 billion acquisition bid was terminated.

          <p>European stocks opened higher on Thursday, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index up 0.5%, as traders assessed the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. The Fed lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points in an 11-to-1 vote, positioning the overnight funds rate between 4.00%-4.25%. Despite investor hopes for a longer cutting path, Fed Chair Jerome Powell termed it a "risk management" move. European banking stocks, including Santander and Deutsche Bank, saw gains, while Novo Nordisk also rose after trials showed its Wegovy obesity pill led to significant weight loss. The Bank of England is expected to keep its rates on hold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government announced securing £150 billion in US investment during President Trump's state visit, projected to create 7,600 jobs across various sectors. Key pledges include £90 billion from Blackstone over a decade, £22 billion from Microsoft over four years, and £5 billion from Google for data center expansion. This significant influx arrives after recent setbacks, with major pharmaceutical companies like Merck and AstraZeneca having scaled back or redirected their UK investments to the US. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praised these commitments as a strong signal of Britain's economic appeal, aiming to foster growth in clean energy, biotech, and AI.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that pervasive anger is America's most significant challenge, intensified by the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. It describes a deeply polarized nation where online mobs readily attack targets and public figures, including Donald Trump and Elon Musk, are seen to harness grievance as a political instrument. The author condemns the celebration of Kirk's death on social media as "disgusting and pathetic," questioning the country's resilience amidst such widespread rage. The article also posits that Silicon Valley giants profit from engagement driven by public outrage, further fueling the cycle of division.</p>

The company signed a $6.2 billion agreement with Microsoft and Aker to develop hyperscale AI infrastructure in Norway and committed $1 billion for an OpenAI data center project there. Nscale, which emerged from a cryptocurrency infrastructure firm, is strategically addressing Europe's lack of sufficient computing capacity and fragmented market. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed confidence, calling Nscale a potential "national champion" for AI infrastructure in the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's late-night program was pulled by TV station operator Nexstar Media Group, which deemed his comments on Charlie Kirk's assassination "offensive and insensitive." During his monologue, Kimmel suggested the alleged killer might have been a pro-Trump Republican, angering Trump supporters and officials. The Trump-appointed FCC head, Brendan Carr, criticized Kimmel, calling it a "concerted effort to try to lie to the American people" and threatening "additional work for the FCC ahead." Democratic Senator Ed Markey, however, labeled the pre-emption "censorship in action." Kimmel was reportedly preparing to explain his comments were taken out of context without apologizing.</p>

Utah Governor Spencer Cox urged unity and blamed social media for fueling political violence, a sentiment echoed by many. However, President Trump and his allies have taken a different tone, framing the incident as radical left violence, further exacerbating partisan divides, despite historical data suggesting more right-wing politically-motivated violence.</p>

          <p>China showcased advanced AI-enhanced body cameras, featuring facial recognition technology, to developing nations at the Global Public Security Cooperation Forum in Lianyungang. The intelligent command center system integrates these body cameras with facial data of high-risk individuals, enabling real-time identification, alert issuance, and simultaneous information transmission to a central command. A vendor demonstrated the system's ability to locate suspects and dispatch police officers to the scene. This equipment, reinforced for demanding police operational environments, underscores China's commitment to "Security Sharing, Development Integration" and its significant advancements in surveillance technology for global law enforcement applications.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration judge has ordered Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student and prominent pro-Palestinian activist, to be deported to Algeria or Syria, citing alleged misrepresentations on his green card application. Khalil, a legal permanent resident married to a US citizen, was detained for three months, during which he missed the birth of his son. His lawyers plan to appeal, asserting the Trump administration is retaliating against him for exercising free speech and that the immigration judge rushed the decision without due process. Khalil denies making misrepresentations, clarifying his past roles, but the judge found his lack of candor willful.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters anticipate Gabrielle will largely remain over open waters for several days, but it is projected to intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the upcoming weekend. Its current forecast track suggests it will pass north of the Caribbean, potentially reaching Bermuda next week with maximum sustained winds of up to 85 mph. The National Hurricane Center noted the storm's path remains "highly uncertain" due to its poorly defined center. Despite initial NOAA predictions for an unusually active season, hurricane activity has been quieter than expected so far this year.</p>

          <p>Donald Henson of Penn Hills is in custody after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's Pittsburgh Field Office in what was initially described as a "targeted attack." The incident occurred around 2:40 a.m. on Wednesday, after which Henson reportedly grabbed an American flag from his vehicle and threw it over the gate before fleeing on foot. No injuries were reported in the crash. The FBI revealed Henson had recently visited the office to make a complaint that "didn't make a whole lot of sense" and is believed to have a history of mental health issues.

This enhanced pact follows Israel's attack on Qatar and growing concerns among Gulf Arab states about the reliability of the United States as a security guarantor. The signing, involving Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, also comes after a tense conflict between Pakistan and India, where Saudi Arabia reportedly played a de-escalating role.</p>

The airline, known for low fares, has been hit by high costs, shifting travel preferences, and increased competition, reporting a nearly $257 million loss since exiting Chapter 11 in March.

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, analysts predict China's central bank will likely engage in moderate easing, even as the Fed's move creates more room for looser monetary policy. The Fed lowered its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to the 4-4.25% range. This action led to an overnight strengthening of the offshore yuan, reaching a high of 7.086 per US dollar. Economists forecast a smaller rate cut from the People's Bank of China this year, which is expected to narrow the interest rate gap and ease capital outflow pressures on the yuan, providing support for the currency.
