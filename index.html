          <p>A proposed Republican bill, detailed in this article, aims to permanently enact the 2017 Trump tax cuts while introducing new ones for tips, overtime, and seniors. To partially offset these costs, the legislation includes significant spending cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps, which could cause millions to lose health insurance. The bill also ramps up funding for border security and mass deportation, repeals clean energy incentives, and is projected by independent analysts to add at least $3 trillion to the national debt.

England managed to take key wickets throughout the day but will face a significant challenge to counter India's first-innings total.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the former criminology Ph.D. student, has pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary in the 2022 slayings of four University of Idaho students.

          <p>This article outlines important factors for savers to contemplate before opening a large Certificate of Deposit, especially in a changing economic environment with shifting interest rates. Key considerations include deciding between a higher-rate short-term CD and a potentially lower-rate long-term one, while being mindful of early withdrawal penalties. Savers should also realistically assess if they can afford to have a significant sum of money locked away for the chosen term. Finally, it is crucial to compare CDs against liquid alternatives like high-yield savings accounts, which currently offer competitive rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republican leaders are facing significant challenges in securing enough votes to pass President Trump's major domestic policy bill after it was amended by the Senate. Skepticism from both conservative and moderate members threatens to derail a key procedural vote, with the GOP's narrow majority leaving little room for defections. The White House is actively engaging with potential holdouts to pressure them into supporting the final version. The situation is further complicated by weather-related travel delays, adding another layer of uncertainty to the high-stakes legislative battle.</p>

While U.S. Soccer regularly uses three of its own drones for analysis, this fourth, unidentified aircraft prompted staff to investigate its origin. The team's coach, Mauricio Pochettino, downplayed the incident, joking that he would send clips to anyone who wanted them. The drone eventually landed outside the facility's perimeter, and the training session continued without further issue as the team readies for its crucial match.</p>

The ruling is a significant test of MI5's credibility and accountability, with the judges commending the BBC for bringing the matter to public attention.</p>

His retirement, along with the defiance of Senator Susan Collins, creates potential pickup opportunities for Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections.

          <h2>Explaining the Consequences of Having Credit Cards Closed for Non-Payment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the severe financial repercussions that occur when a credit card issuer closes an account due to prolonged non-payment. The immediate consequences include the loss of that credit line and potential disruption of automatic payments. More seriously, the closure significantly damages one's credit score due to the history of missed payments and a likely increase in the overall credit utilization ratio. The outstanding debt does not disappear and is typically sold to a collection agency, leading to further negative marks on a credit report and making future borrowing more difficult.</p>

          <p>The UK's House of Commons has voted to officially proscribe the direct-action group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, passing the measure by a vote of 385 to 26. Once the order takes effect, membership in or expressed support for the group will become a criminal offense, carrying a potential prison sentence of up to 14 years. The government's decision follows a series of actions by the group, including a break-in at an RAF base. The move has been met with both support and criticism, with some MPs arguing it stifles legitimate protest.</p>

These indicators include having minimum payments consume over 20% of take-home income, making no progress on the principal balance due to high interest, and considering drastic measures like borrowing from retirement funds. Other signs are maxed-out credit lines, juggling payments with cash advances, and accumulating debt due to uncontrollable life events like job loss.

          <p>In light of recent air traffic control (ATC) outages at major U.S. airports, this article explains the robust training and redundant systems pilots rely on to ensure safety. Pilots are trained from their earliest days to handle lost communications by using backup radio frequencies, specific transponder codes for emergencies, and an onboard collision avoidance system (TCAS). This system communicates directly with other aircraft to coordinate maneuvers and prevent mid-air incidents. While these safety protocols are effective, ATC disruptions are still likely to cause significant flight delays for passengers as traffic is limited in affected areas.</p>

          <p>New labor data shows that U.S. companies announced the highest number of job cuts in the first half of 2025 since the same period in 2020. The surge in layoffs is led by significant reductions in federal agencies, driven by a government efficiency initiative, as well as cuts in the retail, technology, and media sectors. According to the report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, factors contributing to the trend include an economic slowdown, the impact of tariff policies, and company-specific restructuring efforts. This rise in layoffs signals potential cooling in an otherwise solid economy. (not investment advice)</p>
