          <p>In an exclusive interview, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, stated his agents will arrest any person they encounter who is in the country illegally, regardless of their criminal history. This marks a significant policy shift, ending the prioritization of only those with serious criminal records. Lyons also affirmed that the agency will intensify enforcement actions against companies that knowingly hire unauthorized workers, opening up what he called the "whole aperture" of immigration enforcement under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass described the impact of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown as a "reign of terror" that has spread fear throughout the city's large immigrant communities. She heavily criticized the tactics used by ICE agents, such as wearing masks and using unmarked vehicles, which she said resembles kidnapping and sows chaos. Bass argued that the fear has paralyzed residents, hurt local businesses, and that the accompanying deployment of the National Guard was an unnecessary and wasteful political stunt.</p>

          <p>Manhattan Institute fellow Heather Mac Donald asserted that lawlessness at the border during the previous administration helped foster the conditions for the recent riots in Los Angeles. She argued that a tolerance for lawbreaking in one area, such as immigration, can breed unrest in others, empowering activists to cause chaos. Mac Donald advocated for stricter immigration controls, including a cap on entry and the deportation of all individuals present illegally, to ensure cultural assimilation and maintain civil order.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Olga Khazan's book, "Me, But Better," recounts her decision as a lifelong introvert to enroll in an improvisational comedy class to combat loneliness and force herself into social situations. The passage humorously details her initial anxiety and awkwardness during warm-up games designed to encourage spontaneity and overcome the fear of making mistakes. She describes the experience as a form of "rehab for perfectionists," starkly different from the high-stakes environment of her professional life.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that traditional metrics for the U.S. labor market, like the monthly jobs report, have become obsolete and no longer reflect economic reality. The author contends that with the rise of remote work, side hustles, and the "over-employed" holding multiple jobs, a simple job count is misleading. Instead, it is proposed that the government and economists should shift to measuring the population's total, inflation-adjusted income from all sources to get a more accurate view of labor health.

Now, local residents and business owners are organizing events, tours, and new attractions to capitalize on the centennial and bring new life to their historic stretch of Americana.</p>
