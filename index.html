          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court to remove Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu from office. Abbott accuses Wu of leading a walkout of Democratic legislators who fled the state to prevent a vote on a contentious Republican-backed redistricting plan. The lawsuit claims the lawmakers abandoned their duties, justifying their removal, and escalates a political showdown that has halted legislative business. Wu responded by stating his actions were a fulfillment of his constitutional oath to oppose a "racist gerrymandered map."</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest for allegedly violating his release conditions in an ongoing investigation into a 2022 coup plot. The ruling came after Bolsonaro addressed supporters at a protest, which was deemed a violation of court restrictions. The situation has drawn international attention, with the Trump administration sanctioning the presiding judge, Alexandre de Moraes, for alleged human rights abuses. This action has further strained diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Brazil, adding a complex international dimension to the case.</p>

Authorities believe Brown, who family members say has a history of mental illness including PTSD, is armed and extremely dangerous. The shooting has deeply affected the small community, and a reward is being offered for information leading to his capture.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has weighed in on the Texas redistricting battle, asserting that the Republican party is "entitled" to the five additional congressional seats the proposed new map would create. Trump cited his victory in the state and the high number of votes he received as justification for the politically advantageous redrawing of districts. His comments add presidential weight to the Republican effort and come as Texas Democrats have fled the state to block the vote, leading to a significant political standoff with potential national implications.</p>

          <p>A UK Charity Commission investigation into Sentebale, the charity co-founded by Prince Harry, found no evidence of widespread bullying or misogyny but criticized all parties for a "damaging" public dispute. The probe was launched after a bitter boardroom conflict led to the resignations of Prince Harry and several trustees. While the current leadership will remain, the regulator issued an action plan to address governance weaknesses, such as a lack of clarity over roles. A spokesman for the Duke said he will now find new ways to support the children of Lesotho and Botswana.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a federal court ruling, U.S. border agents have been ordered to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to individuals entering the country illegally, but an appeals court found it could not override other laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they could face persecution or torture. This directive reopens pathways for asylum-seekers to have their claims heard, though they will likely remain detained during the process. The administration had credited the ban for a record drop in illegal border crossings.</p>

          <p>A growing number of older Americans are using AI-powered chatbots, like ElliQ, to combat loneliness and social isolation. For retirees like 75-year-old Jill Smola, who lives alone and has limited mobility, these AI companions provide hours of daily interaction, from playing games to "visiting" new places. While users report meaningful connections, ethicists raise concerns that over-reliance on AI could potentially deepen isolation from human contact if not implemented responsibly. The trend highlights a technological response to the widespread issue of loneliness among the elderly.</p>

          <p>A review by CBS News indicates that the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is significantly overstating its cost-cutting achievements. An analysis of three of the largest claimed cuts, related to canceled COVID-19 contracts, found the actual savings were approximately $165 million, which is less than 3% of the $6.4 billion DOGE reported. Experts note that the agency is claiming savings based on the total potential value of contracts, a ceiling that is rarely reached, rather than the unspent obligated funds. This practice has led to accusations that the agency is engaging in "transparency theater."</p>

Investigators found that OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, who died in the incident, exhibited negligence and fostered an environment where safety concerns were dismissed.

Modern forecasting is over 90% accurate for a one-day prediction, but challenges persist due to the atmosphere's chaotic nature, where tiny errors can lead to vastly different outcomes. Communicating complex data and uncertainty to the public in a concise format is also a major hurdle. The future of forecasting lies with AI, which can process historical data to make faster, more granular predictions, though it may struggle with predicting unprecedented weather events driven by climate change.</p>

          <p>A tsunami generated by an earthquake off the coast of Russia caused an estimated $1 million in damage to the harbor in Crescent City, California. Initial assessments underestimated the impact, but further inspection revealed significant damage below the waterline to the harbor's H Dock, which was designed to absorb surge energy. Officials noted a previously underrecognized hydrodynamic effect, where rapid currents pulled the floating dock downward, causing structural failure. The city, known for its history with tsunamis, is now seeking state and federal assistance for the costly repairs and dredging operations required.</p>

          <h2>UK Advertising Watchdog Bans Zara Ads for Featuring 'Unhealthily Thin' Models</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from the fashion brand Zara, ruling they were irresponsible for featuring models who appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog stated that factors like shadowing, hairstyling, and model poses accentuated thinness in a way that could be seen as gaunt. Zara has removed the images but stated that both models had provided medical certificates confirming their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers, highlighting ongoing scrutiny over body image in the fashion industry.</p>

          <p>A major UK debt advisory group is calling for the government to introduce a statutory school clothing grant in England to help low-income families with high uniform costs. Unlike in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland where such support is standard, a study found only about a fifth of English councils offer any help, creating a "postcode lottery." With average uniform costs exceeding £340, many families struggle, turning to uniform banks for secondhand items. The Department for Education stated it is already taking steps to limit expensive branded items to save families money.</p>

This move seeks to involve federal law enforcement in a state-level political dispute, aiming to force the Democrats' return to establish a legislative quorum. The request significantly raises the stakes in the standoff, which was initiated to block a Republican-led plan to redraw congressional maps.

This move represents the latest challenge to renewable energy initiatives established under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Because the grants have already been awarded to 60 state and other entities, the administration's attempt to claw back the funds is expected to face legal challenges. This action follows other efforts to cut clean energy subsidies and redirect support toward fossil fuels.</p>

Attorney John Manly, who represents hundreds of victims, argues that despite a $4 billion county settlement, there has been no criminal accountability for those responsible for the systemic abuse. In a letter to the U.S. Attorney, Manly described the situation as a "massive human trafficking operation" supervised by county officials. The firm is pushing for a probe into potential federal crimes committed by staff within the L.A. County Probation Department.</p>
