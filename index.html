          <p>The Senate Republicans passed changes to the House's budget resolution, paving the way for a debt ceiling increase and making President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent. The amended framework, approved along party lines, would raise the debt ceiling by up to $5 trillion. The process, known as budget reconciliation, allows Republicans to approve priorities without Democratic support. The budget also addresses border funding for the Trump administration.&#x20;</p>

          <p>President Trump's implementation of widespread tariffs has sparked alarm among governments, investors, and economists, marking a shift away from globalization. Trump has long advocated for tariffs, believing they will revitalize the US economy and generate revenue. However, critics warn that these tariffs could increase costs for American consumers and businesses, potentially leading to economic disruption. The tariffs, ranging from 10% to 50%, have already impacted stock markets and raised concerns about a potential trade war.&#x20;</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a vaccine booster that enhances immune responses against cancer and viruses by up to 150-fold. The system, called SABER, acts as a molecular 'elevator', transporting vaccine antigens directly to the endoplasmic reticulum, overcoming cellular barriers. This advancement could improve treatments for malignancies like melanoma and liver cancer, as well as enhance vaccine effectiveness against rapidly mutating coronaviruses. Experiments have demonstrated SABER's ability to effectively deliver antigens from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum.&#x20;</p>
