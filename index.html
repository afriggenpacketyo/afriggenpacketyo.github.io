          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled a comprehensive plan to cut key interest rates and reduce the reserve requirement ratio in an effort to stimulate economic growth amid trade concerns. The People's Bank of China will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points to 1.4% and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting approximately $138.6 billion into the market. These measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, as well as consumption and elderly care, with additional support for small and medium enterprises anticipated soon. The stimulus announcement coincides with planned trade talks between Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland.</p>
