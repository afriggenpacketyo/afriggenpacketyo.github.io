          <p>Market analyst Gary Shilling suggests that the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China may create investment opportunities in India. Shilling highlights India's democratic government, British-inherited legal system, and widespread use of the English language as factors making it an attractive investment destination. He also points out India's booming population, which is expected to grow while China's declines, and the increasing proportion of money spent on services as economies grow, with India poised to capitalize on recreation, travel, and medical services.

          <p>After eight years of weekly dialogues, New York Times columnists Gail Collins (liberal) and Bret Stephens (conservative) are ending their written "Conversation." In a final audio episode, they discuss the transformation of the Republican Party, the degradation of public discourse, and how they maintained civil conversations despite political differences. They emphasize the importance of humor, listening, and not aiming to "win" arguments, and address reader questions about their process and whether they ever changed their positions; Stephens admits Collins swayed him on gun control, and the columnists stress the importance of remembering that the goal of a conversation is to keep the ball in the air rather than to score points.</p>

Buffett's decision marks the end of an era for Berkshire, which has grown into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate under his leadership, and he is handing over the reins at a high point as the company's shares recently reached a new peak.</p>

          <p>An essay in The New York Times argues that Donald Trump's second term has revealed the full latent power of the presidency, building upon the excesses of recent administrations. While Trump's actions are extreme, they often echo strategies used by predecessors, such as Richard Nixon's use of emergency powers and George W. Bush's claims of national security authority. The author calls for substantial limitations on the presidency, urging a return to a time when Congress played a vital role in domestic policy and law and norms checked presidential power.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has announced his retirement as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway by year-end, naming Greg Abel as his successor, with markets bracing for the transition. Buffett's departure marks the end of an era, as he is viewed as a conscience of capitalism. The announcement has sparked questions about the future of Berkshire Hathaway under Abel's leadership, and whether the company will be able to maintain the same culture and investment strategies that have made it so successful under Buffett.</p>

          <p>The United States has rejected Japan's request for a full exemption from "reciprocal" tariffs, as well as a country-specific tariff, during recent negotiations. U.S. officials indicated that they would only consider a cut in the 14% country-specific tariff, which is currently suspended through early July. Japan has been seeking the complete removal of additional levies on cars, steel, and aluminum, but the U.S. has maintained that it will not negotiate the global 10% baseline levy or tariffs on cars and steel products.</p>

          <p>Early figures from Alipay and WeChat Pay indicate a significant increase in inbound travel spending in China during the Labour Day holiday. Alipay reported that transactions and spending by inbound travelers using e-wallets in its network doubled compared to the previous year, attributing the growth to updated tax refund and visa-free policies. WeChat also reported a nearly threefold increase in transactions from foreign users in mainland China during the first three days of the holiday.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic argues against Trump's pronatalist policies, asserting that they should embrace the many kinds of families that already exist and lower barriers for all people hoping to start new ones. The author suggests that the White House has plenty of options to make having and raising a kid alone more feasible. The article also emphasizes that what counts most for kids is the quality of their relationships with family members and whether they're accepted by the outside world, regardless of the household arrangement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he will impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns that America's movie industry is dying. He claimed that the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative will start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying "a very fast death". The move could significantly impact Hollywood studios that film overseas for tax benefits and international locations, and is also anticipated to affect film production relationships with other countries.</p>
