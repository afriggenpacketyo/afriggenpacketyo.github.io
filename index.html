          <h2>Taiwan's Criticism of Beijing's Military Parade Highlights Internal Political Divisions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 02:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A deputy minister from Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council criticized Beijing for allocating US$4.9 billion to a grand military parade celebrating China's victory over imperial Japan, arguing these resources should instead be directed towards pressing internal economic, labor, and social issues. The article, adopting a critical stance towards Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), suggests this condemnation highlights the DPP's own political vulnerabilities following recent electoral setbacks. It questions whether Taiwan would prefer Beijing to invest in military training over a ceremonial display, also noting a past US military parade. This commentary reflects the persistent ideological and strategic disagreements between Taiwan and mainland China, framing Taiwan's actions as potentially counterproductive.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion for the upcoming Saturday drawing, after no tickets matched the winning numbers for Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize. This massive sum, which has an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes, would rank as the third-largest lottery prize in U.S. history. The current sequence of 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner ties a game record, making Saturday's drawing the 42nd attempt to find a victor. Potential winners can opt for an annuity paid over 30 years or a single lump sum payment, facing daunting odds of 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he is "giving serious thought" to revoking actress and comedian Rosie O’Donnell’s U.S. citizenship, a declaration he has made before but legally cannot enact. Trump asserted on Truth Social that O'Donnell is "not a Great American" and poses a "Threat to Humanity." The U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to those born in the country, a category O'Donnell falls into. This latest development continues a nearly two-decade-long public feud between the two figures, which began with O'Donnell's criticism of Trump in 2006, and follows her recent move to Ireland and a public apology for spreading misinformation about a school shooting.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets generally saw gains on Thursday, tracking an overnight tech sector rally on Wall Street that positively impacted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, even as broader economic concerns persisted. Japan's Nikkei 225 advanced significantly, propelled by domestic technology companies, although Nidec Corp experienced a sharp decline following allegations of improper accounting. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also rose, buoyed by stronger-than-expected household spending figures for July. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and mainland China's CSI 300 saw declines amidst volatile trading, while global bond yields, including U.S. 30-year Treasuries, remained elevated due to wider fiscal anxieties and a recent court decision regarding Trump's tariffs.</p>

This plunge followed the company's announcement of an independent third-party committee to investigate allegations of improper accounting within its Chinese subsidiary, Nidec Techno Motor. Internal findings suggested that such malpractice, potentially involving management, might extend to other group companies. This development comes after Nidec previously delayed its financial report submission due to concerns over "potentially erroneous declarations" of country of origin for certain motors, which could have led to unpaid import tariffs.</p>

          <p>France is experiencing unexpected political and economic instability, prompting comparisons to Italy, which was previously known for such volatility. The country faces a crucial confidence vote next week for Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's minority government over a contentious 2026 budget with significant cuts, aiming to reduce a deficit that currently exceeds EU rules. Economists highlight France's worsening fiscal outlook, with a higher deficit than Italy despite lower overall debt. Should the government lose the vote, it would collapse, leading to President Macron appointing a fifth Prime Minister in less than two years, further unsettling financial markets and raising concerns about debt sustainability.</p>

Cook's remains were discovered in a well in 2017, but the case saw no further developments until now. The 38-year-old suspect, who reportedly worked in Malia at the time, was charged by Greek police and has since returned to the UK. Cook's family, who recently endured the 20th anniversary of his death without his parents, expressed mixed emotions, acknowledging a legal sense of justice but noting it cannot compensate for their two decades of suffering.</p>

          <p>Experts have determined the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, illegally felled in September 2023, was at least 100 to 120 years old, based on a dendrochronological investigation. Historic England researchers counted growth rings in a cross-section of the trunk, finding the wood to be in good condition despite the challenge of less distinctive rings in sycamores. The tree, believed to have been planted between 1860 and 1890, was formed by two stems that fused around 30-35 years of age. Two men were jailed for more than four years for the act, which sparked global outrage. The preserved section will undergo further analysis.</p>

          <p>Intense wildfires that ravaged Spain and Portugal this summer, causing eight deaths and tens of thousands of evacuations, were significantly exacerbated by climate change, according to a new report from World Weather Attribution. The analysis concludes that climate change made the weather conditions fueling these fires 40 times more frequent and 30% more intense. The fires scorched over 640,000 hectares across both countries, contributing to Europe's record-breaking 1 million hectares burned this year. Scientists warn that heatwaves of similar intensity, now expected every 13 years, would occur less than every 2,500 years in a world without human-induced warming, emphasizing the urgent need to shift away from fossil fuels.</p>

This elaborate procedure, captured on video, is part of North Korea's extraordinary security measures aimed at preventing foreign intelligence agencies from acquiring samples that could reveal information about Kim's health. Analysts note that such protocols, including traveling with a personal toilet, have been standard since the era of Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, to prevent the collection of biological traces like hair, skin tags, or waste.

          <p>China has initiated an aviation training program for Southeast Asian representatives this month, aiming to promote its domestically produced civilian aircraft, including the C919 jet. Twenty participants from eight Southeast Asian nations are attending the 14-day workshop in Beijing, covering topics like safety management, airworthiness certification, and new technologies related to Chinese large aircraft. This initiative comes as Southeast Asia leads the world in accepting Chinese aircraft deliveries, despite the market dominance of Airbus and Boeing. Experts suggest this is a strategic move by China to "break the duopoly" and deepen economic cooperation within the region, leveraging its nine-year-old C909 regional jets which have already made significant passenger trips.</p>

          <p>Xiaohongshu, the Chinese social media platform often compared to Instagram, saw its valuation surge 19% in just three months, reaching US$31 billion according to portfolio documents from GSR Ventures Management. This significant increase underscores intense investor demand for a Chinese competitor to platforms like TikTok, especially as TikTok faces potential bans in the U.S. The platform, also known as RedNote in the U.S., gained traction following the Chinese government's commitment to supporting private firms, revitalizing confidence in the country's start-up ecosystem. GSR Ventures, a major backer, saw Xiaohongshu comprise 92% of its fund's total assets by June's end.</p>

Lisa Phillips, one of the accusers, emphasized the list is "by survivors, and for survivors," highlighting fears of repercussions for those who go public with names. Marina Lacerda spoke publicly for the first time, detailing abuse from ages 14 to 17. While some accusers mentioned Epstein's friendship with Donald Trump, none witnessed inappropriate behavior from Trump.

          <p>Former Republican Senator John E. Sununu is seriously exploring a comeback bid for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire, a state where Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen is not seeking re-election in 2026. Sununu, part of an influential political family, is considered a top recruit for Republicans, despite the party's recent struggles in New Hampshire Senate races. Senior White House officials have reportedly endorsed his potential campaign. Sununu stated he would make a decision by the end of next month, aiming to appeal broadly across the political spectrum, including seeking support from President Trump. If he runs, he would face a GOP primary against Scott Brown and Dan Innis.</p>

          <p>Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas, former White House physician for Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump, announced that the Navy has restored his retired rank of one-star rear admiral. This decision overturns a 2022 demotion that followed a Pentagon inspector general investigation into his conduct during his White House tenure. The report had cited "sexual and denigrating" comments, alcohol policy violations on presidential trips, and concerns over his use of prescription sleeping medication. Jackson, who denied the allegations as a "political hit job," gained public attention for his statements on Trump's health. The reversal aligns with a broader trend of the Pentagon offering benefits to Trump supporters.</p>

          <p>A controversial Texas bill that would allow residents to sue out-of-state providers of abortion-inducing drugs has reached Governor Greg Abbott's desk, potentially making Texas the first state to target this common abortion method beyond its borders. Supporters view it as a crucial tool to enforce the state's abortion ban and protect fetuses, while opponents criticize it as an intimidation tactic against out-of-state providers complying with their own state laws, fostering vigilantism. The measure permits lawsuits for up to $100,000 against providers, with specific provisions protecting women and excluding those who committed sexual assault from collecting damages. Legal challenges are anticipated, potentially impacting "shield laws" in Democratic-led states.</p>

          <p>An 18th-century Italian painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, looted by Nazis during World War Two, has been recovered in Argentina after being missing since 1945. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, whose collection was seized by the Nazis after his death in 1940. The painting was discovered last month when Dutch journalists spotted it in an online real estate listing in Mar del Plata, belonging to the daughter of Nazi lawyer Friedrich Kadgien, who escaped to Argentina. Police raids followed, and the painting was handed over, leading to house arrest and charges for Kadgien's daughter and her husband.</p>

The attack killed 18 people at a bowling alley and bar.
