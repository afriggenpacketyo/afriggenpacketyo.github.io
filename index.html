          <p>Lawyers for Sean "Diddy" Combs are asking a federal judge to release him from jail before his October sentencing. Combs was convicted on two counts of transportation for prostitution, though he was acquitted of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering charges. His legal team argues for his release on $50 million bail, citing "exceptional reasons" and claiming the law used for his conviction has never been applied to a similar case involving a consensual "swingers lifestyle." The judge had previously denied bail, citing a presumption of detention for the specific conviction.</p>

          <p>PayPal's stock fell significantly despite reporting second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for earnings and revenue. The decline was attributed to slowing growth in transaction margin dollars, a critical measure of profitability, which raised concerns among investors. While total payment volume and active accounts saw modest increases, rising operating expenses and a sharp drop in adjusted free cash flow also contributed to the negative market reaction. The company did, however, raise its full-year earnings per share forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India, home to approximately 75% of the world's wild tigers, has seen its population increase to over 3,600. Despite this conservation success, experts warn that significant risks remain, primarily due to habitat fragmentation caused by deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure projects. These developments isolate tiger populations, affecting their movement and breeding. Conservationists stress that protecting the quality of ecosystems, not just the number of tigers, is crucial for their long-term survival, especially as human-wildlife conflicts also rise.</p>

          <p>A new report from five United Nations agencies projects that Africa will account for nearly 60% of the world's hungry people by 2030, with over 307 million people currently undernourished. The crisis is driven by a combination of widespread conflict, the impacts of extreme weather, high food inflation, and significant public debt hindering government investment in food security. The report notes that while global hunger has slightly decreased, the number of people in Africa unable to afford a healthy diet has risen to one billion, creating a dire humanitarian situation.</p>

          <p>Automaker Stellantis reinstated its financial guidance for the second half of the year, signaling a gradual recovery despite reporting a first-half net loss of 2.3 billion euros. The company, which owns brands like Jeep and Chrysler, confirmed that President Trump's tariffs are projected to have a 1.5 billion euro impact in 2025. The new CEO acknowledged a "tough year" and ongoing challenges in North America but expressed confidence in fixing issues and re-establishing profitable growth, with the updated guidance assuming current trade rules remain in place.

The initiative is supported by investments in improved staffing models and technology to maintain fast service times.
