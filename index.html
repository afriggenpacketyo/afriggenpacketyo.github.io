          <p>President Trump finalized a trade agreement with Japan, imposing 15% tariffs on most Japanese goods, including automobiles, after months of negotiations. In exchange, Japan will invest $550 billion in U.S. projects and increase purchases of American agricultural products and defense equipment. The deal comes as Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba faces mounting political pressure at home, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party releasing a report citing reasons for recent electoral losses. Analysts suggest Ishiba is unlikely to survive an internal challenge, potentially leading to his resignation amid growing discontent within his party. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Indiana lawyer named Mark S Zuckerberg is suing Meta, Facebook's parent company, for repeatedly suspending his account under the false pretense of impersonating a celebrity. Zuckerberg claims these suspensions have occurred five times over eight years, costing him thousands of dollars in lost business. He argues that Meta is in breach of contract because he paid for advertising that was improperly taken down. Meta has since reinstated the lawyer's account, attributing the suspensions to an error and promising to prevent future occurrences. The situation has been resolved, but there is still frustration for the lawyer named Mark Zuckerberg. </p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.7 billion, data analysis reveals the best and worst states for winners after taxes. States like California and Florida, which do not tax lottery prizes, allow winners to receive a larger sum compared to states with higher income taxes. Federal law requires a 24% withholding on lottery winnings over $5,000, with an additional 14.6% due at tax time, bringing the total federal tax to about 37%. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million, with Saturday's drawing marking a record for consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 22:18:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump intends to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War via an executive order, reverting to a name used until after World War II. The order would allow officials to use the title "Secretary of War," and Trump believes congressional approval is unnecessary. While the White House claims this change will serve as a secondary title, it's unclear if Trump can officially change the name without congressional action. The potential change has sparked debate, especially considering the costs associated with renaming and rebranding government agencies. The optimism score is based on the relative stability versus panic.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic criticizes President Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War, calling it an exercise in political performance art. The author argues that the name change reflects Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's obsession with appearing tough. The article highlights that the Department of Defense was created in 1947 to reflect a broader approach to national security beyond just wartime activities. The author emphasizes that the current name has been used by numerous presidents and other countries, questioning the rationale behind the proposed change. The article suggests the move is largely symbolic and lacks practical value.</p>

          <p>President Trump will speak at the Museum of the Bible during a Religious Liberty Commission hearing, focusing on religious freedom in education. The commission, established by Trump, aims to protect Americans' religious practices, especially in public education, and address emerging threats to First Amendment protections. Parents and students are expected to share their experiences expressing faith in schools, with Attorney General Pam Bondi also scheduled to speak. The White House claims the previous administration interfered with religious freedom, justifying the commission's role in safeguarding these rights. The event underscores Trump's emphasis on religious freedom and his commitment to defending people of faith. </p>

          <p>The US Justice Department has initiated a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud claims. The investigation follows a lawsuit Cook filed against President Trump over her attempted firing.
