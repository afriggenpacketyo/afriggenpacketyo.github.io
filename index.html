          <p>Recent anti-China demonstrations in South Korea are threatening the fragile diplomatic progress made between Seoul and Beijing ahead of the upcoming APEC summit. The protests are fueled by public resentment over past economic measures and security concerns related to North Korea. Despite President Lee Jae-myung's efforts to manage the situation, the widespread public backlash could undermine his administration's goal of improving relations with China, its largest trading partner. The tensions highlight the delicate balance South Korea must maintain between public sentiment and crucial foreign policy objectives.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in Maryland is set to rule on the case of Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose deportation is being sought by the Trump administration. A nearly seven-hour hearing was marked by the judge's sharp criticism of the administration's handling of the case, particularly its failure to produce a knowledgeable witness regarding deportation arrangements. The administration has struggled to find a third country willing to accept Abrego Garcia, despite Costa Rica having already agreed to grant him refugee status. The judge expressed significant frustration with the government's contradictory and insufficient actions.</p>

          <p>Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders has suspended his election campaign after being informed of a foiled jihadi attack plot targeting him. The threat, revealed by the Dutch intelligence agency, led to the arrest of three men in Antwerp, Belgium, where a homemade bomb was discovered. Wilders, who has lived under constant police protection since 2004 due to numerous threats, made the decision to halt campaign activities despite his party leading in opinion polls. The incident underscores the severe security risks faced by controversial political figures in Europe.</p>

          <p>The White House has begun laying off thousands of federal employees as the U.S. government shutdown appears set to enter a third week. The Office of Management and Budget confirmed that "reduction-in-force" notices have been sent to workers across several departments, including Commerce, Education, and Treasury. Labor unions have fiercely opposed the move, filing for a temporary restraining order and vowing to challenge the layoffs in court. The firings represent a significant escalation in the political standoff between the administration and congressional Democrats over government funding.</p>

          <p>Verizon has confirmed that widespread cellular and internet service outages across Los Angeles County were caused by multiple acts of vandalism targeting its fiber optic cables. The company stated that these dangerous acts pose a direct threat to public safety and security. This incident is part of a broader trend of infrastructure damage, often by thieves mistakenly searching for valuable copper wire in telecommunications cables. Officials have highlighted that fiber optic cables contain no copper, making the vandalism both destructive and ultimately fruitless for the perpetrators.</p>

          <p>The popular television show 'The Traitors' captivates audiences by tapping into fundamental aspects of human psychology, including our fascination with deception and betrayal. Psychologists suggest the show acts as a microcosm of everyday social interactions, where people constantly try to discern honesty from falsehood. The game's dynamics expose the fragility of cooperation and how self-interest can emerge under pressure. The celebrity edition adds another layer, as viewers project pre-existing beliefs onto famous contestants, making the game of spotting lies even more complex and engaging.</p>

          <p>A surge in arrivals of Chagos Islanders to the UK has prompted a local council to call for government support to cover temporary housing costs. Hillingdon Council reports that over 600 Chagossians have arrived since last July, with many fleeing Mauritius due to safety concerns following a UK deal to hand over the Chagos Islands. The council claims the financial burden of its legal duty to house the homeless British-Chagossians is becoming unsustainable. The situation highlights the complex repercussions of the UK's diplomatic decisions on the displaced Chagossian community.</p>

Formerly known as TripActions, Navan is joining a recent resurgence of tech IPOs after a nearly three-year lull in the market.

          <p>The recent federal indictments of prominent Trump critics, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, have fueled concerns about the weaponization of the Department of Justice. This article explores how these actions, pursued by a newly installed prosecutor, challenge the post-Watergate norms of maintaining law enforcement's independence from presidential influence. Experts worry that this trend is eroding public trust and could lead to a significant exodus of talent from the department, making it harder to prosecute even routine cases effectively.</p>

          <p>The recent peace deal between Israel and Hamas was achieved through an unconventional diplomatic approach led by President Trump's envoys, who leveraged personal relationships and applied significant pressure on all parties. The process involved crafting a 20-point plan that combined a ceasefire with a vision for postwar Gaza, which gained traction after an Israeli apology to Qatar for a controversial airstrike. This article details how the administration's assertive and often unpredictable tactics ultimately brought both sides to an agreement after previous efforts by other leaders had failed.</p>

Republicans, in contrast, are showing signs of strain and a lack of a cohesive message from the White House. Democrats believe the administration's aggressive tactics are backfiring, strengthening their resolve and shifting the political advantage in their favor as the shutdown continues.</p>
