          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made 'substantial progress' in de-escalating the trade war after closed-door discussions in Geneva, Switzerland. Bessent and China's vice-premier He Lifeng engaged in these discussions following steep tariffs levied by the US in January. Details of the agreement are expected to be announced on Monday, with President Trump updated on the developments, who praised the talks for engendering a 'total reset' on the relationship between the two countries. The trade war has seen the US impose tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, with China retaliating with levies of 125% on some US goods.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded cautiously to Russiaâ€™s offer of direct talks, emphasizing the need for an immediate cease-fire. President Trump questioned whether either side genuinely seeks a deal, urging both to meet in Turkey for negotiations. European leaders have set a deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions, with the US potentially joining in imposing these measures. Despite these efforts, Russia resumed long-range drone attacks on Ukraine, escalating tensions and complicating prospects for a truce.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's recent emotional plea to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has resurfaced bitter ruptures within the royal family, overshadowing the king's public duties. The article notes that Harry's comments, made in a BBC interview, came after a legal defeat over his security arrangements in Britain. The palace has pushed back on Harryâ€™s contention that his father could have done more to spare him the loss of publicly funded police protection. This familial discord continues to define Charles' reign, undermining the monarchy's image of unity and tolerance.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are defending their actions at an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, asserting that the Trump administration is 'weaponizing law enforcement.' Representatives LaMonica McIver, Bonnie Watson Coleman, and Rob Menendez claim they were justified in 'storming' the facility, alleging that ICE officials were instructed to lock up the mayor of Newark. They also deny accusations of assault and argue that ICE officers failed to de-escalate the situation. Despite their objections to ICE detentions, the lawmakers acknowledged that inmates appeared to be well-treated within the facility.</p>

          <p>The US and Iran have concluded a fourth round of nuclear talks in Oman, with both sides expressing willingness to meet again. US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff described the discussions in Muscat as encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called them 'difficult but useful'. The US insists Iran must abandon uranium enrichment to prevent nuclear weapon development, a claim Tehran denies, reiterating its intention not to relinquish the program. These talks follow Donald Trump's withdrawal from a previous nuclear agreement in 2018, and his warning of potential military action should negotiations fail.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has banned chess indefinitely, citing concerns that the game promotes gambling and violates Islamic law. According to officials, the ban will remain in place until the game's compatibility with Sharia law is determined. This restriction is the latest in a series of measures imposed by the Taliban, particularly affecting sports and activities for women. One cafe owner in Kabul expressed that while he would respect the decision, he also noted that the ban would negatively impact his business, as many young people enjoyed playing chess there.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 as a gift from Qatarâ€™s royal family, sparking accusations of bribery and corruption. The plane, estimated at $400 million, would serve as the new Air Force One until shortly before the conclusion of Trump's second term, after which it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation. Legal analyses by Trump's attorney general and White House counsel have reportedly concluded that accepting the gift is legally permissible, as it is not conditioned on any official act. However, critics argue that the gift is a form of bribery in broad daylight.</p>

          <p>A recent Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Walton Goggins as a waiter intensely flirting with middle-aged mothers has sparked debate about the portrayal of motherhood and sexuality. While the sketch seemingly aimed to challenge the stereotype that mothers are undesirable and devoid of desire, it ultimately reinforced the idea that it is ridiculous for a man to be attracted to 'frumpy old moms'. The show has been criticized for undermining the idea that women's sex lives continue after childbirth, instead implying that the women were the butt of the joke.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed Russia's offer for direct peace talks but insisted on a full, temporary ceasefire before negotiations can begin. He described the offer as a 'positive sign' but emphasized that a ceasefire is the 'very first step' in ending the conflict. Meanwhile, Russia resumed mass drone attacks in Ukraine, and US officials expressed skepticism about Putin's intentions. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered to host the talks, while Macron warned that Putin is 'looking for a way out, but he still wants to buy time'.</p>

          <p>Democrats are seeking to connect with parents by highlighting rising prices of baby gear and the spread of vaccine misinformation, linking these issues to President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. They aim to persuade voters that the current administration is negatively impacting their lives, particularly regarding health and economic concerns. Concerns over measles outbreaks, safety regulations, and the rising costs of childcare are seen as potential motivators for parents. The Democrats are hoping to regain ground after recent Republican successes in appealing to parents' anxieties.</p>

          <p>A recent conflict between India and Pakistan escalated rapidly due to new-generation technology, particularly drones and missiles, resulting in attacks on sensitive military sites. The escalation raised concerns about the potential use of nuclear weapons. Despite the cease-fire, the underlying political realities and entrenched religious nationalism in both countries remain, creating a risk of future confrontations. The conflict highlights a shift towards noncontact warfare, emphasizing barrages from a distance but still leading to escalation and the potential loss of restraint.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, has returned to Massachusetts after spending six weeks in ICE detention in Louisiana. A federal judge ordered her release on bail, citing a lack of evidence for her detainment besides an op-ed she co-authored. Ozturk and her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated when she was taken into custody by plainclothes ICE officers. She vowed to continue her legal case and highlighted the plight of other women in immigration detention.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly planning to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a gift from the ruling family of Qatar, which could potentially be converted into a presidential aircraft. The gift is expected to be announced during Trump's upcoming trip to the Middle East. Administration officials have prepared an analysis arguing that accepting the gift would be legal, though it has drawn scrutiny under the Constitutionâ€™s Emoluments Clause. The Qatari aircraft is similar to a 13-year-old Boeing aircraft Trump toured in February, while it was parked at Palm Beach International Airport and he was spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, announced that the country will end care worker recruitment from overseas as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. The new rules, expected to be unveiled next week, will require care firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas of overseas workers already in the country. The government aims to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp criticized the plans as insufficient, calling for an annual cap on migration.</p>

The move aims to mitigate ongoing disruptions that have led to numerous delays and cancellations.

The Trump administration is also proposing a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the US air traffic control system, including new centers and technology upgrades.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, the partner of Elizabeth Holmes, has reportedly raised millions of dollars for a new blood-testing company called Haemanthus. The startup is strikingly similar to Theranos, the company that led to Holmes's conviction for fraud. Haemanthus aims to use technology to analyze blood, urine, and saliva for diagnoses, with long-term goals including a wearable device for humans. While some investors have passed on the pitch, Evans has reportedly raised nearly $20 million from friends and other investors, with Holmes advising him.</p>
