          <p>A high-ranking official in China's Jilin province has called for a re-emphasis on the Chinese perspective of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region, known in Korea as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae. This move risks reigniting historical disputes with South Korea, which considers these kingdoms part of its own heritage. The official's comments were made in the context of China's "century of humiliation," linking the historical narrative to modern national identity and potentially straining diplomatic ties between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man allegedly stabbed eleven people with a folding knife at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, leaving six in critical condition. The attack, which authorities described as a random act of violence, began near the store's checkout area. The suspect was apprehended at the scene by a sheriff's deputy with assistance from citizens. Governor Gretchen Whitmer condemned the "brutal act," and the FBI is providing support to the local investigation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chinese government is increasingly suppressing news coverage of mass attacks, such as those involving vehicles or knives, as part of a broader expansion of information control under leader Xi Jinping. This censorship, which intensified after a particularly deadly attack in November, is believed to be an attempt to prevent copycat crimes and allow local officials to conceal security failures. However, the information clampdown has led to public frustration, with some citizens taking to social media to demand transparency and truth from authorities.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that deepens the country's 27-month civil war and raises fears of a permanent partition. The new administration, led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government. This development threatens to escalate the conflict, which has already displaced up to 13 million people and pushed large parts of the population to the brink of famine, while undermining diplomatic peace efforts.</p>

          <p>After a highly publicized trial, former ballerina Ashley Benefield was found guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield, and later sentenced to 20 years in prison.

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow but has avoided a more serious ligament injury that would have required a long-term layoff. An MRI confirmed the strain after Judge experienced difficulty throwing, prompting a platelet-rich plasma injection. While he will miss time, the team is optimistic he can return in 10 to 14 days, initially as a designated hitter, providing some relief for the team and its fans.</p>

          <p>Beyond his legendary music career, Ozzy Osbourne is being remembered for his pioneering role in reality television with the early 2000s MTV show, "The Osbournes." The series, which followed the daily life of his family, broke new ground by presenting a celebrity family in a relatable, sitcom-like format, blending mundane frustrations with a rock-star lifestyle. This innovative approach captured a massive audience before the era of the Kardashians, establishing a new genre of celebrity-driven reality TV and turning the "Prince of Darkness" into a beloved TV father.</p>

          <p>As England fans face the nerve-wracking Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions associated with watching high-stakes sports. The body's stress response, involving hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can cause elevated heart rates and anxiety, but experts say it's a normal sign of caring deeply. To manage the stress, they advise getting rest, having a clear match-day plan, eating well, and reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that provides a rare outlet for emotional expression.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface, resulting in persistent cloud cover and cool, drizzly weather. While some residents are enjoying the temperate conditions, the pattern contrasts sharply with the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California.</p>
