          <p>Corporate travel and expense management startup Navan has officially filed to go public, planning to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol 'NAVN'. The company reported a 32% increase in its trailing 12-month revenue, reaching $613 million, and has seen its net loss decrease by 45% year-over-year. Navan, which describes itself as an "all-in-one super app" for business travel, aims to disrupt the sector with its AI-driven platform. The move comes amid a resurgent IPO market, which has seen the most activity since the boom years of 2020 and 2021.</p>

          <p>A key CDC advisory committee, now comprised of members appointed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has voted against requiring a prescription for COVID-19 vaccines. The panel was sharply divided, with the chair breaking a 6-6 tie, and instead recommended that vaccinations be based on "individual-based decision making" in consultation with a clinician. The meeting was marked by confusion and tense exchanges, raising concerns among public health experts about the committee's lack of experience and reliance on anecdotal evidence. These new recommendations could complicate vaccine access and further fragment availability across the country.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have revealed that the man who attempted to assassinate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022 also intended to kill two other justices. In a sentencing memorandum, the Justice Department argued that Nicholas Roske's goal was to "single-handedly alter the constitutional order," labeling his actions as a form of terrorism. The filing detailed Roske's extensive research and planning, which was motivated by the Supreme Court's leaked draft opinion on Roe v. Wade. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 30 years to life in prison.</p>

          <p>Reports emerged that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, was in the process of raising $10 billion at a staggering $200 billion valuation. However, Musk quickly refuted these claims in a post on his social media platform X, calling the report "fake news" and stating that xAI is not currently raising capital. The initial report suggested the funding would support the development of its AI models, including the Grok chatbot, and the construction of a large AI supercomputer in Memphis. The situation highlights the intense investor interest and soaring valuations within the competitive AI industry.</p>

          <p>Former ESPN host Keith Olbermann sharply criticized current ESPN star Stephen A. Smith for his comments regarding Jimmy Kimmel's indefinite suspension from ABC. Smith had questioned the comedic value of Kimmel's remarks about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, which led to his removal from the air. In response, Olbermann accused Smith of "prostituting himself to the right wing" for financial gain. The public dispute highlights the intense and polarizing debate surrounding Kimmel's comments, which have drawn reactions from across the media and political spectrums.</p>

          <p>The White House has released a new version of the presidential letter given to newly naturalized U.S. citizens, revealing a notable shift in how the administration defines American identity. The letter from President Trump emphasizes assimilation into the nation's culture, history, and traditions, diverging from past presidents who focused on America as an idea founded on ideals like equality and liberty. This rhetorical change aligns with a broader movement on the right to define America as a nation with a shared culture rather than a creedal nation open to all. The letter omits any encouragement for democratic participation, a common theme in previous versions.</p>

Despite a dominant warm-up victory, England narrowly defeated France in a tense Six Nations decider earlier this year, suggesting a competitive match is expected.

          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and FCC Chair Brendan Carr to revoke the broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over the media. Broadcast networks such as ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox operate by licensing public airwaves from the government, which requires them to serve the "public interest." While this authority has historically been used to address issues like obscenity or local programming, the current administration is framing it as a tool to combat perceived political bias. Experts note that revoking a license is a complex process that would likely face significant legal challenges.</p>

The incursion, which lasted for 12 minutes over the Gulf of Finland, was condemned by Estonia's foreign ministry as "unprecedentedly brazen." In response to the incident, the Estonian government has requested Article 4 consultations with NATO. The Russian aircraft reportedly had their transponders off and did not maintain radio contact, prompting a response from both Finnish and Italian jets under NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission to escort them out of the area.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have issued proposed regulations clarifying President Trump's new "no tax on tips" policy. The provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually, but the guidance specifies which occupations qualify and which do not. Notably, jobs in sectors like healthcare, legal, and financial services are excluded. The rules also confirm that automatic gratuities, such as those added for large parties at restaurants, will not qualify for the deduction because they are not considered voluntary payments. The agencies will finalize the regulations after a public comment period.</p>

          <p>Following a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, consumers may find more affordable options for borrowing money. Among the cheapest methods are home equity-based products, with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) currently offering the lowest average rates due to their variable nature. Home equity loans provide the stability of a fixed rate at a slightly higher cost. For those without home equity, personal loans remain a less expensive alternative to high-interest credit cards, though rates are still higher than in previous years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A retrospective look at Robert Redford's extensive film career reveals a consistent and critical theme: the hollowness and corrupting nature of victory. Across iconic roles in films like "Downhill Racer," "The Candidate," and "The Natural," Redford often portrayed characters whose athletic or personal triumphs came at a significant moral or personal cost. As both an actor and director, he was drawn to stories that questioned America's obsession with winning, suggesting that true grace comes from the art of playing the game, not just the outcome. This perspective defined his legacy as an artist who used his 'golden boy' image to explore deeper, more complex truths.</p>

The company cited "changes in the macroeconomic environment" as the reason for the price hikes, which will see increases of $20 to $70 depending on the model. This move follows similar price adjustments by competitors Sony and Nintendo earlier in the year. While not explicitly stated, the decision is seen in the context of broad tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which have impacted many consumer electronics companies.</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing rising grocery bills due to a combination of three key factors: tariffs, climate change, and agricultural labor shortages. According to food industry experts, tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have increased the cost of imported goods like coffee. Climate change is shifting where certain foods can be grown, while stricter immigration policies have contributed to a shortage of farm workers. In response, some companies are engaging in "shrinkflation," reducing product size while keeping prices stable, as consumers increasingly seek out deals and store brands to manage their budgets.</p>

          <p>The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel by ABC, following pressure from the Trump administration, is presented as a critical moment for free speech in the United States. This article argues that the incident exemplifies the "paradox of democracy," where the very openness that allows for dissent can be exploited by authoritarian forces to silence it. The author suggests that the government's use of regulatory threats against a media critic sets a dangerous precedent. It frames the situation as a test of whether a culture that values free expression will tolerate concerted efforts to suppress it, especially when powerful institutions capitulate to political pressure.</p>

The lawsuit, which also named publisher Penguin Random House, was part of a broader criticism by Trump of media coverage he deems unfair.
