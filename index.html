          <p>Two survivors of the Nottingham attacks, Sharon Miller and Wayne Birkett, speak for the first time about the events of June 13, 2023, when they were struck by a van driven by Valdo Calocane. Both Sharon and Wayne sustained serious injuries, with Sharon breaking multiple ribs and suffering a lacerated spleen, while Wayne suffered complex brain injuries and has no memory of the event. Both survivors express survivor's guilt, wishing they could have traded places with the victims who were killed in the attacks. Calocane, who had paranoid schizophrenia, was sentenced to a hospital order after admitting to manslaughter and attempted murder, and a public inquiry has been launched to investigate the incident.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would replace interim U.S. attorney Ed Martin, a controversial pick for the District of Columbia, with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. Martin, a "Stop the Steal" activist, faced opposition in the Senate due to his views on the January 6th Capitol riot. Pirro, a staunch Trump supporter and former district attorney, has been chosen to fill the role on an interim basis. Trump expressed disappointment about Martin's lack of support, but stated that Pirro is incredibly well qualified for the position and is considered one of the top District Attorneys in the History of the State of New York.</p>

          <p>A report examines how Hong Kong's national security law (NSL) has fostered a culture of informing, with citizens reporting alleged violations to the authorities. One pro-China informer, Innes Tang, details how he and his volunteers have reported nearly 100 individuals and organizations to the police. The NSL, imposed by Beijing, criminalizes activities considered to be calls for "secession" or "subversion," leading to arrests and self-censorship. Critics argue that the law undermines free speech and civil liberties, while the government maintains it is necessary for stability.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump has launched a criminal fraud probe targeting New York Attorney General Letitia James, more than a year after James won a civil fraud case against Trump. The investigation was initiated after William Pulte alleged that James falsified bank documents and property records to obtain favorable loan terms. James has denied the allegations, calling them baseless, and her attorney, Abbe Lowell, has denounced the investigation as political retribution. The probe comes after James' office secured a judgment against Trump for over $500 million in a civil fraud trial.</p>

The deal primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than representing a deep free trade agreement. The agreement offers better trading conditions for some than were available a few days ago, but not necessarily better than six months ago. The deal doesn't dilute the UK's Digital Services Tax and doesn't involve questions about the NHS or food standards.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit filed by former Brookfield Asset Management fund manager Josh Raffaelli accuses the company of fraud, attempted bribery, and improperly limiting investments in Elon Musk's companies. Raffaelli claims Brookfield mistreated investors in his funds to compensate for losses in other areas. He alleges that Brookfield limited the amount he could invest in a Musk company on behalf of clients. Brookfield denies the claims, calling the suit meritless, while Raffaelli's lawyer maintains that the company betrayed investors' trust.</p>

          <p>Columbia University responded assertively to a pro-Palestinian demonstration in which protestors occupied the university's main library. Unlike a similar incident a year prior, campus security forces intervened aggressively, leading to arrests. The university's actions were praised by some critics who felt Columbia had been too lenient in the past, but disturbed others who felt unarmed demonstrators should not be met with force. Demonstrators vandalized the library with graffiti, and the university is moving to tighten control of protest discipline.</p>
