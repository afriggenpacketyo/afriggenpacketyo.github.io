            <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that there are currently no scheduled talks between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping amidst an ongoing trade war. Greer insisted that the president is working to reshore American manufacturing and trade as part of a broader global issue, and that China chose to retaliate, leading to the current situation. He also addressed concerns about China potentially selling assets in the U.S., emphasizing the need for a resilient American economy due to dependence on China and lack of fair market access. The trade representative added that conversations have been underway with 70 countries regarding reciprocal trade since before the tariffs were announced. (not investment advice)</p>

The fossil revealed previously underestimated complexity in early arthropods and allowed scientists to draw evolutionary connections to modern creatures. Structures observed include a brain, digestive glands, a primitive circulatory system, and traces of nerves supplying the larva's simple legs and eyes. The discovery provides valuable insights into the evolution of arthropod heads and their adaptation to diverse environments.</p>

            <p>US stock markets are anticipated to rebound after President Trump excluded smartphones and laptops from his tariff regime. Shares in Apple and chipmaker Nvidia are expected to rise following the 90-day reprieve on tariffs. However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested the exemption may be temporary, with separate levies planned for the sector. China responded to the initial tariffs with duties on US exports, but described the tech exemption as a "small step" towards easing the trade conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown accused President Trump of "weaponising" the global trading system with steep import tariffs. Brown warned of a potential "breakdown" in the global economic order and called for a "global rescue plan" with synchronised interest rate cuts. He echoed concerns about market turmoil and the risk of a 1930s-style depression, urging finance ministers and central bankers to address the issue. Brown suggested the UK needs to find partners other than the US to rebuild the world order.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump is in "excellent cognitive and physical health," according to his White House physician, Captain Sean Barbabella. Trump underwent a nearly five-hour medical examination at Walter Reed hospital, including blood tests and cardiac examinations. Barbabella noted Trump's active lifestyle and credited it for contributing to his well-being. The examination also revealed scarring on Trump's right ear from a gunshot wound sustained during an assassination attempt last July.</p>
