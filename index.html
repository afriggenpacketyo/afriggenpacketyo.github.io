          <p>As tensions escalate between India and Pakistan, Chinese defense stocks are experiencing a surge. This follows reports that Pakistan deployed China-made J-10C fighter jets in a recent clash with India's air force. Companies like AVIC, which manufactures the J-10C, and China State Shipbuilding Corporation, which builds military vessels, have seen their stocks increase as a result of the heightened geopolitical instability. Pakistan is the largest buyer of Chinese arms, including fighter jets, air defense systems, naval vessels, and UAVs, so this increase in tensions has a direct effect on Chinese defense stocks.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the renowned mystery novelist who died in 1976, has been digitally reanimated using AI to "teach" an online writing course for BBC Maestro. While Christie's family estate approved the project, stipulating that only her words be used, the course raises ethical questions about using AI to represent deceased individuals. Some experts argue that even with consent, the representation is a 'deepfake' that could blur the lines between fact and fiction, while others believe it's a harmless way to educate and entertain fans, as the technology used only creates her likeness and does not create or alter her views.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling a potential win for both nations seeking closer economic ties. The deal, teased by Trump on social media, would be the first announced since the U.S. imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners. While details remain unclear, discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. For the UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, this trade deal would offer vindication for his assiduous cultivation of Mr. Trump.</p>

          <p>Maersk, a leading shipping company and indicator of global trade, has revised its 2025 container market volume growth forecast due to increasing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, specifically U.S.-China trade tariffs. While the company's first-quarter operating profit exceeded expectations, Maersk now anticipates container volume growth to be between -1% and 4%, down from a previous forecast of 4%. The company's CEO, Vincent Clerc, noted that the trade tensions are primarily a China-U.S. issue and have not yet significantly impacted other trade routes.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. anticipates a significant decline in net profit for the fiscal year 2025, projecting a 34.9% drop due to concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

          <p>Nintendo projects to sell 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the first sales forecast since announcing the successor to the popular Switch.

The Switch 2, starting at $449.99, is expected to launch in June with improved features; however, pre-orders in the U.S. were delayed due to President Trump's tariffs on countries where Nintendo consoles are manufactured.</p>

          <p>A rapid analysis by climate scientists has found that the historic four-day storm that caused widespread death and destruction across the central Mississippi valley in early April was made more likely and severe by burning fossil fuels. The study found that the rainfall was about 9% more intense and 40% more likely due to human-caused climate change, with warmer ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico playing a significant role. Researchers also noted that cuts and staff layoffs at the National Weather Service, thanks to Donald Trump and Elon Musk, could put lives at risk.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that climate change significantly worsened the deadly storms that swept through eight U.S. states in early April, making record-breaking downpours about 9% heavier. Unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbated by climate change, fueled the storm's intensity, making such events 14 times more likely. Researchers expressed concern about ongoing staff shortages at the National Weather Service, which could impact the issuance of real-time warnings and coordination with emergency management. Without a rapid shift away from fossil fuels, extreme weather events are expected to become more common and intense.</p>

          <p>China's steel exports are projected to decline in the second quarter of 2025 due to the ongoing trade war and rising protectionism, potentially worsening the domestic oversupply. Washington's tariffs and duties imposed by top customers like South Korea and Vietnam are impacting export markets. The decline in exports will redirect steel back to the domestic market, depressing prices, eroding steelmaker profitability, and reducing demand for inputs like iron ore, according to analysts and traders. The chairman of Baosteel, China's largest listed steelmaker, noted that the sector's exports face "unprecedented" pressure.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's has postponed its auction of sacred jewels linked to the Buddha's remains in Hong Kong following a threat of legal action by the Indian government. The sale of the Piprahwa Gems, described as a significant archaeological find, had drawn criticism from Buddhist academics and monastic leaders, with India asserting that it offended the global Buddhist community. The auction house has agreed to suspend the sale to allow for discussions between the parties involved. The relics were unearthed in northern India nearly 130 years ago.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. has presented a somber outlook, projecting a 20% decline in operating profit for the fiscal year, citing headwinds from a stronger yen and a $1.3 billion hit from President Trumpâ€™s tariffs. The company noted the uncertainty surrounding trade relations and the difficulty in forecasting the full impact of the tariffs, which include a 25% levy on vehicle imports and auto parts. This situation highlights the challenges Japan faces in ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., where automobiles and auto parts are a top export.</p>

          <p>Four women have filed a lawsuit against Motown legend Smokey Robinson and his wife, Frances Robinson, alleging sexual battery, assault, and workplace violations, seeking $50 million in damages.

Robinson's wife is accused of failing to prevent the alleged acts and having prior knowledge of similar settlements.

          <p>With India launching military strikes against Pakistan, this article compares the military capabilities of the two nuclear-armed neighbors. India possesses a larger military with approximately 1.5 million active service personnel and a significantly higher defense budget. Pakistan, despite its smaller size and economic challenges, has heavily militarized to counter India. While India's military is increasingly focused on China, Pakistan's defense strategy revolves almost entirely around India, with the military exerting considerable control over the civilian government. Both countries possess substantial air forces and are believed to have similar nuclear weapon stockpiles.</p>
