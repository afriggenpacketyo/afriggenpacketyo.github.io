          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has canceled $500 million in funding for mRNA vaccine projects targeting viruses like influenza and bird flu. The decision impacts 22 projects from companies including Pfizer and Moderna, with Kennedy citing concerns that the technology's risks outweigh its benefits for respiratory viruses. Health experts have sharply criticized the move, warning that it undermines future pandemic preparedness by sidelining a technology crucial for rapid vaccine development. The funding will be redirected to what the department calls "safer, broader vaccine platforms."</p>

          <p>California Senator Adam Schiff is reportedly under a federal criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland concerning potential mortgage fraud. The investigation follows a criminal referral from the Federal Housing Finance Agency alleging Schiff falsified bank documents and property records to secure more favorable loan terms. At issue are conflicting claims where Schiff certified a Maryland property as his primary residence in 2011 while also claiming a California condominium as his primary residence more recently. Schiff's office has not yet commented on the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court to remove Democratic Caucus Chair, Rep. Gene Wu, from office. Abbott accuses Wu of being the "ringleader" of a group of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to deny a quorum and block a vote on a Republican-backed redistricting plan. The governor's petition argues that Wu and others have abandoned their offices, a claim legal experts question. In response, Wu stated his actions were a fulfillment of his constitutional oath to oppose a "racist gerrymandered map," not an abandonment of his duties.</p>

          <p>The manhunt for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old former U.S. soldier suspected of killing four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has entered its fifth day. Governor Greg Gianforte has signed an executive order to provide more resources to the dozens of law enforcement agencies involved in the search across a mountainous region. Authorities believe Brown, who has a history of mental illness, is armed and extremely dangerous. The shooting has deeply unsettled the small community, and a reward of up to $10,000 is being offered for information leading to his capture.</p>

          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has concluded its investigation into Prince Harry's charity, Sentebale, finding no evidence of widespread bullying, harassment, or misogyny. The inquiry was launched after a public boardroom dispute led to the resignation of Prince Harry and several trustees. While no sanctions were imposed, the regulator criticized all parties for allowing the internal conflict to damage the charity's reputation and issued a plan to address governance weaknesses. Prince Harry's spokesperson expressed disappointment that the report did not hold the current chair accountable for her actions, though she will remain in her position.</p>

          <p>Following a federal court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had previously allowed for the summary deportation of individuals entering the country illegally without an opportunity to claim asylum. A federal appeals court ruled that while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore other laws that protect migrants from being sent to places where they face torture or persecution. This move effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims, though migrants will likely remain detained during processing.</p>

          <p>A growing number of older Americans are turning to AI-powered chatbots for companionship to combat loneliness and isolation. For retirees like 75-year-old Jill Smola, who lives alone and has limited mobility, a chatbot named ElliQ has become a meaningful daily companion for conversation and activities. While users report positive experiences, ethicists like Thalia Porteny from Columbia University express concern that over-reliance on AI could potentially lead to even greater social isolation if not deployed responsibly. The trend highlights a technological response to the widespread issue of loneliness among the elderly, which affects one in four older adults.</p>

An analysis of three large contract cancellations with the Department of Health and Human Services, which DOGE claimed saved $6.4 billion, found the actual savings to be around $165 million, or less than 3% of the reported figure. Experts note that DOGE is reporting the total potential value of canceled contracts as savings, a figure rarely reached in practice. Critics have labeled the agency's public accounting as "transparency theater," designed to create a perception of massive savings.</p>

Caro Quintero is accused of the 1985 murder of a DEA agent, while Zambada is a reputed leader of the Sinaloa cartel.

Communicating complex meteorological data in a simple format also presents a challenge. While forecasting accuracy has greatly improved, with one-day forecasts now over 90% correct, predicting weather for small, specific areas remains difficult.

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from fashion retailer Zara, ruling that they featured models who appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog found the images to be "irresponsible," citing one model's "gaunt" appearance and another's "protruding" collarbones as focal points of the ads. Zara has since removed the images but stated that both models had provided medical certificates confirming their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers like Marks & Spencer and Next for similar concerns about promoting unhealthy body images.</p>

          <p>A major UK debt adviser, Money Wellness, is urging the government to introduce a statutory school clothing grant for low-income families in England, mirroring policies in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. A study found that only about a fifth of English councils offer dedicated uniform support, creating a "postcode lottery" for assistance. With uniform costs averaging over £340 for primary school children, many families face significant financial strain. While the government is limiting branded item requirements to save money, advocates argue that direct financial aid is necessary to ensure affordability for all.</p>

          <p>The political standoff in Texas has escalated, with Republican Senator John Cornyn requesting FBI assistance to locate and arrest the Democratic state lawmakers who fled to block a redistricting vote. This move heightens the confrontation between Texas Republicans and the Democrats, many of whom have sought refuge in Illinois. Governor Greg Abbott has also filed a petition to remove the Democratic caucus chair from office. The conflict began after Democrats broke quorum to prevent a vote on a new congressional map sought by Donald Trump, which could add five Republican-leaning seats.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to terminate approximately $7 billion in grant funding from the Solar for All program, which is designed to help low- and middle-income households install solar panels. The program, funded by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, has already awarded the grants to 60 state agencies and other entities. Because the funds have already been awarded, this move is legally complex and likely to face court challenges. This action represents the administration's latest effort to roll back clean energy initiatives, following previous attempts to cut climate grants and subsidies.</p>

Despite a market pullback, Cramer emphasized that corporate profits remain strong and that many companies are effectively managing challenges like tariffs. He suggested that investors are overly fearful of a market downturn and are overlooking the strong performance of major companies. Cramer believes the focus should be on bountiful corporate profits rather than a narrative of an impending rollover. (not investment advice)</p>

The creator points out that no one is proposing a single coast-to-coast line; instead, proposed routes like San Francisco to Los Angeles or Dallas to Houston are comparable in distance to successful high-speed lines in Europe and Asia. For example, the Barcelona-to-Madrid route in Spain is longer than the New York-to-D.C. corridor.
