          <p>Lucy Connolly, recently released from prison after serving a sentence for inciting racial hatred against asylum seekers, claims she was a "political prisoner" of Sir Keir Starmer. Connolly, wife of a Tory councillor, had called for burning hotels housing asylum seekers after a 2024 attack. While acknowledging her tweet was not her "finest moment" and denying advocating violence, she criticizes Starmer for human rights and free speech, and is considering legal action against police for a "twisted" statement. The article details the context of her arrest, conviction, and the political reactions to her case.</p>

          <p>House Democrats have introduced a bill to establish legal thresholds for advanced chips requiring congressional approval before export to China. This aims to set clear limits amid national security concerns that China uses cutting-edge chips for surveillance and military modernization. The bill specifies benchmarks for processing performance, memory, and interconnect speeds, ensuring that if an advanced AI chip is destined for China, the U.S. government must prove it serves national security or Congress must approve it. The measure faces significant challenges to pass both the Republican-led House and Senate.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison where he alleges torture, has been released from detention in Tennessee and reunited with his family in Maryland. He faces human smuggling and gang membership charges, which his family denies, and has pleaded not guilty. A federal judge ordered his return to supervised release under ICE in Baltimore, preventing immediate re-deportation, but Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem condemned his release and vowed to continue efforts for his removal, calling the judge's ruling a "new low."</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. government has acquired a 10% stake in Intel, making it one of the company's largest shareholders. This deal, valued at approximately $11 billion, converts previously pledged government grants under the CHIPS and Science Act and Secure Enclave program into equity. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the agreement strengthens U.S. semiconductor leadership and technological edge. The move follows Trump's previous criticism of Intel's CEO and is part of his strategy to boost domestic chip production and leverage power over tech companies, though the government will hold non-voting shares.

Maxwell, who received limited immunity, stated she never saw Donald Trump in "any inappropriate setting" and praised him, dismissing concerns about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. She detailed their social interactions but denied them being close friends or Trump visiting Epstein's house. The interview also touched on Epstein's relationship with Bill Clinton and Maxwell's role in compiling Epstein's birthday book, denying any Trump contributions or naked photos.</p>

This "political arms race" for power, though unusual mid-decade, could spread to other states ahead of next year's midterm elections.

          <p>San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies have arrested Jake and Rebecca Haro, parents of 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro, on suspicion of murder. The infant was reported kidnapped last week, with Rebecca initially claiming she was assaulted and the baby taken. Investigators found "inconsistencies" in her story and could not rule out foul play, leading to the arrests. The search for Emmanuel continues, and a 2-year-old child was previously removed from their home. Jake Haro has a prior conviction for willful child cruelty, and his ex-wife has sought a restraining order.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of actively trying to prevent a peace meeting with Vladimir Putin, despite U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to broker talks. Trump acknowledged the difficulty, stating the leaders "don't get along too well." While Zelensky supports a meeting, he seeks robust security guarantees from Western allies, aspiring to a NATO Article 5-like commitment to prevent future attacks. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, however, stated no meeting is planned, blaming Ukraine for inflexibility and hindering progress, while Putin expressed optimism about Russia-U.S. relations without mentioning Ukraine talks.</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares increased over 3% following reports that Apple is in early discussions to potentially integrate Google's Gemini AI models into an updated version of its Siri assistant, possibly launching next year. This development comes as Google's Gemini models lead in AI advancements, while Apple has struggled to define its own AI strategy. The talks also occur as Google faces regulatory scrutiny over its search monopoly, with potential risks to its lucrative search deals with Apple. Apple is reportedly exploring partnerships with other AI firms as well. (not investment advice)</p>

The victory leaves both teams on eight points, making qualification unlikely but still mathematically possible if other results align in their favor.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel patrolling Washington D.C. to be armed, intensifying the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. This reverses a previous stance that troops would not carry weapons. President Trump, who ordered approximately 2,000 troops to D.C. earlier in August and took control of its police force, lauded the mission as bringing "total safety" and is considering declaring a national emergency to extend the deployment. Local officials and residents, however, widely oppose the federal intervention, with polls showing deep unpopularity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt and delinquencies reach new highs, many Americans are seeking relief, with credit card forbearance emerging as a temporary option. This article explains forbearance as an arrangement allowing borrowers to pause or reduce payments for a limited period, potentially including fee waivers and interest relief, though interest often accrues. Qualification typically requires proof of financial hardship, such as job loss or unexpected expenses, and a history of on-time payments. For those ineligible, alternatives like debt management plans, consolidation loans, or balance transfers are suggested. (not investment advice)</p>
