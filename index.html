          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man facing human smuggling charges, claim the U.S. government is attempting to coerce him into a guilty plea. They allege that after he was released from custody, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) threatened him with deportation to Uganda unless he accepted a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica. This development occurred after Abrego Garcia was wrongly deported once before and brought back to the U.S. The Justice Department maintains he is a danger to the community and will be held accountable.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine celebrated its 34th Independence Day, Russia launched a significant overnight attack involving 72 drones and a ballistic missile across ten locations. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 48 of the drones, while President Zelenskyy framed the ongoing conflict as the nation's "war for independence." In response, Ukraine targeted Russian territory with 95 drones, reportedly causing explosions at an oil refinery and a fire at a gas terminal. A downed drone also caused a fire at the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, prompting concern from the IAEA.</p>

          <p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers rookie safety Shilo Sanders was ejected from a preseason game against the Buffalo Bills for throwing a punch at tight end Zach Davidson. The incident occurred in the second quarter after the two players were engaged in pushing and shoving. Sanders, the son of NFL legend Deion Sanders, is currently competing for a spot on the team's final roster after going undrafted. Head coach Todd Bowles called the action "inexcusable," noting that such behavior will always be penalized in the league.</p>

          <p>According to Al-Awda Hospital and eyewitnesses, Israeli forces opened fire and killed four Palestinians who were traveling to a food distribution point in the Netzarim corridor area south of Gaza City. The incident adds to a growing number of casualties among civilians seeking food amid a deepening humanitarian crisis, with a U.N.-backed initiative recently declaring a famine in the city. The Hamas-run Health Ministry reports that over 2,000 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid since the war began. Israel's military is simultaneously increasing its operations in northern Gaza.</p>

          <p>A political battle over congressional redistricting is escalating between Republican and Democratic-led states, threatening to intensify partisan divisions ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. At the reported urging of former President Trump, Texas Republicans have passed new maps to gain up to five GOP seats, prompting California's Governor Gavin Newsom to counter with a plan to subvert his state's independent commission and add a similar number of Democratic seats. This "fire with fire" approach is also being considered in other states like Ohio, New York, and Florida, raising concerns about the future of competitive elections.</p>

          <p>Amid declining public trust and partisan attacks, American universities are facing an existential crisis that threatens their core mission. The article argues that institutions have become vulnerable by abandoning institutional neutrality and taking stances on political issues, which fuels accusations of bias and stifles free expression on campus. To save their role as centers for open inquiry, universities must reclaim the principle of academic freedom for individuals while the administration itself remains neutral. This would create a protected space for complex disagreements, a function more vital than ever in an era of polarization.</p>

The move aims to reduce the number of migrants housed in hotels at taxpayer expense while awaiting decisions.

Instead, AI should be built as a collaborative tool to augment human skills by handling vast data while leaving context, ethics, and final judgment to people.

          <h2>Internal Divisions Hinder Political Progress for Democratic Socialists of America</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite growing public interest in socialism, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) struggles to become a major political force due to deep internal conflicts. The article identifies two main factions: a "mass-politics" wing that aims to win elections within the Democratic Party, and a "sectarian" wing with extremist, anti-democratic views that alienate mainstream voters. This division results in contradictory actions, such as refusing to endorse popular socialist-aligned politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or work to defeat Donald Trump. This internal factionalism prevents the DSA from adopting a unified, effective strategy for gaining national political power.</p>

          <p>An essay argues that when parents don't read aloud to their children, they miss out on a profound opportunity for connection and mutual understanding. The author shares her personal experience of reading to her newborn, transitioning from Romantic poetry to simple board books, and discovering the joy in watching his comprehension grow. Reading aloud is presented not just as a tool for a child's development, but as a way for a parent to learn how to "read" their own child. It becomes a shared act of making sense of the world together, creating a unique and lasting bond.</p>

          <p>Tennis offers a unique combination of physical and cognitive benefits that make it an ideal lifetime sport. It provides a full-body, aerobic workout that improves muscle strength, cardiovascular health, and bone density, with studies suggesting it can add nearly a decade to one's life expectancy. The sport's complexity—requiring rapid assessment of trajectory, speed, and spin while coordinating complex movements—enhances cognitive functions like reaction time and decision-making. As a relatively safe and accessible sport, tennis provides a fun and engaging way to maintain both brain and body health throughout life.</p>

          <p>An Ohio woman sought advice from "The Ramsey Show" after discovering she still owes over $17,000 on a 2016 Ford Fusion she purchased in 2017, despite making payments for over seven years. The subprime lender claims the balance is due to late fees and other charges, but the borrower disputes the calculation. Host Dave Ramsey explained the dangers of subprime lenders, who target borrowers with low credit scores using extremely high interest rates, in this case 18.95%. He advised her to demand an itemized statement or consider hiring a lawyer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book by an anthropologist and an artist proposes a novel approach to climate change: treating excess atmospheric carbon like the nation's gold reserves. The idea involves creating community-based "carbon banks" that would accept organic waste, convert it into a stable form like biochar, and sequester it. In exchange, depositors would receive a local digital currency, creating a grassroots economy based on carbon removal. The authors argue that just as society rendered gold priceless by taking it out of circulation, we could create a new value system around sequestering carbon.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, causing over 1,400 deaths and flooding 80% of the city, residents and experts reflect on the disaster and its legacy. The catastrophe was long predicted, with officials aware that the levee system was vulnerable to a major storm surge, yet preparations were inadequate. The storm exposed profound failures in government response at the local, state, and federal levels, particularly within FEMA. As the city continues its slow recovery, concerns are rising that the critical lessons about infrastructure, preparedness, and federal disaster management are being forgotten.</p>

          <p>As the new school year approaches, families are facing higher prices on supplies due to the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese imports, which largely went into effect in August. A National Retail Federation survey found that 72% of parents expect to pay more this year, with total spending projected to reach a near-record $39.4 billion. While some retailers are attempting to absorb the initial costs, economists predict the increases will inevitably be passed on to consumers. Federal Reserve officials have noted that the tariffs are starting to appear in inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump and his allies are employing a new strategy of accusing political opponents of mortgage fraud, a tactic critics describe as "lawfare" similar to that used in authoritarian regimes. The effort is led by Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has publicly targeted New York AG Letitia James, Senator Adam Schiff, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Cook, the first Black woman on the Fed board, is being pressured to resign over unverified claims. This move is seen as part of Trump's broader antagonism toward the Federal Reserve.</p>
