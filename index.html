          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly directed the Pentagon to develop military plans against Latin American drug cartels, which were recently designated as foreign terrorist organizations. According to media reports, potential actions could include special forces operations and intelligence support, coordinated with partner nations. This move follows President Trump's vow to "wage war" on cartels, whom he accuses of flooding the U.S. with drugs. In response, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly stated that no U.S. military invasion would be permitted on Mexican soil, emphasizing cooperation over intervention.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the celebrated astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and safely guided its crew back to Earth, has passed away at the age of 97. NASA praised him for turning a "potential tragedy into a success" after an onboard explosion aborted the 1970 moon landing attempt. Lovell was the first person to fly to the Moon twice but never landed on its surface, and his life was immortalized in the 1995 film "Apollo 13." Tributes from his family and actor Tom Hanks remembered his unshakeable optimism and leadership in pushing the boundaries of human exploration.</p>

          <p>Welsh athlete Louis Rees-Zammit has decided to end his venture into the NFL and return to rugby union, a move that comes after a brief period with the Jacksonville Jaguars. His American football dream was cut short by a combination of factors, including a back injury and a coaching staff change, which diminished his chances of making the active roster. Despite his determination, experts noted the immense athletic and technical gap he faced in the NFL. His return is being hailed as a major boost for Welsh rugby, with coaches and former players believing he will come back a more mature and skilled athlete.</p>

The planned summit, the first between U.S. and Russian leaders since 2021, comes as Trump aims to broker a deal, having previously expressed frustration with Putin's continued aggression despite talks.</p>

          <p>Manchester City midfielder Rodri has experienced a setback in his recovery from a long-term injury and is not expected to be fully fit until after the upcoming international break. The Spanish international, who suffered a ruptured ACL last season, recently returned to action but sustained a new groin issue during a Club World Cup match. Manager Pep Guardiola confirmed the new injury, stating that while Rodri is improving, he will need more time to regain full fitness. This news is a blow to the team as they prepare for the next phase of their season without the 2024 Ballon d'Or winner at his best.</p>

          <p>Federal agents conducted two raids at a Home Depot in Van Nuys, detaining day laborers and sparking concerns that they may be violating a recent court order against racial profiling. Immigration advocates and Los Angeles city officials have questioned the legality of the operations, one of which reportedly involved agents emerging from a rental truck. A U.S. Border Patrol chief defended the actions as targeted enforcement based on intelligence, not indiscriminate sweeps, and stated that agents always abide by the law. The events have heightened tensions surrounding immigration enforcement in the region.</p>

For Putin, key goals likely include preventing Ukraine's NATO membership and gaining formal recognition of Russian-held territories. The main negotiating points will revolve around a ceasefire, the future of Ukraine's borders, and its potential military alliances, with both sides holding deeply entrenched and conflicting positions.</p>

          <h2>The 'Treatonomics' Trend Sees Consumers Spending on Small Luxuries and Big Experiences Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is booming as people seek mood boosts during periods of economic uncertainty. This behavior involves spending on both small, affordable luxuries like makeup and larger, memorable experiences such as concert tickets. An evolution of the "lipstick effect," this trend is driven by a post-pandemic re-evaluation of well-being and a desire for joy when traditional milestones like homeownership feel unattainable. Analysts note that consumers are cutting back on daily essentials to afford these guilt-free treats that inject happiness into fraught times. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are employing tactics reminiscent of the COVID-19 pandemic to control an outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease chikungunya, raising concerns among the public. The response has involved intrusive measures, such as a task force led by a Communist Party secretary forcibly entering a home to clear stagnant water where mosquitoes could breed. These heavy-handed actions, including demands for blood samples from feverish children, have led to complaints and highlight the ongoing tension between aggressive public health enforcement and individual rights in China.</p>

          <p>Authorities in China are employing aggressive and intrusive tactics to control an outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease chikungunya, drawing comparisons to the country's stringent COVID-19 playbook. The public health response has included task forces forcibly entering private residences to inspect for and eliminate stagnant water where mosquitoes breed. While aimed at preventing the spread of the disease, these measures have sparked concerns and complaints from residents about the violation of their privacy and rights, highlighting a tension between public health control and individual liberties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly seeking a $1 billion settlement from UCLA to resolve a Justice Department investigation into the university's response to pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024. The probe concluded that UCLA was "deliberately indifferent to a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students." The administration has already suspended hundreds of millions in federal research funding to the university. UCLA's president warned that a payment of this magnitude would be devastating to the public university system, while California's governor decried the move as extortion.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration agents conducted two raids targeting day laborers outside a Home Depot in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, prompting immediate criticism from advocacy groups. Critics argue the actions flout a recent temporary court order that prohibits agents from targeting individuals based on race, location, or vocation without reasonable suspicion. The L.A. mayor has raised concerns, and the city is exploring legal options. A U.S. Border Patrol chief defended the operations, stating they were targeted actions based on intelligence and not indiscriminate sweeps.</p>
