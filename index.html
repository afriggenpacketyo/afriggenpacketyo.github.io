            <p>Amid escalating trade tensions, China is shifting its retaliatory measures away from tariffs on goods and toward the U.S. services sector. This includes tightening export controls on critical minerals, initiating antitrust probes into American companies like DuPont and Google, and restricting deliveries of Boeing jets. These actions signal Beijing's intent to exert pressure on U.S. businesses through various means beyond tariffs, leading to concerns about the decoupling of the two economies. Wendy Cutler from the Asia Society Policy Institute notes that China has many levers to pull to inflict different levels of pain for U.S. companies, thus escalating the situation.

            <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) is appealing a judge's order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. after his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. Simultaneously, the DOJ released documents alleging Abrego Garcia's ties to the MS-13 gang, based on a police field interview and a DHS form. These documents cite his clothing and information from a confidential informant as evidence, while Abrego Garcia's lawyers and wife deny his gang affiliation, questioning the validity of the evidence and highlighting inconsistencies in the reports. The case raises questions about due process and the use of potentially unreliable information in deportation proceedings.</p>

Shapps emphasized the importance of moral clarity in condemning Putin's actions, including the invasion of Ukraine and the suppression of political opponents. He also alluded to potential compromising material that Russia may possess regarding Trump, suggesting that appeasing Putin encourages other autocrats with territorial ambitions, thus creating a dangerous precedent for international relations.</p>
