            <p>Several core Democratic political groups, including ActBlue and Indivisible, are preparing for potential criminal investigations launched by allies of President Trump, fearing retribution for past actions and facing accusations of illegal activities. These groups are working with attorneys and developing contingency plans to counter potential threats, emphasizing the importance of collective action to defend against perceived anti-democratic threats. Republicans have accused ActBlue of campaign finance violations and ties to terror-linked organizations, while Trump allies have condemned Indivisible for inciting violence. ActBlue reports a surge in donations, demonstrating grassroots support despite the attacks.</p>

            <p>President Trump has controversially blamed Ukrainian President Zelensky for starting the war with Russia, following a deadly Russian attack on the city of Sumy. Trump stated that Zelensky shares the blame with Putin and Biden for the conflict's casualties, questioning Zelensky's competence and criticizing Ukraine's pursuit of missiles. This statement comes amid heightened tensions between Trump and Zelensky, who previously urged Trump to visit Ukraine before negotiating with Putin. The attack on Sumy resulted in numerous casualties, with Russia claiming to have targeted Ukrainian soldiers. Trump has signaled potential proposals to end the conflict, but details remain unclear.</p>

            <p>Oil giant BP is being considered a prime takeover target, sparking speculation about a potential mega-merger within the energy sector. Analysts suggest that BP's recent strategic shift to refocus on oil and gas while cutting renewable spending has made it attractive to potential suitors like Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron. While antitrust concerns and Shell's capital discipline might hinder a Shell-BP merger, Chevron could be interested if its pursuit of Hess falls through. Analysts note that the entire oil and gas sector faces an existential crisis, driving companies to consolidate to reduce costs and return cash to shareholders (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>The U.S. Commerce Department is conducting a national security investigation into semiconductor technology and related imports, potentially leading to new tariffs. This investigation aims to assess the feasibility of increasing domestic semiconductor capacity and reducing reliance on foreign markets. Despite some exemptions on electronic products, the probe suggests a broader plan to apply tariffs to the sector, justified under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The U.S. relies heavily on semiconductor technology from Taiwan, South Korea, and the Netherlands, prompting efforts to bolster domestic production through policies like the CHIPS and Science Act.</p>

            <p>Hungary's parliament has passed a constitutional amendment allowing the government to ban public events by LGBTQ+ communities, drawing criticism as a step towards authoritarianism. The amendment prioritizes children's rights to moral and spiritual development over the right to assemble, effectively codifying a law that bans LGBTQ+ public gatherings. Critics argue the measures distract from more serious national issues and mobilize Prime Minister Orb√°n's right-wing base ahead of elections. The amendment also defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and allows for the suspension of citizenship for dual citizens deemed a threat to national security.</p>

Coastal areas popular with second-home owners are also seeing slower sales due to increased supply caused by higher taxes on second homes. The time from agreement to completion, however, remains significantly longer, typically taking an additional 4-6 months.</p>

This has led to some seeking private healthcare, although newer, more effective medicines are often only available on the NHS.

            <p>The Trump administration is freezing federal funds to Harvard University after the university rejected demands to crack down on antisemitism and alter its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The administration called for reforms to Harvard's governance, admissions, and hiring policies, as well as a ban on face masks and an end to diversity programs. Harvard's president responded that the university would not comply with demands that threaten academic freedom, calling the administration's actions a political ploy. The move has sparked protests and a lawsuit from the American Association of University Professors.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has rejected an agreement proposed by the Trump administration to maintain federal funding, citing its commitment to independence and constitutional rights. In response, the administration announced a freeze on $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60 million in multi-year contract value to Harvard. The administration's demands included leadership reforms, an end to diversity and inclusion policies, and increased discipline for students violating school policies. Harvard's president argued that the proposed agreement exceeded the federal government's power and would compromise the university's intellectual and academic freedom.</p>

            <p>Senior advisers close to President Trump privately warned weeks ago that proposed tariffs could negatively impact global financial markets and destabilize the U.S. economy. Internal disagreements arose before the April 2 announcement, with some leaders predicting serious economic instability. Treasury Secretary Bessent and Commerce Secretary Lutnick advocated for a more calculated rollout with targeted tariffs, while trade adviser Navarro pushed for broad tariffs on all imported goods. Financial markets reacted negatively to the announcement, leading to a partial pause on some tariffs after initial market turmoil.</p>

Health officials reported numerous cases of suffocation, with hospitals overwhelmed by patients struggling to breathe. The storm, characterized by thick orange haze and reduced visibility, has also caused power cuts and flight suspensions in several regions. While dust storms are common in Iraq, experts believe they are becoming more frequent due to the effects of climate change. Local media reported power cuts and the suspension of flights in a number of regions.</p>

The US government conceded that √Åbrego Garc√≠a's deportation was due to an administrative error, although they also claim he is a gang member, a claim his lawyer denies.

            <p>During a recent earthquake at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, a herd of African elephants exhibited a remarkable display of protective behavior, forming an 'alert circle' around their young. This defensive tactic, used in the wild to shield youngsters from threats, showcased the elephants' strong family bonds and communication skills. The elephants, sensing the ground shaking, quickly gathered around the younger members of the herd, creating a protective barrier. This is not the first time the elephants have displayed this behavior, having done so during a 2010 earthquake as well.</p>

            <p>A federal funding freeze by the Trump administration has halted key infrastructure projects in tribal communities across the US, leaving many tribes uncertain about their ability to address critical needs. More than 22 tribes and nonprofits have had around $350 million in federal funding frozen, often without notice, impacting projects ranging from housing renovations to riverbank stabilization. These projects, funded through the EPA's Office of Environmental Justice, aimed to improve community infrastructure and address the impacts of climate change. The funding freeze has created significant uncertainty and disrupted the progress of vital projects in vulnerable communities.</p>
