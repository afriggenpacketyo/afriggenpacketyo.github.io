          <p>Paul Tudor Jones, a billionaire hedge fund manager, anticipates the stock market will decline to new lows, even if President Trump reduces tariffs on China. Jones cites Trump's focus on tariffs and the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut rates as factors detrimental to the stock market. He suggests these conditions could reduce economic growth and that stocks have not yet reached their bottom. Jones gained recognition for accurately predicting the 1987 stock market crash and is the chairman of the nonprofit Just Capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are considering curtailing or ending Medicaid provider taxes, a move that could save the federal government approximately $600 billion over the next decade. These taxes, used by states to increase federal matching funds, involve taxing hospitals and returning the funds as higher Medicaid payments, effectively gaming the federal government. A recent analysis suggests that Republican-led states, which rely more on this strategy, could be hit the hardest. The article includes an interactive graphic that explains how the provider tax works and how it generates additional money for the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that President Trump's trade tariffs have caused a broad slump in U.S. exports, particularly affecting the agricultural sector. Ports across the nation are experiencing declines, with the Port of Oregon facing the most significant drop at 51%. The overall decrease in exports is attributed to reduced containership traffic and changes in global demand. This situation is leading to concerns about retail inventories and potential supply disruptions during the upcoming holiday shopping season.</p>

          <p>President Trump is urging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but the Fed is expected to hold steady at its May meeting. The decision comes amidst mixed economic signals, including negative GDP growth and strong job numbers. Economists suggest the Fed will likely maintain its current rate, waiting for more data and the effects of the Trump administration's economic policies to become clearer.</p>
