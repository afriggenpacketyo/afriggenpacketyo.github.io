          <p>The Israeli military fired warning shots at a group of diplomats, including Japanese officials, in the occupied West Bank, prompting a formal protest from Japan. According to the Israeli troops, the shots were fired after the diplomats entered a restricted area in Jenin while assessing the humanitarian situation. The Japanese Foreign Ministry expressed regret and demanded an explanation and measures to prevent similar incidents, while the Israeli military stated that it regrets the incident and will report its findings to the concerned nations. The group consisted of diplomats from over 30 countries, visiting the city to assess the humanitarian situation.</p>

The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, 30, of Chicago, was taken into custody after allegedly chanting "Free, Free Palestine." The victims, a couple about to be engaged, were shot at close range as they exited the event. The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential act of targeted violence, with President Trump pledging support in combating anti-Semitism.

          <p>Shares of Xpeng, the Chinese electric-vehicle maker, experienced a significant surge in Hong Kong following positive earnings reports and an optimistic revenue forecast for the second quarter. Analysts anticipate that Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of this year, driven by strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled compared to the previous year, fueled by robust sales figures, and its net loss narrowed substantially. This financial performance has led brokerages to maintain a buy rating on the stock, projecting substantial upside from its current price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that climate change has significantly contributed to increased deaths and economic costs in the United States due to wildfire smoke. From 2006 to 2020, climate change was linked to approximately 15,000 deaths and $160 billion in economic damages resulting from exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from wildfires. Researchers emphasize the growing frequency of these smoke events and their severe health impacts, particularly for vulnerable populations. The study underscores the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and implement land management practices to mitigate the increasing risk of deadly wildfire smoke.</p>

          <p>The Archdiocese of New Orleans has agreed to pay nearly $180 million to over 500 victims of clergy sexual abuse to settle a lawsuit filed in 2020. The settlement, which requires approval from the survivors, the bankruptcy court, and other creditors, includes provisions to safeguard against future abuse and provide services to survivors. However, some attorneys representing the survivors have voiced opposition, calling the deal an insult and a move to prevent victims from taking their claims to state court. The settlement comes after the release of church records documenting years of abuse claims and clergy transfers without reporting alleged crimes to law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Russia's war-focused economy is showing signs of strain due to international sanctions and internal pressures, including inflation and high production costs. While Russia seems reluctant to engage in peace negotiations with Ukraine, increasing economic and military pressures may eventually force Moscow to the negotiating table. A slowdown in GDP growth, concentrated growth in the defense sector, and tighter sanctions on Russia's oil exports are factors contributing to the economic challenges. The Russian central bank is maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation, but a marked slowdown in the economy has surprised some economists.</p>

Despite a strong performance from Jalen Brunson, the Knicks ultimately fell short as Obi Toppin's late dunk secured the victory for Indiana.

Economic disparities and a lack of public confidence in the government have fragmented the country, with recent elections highlighting the potential for further division. Starmer's Council of the Nations and Regions aims to foster partnership between the UK government and devolved governments, but its effectiveness remains uncertain. The success of Starmer's agenda depends on collaboration between different parts of the UK's devolved system of governance.</p>

          <p>A landmark review in the UK proposes that violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, could be released after serving just a third of their sentence. The Independent Sentencing Review recommends managing more offenders in the community to alleviate prison overcrowding, warning that building more prisons is not a sufficient solution. The review also suggests shorter custodial sentences and greater use of suspended sentences and community orders.

          <p>Richard Poplak's op-ed in The New York Times addresses the false narrative of "white genocide" in South Africa, perpetuated by right-wing Afrikaner lobbyists and amplified by figures like Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump.

Trump's administration has even offered refugee status to ethnic minority Afrikaners, a move that Poplak critiques as a distortion of South Africa's history. The piece contends that this narrative is an attempt to flip the script of apartheid and cast former oppressors as victims in a democratic South Africa.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are set to vote on revoking California's vehicle emissions waivers, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." The waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue they have the authority to overturn the waivers through the Congressional Review Act, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The outcome could impact cities and states that have adopted California's standards, as well as the auto industry's transition to electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>The House Rules Committee advanced the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" after making changes aimed at securing support from Republican holdouts. The bill, supporting President Donald Trump's second-term agenda, now includes an earlier start date for Medicaid work requirements and a higher SALT deduction for certain incomes. The bill also renames MAGA accounts to "Trump" accounts and expedites cuts to clean energy credits. Despite these changes, the bill faces challenges on the House floor and in the Senate, with Democrats expected to oppose it.</p>

          <p>House Republican leaders are struggling to secure enough votes to pass their sweeping domestic policy bill, facing opposition from both fiscal conservatives and moderate lawmakers. The bill, which includes tax cuts, increased military spending, and cuts to social programs, faces a narrow margin of control in the House. Concessions made to appease one faction risk alienating others, leaving the bill's fate uncertain. The bill is projected to add trillions to the national debt, drawing criticism from Democrats and raising concerns among economists.</p>

Such an event could sink coastal land by up to 6.5 feet and generate waves of extreme height, posing a significant risk to millions.

          <p>The Republican-controlled House of Representatives is set to vote on President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill after it cleared a procedural hurdle.

It also includes provisions for tipped income and auto loans, while tightening eligibility for food and health programs.
