        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that President Trump and his allies are irresponsibly framing political violence as an exclusively left-wing problem following the killing of Charlie Kirk. The author contends that this narrative ignores data showing far-right extremists have perpetrated the majority of domestic terror attacks in recent decades. The piece criticizes Trump for capitalizing on the tragedy to advance a political agenda and for a history of rhetoric that has allegedly incited violence from his own supporters. It concludes that this one-sided portrayal creates a dangerous environment detached from factual reality.</p>

          <p>This article details the journey of footballer Yoane Wissa, who recently completed a £55m transfer to Newcastle United. It highlights his remarkable recovery and determination after suffering a horrific acid attack at his home in 2021, an event that could have ended his career and cost him his sight. Despite the trauma, Wissa's strong will, praised by former managers and teammates, propelled his rise from the French second division to the Premier League and now the Champions League. His recent departure from Brentford was contentious, but the piece focuses on his perseverance through adversity.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has convicted former President Jair Bolsonaro for leading a conspiracy to stage a military coup and illegally remain in power after his 2022 election loss. A majority of justices found him guilty on multiple charges, including attempting to violently abolish democratic rule, which could result in a prison sentence of over 40 years. The court determined that the plot culminated in the January 8, 2023 storming of government buildings by his supporters. Bolsonaro, who has maintained his innocence and called the trial a politically motivated "witch hunt," is expected to appeal the verdict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the significant political influence of Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was fatally shot. It details his rise from a suburban Chicago high school student concerned with textbook bias to the founder of Turning Point USA, a powerful youth-focused conservative movement. The piece explores how Kirk's charismatic and relatable style helped brand the MAGA movement for a younger generation, making him a key ally of President Donald Trump.

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Trump stated he is not concerned for his own safety but rather for the country. He attributed the violence to a "radical left group of lunatics" and asserted that his administration would solve the problem. When asked about a potential response from his supporters, Trump advocated for nonviolence, reflecting what he described as Kirk's own principles. Separately, the article notes the Trump administration is pushing an appeals court to expedite its challenge to a ruling that prevents the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have successfully changed chamber rules to accelerate the confirmation process for President Trump's sub-cabinet level nominees, bypassing Democratic opposition. The move, which Democrats warned against as a "nuclear option," lowers the voting threshold to a simple majority for these appointments. Majority Leader John Thune argued the change was necessary to overcome what he called a crisis of Democratic obstructionism and allow the president to assemble his team. Despite last-minute negotiations for a bipartisan deal, talks failed, prompting Republicans to proceed with the procedural maneuver to alter Senate precedent.</p>

With an average interest rate of just 0.39% and inflation near 2.9%, a $10,000 deposit would earn less than $40 in a year, resulting in a net loss of purchasing power. The author suggests that savers would be better served by exploring high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs), which offer significantly higher returns.

          <p>In the wake of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Comedy Central has pulled a recent "South Park" episode from its broadcast schedule. The episode, which originally aired in August, featured the character Eric Cartman parodying Kirk's confrontational debate style and hosting a right-wing podcast. Kirk himself had previously reacted to the parody on TikTok, calling it "hilarious" and a sign of his cultural impact. While the episode is no longer in the network's rotation, it remains available for streaming on demand and on Paramount+, as Kirk's supporters criticize the show's creators.</p>

The struggling real estate technology firm, which had been trading below $1 per share earlier this year, has seen its stock increase by over 500% year-to-date. The leadership change follows a pressure campaign from investors, including Rabois himself, after former CEO Carrie Wheeler resigned last month. The company stated it is returning to "founder mode" and plans to leverage artificial intelligence to simplify home buying and selling.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock fell 6% after a record-setting rally, following a report that a significant portion of its projected growth is tied to a single customer: OpenAI. Earlier in the week, Oracle's shares surged nearly 36% after the company announced multi-billion-dollar contracts and a massive increase in its performance obligation backlog. However, investor enthusiasm cooled after The Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI is set to pay Oracle $300 billion over five years for data center capacity. This revelation has raised concerns among analysts about the concentration of Oracle's future revenue stream.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing in Germany over whether classic literary works by authors like Goethe should remain central to the high school curriculum. Some students and reformers argue that the required reading lists are dominated by "old white men" and fail to reflect the country's diverse population or engage young people's interests. They advocate for more contemporary and culturally varied texts relevant to students' lives. Conversely, educators and philologists argue that classics are essential for understanding history and developing critical thinking, suggesting a balanced approach that includes both traditional and modern works chosen in consultation with students.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has triggered an outpouring of grief and rage across social media and conservative media outlets. Many prominent figures on the right mourned him as a martyr, while others quickly directed blame toward the left and Democrats for fostering a climate of political violence. President Trump echoed these sentiments, claiming that rhetoric from the "radical left" was directly responsible for the attack. The article notes that this narrative took hold immediately, even as authorities continue to search for the shooter and have not yet identified a motive for the killing.</p>

          <p>New data from the Department of Labor shows that initial claims for unemployment benefits surged to 263,000 last week, the highest number recorded since October 2021. This significant jump is being interpreted as one of the clearest signs yet that the U.S. job market is cooling and that layoffs are beginning to increase. The sluggish pace of hiring in recent months, combined with this rise in jobless claims, strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to implement an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. The news comes as other data shows consumer price inflation ticked up in August.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak has experienced strong consumer demand for its new product, the "Kodak Charmera," a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras. The palm-sized cameras, marketed as functional fashion accessories with vintage filters, sold out quickly on Kodak's website and are now available only for pre-order at most retailers. This early success comes at a critical time for the struggling photography pioneer, which recently warned of financial difficulties in its quarterly earnings report. The popularity of the Charmera suggests Kodak has successfully tapped into Gen Z's growing appetite for retro technology and Y2K aesthetics.</p>
