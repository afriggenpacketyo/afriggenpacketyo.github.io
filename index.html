          <p>A group of Yale University classmates has penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, expressing their concern that his role in the Trump administration could enable a descent into authoritarianism. The letter, signed by 140 members of the Yale Class of 1984, cites actions by the Trump administration as unconstitutional and undermining democratic principles, including giving Elon Musk extensive access to private data and punitive attacks on media and universities. Bessent responded by criticizing the signatories as close-minded progressives and defending his service in the Trump administration as an honor. The controversy highlights the deep political divisions and ethical considerations facing individuals serving in controversial administrations.</p>

          <p>Small business owners are advocating for exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs, citing the significant threat these taxes pose to their livelihoods. Senator Ed Markey has urged the Small Business Administration to provide relief, noting the vulnerability of small businesses due to their tight margins. The tariffs, which include increased rates on Chinese imports and reciprocal tariffs on other trading partners, are defended by the administration as measures to protect domestic manufacturing and stimulate economic growth. However, former SBA head Isabel Guzman argues that small businesses lack the financial reserves and supply chain diversity to withstand the impact of these tariffs.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has drafted a peace plan counteroffer to a White House proposal, suggesting potential compromises on key issues in the conflict with Russia. While the plan includes provisions that may be unacceptable to the Kremlin, such as no restrictions on the Ukrainian military and the deployment of a European security contingent, it also omits demands for Ukraine to regain all territory or join NATO. This suggests a willingness to find common ground, though major obstacles remain in reaching a comprehensive peace agreement.

          <p>The Justice Department has rescinded a Biden-era policy that protected journalists in leak investigations, potentially allowing authorities to subpoena reporters and compel testimony. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the policy change is necessary to prevent federal employees from leaking sensitive information, which she argues undermines the DOJ's ability to enforce the law and protect national security. This decision marks a shift towards a more aggressive approach to leak investigations, raising concerns about press freedom and the ability of journalists to protect confidential sources. Bruce Brown of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press criticized the decision, emphasizing the importance of protecting sources for consequential reporting.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Pentagon office reportedly established a system enabling him to access Signal messages, bypassing standard security protocols. A monitor in his office displayed his personal iPhone's text messages and Signal chats, even though cellphones are prohibited in the sensitive compartmentalized information facility (SCIF). Sources claim this workaround poses a security risk, granting Hegseth access to unsecured communications at his desk. The Pentagon denies the presence of a "dirty line" and the current use of Signal in Hegseth's office, stating the monitor merely alerts him to messages so he can check his phone outside the office.</p>

          <p>California is set to introduce a new license plate sequence starting next year due to the depletion of available combinations in the current format. The change, prompted by an increasing rate of new vehicle registrations, will shift from the existing number-letter-letter-letter-number-number-number sequence to a number-number-number-letter-letter-letter-number format. The surge in new car purchases is partly attributed to concerns about potential price increases resulting from the Trump administration's trade policies.

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) claims significant savings in US government spending, but a BBC Verify analysis reveals a lack of evidence to support some of the largest claimed savings. The analysis points out accounting errors and questions the methodology used to calculate savings, particularly regarding cancelled contracts. It also notes that a substantial portion of the claimed savings lacks supporting documentation. This raises concerns about the accuracy and transparency of Doge's reported achievements in cutting government spending.</p>
