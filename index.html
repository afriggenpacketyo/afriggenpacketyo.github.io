Yellow weather warnings remain in place for rain and thunderstorms in northern England, parts of Northern Ireland, and Scotland.  Flooding in Dover, Kent, caused disruption, and a lightning strike likely started a fire in St Leonards-on-Sea, though there were no casualties.  Rail services were also affected by a landslip.</p>

          <p>The UK government is navigating the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, maintaining a cautious diplomatic approach.  While expressing long-held concerns about Iran's nuclear program, the UK avoids explicitly endorsing Israel's actions.  Preparations for potential Israeli strikes began last year, and the government is engaging in multiple diplomatic channels to de-escalate the situation. The UN summit on a two-state solution has been postponed.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent attacks on Iran raise questions about the country's proximity to producing a nuclear weapon.  While Israel claims Iran was months away, other experts disagree, citing Iran's 'near-zero breakout' status for months.  Iran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful, despite past IAEA findings of weapons-related activities. The IAEA's latest report indicates Iran has enough enriched uranium for several bombs.</p>

          <p>Eight female athletes are appealing the NCAA's $2.8 billion settlement, arguing it violates Title IX due to its disproportionate allocation of funds favoring men's sports.  The appeal halts back payments, potentially delaying compensation for over a year.  The settlement aims to compensate athletes for lost name, image, and likeness (NIL) earnings, but the plaintiffs contend women are shortchanged by over $1 billion.  The NCAA's new plan to allow schools to pay current players directly will still proceed.</p>

          <p>President Trump's military parade evokes historical precedents of authoritarian displays of military power, from ancient Mesopotamia to modern-day Russia and China.  While large-scale military parades are rare in US history, this event draws parallels to past celebrations of military victories.  Historians note the contrast between Trump's approach and the more cautious stance of previous presidents who avoided overtly militaristic displays in the capital. The parade's symbolism is debated, with critics viewing it as authoritarian and supporters seeing it as a patriotic celebration.</p>
