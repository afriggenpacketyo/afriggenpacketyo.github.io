          <p>President Trump is visiting Texas after catastrophic floods killed over 120 people, including dozens of children at a summer camp. His visit comes amid questions about the local and federal emergency response, yet he has refrained from the harsh criticism he has directed at other states during past disasters. Instead, Trump has emphasized his close relationship with Texas Governor Greg Abbott. This approach contrasts with his previous attacks on Democratic officials and raises questions about the future of FEMA, which his administration has considered phasing out.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military ruler, Min Aung Hlaing, has publicly praised President Trump after receiving a letter about US tariffs, which the junta has interpreted as a form of official recognition. In a detailed response, the leader endorsed Trump's false claims about the 2020 US election and thanked him for cutting funding to US-backed media outlets. Seizing the opportunity, Min Aung Hlaing requested that the US lift economic sanctions that were imposed after the military's 2021 coup plunged the country into civil war.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing 'Devin,' an autonomous AI software engineer created by the startup Cognition, marking a significant milestone for artificial intelligence adoption on Wall Street. The bank plans to integrate hundreds, and potentially thousands, of these AI agents to work alongside its human developers on tasks like code updates. This move to a "hybrid workforce" is expected to dramatically boost productivity but also fuels ongoing anxiety about the potential for AI to displace human jobs in the financial sector and beyond.</p>

          <p>The UK government has put on hold any immediate plans to reduce the annual allowance for tax-free cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs). The proposal, which was intended to encourage more investment in stocks and shares to boost the economy, faced strong opposition from banks, building societies, and consumer advocates. While the Treasury has paused the controversial move, it has not ruled out future changes and still aims to promote investment through other avenues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As a hosepipe ban affecting millions comes into force in Yorkshire due to low reservoir levels, residents are voicing frustration over numerous, persistent water leaks. Many have reported water pouring down streets for weeks, seemingly unchecked by Yorkshire Water, leading to accusations of hypocrisy. The water company, which loses an estimated 260 million litres daily to leakage, is facing public anger for imposing restrictions on customers while significant amounts of water are being wasted.</p>

          <p>The UK and France have announced a new pilot scheme to address illegal Channel crossings, based on a "one in, one out" model. Under the deal, for every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept another who has made a legal asylum claim in France. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper insists the plan is robust enough to withstand legal challenges, while the Conservative opposition has dismissed it as a "gimmick" that will not solve the problem amid record arrival numbers.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as global sports like soccer and Formula One finally succeed in the American market, they are confronting a paradoxical challenge. The United States, set to host major events like the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics, is simultaneously pursuing increasingly isolationist politics under President Trump. This creates a strange dynamic where the country welcomes global spectacles while its policies, such as tariffs and travel bans, express contempt for its international guests.</p>

          <p>Tesla is experiencing a massive sales boom in Norway, with a 54% year-on-year increase in June, defying a broader slump across the rest of Europe. This success, largely fueled by the popular Model Y, comes despite a growing backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political rhetoric, which has impacted sales in other European markets. While a survey found many Norwegians would not buy a Tesla for political reasons, the brand's value proposition continues to dominate the world's most EV-friendly country.</p>
