          <p>Microsoft has issued a warning about active cyberattacks targeting a vulnerability in its on-premises SharePoint collaboration software, which could grant attackers unauthenticated system access. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed the threat poses a significant risk to organizations globally. While Microsoft has released patches for two versions of the software, a 2016 version remains vulnerable. Security researchers noted the flaw could allow hackers to impersonate users and steal data even after a patch is applied, affecting potentially thousands of organizations worldwide.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest pilot operating a Delta Connection flight performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a midair collision with a B-52 military aircraft near Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the military plane appeared on a converging course unexpectedly, as the local airport tower operates visually without radar. He apologized for the sudden turn, which he deemed the safest course of action. The Air Force confirmed a B-52 was in the area for a state fair flyover, and both the FAA and the military are investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary Horizon Air experienced a three-hour, system-wide ground stop due to a significant IT outage caused by a hardware failure at its data centers. The airline has since resumed operations but warned of residual flight impacts, with over 150 flights canceled. The carrier clarified that the incident was not related to a cyberattack and that flight safety was never compromised. This event follows a similar, though brief, grounding of its flights in Seattle last September due to another unspecified technology issue.</p>

          <p>During a recent concert, Coldplay's Chris Martin humorously warned the audience they might be put on the big screen, a subtle reference to a recent viral incident. The joke follows a controversial "Kiss Cam" moment at a previous show where Astronomer CEO Andy Byron was filmed with his company's HR chief, leading to speculation of an affair. The company launched a formal investigation, and Byron has since resigned. The incident sparked widespread online discussion about privacy and workplace conduct, with Martin's lighthearted comment marking the band's first public acknowledgment.</p>

The campaign group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful as it was on protected land.

The author argues that technology is a product of human choices, not an unstoppable force of nature. Citing historical examples like the regulation of recombinant DNA, the non-cloning of humans, and nuclear disarmament efforts, the article suggests that society has the agency to restrain potentially dangerous technologies. It calls for a civilization-scale effort to compel governments to resist a blind race toward AGI, which many experts believe poses existential risks.</p>

          <p>Following several high-profile incidents, this article explores the persistent danger of bird strikes to aircraft and the complex mitigation strategies airports employ. In 2023, the FAA recorded about 19,000 such incidents in the U.S., costing airlines an estimated $461 million. Airports like Boston's Logan use pyrotechnics, air cannons, and habitat management to deter birds, resorting to lethal measures only when necessary. The challenge is immense, as environmental factors like clean harbors can inadvertently attract more wildlife, creating a constant and evolving risk for aviation safety.</p>

          <p>Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep, Dodge, and Fiat, has issued a warning that it anticipates a net loss of approximately $2.7 billion for the first half of the year. The company cited several factors, including pre-tax charges, higher industrial costs, and the early effects of U.S. tariffs, which are expected to have an initial impact of 300 million euros. This unexpected announcement underscores the challenges facing the auto giant, which has seen its stock price fall significantly this year amid declining sales and a recent change in leadership.

          <p>A 33-year-old man has appeared in court, accused of violent disorder during a protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which is being used to house asylum seekers. The demonstration saw clashes where police officers were injured by thrown bottles and eggs. The protest was sparked by allegations that a man living in the hotel was charged with sexual assault. While a smaller counter-protest was also held, the larger gathering turned violent, leading to property damage and multiple arrests over several days. The accused man has denied the charge of violent disorder.</p>

          <p>According to a Reuters poll of economists, Brazil's economy is projected to maintain its growth trajectory despite the threat of U.S. tariffs, though inflation risks are rising. The consensus forecast shows GDP increasing by 2.2% this year and 1.7% in 2026, supported by a strong domestic job market. However, inflation is expected to remain near the upper end of the central bank's target range. Most analysts believe the U.S. will extend its deadline for imposing a potential 50% duty, allowing for negotiations to de-escalate the trade dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's coalition government, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, has lost its parliamentary majority following significant gains by right-wing populist parties in a recent election. This outcome reflects growing voter dissatisfaction with issues like declining real wages and increased immigration. The five-year-old Sanseito party, running on a xenophobic "Japanese First" platform, saw a dramatic increase in its seats. The result puts Prime Minister Ishiba's leadership on shaky ground, as he now faces a strengthened opposition and potential challenges from within his own party.</p>
