          <p>A 52-year-old man, Eric Slate, died from blunt force injuries after entering a kangaroo and wallaby enclosure at 5 Star Farm petting zoo in South Carolina. Slate, a relative of the owner, reportedly had a history of "playing rough" with the animals. The animal believed to be responsible has not been euthanized, and the investigation is ongoing. The petting zoo owner requested respect and support for the family during this time, emphasizing that the animal remained within its secure enclosure and posed no risk to the community.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced its intention to release US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander as a goodwill gesture to facilitate a ceasefire agreement and humanitarian aid entry into Gaza. The decision precedes President Trump's visit to the Middle East. Hamas stated that direct negotiations with a US administration official in Qatar are ongoing. The release is expected to involve a temporary halt to Israeli military activity during the handover, with President Trump confirming the news and calling it a step in good faith. The Families and Missing Families Forum campaign group said Alexander's release "must mark the beginning of a comprehensive agreement that will secure the freedom of all remaining hostages".</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark will stop covering Zepbound for weight loss, opting to cover Wegovy instead, despite research indicating Zepbound leads to greater weight loss. This decision is driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers aimed at lowering drug prices for employers, potentially limiting treatment options for patients. Patients like Ellen Davis, who experienced significant health improvements on Zepbound, are now forced to switch medications against their will. Caremark claims the move will reduce drug costs for employers by 10-15%, while Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy, distances itself from the decision, advocating for patient and doctor choice.</p>

          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy found that Mounjaro is more effective, leading to a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14% over 72 weeks. The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer Eli Lilly, involved 750 obese individuals and showed that 32% of people lost a quarter of their body weight on Mounjaro compared to 16% on Wegovy. Researchers suggest both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may be more suitable for those needing to lose more weight. In the UK, Mounjaro sales privately are now well ahead of Wegovy, suggesting that this paper will accelerate that trend.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court discovered documentation associated with the Nazi regime among its archives, including propaganda material. The material was intended to spread Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina during World War II. The documents are believed to be related to 83 packages sent by the German embassy in Tokyo in 1941. The president of the Supreme Court has ordered the preservation and thorough analysis of the material.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced it will release the last living American citizen held captive in Gaza, Edan Alexander, ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The decision follows talks with the United States, but the exact timing and conditions of the release are unclear. Hamas hopes to gain favor with Trump, who is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. The Trump administration has broken with past policy by holding direct talks with Hamas to secure Alexander's release.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will sign an executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for drugs administered in a doctor's office to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation" policy aims to lower healthcare costs for Americans, but faces strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. The proposal is similar to a failed effort from Trump's first term and will likely only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare Part B.</p>

          <p>Neuroscientists are developing a "digital bridge" to help paralyzed individuals regain movement and bodily functions. This technology bypasses spinal cord injuries, sending signals from the brain to the intact spinal cord. While walking is a top priority for the public, those with spinal cord injuries prioritize bladder control, sexual function, and blood pressure regulation. Spinal cord stimulators may also show promise in helping people with Parkinson's Disease regain mobility.</p>
