          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes against Iran, crude oil futures experienced a significant jump, reaching levels not seen since March 2022. The price surge reflects investor concerns about potential disruptions to Middle East oil supplies due to the escalating conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation, which targeted Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, will continue until the perceived threat is removed. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that Israel acted unilaterally, and President Donald Trump commented on Iran's failure to reach a nuclear deal, suggesting they now have a second chance. The situation remains volatile, with potential implications for global energy markets and geopolitical stability.</p>

          <p>Iran launched dozens of ballistic missiles toward Israel in retaliation for Israel's surprise attack early Friday, triggering sirens and prompting Israel's Iron Dome defense system to intercept the incoming projectiles. Israeli officials stated that their initial strike targeted Iran's nuclear program, resulting in the deaths of nuclear scientists and high-ranking military leaders. A U.S. official confirmed that the United States did not provide military assistance or have any involvement in the Israeli strike.

          <p>Archer Aviation's stock experienced a 15% decline following the announcement of an $850 million share sale intended to support the company's infrastructure development and AI-based aviation software platform. The funding will also support Archer's Launch Edition program, including its partnership to provide air taxi services during the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. This stock offering follows President Donald Trump's executive order to support the development of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles in the U.S., which had previously boosted Archer's stock.

Preliminary data suggests the plane lost signal less than a minute after takeoff, reaching a maximum altitude of 625 feet before crashing into a residential area. Investigators will examine the black boxes, maintenance records, pilot actions, and weather conditions to determine the cause of the crash, and past manufacturing concerns about Dreamliners may also be considered.</p>

The incident, along with other instances of harassment against Democrats, is seen as part of a pattern of government retribution against critics. The author draws parallels to regimes in countries like Serbia and Russia, and emphasizes the importance of civil society and cross-party cooperation in defending democratic principles.

The author explains that taking a break from sex and dating allowed her to widen her aperture and notice things that had previously escaped her attention. The book suggests that spirituality can be found in smaller phenomena and stiller moments, emphasizing the importance of marshaling one's attention to the world around us.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the October 7th attacks and subsequent events have altered Israel's strategic calculus, leading to its recent strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities and military leaders. Factors contributing to this shift include Israel's successful campaign against Hezbollah, a reduced fear of diplomatic blowback, and President Trump's foreign-policy approach. The author also suggests that Prime Minister Netanyahu's political situation has influenced the timing of the strikes. The article concludes that while concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions have long existed, the events set in motion by the October 7th attacks created the conditions for Israel to finally take action.</p>
