          <p>Senator Tammy Duckworth has stated that Mike Waltz, nominated for U.N. ambassador, will face a "brutal hearing" due to his involvement in a Signal chat leak where classified information was shared. Duckworth argues that Waltz is not qualified for the role, citing his inability to handle classified information responsibly. She believes everyone involved in the chat should have been terminated for not addressing the security breach. In contrast, Representative Mike Turner defends Waltz, highlighting his extensive background and experience, and expressed his satisfaction that Waltz would remain in a prominent position within the administration. The article provides context on the bipartisan call for an investigation into the security breach.</p>

Belichick defended Hudson and accused CBS of misrepresenting the conversation, while CBS stood by its interview, stating there were no preconditions or limitations.</p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece explores the intellectual underpinnings of President Trump's efforts to expand executive power, arguing that they go beyond the unitary executive theory. The author suggests that Trump's administration draws on a longer tradition of right-wing thought, including ideas from Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, and figures associated with the Claremont Institute. These thinkers favor a more monarchical or dictatorial rule, emphasizing decisive action and the identification of enemies. The article warns that this expansive view of executive power threatens the separation of powers and could lead to dictatorial government.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated a willingness to lower tariffs on China, citing the current high levies as a hindrance to trade between the two countries. Trump noted that the tariffs, which have reached as high as 145%, have led to a significant reduction in business activity between the U.S. and China. He acknowledged recent economic challenges in China and emphasized that any future trade deal must be fair. Trump also praised some recent statements from China as "positive," suggesting a potential for improved relations.</p>
