        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by the National Audit Office (NAO) has revealed that two UK government insulation schemes were severely mismanaged, leaving tens of thousands of homes in need of repair. The watchdog found that 98% of homes with external wall insulation installed under the ECO4 and Great British Insulation Scheme have issues that could lead to damp and mould. The report cited an under-skilled workforce and corner-cutting by businesses as key failures. The government has acknowledged the systemic failings and pledged that all affected homes will be repaired at no cost to the consumers.</p>

          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, annual growth in average earnings in the UK slowed slightly to 4.7% in the three months to August, down from 4.8%. During the same period, the national unemployment rate experienced a marginal rise from 4.7% to 4.8%, with the increase primarily driven by younger individuals. While private sector earnings growth reached a four-year low, it remained ahead of inflation, and public sector wage growth was notably higher. This data suggests a relatively stable but softening labor market, which could lead to easing cost pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google plans to invest $15 billion over the next five years to establish a major artificial intelligence and data center hub in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. According to Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, this will be the company's largest AI hub outside of the United States, featuring a 1-gigawatt project. This significant investment reflects the surging global demand for cloud services and AI infrastructure, driven by the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence applications. The move is part of Google's broader strategy to expand its global data center capacity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented new tariffs on imported timber and furniture, which officially went into force on Tuesday. The duties include a 10% levy on softwood lumber and a 25% tariff on certain upholstered furniture and kitchen cabinets, with some rates set to increase further next year. Canada, the primary lumber supplier to the U.S., is expected to be hit particularly hard, alongside major furniture exporters like Vietnam, Mexico, and China. The White House stated the tariffs are intended to protect national security and boost domestic industries, though experts warn it will likely increase construction costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former student of the Switzer Learning Center in Torrance, California, was arrested after allegedly stabbing three staff members and planting two pipe bombs on campus. The attack occurred Monday morning, resulting in two victims being hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, while a third was treated at the scene. After being taken into custody, the suspect informed police about the location of two incendiary devices, which were later located and safely neutralized by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Bomb Squad.

          <p>China's Commerce Ministry has imposed sanctions on five U.S.-based subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, causing the company's shares to drop over 8%. Beijing accused the units of assisting the U.S. government in its investigations into China's maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding industries. The sanctions, which are effective immediately, prohibit Chinese individuals and organizations from conducting business with the named entities. This action marks an escalation in trade tensions, following Washington's decision to impose steep fees on Chinese ships at American ports and Beijing's subsequent retaliation with similar charges.

          <p>A 16-year-old from Inverclyde, Scotland, is campaigning for CPR to be taught in all Scottish schools after losing both of his parents to heart conditions. Cameron McGerr believes he might have been able to help save his father, who died from a cardiac arrest, if he had been trained in the life-saving skill. After successfully persuading his own school to introduce CPR lessons, he is now taking his 'Pulse of Life' campaign to the Scottish Parliament. Health charities support the initiative, noting that Scotland's low out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rate of one in ten could be improved if more people were equipped with CPR knowledge.</p>

Only seven English players classified as traditional strikers have appeared in the Premier League this season, highlighting a potential vulnerability in the squad's depth. England Under-21s manager Lee Carsley also noted the need for more orthodox number nines, suggesting a tactical shift in player development may be contributing to the scarcity of this type of player.</p>

          <p>European politicians are increasingly grappling with a chaotic and unpredictable global landscape, which some officials are likening to the 'three-body problem' from Chinese science fiction. The continent faces simultaneous challenges from a disruptive United States, a China that is weaponizing its control over critical minerals, and an aggressive Russia waging war on its borders. This complex geopolitical dynamic creates an unstable environment where traditional alliances and economic strategies are being tested. The analogy suggests that the current global situation may not have a simple solution, forcing Europe to focus on survival and adaptation rather than control.</p>

          <p>A woman who suffered a traumatic brain injury after a fall has found a new way to communicate by learning British Sign Language (BSL). Tina, 59, was left with significant speech difficulties after being in a coma for six weeks in 2018. She says that learning BSL has helped her express words she cannot speak and has boosted her confidence. The journey was featured in a BBC series where deaf actress Rose Ayling-Ellis taught BSL to older residents at a retirement village, demonstrating that sign language can be a powerful communication tool for people beyond the deaf community.</p>

          <p>Two Venezuelan activists living in exile in Bogota, Colombia, were shot and injured in what authorities suspect was a targeted attack. Yendri Velasquez, an LGBTQ+ and human rights activist, and Luis Peche, a political analyst, were fired upon by two unidentified gunmen as they were leaving a building. Both men, who fled Venezuela last year citing political persecution by the Maduro regime, are reported to be in stable condition. Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado condemned the attack, calling for a thorough and transparent investigation by the Colombian government.</p>

The ministry confirmed that communication has been maintained within the framework of a bilateral consultation mechanism established earlier this year.

The talks occurred amid renewed friction, including China's expansion of rare earth export controls and Washington's implementation of new port fees targeting Chinese vessels.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts of a 1.9% increase. Despite the strong performance, which was a slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion, the country's central bank warned that growth is likely to moderate in 2026. The manufacturing sector was a primary drag on growth, while the construction and services sectors also softened. In light of the outlook, the Monetary Authority of Singapore maintained its current policy settings, projecting that GDP growth will slow to a near-trend pace as global economic activity normalizes.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed legislation that would have banned the sale of many consumer products containing PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals." The bill aimed to phase out these synthetic chemicals, which have potential links to cancer, in items like nonstick cookware, children's products, and dental floss by 2030. In his veto statement, Newsom expressed concern about the impact on the availability of affordable cooking products, despite acknowledging the bill's good intentions. The move was a disappointment to environmental and health advocates but was praised by industry groups who had opposed the legislation.</p>

          <p>Newly released police records indicate that the gunman who attacked a Dallas immigration facility, killing two detainees, suffered from paranoia and had become increasingly isolated. According to his parents, 29-year-old Joshua Jahn believed he had "radiation sickness" and was "allergic to plastic," leading him to wear cotton gloves constantly. Jahn, who was unemployed and spent most of his time playing computer games, had recently purchased a rifle and practiced shooting a month before the attack. While federal authorities previously noted he left anti-ICE writings, the new records provide a deeper look into his disturbed mental state.</p>
