          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans to significantly increase France's defense budget, citing unprecedented threats to freedom and peace in Europe. Speaking before Bastille Day, Macron stated the annual defense spending will reach €64 billion by 2027, a target originally set for 2030 and double the amount from when he took office. He attributed the need for a more powerful and "feared" France to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and growing global uncertainty. The accelerated funding aims to bolster France's military capabilities in a rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 12-meter aircraft has crashed and caught fire at London Southend Airport, leading to the cancellation of all scheduled Sunday flights. Eyewitnesses described seeing the plane bank heavily shortly after takeoff before it inverted and hit the ground, resulting in a "huge fireball." Emergency services, including police and fire crews, are at the scene of the "serious incident." While there is no immediate information on casualties, authorities have asked the public to avoid the area as the investigation and response efforts are ongoing.</p>

          <p>A rapidly expanding wildfire near the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed dozens of structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and a water treatment facility. The Dragon Bravo Fire grew quickly due to high winds, and a resulting chlorine gas leak from the damaged facility forced firefighters to evacuate, hampering containment efforts. In parallel, the White Sage Fire has forced hundreds to evacuate in the Kaibab National Forest. Meanwhile, smoke from severe Canadian wildfires is causing unhealthy air quality across the Upper Midwest, affecting states like Minnesota and North Dakota.</p>

          <p>A child has died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles, according to BBC sources. The hospital has seen a surge in seriously ill children with the virus, treating 17 cases since June, and warned of rising infections due to low MMR vaccination rates. Health officials have expressed serious concern, noting measles is a highly contagious and dangerous disease, especially for infants and those with weakened immune systems. The UK Health Security Agency is urging parents to ensure their children are vaccinated, as uptake in the region remains below the 95% target recommended by the WHO.</p>

His presidency from 2015 to 2023 was met with mixed results, facing significant economic decline and widespread insecurity despite his promises to tackle corruption and the Boko Haram insurgency.

Graham described the measure as a "sledgehammer" to compel Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, noting that the president's patience with Russia is wearing thin.

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," has become a prominent and combative defender of the administration's immigration policies. During a recent speech, he aggressively confronted a heckler, and in a later interview, he walked back previous comments that seemed to endorse racial profiling by ICE agents. Homan clarified that physical description cannot be the "sole factor" for detaining someone, but he also admitted that "collateral arrests" of U.S. citizens have occurred during immigration raids. His heightened media presence comes as the White House pushes its mass deportation program.</p>

          <p>A violent attack by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank has resulted in the deaths of two young Palestinian men, one of whom was a 20-year-old U.S. citizen. Sayfollah Musallet, from Florida, was reportedly beaten to death, and Mohammed al-Shalabi, 23, was shot during the confrontation near the town of al-Mazra'a al-Sharqiya. The incident has heightened tensions in the region, where settler violence has surged since last October. The U.S. State Department is aware of the death of the American citizen, and the families are demanding a full investigation and accountability for the killings.</p>

          <p>A Goodyear, Arizona, resident is in a dispute with his homeowners association (HOA) for repeatedly being fined for placing a cooler of free bottled water outside his home for passersby. David Martin says he is trying to help people stay hydrated in triple-digit heat, but the Canyon Trails HOA has issued multiple $100 fines, arguing its rules prohibit the cooler. The conflict has escalated, with residents voting to recall board members, a result the HOA then voided. Martin is now preparing for a legal battle over what he calls a ridiculous and dangerous policy.</p>

          <p>Iran's state-affiliated Fars news agency has reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained minor leg injuries during an Israeli strike on a secret underground facility in Tehran last month. The report, which has not been independently verified, claims that six bombs targeted the facility on June 16 while Pezeshkian was in a high-level security meeting. The strikes allegedly blocked all exits, but the president and others escaped through an emergency shaft. This report follows Pezeshkian's recent accusation that Israel tried to assassinate him, a claim Israel has denied.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will delay imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, which were set to begin Monday, in an effort to reach a trade agreement with the Trump administration. The move came after President Trump threatened to implement new 30% tariffs on EU products by August 1. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the suspension of EU countermeasures provides a window for negotiation until that deadline. The ongoing trade dispute creates significant uncertainty for the €1.7 trillion EU-U.S. trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of government data reveals a significant disconnect between the Trump administration's rhetoric about deporting dangerous criminals and the reality of who is being detained by ICE. While the president has pledged to remove "the worst of the worst," the latest statistics show that the majority of ICE detainees—over 71%—have no criminal convictions. Of those with convictions, a small fraction have committed high-level violent crimes. Immigration policy experts argue this disparity shows that enforcement is overwhelmingly targeting people without criminal histories, contrary to the administration's public justification for its aggressive deportation agenda.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has clarified that President Trump's intention is to "remake" the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), rather than eliminate it entirely. Speaking amidst criticism of the federal response to the deadly Texas floods, Noem defended the administration, calling the response the "best" in years and dismissing reports of unanswered calls to FEMA as "fake news." Her comments appear to soften previous statements from both herself and the president about phasing out the agency, shifting the focus to redeploying it in a "new way" to better support states during disasters.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week, a meeting that comes as the administration signals a new strategy to arm Ukraine. The plan involves selling U.S.-made weapons to NATO allies, who can then transfer their existing, compatible equipment to Ukraine more quickly. This approach is part of what Senator Lindsey Graham calls a "turning point" in the U.S. stance on the war, combining military support with the threat of severe economic sanctions against Russia and its backers. The meeting underscores a renewed, unified effort to counter Russian aggression.</p>

The IDF expressed regret for any harm to civilians and said the incident is under review.
