          <p>China is constructing a massive 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet, dubbed a "project of the century" due to extreme engineering challenges and cost. The line will traverse treacherous terrain, including mountain ranges and permafrost, at an average altitude over 4,500 meters. With an estimated investment of up to 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), it is set to be one of China's most expensive rail projects, aiming to enhance connectivity and strategic presence in the remote regions.</p>

          <p>Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has announced that an "attempt to seize power illegally and by force" is underway in the country. The warning follows weeks of youth-led "Gen-Z" protests against police brutality and shortages of power and water, which have escalated into broader calls for political change. A faction of soldiers has reportedly joined the demonstrators, increasing instability and clashing with gendarmes in the capital, Antananarivo, as the government insists it remains in control of national affairs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed doubling tariffs to 50% on steel imports that exceed a newly reduced quota, a move aimed at protecting its domestic industry from global overproduction. This measure is seen by some as a protectionist step similar to US policies, while the EU frames it as a WTO-compliant system that still allows for fair tariff-free imports. The decision is also interpreted as a strategic maneuver to gain trade concessions from the United States and encourage a renewed dialogue on tackling global steel overcapacity.

          <p>The European Union is gradually implementing its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces passport stamping, requires travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, upon their first entry. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, concerns have been raised about potential delays and queues during the initial registration phase at ports, airports, and train terminals.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to secure a place in the upcoming men's World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to "put right" the team's failure to qualify for the 2022 tournament. He specifically referenced the painful 3-1 play-off defeat to Ukraine, which ended their hopes for a spot in Qatar. Clarke, who has successfully led Scotland to two consecutive European Championships, is now focused on overcoming this lingering disappointment and ending a 28-year absence from the World Cup finals.</p>

After USC's top two running backs left the game with injuries, Miller, a redshirt freshman, stepped up and rushed for 148 yards and a touchdown. His performance was instrumental in the win, which boosts USC's season prospects and challenges the perception that the team lacks the physicality to compete with top Big Ten opponents.</p>

          <p>China has sharply criticized the United States for employing "double standards" after President Trump announced new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and export controls on critical software. Beijing has vowed to take corresponding measures to protect its interests if the US proceeds. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce defended its own recently announced export limits on rare earth minerals, calling them necessary for national security amid global instability, while assuring that the impact on global supply chains would be extremely limited.

          <p>Alison Davis has been found not guilty of murdering her husband, Kevin Davis, who was found with fatal head injuries at the bottom of their home's staircase in 2023. Prosecutors argued that the multiple skull fractures were consistent with a beating and that Alison's behavior was suspicious, but they never found a murder weapon. The defense successfully countered that Kevin, who was intoxicated, suffered a single, catastrophic impact by hitting his head on the banister post during an accidental fall. After 17 months in jail, Alison Davis was freed following the jury's verdict.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the challenges the Los Angeles Dodgers will face against the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series. The Brewers, despite a significantly smaller payroll, have built a formidable team based on a "small-ball" offensive approach, disciplined pitching, and strategic management. Key strengths include a deep pitching staff anchored by ace Freddy Peralta, a relentless offense that excels at getting on base and manufacturing runs, and the impactful relief work of rookie flamethrower Jacob Misiorowski, who previously dominated the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>Austin Beutner, a former Los Angeles Unified School District superintendent and investment banker, is planning to challenge Mayor Karen Bass in the 2026 mayoral election. Beutner is heavily criticizing Bass's administration for what he calls a "failure of leadership," particularly regarding the city's response to the devastating Palisades fire, crime, and housing costs. His entry into the race would make him the first serious challenger to Bass, potentially setting the stage for a competitive election as he leverages his diverse background in finance and local government.</p>
