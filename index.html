          <p>A significant Russian attack on Kyiv resulted in multiple fatalities and injuries, marking one of the deadliest assaults on the Ukrainian capital in recent times. The attack involved a barrage of missiles and drones, severely damaging residential buildings and prompting emergency rescue operations. This event occurred amidst rising tensions between Ukraine and the U.S., with the Trump administration pressing for Ukraine to cede territory to Russia for a potential peace agreement. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has announced he will cut short his diplomatic trip to South Africa and return to Kyiv because of the strikes. Optimism is low due to the escalating conflict and political pressures.</p>

          <p>Democrats are divided over how to respond to President Trump's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant sent to a mega prison in El Salvador despite a court order preventing his deportation. Some Democrats advocate for highlighting this lawless cruelty, while others fear it plays into Trump's strengths on immigration. The debate centers on whether taking a high-profile stand on due process for undocumented immigrants will benefit Trump politically by shifting focus away from his unpopular economic policies. Some worry it could give voters the impression that Democrats prioritize the rights of undocumented immigrants over the concerns of American citizens.</p>

          <p>With the Real ID deadline fast approaching, many Americans are urged to apply for one to avoid potential travel disruptions. The Real ID Act, intended to improve security, establishes a nationwide standard for identification. Despite multiple extensions, many states remain below full compliance. The TSA will accept alternative forms of identification, such as a U.S. passport, but travelers without a Real ID or other acceptable ID may face delays. Some DMV offices are extending hours to accommodate Real ID applications.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that economic nostalgia, exemplified by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and the Trump-era tariffs, leads to terrible policies. Both protectionist episodes emerged from a longing for a romanticized past and fear of economic change. The author contends that attempting to recreate a past era through trade barriers ultimately undermines the economy and makes the transition to a changing world more difficult. The author points out that the protectionist tariffs have hurt the farmers and manufacturers they were supposed to help.</p>
