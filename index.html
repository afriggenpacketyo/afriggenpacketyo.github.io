          <h2>Asian Markets Plunge Amid Tariff Concerns and Global Trade War Fears</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant downturn, mirroring the decline in U.S. stock futures, as investors reacted to escalating tariff tensions initiated by the Trump administration. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell nearly 8%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and South Korea's Kospi also saw substantial losses. These market movements reflect growing concerns about the potential economic repercussions of a global trade war, particularly following President Trump's imposition of tariffs on U.S. imports and retaliatory measures from China. The situation is described by analysts as a 'game of chicken,' with the risk of a severe global trade war looming over financial markets. (not investment advice) <br/><i></p>

          <p>A severe weather system brought tornadoes and flash flooding to parts of the South and Midwest, resulting in at least 18 fatalities and widespread destruction across 10 states.

The extreme flooding has disrupted interstate commerce, with potential shipping and supply chain delays anticipated due to the impact on major cargo hubs in Louisville and Memphis. The situation is further complicated by staffing shortages within the National Weather Service following previous job cuts. </p>
