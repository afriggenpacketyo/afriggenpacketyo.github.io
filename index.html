        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Erik Menendez was denied parole 36 years after he and his brother murdered their parents. The parole board's decision was primarily based on his behavior in prison, including possession of illegal cellphones and other rule violations, which they found demonstrated he still poses an unreasonable risk to public safety. The board acknowledged the claims of abuse Menendez suffered but stated his actions in prison, not the original crime, were the key factor in the denial. He will be eligible for another parole hearing in three years, while his brother Lyle's hearing is scheduled to take place the following day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.1% in July, slightly higher than economists' expectations but down from the previous month. The slowdown was partly attributed to easing rice prices, which had previously skyrocketed. Despite this being the 40th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, the central bank has been slow to raise interest rates, drawing criticism for potentially falling behind the curve in combating inflation. This data arrives as Japan's economy shows modest growth but faces challenges from declining exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration and Florida to cease operations at the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigrant detention center in the Everglades, citing environmental concerns. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction that blocks the transfer of new detainees and halts further construction, requiring the removal of temporary structures within 60 days. The judge found that officials violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to conduct necessary reviews, risking irreparable harm to the sensitive ecosystem. Environmental groups praised the decision as a significant victory for the protection of the Everglades.</p>

The address comes amid significant political pressure on the Fed from the Trump administration, which has repeatedly called for lower rates and criticized the central bank's policies. Powell is expected to discuss the economic outlook and the Fed's long-term policy framework, balancing concerns over inflation with recent signs of a cooling labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Facebook has removed a large Italian group named "Mia Moglie" (My Wife) where tens of thousands of members shared intimate and non-consensual photos of women, often accompanied by sexually explicit and violent comments. The discovery of the group, which had around 32,000 members, has sparked widespread outrage in Italy over the objectification of women and what some critics have called "virtual sexual assault." The incident has led to numerous police reports and highlighted ongoing concerns about the spread of abusive content on social media platforms, drawing parallels to other cases of technology-facilitated abuse in Europe.</p>

          <p>A lawyer for the anonymous message board 4chan has stated that the company will not pay a proposed fine from Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, for failing to comply with the Online Safety Act. The US-based company argues that the UK law creates no legal obligations in the United States and that American courts will not enforce foreign censorship codes or penal fines. The stance sets up a significant international clash over internet regulation, as Ofcom may resort to ordering UK internet service providers to block access to the site if it cannot enforce its penalties directly.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidance urging baby food manufacturers to reduce sugar and salt levels in their products. The guidelines also call for companies to stop promoting snack foods for babies under one year of age and to restrict marketing claims that suggest unproven health benefits. This move follows a BBC investigation that found some popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. While the guidelines are currently voluntary, the government has indicated it will consider alternative measures if businesses fail to comply within 18 months.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart's U.S. division, expressed his bewilderment at the company's stock dropping over 4% despite what he described as an exceptionally strong quarterly performance. The retail giant raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, grew its top line, and expanded margins, which Simon believes should have been very well-received by the market. He suggested investors may have overreacted to a one-time expense that caused an earnings miss, while overlooking the fundamental strengths of the business, including its ability to attract shoppers and manage tariff impacts.

          <p>A global arms race for hypersonic weapons, which can travel at over five times the speed of sound and maneuver in flight, is intensifying.

These advanced missiles pose a significant challenge to existing defense systems because they are difficult to detect and intercept. The U.S. and UK are now increasing investment to develop their own hypersonic capabilities and countermeasures to close the strategic gap.</p>

His impressive performance, which included a brilliant swiveling goal and creating several chances, highlighted his value to the team and puts pressure on the manager ahead of the second leg in Bucharest.</p>
