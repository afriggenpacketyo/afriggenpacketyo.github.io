          <p>At 45, Venus Williams is set to become the oldest singles player to compete in the U.S. Open in over four decades, having received a wild card invitation for her 25th appearance. Despite a current WTA singles ranking of 654th due to recent injuries, the seven-time Grand Slam champion aims to reclaim the title she has won twice before. This milestone follows her recent victory in the DC Open, where she became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004. Her participation highlights the longevity seen in professional tennis, where many athletes continue to compete at elite levels well into their 30s and 40s.</p>

          <p>Audition records from the late singer Dame Vera Lynn, recorded 90 years ago, are being released for the first time by Decca. The three silver aluminum discs were discovered by her daughter among a collection of records donated to the British Library's Sound Archive. Known as the 'Forces' Sweetheart' for her uplifting songs during World War Two, Dame Vera's earliest recordings provide a new glimpse into the start of her celebrated career. The release will include a single to mark the 80th anniversary of VJ Day, followed by a new album titled 'Hidden Treasures' featuring other rare tracks from the discovered collection.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old Guatemalan national, Wilmer Castillo Garcia, was released without bail after being accused of selling THC-laced gummies that led to the hospitalization of twelve middle school students in New York. The case has drawn criticism from the Suffolk County District Attorney, who cited it as an example of flaws in New York's bail reform laws, as the charges are considered non-bail-eligible. Castillo Garcia, who pleaded not guilty, also faces separate charges for allegedly selling cocaine and marijuana to an undercover officer. His defense attorney stated that his client is not a flight risk and that there was no intent to harm anyone.</p>

An FDNY hazmat unit was dispatched to investigate the substance, which was found on the ninth floor of 26 Federal Plaza. Mayor Eric Adams confirmed that he was briefed on the situation and reassured the public that there were no known injuries at the time. The incident is currently under investigation, and officials have advised the public to avoid the area while federal partners conduct tests on the powder to determine its nature and any potential threat.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program marks its 90th anniversary, concerns over its long-term financial stability are growing, with its trust funds projected to be depleted by 2034. This could lead to a significant benefit cut of up to 23% for the nearly 70 million Americans who rely on the program unless legislative action is taken. Proposed solutions to the funding shortfall include raising the cap on income subject to payroll taxes or increasing the full retirement age. The program's challenges have led to declining public confidence, even as a majority of Americans consider it one of the government's most important services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a plan for state lawmakers to redraw congressional maps in a direct response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas. The proposal, which would require voter approval in a special election, aims to create more Democrat-favorable districts to counter potential Republican gains in the U.S. House. Newsom stated that this defensive measure is necessary to "meet fire with fire" against what he describes as partisan gerrymandering initiated at Donald Trump's request. The new map would only take effect if a Republican state moves forward with a similar partisan plan, and it would remain in place through the 2030 elections.</p>

Commissioners cited significant concerns about the environmental impact of sonic booms on residents, wildlife, and property, as well as impacts on public access and natural resources. A key point of contention is whether the launches, many of which deploy Starlink satellites, serve primarily commercial purposes or federal government interests. The commission's objection does not halt SpaceX's activities, as the company may be able to proceed without state permits if the launches are classified as federal activities.</p>

          <p>Ahead of their meeting in Alaska, an analysis of past encounters between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin reveals a relationship characterized by mutual public respect but strategic maneuvering. Their previous meetings, from their first at the 2017 G20 summit to later talks in Helsinki, have often produced memorable moments and significant political controversy. Former officials note Putin's tendency to dominate conversations with lengthy monologues and calculated gestures, contrasting with Trump's more freewheeling and relationship-focused approach. Experts suggest Putin will likely use his intelligence background to manipulate the discussions, while Trump relies on his personal rapport to negotiate, creating an unpredictable dynamic for the high-stakes talks.</p>

          <p>Ford is undertaking a significant overhaul of its manufacturing process to compete with the influx of affordable, high-tech electric vehicles from China, which CEO Jim Farley views as an existential threat.

This strategic shift acknowledges that Ford's current method of adapting gas-powered models for EVs is too expensive and inefficient. The move is a critical attempt to catch up with Chinese competitors who benefit from government subsidies, advanced battery technology, and lower labor costs.</p>

This trend, known as a "consumption upgrade," is seen in the growing demand for products like Tesla vehicles and imported goods.

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, which formed in the eastern Atlantic, is expected to strengthen and become the season's first hurricane by Friday. The storm is currently moving westward and is projected to become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands late in the week. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain. Tropical storm watches have been issued for the northern Leeward Islands, which are likely to be affected over the weekend. The storm has already caused significant flooding and at least eight fatalities in the Cabo Verde islands off the coast of Africa.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway has disclosed a new stake in the beleaguered insurer UnitedHealth, acquiring over 5 million shares worth approximately $1.6 billion. The investment is notable given UnitedHealth's recent struggles, including a nearly 50% stock decline in 2025 and a Justice Department investigation into its billing practices. The move aligns with Warren Buffett's history of value investing in troubled companies. Following the disclosure, UnitedHealth's stock rose 6% in extended trading. The purchase was one of several new positions for Berkshire, which also invested in Nucor, Lamar Advertising, and homebuilders Lennar and DR Horton. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Data software company Palantir has experienced a surge of over 1,700% since its 2020 public debut, recently surpassing a $430 billion market valuation. This astronomical growth is largely fueled by significant U.S. government contracts, particularly with the military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. The company's stock has also been bolstered by strong interest from retail investors, who poured $1.2 billion into the stock last month. Despite its high valuation, which dwarfs that of tech giants with far greater revenues, analysts have raised some concerns about the slower growth of its international commercial revenues.

          <p>A year after the World Health Organization declared mpox a global health emergency, the virus continues to spread rapidly in Africa, with outbreaks now present in 24 countries. A new, more transmissible strain has emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is spreading to neighboring nations, leading to what experts believe is a severe undercount of cases. Critics argue the global response has been dangerously inadequate, citing stalled vaccine distribution and funding cuts to foreign aid. Public health specialists express frustration that the virus remains uncontrolled, warning that it could become further entrenched in the human population and evolve.</p>

The company projects that higher duties will cost it $160 million, leading to a full-year earnings forecast below analyst expectations. The financial headwinds are partly attributed to the suspension of the de minimis rule, which had allowed items valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. Despite the profit warning, Tapestry still expects low single-digit revenue growth and noted that underlying sales trends have remained strong. (not investment advice)</p>

They argued that true public safety is achieved through long-term community collaboration, not through fear-based governance or a military presence. The leaders also pointed out that the move comes while violent crime is at a 30-year low and criticized Congress for withholding funds for programs that address the root causes of crime.</p>
