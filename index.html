        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, missing market expectations primarily due to a 94% plunge in its chip division's profits. The South Korean tech giant has been struggling with increased competition and inventory adjustments in its memory chip business, falling behind rivals in key areas like high-bandwidth memory for AI. Despite the downturn in semiconductors, the company's mobile division saw an uptick in sales and profit, driven by robust sales of its Galaxy S25 and A-series smartphones. Future prospects may be boosted by a major chip supply deal with Tesla.</p>

          <p>A significant diplomatic divide is emerging between the United States and its key allies, including the UK, France, and Canada, over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While these allied nations are moving towards recognizing a Palestinian state to rekindle a two-state solution, the Trump administration has boycotted these discussions, labeling them an anti-Israel "publicity stunt." This article highlights a growing perception among allies that the US lacks a coherent long-term plan for the governance and future of Gaza beyond the current conflict, creating a strategic vacuum that European and Arab nations are now trying to fill.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, prompting extensive tsunami warnings across the Pacific, including for Hawaii, Japan, and the U.S. West Coast. The powerful temblor caused some flooding and damage in the sparsely populated region near its epicenter. However, the tsunami's impact was less severe than initially feared in more distant, populated areas, with waves being relatively small and causing only minor flooding in places like Hawaii. Emergency officials remained on high alert as the series of waves continued for hours.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the MLB trade deadline, the Philadelphia Phillies executed a major move by acquiring hard-throwing closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins in exchange for two top prospects. The deal was part of a busy day of trades that saw several contenders strengthen their bullpens for the playoff push. In other notable moves, the New York Mets landed submarine-style pitcher Tyler Rogers and reliever Ryan Helsley in separate deals, while the Cincinnati Reds acquired Gold Glove third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the Pittsburgh Pirates.</p>

As part of the agreement, President Trump announced that South Korea would provide a $350 billion fund for investments in the U.S. However, the two nations appear to have different interpretations of the fund, with Washington emphasizing U.S. control and profits, while Seoul views it as a vehicle to support its own companies' entry into the American market.

          <p>South Korea has successfully negotiated a trade deal with the U.S., securing a 15% tariff rate and preventing steeper levies. A significant victory for Seoul was protecting its highly sensitive agricultural markets, as it did not have to further open its rice and beef industries to American imports. The agreement also includes a $350 billion investment from South Korea into the U.S., with $150 billion specifically designated for shipbuilding cooperation, leveraging one of South Korea's industrial strengths to address U.S. security and manufacturing concerns.

          <p>Shares of chip designer Arm Holdings fell after the company's first-quarter earnings report revealed that growth from smartphone royalties was weaker than expected. While overall financial results were largely in line with forecasts, the disappointing performance in its core market has raised concerns. In response, the company signaled a strategic pivot, stating it is exploring a move beyond basic designs to potentially develop its own chiplets or full semiconductor solutions, a move that could put it in direct competition with its current customers.

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has launched an aggressive recruitment campaign to hire thousands of new personnel, including deportation officers and lawyers, offering signing bonuses of up to $50,000. The hiring spree, promoted with patriotic slogans like "DEFEND THE HOMELAND," is funded by a recent congressional appropriation of over $76 billion to the agency. The expansion aims to support the Trump administration's goal of dramatically increasing immigration enforcement and annual deportations, raising concerns among critics about the implications of such rapid growth.</p>

          <p>Acting on a request from President Trump, Texas Republicans are moving forward with a controversial plan to redraw the state's congressional district maps mid-decade, five years ahead of the usual schedule. The proposed new map is designed to heavily favor the GOP, potentially giving the party 30 of the state's 38 House seats and solidifying its majority ahead of the 2026 elections. This has sparked fierce opposition and threats of retaliatory gerrymandering from Democrats in other states, fueling concerns about escalating partisan warfare over electoral maps.</p>

The recovery operation was prolonged and challenging due to the dangerous, fast-moving water conditions, which had to subside before teams could safely retrieve her body.</p>

The recall affects specific lot codes of the energy drink that were shipped to retailers in six states, and consumers are being advised to dispose of the affected product.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly limited tsunami damage across the Pacific. Scientists explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into a vast, open stretch of the ocean between Alaska and Hawaii, a sparsely populated corridor. This directionality allowed much of the energy to dissipate over the long distance, meaning that by the time the waves reached the U.S. West Coast and other populated areas, their size and power were significantly diminished.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the Federal Reserve is reluctant to cut interest rates because of a deeply mixed and uncertain economic landscape. He highlights the conflicting signals facing policymakers: a strong labor market and healthy GDP growth suggest holding steady, while persistently high housing costs and signs of weakness at some major consumer companies could justify a cut. This ambiguity, further clouded by the unknown impact of new tariffs, has led the Fed to adopt a cautious, wait-and-see approach before making any moves. (not investment advice)</p>
