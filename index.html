          <p>Actor Jason Bateman reflected on his struggles after achieving fame as a child star, explaining that a lack of a normal youth led to a period of intense partying in his 20s that nearly derailed his career. He recalled feeling that the industry had moved on without him, leading to deep anxiety and a consideration of leaving Hollywood entirely. The turning point came with his role in "Arrested Development," which revitalized his career and led to acclaimed dramatic roles in shows like "Ozark." Bateman now looks back on his journey as a cautionary tale, expressing that while he wouldn't change his past, he wouldn't want his own children to experience similar pressures.</p>

          <p>A massive, airship-like flying wind turbine, the S1500, successfully completed a test flight in China's Xinjiang region, generating one megawatt of power. Developed by Beijing-based startup Sawes Energy Technology, the turbine is the size of a basketball court and floats on helium to capture stronger, more consistent winds at higher altitudes. The company achieved all its goals during the desert trial, which included assembly, launch, and retrieval in challenging conditions. With mass production planned for 2026, this test marks a significant step toward deploying a new form of renewable energy technology.</p>

          <h2>Persistent Inflation and Market Dynamics Keep Mortgage Rates High Despite Easing Borrowing Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve lowering its benchmark rate, 30-year fixed mortgage rates are climbing again, remaining stubbornly above 6%. This divergence is because mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury bond yield rather than the Fed's rate. The gap, or spread, between the 10-year yield and mortgage rates is currently wider than historical norms. Economists attribute this to sticky inflation, which erodes the value of bond payments, and the Fed's reduced purchasing of mortgage-backed securities, which has decreased demand and driven up yields to attract private investors.</p>

          <p>Subscribers to YouTube TV are at risk of losing access to NBCUniversal channels, including popular programming like "Sunday Night Football," as the two companies face a carriage dispute. The current agreement is set to expire on September 30, and if a new deal is not reached, it could lead to a network blackout. NBCUniversal claims YouTube TV is demanding preferential rates, while YouTube TV accuses NBCUniversal of charging more than it does for its own Peacock streaming service. This conflict highlights the growing tensions between content creators and the powerful streaming platforms that distribute their programming.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve's Preferred Inflation Metric Shows Slight Acceleration in August</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 08:55:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's favored measure of inflation, rose to 2.7% year-over-year in August, a slight increase from the previous month. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy costs, remained steady at 2.9%, indicating that underlying price pressures persist above the central bank's 2% target.

The persistent inflation complicates the Fed's future decisions, especially amidst criticism from President Trump for not cutting rates more aggressively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales, has admitted to accepting bribes in exchange for making pro-Russian statements while he was a member of the European Parliament. The 52-year-old pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery for agreeing to receive money from a Ukrainian politician to promote a narrative favorable to Russia regarding events in Ukraine. The charges stemmed from an investigation that began after Gill was stopped at Manchester Airport in 2021. His defense acknowledged that a prison sentence is inevitable, with sentencing scheduled for November.</p>

          <p>A recent series of high-profile shootings in the U.S. has revealed a disturbing trend: perpetrators writing messages on their shell casings and firearm magazines. This article examines the phenomenon as a form of performative violence, intended to send a message to specific online communities or the public at large. Experts trace the modern emergence of this trend to the 2019 Christchurch mosque shooter, whose weapon was covered in white supremacist memes. These inscriptions, whether targeted political statements or nihilistic internet jargon, represent a new way for shooters to ensure their motives and ideologies are disseminated after their attacks.</p>

          <p>Congress is considering the Claiming Age Clarity Act, a bipartisan bill designed to make Social Security's retirement benefit language easier for Americans to understand. The proposed changes would rename the "early eligibility age" (62) to "minimum benefit age" and the "full retirement age" (66-67) to "standard benefit age." Similarly, age 70 would become the "maximum benefit age." Proponents argue that this new terminology more accurately reflects the financial consequences of claiming benefits at different times, helping individuals make more informed decisions about their retirement security.</p>

          <p>The bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act, which passed unanimously in a Senate committee, is being viewed as a promising federal approach to the U.S. housing crisis. The bill encourages the development of model zoning codes and provides financial incentives to municipalities that increase their housing supply. Analysts at the Economic Innovation Group suggest this could lay the groundwork for "Right-to-Build Zones," where cities could adopt less restrictive federal zoning rules in specific areas to streamline construction. This strategy aims to bypass local-level opposition that often stifles development, offering a potential breakthrough for housing policy.</p>

The ID will be an app-based system on smartphones, containing residency status, personal details, and a photo. While compulsory for work, it will be optional for students, pensioners, and others not in the workforce, and officials have stressed it will not function as a traditional identity card to be carried daily.</p>

This development contradicts the administration's stated focus on targeting dangerous criminals and indicates a significant broadening of immigration enforcement.

          <p>Global consulting firm Accenture has announced plans to "exit" employees who are unable to be reskilled in artificial intelligence as part of a major strategic shift. CEO Julie Sweet stated that while the company's primary strategy is to upskill its current workforce, it will use a "compression timeline" to lay off staff for whom retraining is not a viable option. This move is part of an $865 million business optimization program designed to pivot the company toward AI-centric services. Despite the cuts, Accenture has significantly increased its number of AI and data professionals and plans to continue hiring in key markets.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has unveiled a new set of industry-specific tariffs, escalating his administration's protectionist trade policies. The measures include a 100% tariff on imported branded pharmaceuticals unless the company is building a factory in the U.S., a 25% tariff on all heavy-duty trucks, and a 50% tariff on kitchen and bathroom cabinets. Trump stated the tariffs are necessary to combat the "flooding" of these products into the U.S. market and to protect domestic manufacturers. The move has drawn concern from business groups and is expected to raise prices for American consumers.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making a false statement to Congress and obstruction of a congressional proceeding. The indictment is the latest development in President Trump's campaign to pursue legal action against his political adversaries, whom he has frequently targeted on social media. The charges appear to relate to Comey's 2020 testimony about the Russia investigation.

          <p>A Goldman Sachs survey of 245 global family offices reveals that the ultra-wealthy prefer investing in the artificial intelligence boom through public equities and ETFs rather than direct investments in private startups. Over 52% of these investment firms reported exposure to AI via public stocks, compared to just 25% investing directly in private AI companies. This preference is partly attributed to more confidence in the valuations of public companies compared to the often-inflated valuations in private markets. The trend indicates a more cautious, mainstream approach to AI investing among the world's wealthiest families. (not investment advice)</p>

Published in 1975, the book was revolutionary for its honest and non-judgmental depiction of teenage sexuality from a young woman's perspective. It portrayed its protagonist, Katherine, taking control of her own sexual narrative, from getting birth control to experiencing her first sexual relationship, without facing dire consequences. For decades, the book served as a rite of passage for young readers and attracted controversy for validating female desire, making it a landmark text in adolescent literature.</p>

          <p>A Texas community is grappling with a tragic and perplexing case where a 17-year-old boy, Benjamin Elliott, fatally stabbed his twin sister, Meghan, in 2021. Immediately after the incident, he called 911, claiming he had just woken from what he thought was a dream. With no apparent motive or history of conflict between the deeply connected twins, his defense is centered on parasomnia, or sleepwalking. A sleep disorder expert who conducted studies on Elliott supports this claim, but prosecutors remain unconvinced and have charged him with murder, leaving a grieving family facing the potential loss of their son after losing their daughter.</p>
