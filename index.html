            <p>A federal judge has indicated that the Trump administration likely acted in contempt of court by defying an order to turn around deportation flights carrying alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. Judge James Boasberg criticized the administration's "willful disobedience of judicial orders," emphasizing the importance of upholding the Constitution. While the Supreme Court ultimately vacated the order, Boasberg maintains that the administration defied it during the three weeks it was in effect. He has given the administration a deadline to explain their actions or face further legal proceedings, potentially including prosecution by an independent attorney.</p>

            <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) has issued a warning that the outlook for global trade has significantly worsened due to the surge in tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. The WTO's report forecasts a 0.2% decline in world merchandise trade volume for 2025, a sharp contrast to the 2.9% growth in 2024. This decline is expected to be particularly severe in North America, with exports predicted to drop by 12.6%. The WTO also cautioned about potential risks, including the implementation of reciprocal tariffs, which could further reduce global trade growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Police are investigating whether the arson attack on the Pennsylvania governor's residence was motivated by the suspect's views on the conflict in Gaza. Cody Balmer, who was already out on bail for a previous assault charge, allegedly targeted Governor Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, due to "perceived injustices to the people of Palestine." Balmer reportedly confessed to the attack and expressed hatred towards Shapiro, and even planned to attack him with a hammer if he were discovered inside the residence. Governor Shapiro condemned the violence and emphasized the need for societal improvement.</p>

            <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data appears to contradict President Trump's assertions regarding the daily revenue generated by his recent tariffs. The agency stated that it has collected over $500 million since April 5 under the new reciprocal tariffs, contributing to more than $21 billion in total tariff revenue since January 20, 2025. This figure contrasts with Trump's repeated claims that the United States is taking in $2 billion per day from tariffs. The agency clarified that even during a recent finance system glitch, the average revenue stream remained uninterrupted. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>California is launching a legal challenge against President Trump's tariffs, alleging that he has overstepped his authority and caused significant harm to the state's economy. Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta argue that the power to impose tariffs rests with Congress, and Trump's use of emergency powers is unlawful. The lawsuit seeks to declare Trump's tariff orders void and prevent their enforcement, citing the negative impact on California families, businesses, and the agricultural sector. California relies heavily on trade with Mexico, Canada, and China, all of whom are impacted by Trump's tariffs.</p>

            <p>Talks to end a strike by bin workers in Birmingham have collapsed, with the Unite union stating negotiations will resume next week but offering to continue talks over Easter. The strike, ongoing for over five weeks, stems from a dispute over pay and the removal of a safety position. The union seeks written guarantees from the council that bin lorry drivers' existing pay levels will be maintained. Council leader John Cotton claims a reasonable offer is on the table, but the union insists promises made in interviews must be put in writing to secure a deal.</p>

            <p>England's Women's Six Nations team will feature nine changes for their upcoming match against Scotland, including a first start for centre Jade Shekells. Former captain Marlie Packer returns to the team at open-side flanker. A victory for England, combined with a loss for France, would secure their seventh consecutive Six Nations title before the home Rugby World Cup in August. Scotland enters the match following a disappointing defeat by Italy, hoping to improve on their narrow victory over Wales.</p>

            <p>Westminster has been embroiled in a contentious debate over gender identity, with politicians struggling to define "woman." The debate has caused political divisions, party splits, and public controversies. A recent Supreme Court ruling may offer some clarity, but the issue remains politically sensitive. The Labour Party, in particular, has faced criticism for its shifting positions on transgender rights and self-identification. The Conservative Party has attempted to exploit the issue, but has also faced controversy over its rhetoric.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk has reportedly been sending unsolicited DMs on Twitter, offering women the chance to have his babies. According to the Wall Street Journal, Musk has made a habit of contacting women, often in right-wing political circles, and making the offer. The report highlights Musk's obsession with falling birth rates and his literal approach to spreading his genes. This has resulted in custody battles, lawsuits over child support, and personal attacks, making him one of the worst fathers in recent history, according to many accounts.</p>

            <p>A Massachusetts detective, Brian Fanion, is under scrutiny after his wife was found dead with a gunshot wound, and peculiar online searches were discovered on his work computer. Eleven days before Amy Fanion's death, Brian searched "gsr testing" and visited websites related to gunshot residue. Other searches included household poisons, prescription overdoses, and Massachusetts divorce laws. Fanion was later found guilty of first-degree murder, with prosecutors arguing the searches indicated he was planning his wife's death. His conviction is currently under appeal.</p>

            <p>The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that the term "woman" in the 2010 Equality Act refers to biological sex, a decision with potential implications for civil rights law. The ruling came in response to challenges brought by For Women Scotland (FWS), concerning the definition of "woman" in Scottish legislation. The court stressed that the definition was solely for the purpose of interpreting the specific part of the legislation in question. The ruling has been met with mixed reactions, with some celebrating it as a victory for women's rights, while others express concern about its potential impact on the trans community.</p>

The decision stems from Ecuador's raid on the Mexican embassy in Quito in April 2024, leading Mexico to recall its diplomats. The raid involved the arrest of former Ecuadorean Vice President Jorge Glas, who had been living in the embassy and was granted diplomatic asylum. The rift has further strained relations between the two countries.</p>
