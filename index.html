          <p>Estonia has requested urgent consultations with fellow NATO members after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets reportedly violated its airspace for 12 minutes over the Gulf of Finland. The Estonian foreign ministry condemned the "brazen" incursion as a clear provocation, leading NATO to intercept the aircraft and criticize Russia's "reckless behaviour." This incident further escalates regional tensions, following similar airspace breaches reported by other NATO members like Poland and Romania since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Estonian officials are now pressing for a robust political and practical response from the alliance, emphasizing the unprecedented duration of the violation and the need for unity. The Russian defense ministry, however, denied any violation, claiming its jets flew over neutral Baltic waters.</p>

Fortunately, no injuries were reported among the staff present inside during the attack. Authorities classify it as a drive-by shooting, indicating a vehicle drove by, fired, and then departed the scene. California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the act as an "attack on our democracy itself" and expressed solidarity with journalists, highlighting the broader implications of violence against media. The Sacramento Police Department has vowed to relentlessly pursue those responsible, labeling it "unacceptable behavior" that will not be tolerated.</p>

The initial deployment will feature robotaxis operating on fixed routes within the Punggol residential district, a newly developed area. This collaboration aims to enhance local residents' daily commutes and advance Singapore's smart mobility vision, according to Pony.ai's CEO James Peng. This venture represents Pony.ai's third international expansion, following recent partnerships in Qatar and ongoing vehicle testing in Dubai, with future plans to launch robotaxi services in Hong Kong after clearing regulatory hurdles. The company views the local Singaporean and broader Southeast Asian markets as holding significant potential for its safe and efficient autonomous technology.</p>

The exhibition featured the island's first locally built anti-ballistic missile system, the Chiang-Kong, designed to intercept enemy ballistic missiles at altitudes up to 70km, enhancing Taiwan's layered missile defense capabilities. Additionally, a cruise missile co-developed with a US defense firm was presented, demonstrating strengthened partnerships aimed at deterring Beijing's escalating military pressure. This biennial event drew over 400 exhibitors from 14 countries, reflecting Taiwan's urgent drive to expand its defense industry amid heightened cross-strait tensions.</p>

The race pits Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger, with Spanberger currently favored in some recent polling. National issues, particularly the Trump administration's federal workforce cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have taken center stage, significantly impacting Virginia's substantial federal employee population. The campaign is also unfolding less than two weeks after the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an event that has heightened fears about political violence and led to increased security measures for the candidates.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) is actively exploring and testing various counter-drone systems to enhance the protection of national security facilities from increasing drone incursions. During the ‘Falcon Peak 25.2’ event at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, acoustic detection systems and interceptor drones, capable of capturing or eliminating hostile drones, were demonstrated. This critical initiative responds to growing threats, including a notable incident in 2024 where a drone swarm infiltrated a Virginia military base for 17 consecutive nights, highlighting existing vulnerabilities. With an estimated 8,000 drones in U.S. airspace and 350 incursions reported across military installations in 2024, the Pentagon aims to develop robust defenses and establish 24-hour counter-drone response teams nationwide to address both nefarious and accidental drone activities.</p>

The couple, aged 80 and 76, who had lived in Afghanistan for almost two decades running a charitable training program, were released through Qatari mediation. While the Taliban stated they had broken Afghan laws, the specific reasons for their detention were never publicly disclosed. Their family expressed immense gratitude and relief, detailing the couple's harrowing conditions and rapidly deteriorating health during their imprisonment, and acknowledging the vital diplomatic efforts by Qatar, the UK government, the US, and the UN in securing their release.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a third US military strike on an alleged drug-trafficking vessel in international waters, resulting in the deaths of three individuals he termed "narcoterrorists." The strike, ordered by Trump, targeted a boat believed to be carrying illicit narcotics in the US Southern Command's area of responsibility, which covers South America and the Caribbean. This action follows two previous strikes that collectively killed 14 people on vessels allegedly from Venezuela, which has condemned the actions as "aggression" and vowed to defend itself. Critics question the legal justification for using lethal military force against suspected drug traffickers in international waters, raising significant concerns about adherence to international human rights and maritime law.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order introducing "Gold Card" visas, offering an expedited path to lawful permanent residency for non-Americans contributing at least $1 million to the Commerce Department. Corporations can sponsor individuals for $2 million, with 80,000 cards planned to replace existing EB-1 and EB-2 categories. This initiative prioritizes financial contribution as a measure of "exceptional value." Concurrently, the administration imposed an additional annual $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, a move that could significantly impact the tech industry. Critics argue this substantial increase may suppress wages and faces legal challenges regarding executive authority to set such fees, while supporters believe it ensures highly skilled workers.

          <p>A 45-year-old Argentinian hiker tragically died after falling approximately 2,000 feet down the Wintun Glacier on California's Mt. Shasta. Matias Augusto Travizano had successfully summited the mountain but veered off the Clear Creek Trail during his descent, finding himself on a steep ice sheet at 13,500 feet. After attempting a controlled slide with a companion, Travizano lost control, collided with a boulder, and subsequently slid down the remainder of the glacier face. This incident marks another fatality on Mt. Shasta, which averages about one death per year, prompting officials to warn climbers about the treacherous conditions, especially during stormy summer weather, and to emphasize the critical importance of having a climbing partner and high-quality GPS.</p>

          <p>The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has voiced significant concern that the decision to drop espionage charges against two men accused of spying for China could leave Parliament vulnerable to foreign interference. Christopher Berry and Christopher Cash, who had denied the allegations under the Official Secrets Act, saw their charges withdrawn by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) due to the "evidential threshold" not being met. Sir Lindsay criticized the two-year delay and the CPS's decision, stating it "leaves the door open to foreign actors trying to spy on the House" and considering private action. The Home Office also expressed disappointment, underscoring the seriousness of the allegations despite the legal outcome, while Beijing has consistently called the claims "malicious slander."</p>

Environmentalists and the UN Secretary-General hail this as a "monumental achievement" and "proof that countries can come together to protect our blue planet," demonstrating successful international cooperation for environmental protection. The treaty is crucial for meeting the global goal of protecting 30% of national and international waters by 2030, a vital step against decades of overfishing, pollution from shipping, and warming oceans exacerbated by climate change.</p>

This development occurred amid concerns that Siebert could be fired for failing to bring a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump allies had referred James for alleged mortgage fraud, but Siebert reportedly expressed doubts about the strength of the evidence. James, who previously won a civil fraud suit against Trump, has consistently dismissed the allegations as "baseless" and politically motivated. Siebert's departure leaves one of the nation's most powerful federal prosecutor's offices without a confirmed leader and highlights ongoing tensions between the executive branch and the justice system regarding politically charged investigations.</p>

This weakening partnership is viewed as potentially dangerous from Japan's perspective, as it creates strategic openings for China to expand its influence in the region.

          <p>A CNBC investigation has uncovered widespread issues of counterfeit and fraudulent products being sold by third-party sellers on Walmart.com, ranging from fake brain supplements to luxury face creams sourced from imposter businesses. Shoppers, who expected authentic goods from a trusted retailer, often received potentially dangerous fakes, with one seller even using the identity of a Chicago pizza parlor. The investigation suggests Walmart eased its seller vetting processes to rapidly expand its marketplace and compete with Amazon, inadvertently leading to a surge in bad actors. While Walmart states a zero-tolerance policy for prohibited items and has recently tightened vetting for health and beauty products, critics argue its platform became a "Wild West" where consumers' trust was eroded, and legal experts note growing liability arguments against marketplaces for harmful products.</p>

          <p>New data reveals Tesla's U.S. market share has fallen to 38%, its lowest level in nearly eight years and the first time dipping below 40% since 2017. This decline is attributed to a perceived lack of new products, CEO Elon Musk's increasing political involvement alienating some consumers, and a talent exodus from the company. While Musk has remained bullish on his robotics and AI aspirations, industry analysts suggest that a car company needs continuous new offerings to maintain its market share. Despite Tesla's specific challenges, the overall EV market continues to grow robustly, with a 24% month-over-month sales leap in July. Other automakers like Hyundai, Honda, Kia, and Toyota are gaining significant ground by offering more robust incentives to consumers ahead of federal tax credits expiring. (not investment advice)</p>

ICE maintains she exhausted all legal remedies and is enforcing US law, but her family pleads for her release due to serious health concerns and her lack of family or home to return to in India, highlighting the humanitarian aspect of the case.</p>

          <p>Jordan Wilmore, a remarkable 7-foot-3 former professional basketball player, has chosen to leave his athletic career behind to pursue his lifelong passion for policing in Kemah, Texas. Despite societal pressure and expectations to continue playing basketball, the 24-year-old felt a profound calling to help other people, stating it's simply "who I am." Wilmore, who played college basketball and professionally overseas, is now likely America's tallest police recruit. Kemah Police Chief Raymond Garivey is actively making accommodations for Wilmore's unique stature, including sourcing a suitable uniform and a patrol cruiser. Garivey lauded Wilmore's dedication to service, emphasizing his commitment to the "thin blue line" and his unwavering desire to make a tangible difference in the community, even expressing he would turn down an NBA offer.</p>

          <p>CDC vaccine advisers have unanimously voted to shift Covid-19 vaccine recommendations towards "shared clinical decision-making," requiring patients to consult a healthcare provider for vaccination, though no prescription is mandated. This change implies an opt-in process, which experts warn could reduce vaccine uptake due to increased confusion and the assumption of universal healthcare access in the US. The committee also controversially recommended amending vaccine information statements to include "at least six new risks and uncertainties," some based on preliminary and refuted scientific findings, a move legal experts question as beyond ACIP's purview. This new guidance, awaiting CDC Director signoff, could lead to a fragmented patchwork of vaccine access across states, depending on provider willingness and state adherence to recommendations, potentially impacting public health efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the US Supreme Court for a second time to intervene in its efforts to terminate deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program. The Justice Department filed an emergency application to lift a federal judge's ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end these protections, which were granted by the Biden administration in 2021 and 2023. This move aligns with Trump's broader agenda to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration, expanding the pool of potential deportees. Critics argue the administration disregards lower court orders, while the TPS program, typically for countries affected by war or disaster, provides crucial protection and work permits to recipients living in the US.</p>

Facing slowing demand in Western markets, many companies view the annual event as a strategic gateway to attract new buyers and expand their international footprint. This significant market shift is driven by Southeast Asia's large and young consumer base, which offers substantial growth potential compared to the perceived saturation of European and American markets. Exporters like Li Wenqi, a manager at an electric scooter and battery manufacturer, explicitly highlight the region as a vital new frontier for their business ambitions amid evolving global economic landscapes, aiming to capitalize on its robust economic development.

          <p>A US federal judge has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, citing the complaint's "decidedly improper and impermissible" language and excessive length. Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page lawsuit, which accused the newspaper of attempting to undermine Trump's 2024 campaign and contained statements lauding his "singular brilliance," was a "megaphone for public relations" rather than a legitimate legal filing. While the judge did not rule on the legal merits, he granted Trump's lawyers 28 days to refile an amended complaint "in a professional and dignified manner." The Times welcomed the quick ruling, asserting the original complaint was a political document intended to stifle independent reporting, underscoring ongoing tensions between Trump and media organizations.</p>

          <p>Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner publicly defended Jimmy Kimmel after the Disney-owned ABC network indefinitely suspended the late-night host from his show, "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" Eisner, who led Disney for over two decades, criticized the suspension as "out-of-control intimidation" that occurred immediately after threats from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr regarding Kimmel's comments on the Charlie Kirk murder suspect. He questioned the absence of leadership in standing up for the First Amendment against such pressures, suggesting that corporate entities are capitulating to "bullies." Eisner, a prominent former executive, emphasized his belief in Kimmel's talent and humor, implying the decision was influenced by political or financial self-interest rather than a commitment to free speech principles.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation imposing an annual $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, a move that could significantly impact the US tech industry, which heavily relies on skilled foreign workers, particularly from India and China. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that "all the big companies" were briefed and "on board" with the new fee, framing it as an incentive to "train Americans" and ensure only "top, top people" enter the country. Critics, however, argue this exorbitant fee creates a disincentive for attracting global talent, potentially reducing US innovation and economic growth, and pushing companies to seek talent elsewhere. Immigration experts also question the executive branch's legal authority to impose such a substantial fee without congressional approval, as visa fees typically cover processing costs, not serve as a deterrent.

Federal law enforcement agencies issued a bulletin tracking "several threats of unknown credibility" against attendees, though it emphasized no verified plot exists.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's repeated threats to revoke broadcast station licenses for perceived bias, alongside FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's similar statements, highlight the federal government's regulatory power over media. This article explains that major networks like ABC obtain over-the-air spectrum licenses from the FCC, which legally requires them to operate in the "public interest, convenience and necessity." While the FCC primarily regulates local stations and is generally barred from preventing the broadcast of specific viewpoints, its broad rules and ability to deny mergers give it significant leverage over media companies, as seen with the recent Jimmy Kimmel suspension. Critics argue that Trump's actions represent an unprecedented political interference, contrasting with traditional FCC concerns like children's programming or obscenity, and raise serious First Amendment questions about media independence.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning songwriter Brett James, renowned for co-writing Carrie Underwood's hit "Jesus, Take the Wheel," tragically died at 57 in a plane crash in North Carolina. James was one of three fatalities aboard a single-engine Cirrus SR22T that went down "under unknown circumstances" in a wooded area near Macon County Airport, after taking off from Nashville. Carrie Underwood expressed profound grief, calling his death "unfathomable" and noting his genuine faith reflected in their songs, which she will now sing with his memory in mind. Fellow artists like Jason Aldean also shared heartbreak, praising James's impact on their careers. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers lauded him as a "songwriting force of nature" with a big heart, while the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash.</p>
