          <p>Meta has reportedly entered into a six-year agreement to spend over $10 billion on Google's cloud services, a significant move as Google competes with rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The deal primarily focuses on artificial intelligence infrastructure, reflecting Meta's substantial investments in developing its Llama family of models and integrating AI across its platforms. This partnership highlights the immense infrastructure demands of leading tech companies, showing that even direct competitors in areas like online advertising must collaborate to access necessary cloud computing power for their strategic goals.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's encouragement, Missouri is poised to become the next Republican-led state to redraw its congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The proposed changes aim to create a 7-1 Republican majority in the state's U.S. House delegation, likely by targeting the district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver in Kansas City. This move is part of a broader, escalating partisan battle over redistricting, with states like Texas and California also pursuing mid-decade map changes to secure political advantages, potentially making smaller state adjustments highly consequential for control of Congress.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with federal law enforcement and National Guard members in Washington, D.C., overseeing a surge in personnel aimed at addressing what he terms a crime emergency. During the visit, he thanked officers and stated the operation has yielded "incredible results," suggesting the model could be replicated in other U.S. cities. The deployment has drawn criticism from local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, who argue it is politically motivated and unnecessary, citing city data that shows a decrease in violent crime compared to previous years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has issued a deeply fractured and complex ruling regarding the Trump administration's cancellation of numerous National Institutes of Health research grants. The decision creates a convoluted legal path for plaintiffs, suggesting that challenges to the overall policy belong in federal district court, while claims for the actual grant money must go to the Court of Federal Claims. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a sharp dissent, criticized the ruling as "Calvinball jurisprudence," arguing it creates procedural hurdles that will effectively prevent timely relief for vital research into issues like suicide prevention and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

          <p>Two homes in Rodanthe, North Carolina, are on the brink of collapsing into the Atlantic Ocean due to powerful waves generated by Hurricane Erin. These structures are the latest among nearly a dozen in the area that have fallen into the sea since 2020, victims of persistent coastal erosion on the dynamic barrier islands. Experts note that development in such areas is inherently risky, as rising sea levels and storm surges continually reshape the coastline, threatening properties built decades ago when the shoreline extended further out.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, eased to 3.1% in July from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest level since March. While the cooling was partly driven by easing rice price inflation, the figure was still higher than the 3% forecast by economists. The "core-core" inflation rate, which also strips out energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, remained steady at 3.4%. These figures come as the Bank of Japan has recently upgraded its inflation forecasts for the fiscal year.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the massive financial penalty, which had grown to over $500 million with interest, imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial. While the court upheld the underlying ruling that Trump is liable for fraud, it deemed the monetary award excessive and a potential violation of constitutional protections. The non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on serving as a company director in the state, remain in place. The New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal the decision on the fine to the state's highest court.</p>

          <p>The Florida Department of Transportation has removed a rainbow-colored crosswalk in Orlando that served as a memorial to the 49 victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting. The state agency painted over the crosswalk in the middle of the night, an act Orlando's mayor called "cruel" and a state senator labeled as vandalism of city property. Governor Ron DeSantis defended the action, stating state roads will not be used for political purposes, reflecting a broader state policy against pavement art with social or political messages.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with canceling National Institutes of Health research grants related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and gender identity. The ruling lifts a lower court's order that had required the NIH to restore funding for hundreds of canceled projects, allowing the administration's policy to take effect while the legal challenge continues. The administration has argued that such grants do not align with its objectives, while opponents warn the move will irreversibly harm vital public health research.</p>

          <p>Donald McPherson, a Navy fighter pilot from Nebraska who was recognized as the last living American "ace" from World War II, has passed away at the age of 103.

After the war, he returned to his hometown, where his family said he preferred to be remembered for his dedication to his faith, community, and family rather than his decorated military service.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation to hold a special election in November, where voters will decide whether to redraw the state's congressional map to favor Democrats. This move is a direct and aggressive response to a similar effort by Republicans in Texas, escalating a national partisan battle over electoral boundaries ahead of the 2026 midterms. If approved, the measure would temporarily sideline the state's independent redistricting commission and could potentially create five new Democratic-leaning seats, neutralizing gains sought by Republicans in other states.</p>

His journey to the border was a final protest against what he views as ongoing American imperialism in the South, a belief he has held since the division of the peninsula.</p>

The proposed amendment, drafted by top economic planning and market regulation bodies, aims to create a more sustainable equilibrium by tightening regulations on pricing, a move supported by business leaders who have seen profits eroded by homogenized competition.
