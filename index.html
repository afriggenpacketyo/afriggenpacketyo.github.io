          <p>The deodorant brand Mitchum has issued an apology and recalled some of its 48-hour roll-on products following numerous customer complaints of skin irritation. Consumers reported experiencing itchy, burning armpits, with some describing severe reactions like "weeping spots" and redness. The company stated that a change in the manufacturing process for a raw material, not a formula change, caused the issue in batches sold in the UK, Ireland, and South Africa. Mitchum has since reverted to its original manufacturing process and is working to remove the affected products from stores while addressing customer concerns.</p>

This development signals continued strong demand for AI computing resources, boosting investor confidence in the sector despite recent concerns about a potential market bubble.

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli has resigned following violent, youth-led protests that plunged the nation into political turmoil. The unrest was initially sparked by a government ban on 26 social media platforms, which critics called an assault on free expression. However, the demonstrations quickly grew to reflect broader public anger over corruption and misgovernance. After security forces killed at least 19 protesters, the government reversed the ban, but the unrest continued, leading to Oli's resignation. Constitutional experts now warn of prolonged instability and suggest a national unity government backed by the army may be necessary to restore order.</p>

The LELDF accuses the firm of being an "influence-peddling operation" that allows donors and activists to shape the actions of elected prosecutors. The Wren Collective defended its work as transparent and focused on improving community safety.</p>

          <p>China is advancing its "Air Silk Road" initiative, a component of the broader Belt and Road Initiative, to develop civil aviation capabilities in dozens of partner countries. A recent government report outlines plans to enhance air route connectivity and establish express air traffic corridors, primarily with nations in Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe. This strategy is expected to create new markets for China's domestically produced aircraft, such as the Comac C919, while also strengthening trade relationships. The initiative represents a strategic effort to expand China's global economic and technological influence amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American consumers are increasingly favoring debit cards over credit cards, a trend driven by a growing aversion to debt, particularly among younger generations like Gen Z. High interest rates and the memory of economic downturns have made many hesitant about credit card spending, which can feel less tangible and lead to compounding debt. In response, financial companies are marketing debit cards with new reward programs to attract these consumers. While credit cards once dominated transactions, debit usage has steadily climbed and now accounts for nearly half of all U.S. card payments, reflecting a cultural shift towards more direct budget management.</p>

Businesses, particularly in durable goods manufacturing, are reportedly hesitant to hire due to unpredictable costs and ongoing legal challenges to the tariffs.

          <h2>Experts Advise on Choosing Between Multiple CDs and a Single Jumbo CD</h2>

          <p>With interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) currently high but a Federal Reserve rate cut likely, savers are considering how to best lock in returns. Financial experts weigh the choice between opening a single jumbo CD, which typically requires a $100,000 minimum deposit, and a CD ladder strategy using multiple smaller CDs. While jumbo CDs traditionally offer higher rates, the current market often sees shorter-term standard CDs matching or exceeding their yields. A CD ladder provides greater flexibility and liquidity as funds mature at different times, which is advantageous in a shifting rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An experienced CEO who has interviewed over 500 candidates highlights three subtle yet critical red flags that job seekers should avoid. The first is tardiness, even by a minute, as it suggests poor planning and a lack of respect for time. The second is giving generic, theoretical answers instead of specific examples rooted in personal experience, which fails to demonstrate proven problem-solving skills. The final red flag is a lack of energy or enthusiasm, as a disengaged demeanor in an interview often predicts a similar performance on the job. The article advises candidates to be punctual, use concrete examples, and show genuine engagement.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister François Bayrou has resigned after his government was defeated in a no-confidence vote, deepening the country's political instability. The vote was triggered by opposition to his proposed budget cuts, which aimed to address France's significant national debt. President Emmanuel Macron must now appoint his seventh prime minister since 2017, facing the challenge of finding a leader who can command a majority in a fractured parliament. The political turmoil coincides with planned nationwide protests and strikes, with unions calling to "block everything," threatening disruptions at airports and major city entrances.</p>

          <p>Several Premier League clubs are requesting more information regarding the legal settlement between the league and Manchester City over Associated Party Transaction (APT) rules. These regulations are designed to prevent clubs from inflating commercial deals with companies linked to their owners. While City has now accepted the rules as valid, ending its lawsuit, rival clubs report they have not been given details about the settlement's terms or potential concessions. Concerns have been raised that the agreement might make it easier for state-linked clubs to secure lucrative sponsorship deals, potentially impacting the league's competitive balance.</p>

          <p>A Phillies fan who went viral for taking a home run ball from his son's glove and giving it to another woman has explained his actions. Drew Feltwell said that after catching the ball and giving it to his 9-year-old son, a woman became loud and persistent, claiming the ball was hers. To avoid a larger conflict and teach his son a lesson in de-escalation, Feltwell chose to hand over the ball. The story had a positive outcome, as both the Marlins and Phillies organizations provided the boy with souvenirs, and he got to meet and receive a signed bat from the player who hit the home run, Harrison Bader.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled its new Type 100 tank, a smaller and lighter vehicle that represents a strategic shift towards information-centric and uncrewed combat systems. The tank features a diesel-electric hybrid engine for quieter operation and is equipped with an unmanned turret and advanced active protection systems instead of heavy armor. Its design emphasizes a high degree of "informationisation," allowing for superior situational awareness and networked coordination with other crewed and uncrewed platforms. According to state media, this new generation of combat vehicles is intended to revolutionize future land battles by integrating reconnaissance, communication, and firepower.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban, allowing approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar to legally work in the country. This policy change comes after significant cuts in U.S. humanitarian aid led to the cancellation of food rations for many living in border camps, some for decades. The move is seen as a pragmatic solution to allow refugees to become self-sufficient and support their families, while also potentially filling labor shortages in Thailand. The UN Refugee Agency has praised the decision as a "turning point" and a potential regional benchmark for rights-based refugee solutions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 09:59:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing an uncharacteristic weakness in their bullpen, which currently ranks 19th in the majors in ERA, creating a strategic challenge for the upcoming postseason. This situation may force manager Dave Roberts to push his starting pitchers deeper into games, a departure from the bullpen-heavy strategies of recent years. While the starting rotation has performed well, key pitchers like Blake Snell and Tyler Glasnow have a history of not pitching deep into playoff games. The reliability of the bullpen will be a critical factor, potentially forcing difficult decisions about when to pull starters during high-stakes October matchups.</p>
