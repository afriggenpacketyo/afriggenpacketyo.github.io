          <p>A public feud erupted between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, marked by online exchanges on Truth Social and X. The conflict began after Musk criticized Trump's tax-cut and spending bill, leading to Trump threatening to withdraw government contracts from Musk's companies. Billionaires like Bill Ackman urged the two to reconcile, while others such as Steve Bannon suggested seizing SpaceX. Wall Street traders reacted negatively, causing Tesla shares to plummet, though Wedbush maintained a bullish view on Tesla despite the regulatory uncertainty. Optimism among investors is affected by the potential impact on Tesla's regulatory environment. Optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) experienced a hacking incident where the hacker group DragonForce sent an abusive email with a ransom demand directly to CEO Stuart Machin. The email, written in broken English, confirmed that M&S had been hacked and its servers encrypted, with claims of stolen customer data. The email was sent using the account of an employee from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), an IT service provider for M&S. While TCS denies involvement, the incident has disrupted M&S operations and is linked to the ongoing cyber-attack on Co-op, also claimed by DragonForce. Optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's proclamation that banned foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University. The judge, Allison Burroughs, stated that Harvard demonstrated it would sustain "immediate and irreparable injury" before she could hear from all parties involved in the lawsuit. Harvard filed the legal challenge, calling Trump's order illegal retaliation for the university's rejection of White House demands. The university argued that the ban would disrupt the academic pursuits of over 7,000 international students and visiting scholars. Optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>A new report by PwC suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) is enhancing the value of workers, rather than diminishing it through automation. The report challenges common myths about AI's impact, indicating that both jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations. It found that productivity growth in industries well-positioned to adopt AI has nearly quadrupled since 2022. Wages for workers with AI skills are also significantly higher, and the demand for formal degrees is declining in AI-exposed jobs, creating broader opportunities. Optimism score is 80.</p>
