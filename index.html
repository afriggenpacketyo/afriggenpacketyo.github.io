          <p>Victims of Jeffrey Epstein have announced they are creating a confidential list of his associates whom they say were involved in the sexual abuse. Speaking at the US Capitol, survivors detailed their experiences and called on lawmakers and the Department of Justice to release all remaining files from the investigation. The survivors stated that many victims fear repercussions if they publicly name individuals themselves, highlighting the need for official action to ensure their protection and achieve full accountability. This initiative aims to provide a survivor-led path to justice while official document releases have been criticized as containing mostly pre-existing public information.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell by 14% in extended trading after releasing its first quarterly earnings report since its initial public offering. While the company's revenue of $249.6 million slightly exceeded expectations and it reported a small net income, its third-quarter revenue forecast appeared to dampen investor enthusiasm. The report comes as Figma integrates new AI features like Figma Make and Figma Sites, though it has not yet begun fully charging for these services. The company's net retention rate, a key metric for customer expansion, also saw a slight decline from the previous quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District has reached a settlement in a five-year-long lawsuit concerning educational support following the COVID-19 pandemic. The agreement will provide high-intensity tutoring to approximately 100,000 of the district's most vulnerable students who experienced significant learning setbacks. Filed by a group of parents, the lawsuit alleged that the district failed to meet state standards during remote learning, disproportionately affecting Black and Latino students. The settlement mandates at least 45 hours of tutoring per year for three years, regular student assessments, and additional teacher training.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the potential for a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) development bank to create an alternative financial framework, reducing reliance on the US-dominated global system. The analysis highlights China's recent pledge of $1.4 billion in loans to SCO states as a signal of this strategic shift. For member states like Iran, integration into such a system is viewed as crucial for economic survival, especially with the potential restoration of international sanctions. The author argues that developing these financial instruments allows the bloc to counter Western economic pressure and strengthen cooperation among its members in the East.

          <p>The FBI has confirmed that bones discovered during a recent search operation in Washington state are not human, according to an update provided on September 3. The two-day search was part of the ongoing manhunt for Travis Decker, a fugitive accused of murdering his three young daughters. The operation involved nearly 100 personnel conducting a grid search near the Rock Island Campground, where the girls' bodies were found in June. While the bones were determined to be animal remains, authorities had previously stated that other "potential evidence" was collected and is being analyzed for connections to the case.</p>

The mayor of Lisbon has declared a three-day period of mourning in response to the incident. The investigation into the exact cause of the derailment is currently underway.</p>

          <p>In a significant antitrust ruling, a federal judge decided against forcing Google to sell its Chrome web browser, causing the stock of its parent company, Alphabet, to rise by 9%. While Judge Amit Mehta had previously deemed Google a "monopolist" in online search, he concluded that divesting Chrome would be an overly complex and risky remedy. However, the judge did impose other restrictions, including requiring Google to share some of its valuable search data with certain rivals to help foster competition. The Department of Justice supported the remedies as a step forward, though some advocacy groups felt the ruling did not go far enough.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration and its allies are actively working to reframe the January 6 Capitol attack as a moment of triumph rather than an insurrection. The author points to recent actions, such as the Air Force granting military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt and the administration settling a wrongful-death lawsuit with her family. The piece contends that by pardoning rioters, purging prosecutors, and discussing compensation for those convicted, the administration is creating a "New Lost Cause" narrative that casts perpetrators as victims. This effort, the author suggests, justifies the attack by force of political will rather than by re-litigating the facts.</p>

          <p>A judge has ruled that advanced DNA evidence from whole genome sequencing can be used in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann, setting a legal precedent in New York state. This cutting-edge technique allowed investigators to link Heuermann and his family to nine degraded, rootless hair strands found on the remains of six victims. The defense had argued the method was unreliable, but the judge determined its principles are accepted within the scientific community. The ruling is considered a major victory for prosecutors, though the defense has already challenged it on the grounds that the testing lab is not licensed in New York.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants for Harvard University, ruling the action was illegal. The court found that the administration likely used concerns about antisemitism on campus as a pretext to retaliate against the university for its ideological positions and refusal to alter its policies. The ruling vacates the freeze orders, which had halted work on numerous critical research projects, including studies on veteran suicide prevention and Lou Gehrig's disease.

          <p>The projected cost for expanding the Los Angeles Convention Center has risen again, now reaching $2.7 billion, which is an increase of nearly half a billion dollars in just six months. City officials are growing increasingly concerned that the project's first phase will not be completed in time for the 2028 Olympic Games, for which it is a key venue. A major part of the funding plan relies on revenue from two large digital billboards, but the state bill required to approve them may not have the governor's support. If that revenue fails to materialize, the city's general fund would be on the hook for over $100 million annually to cover the project's costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Legal experts have raised concerns that the recent US military strike on a boat in the Caribbean, which killed 11 alleged drug traffickers, may have violated international law. President Trump announced the strike against a vessel he said was operated by the Tren de Aragua cartel. However, specialists in maritime and international law told BBC Verify that using lethal force in international waters under these circumstances is highly questionable and could be considered an extrajudicial killing. While the US has designated the cartel a terrorist organization, experts argue this does not automatically make its members lawful military targets outside of an armed conflict.</p>

          <p>Veteran all-rounder Ravi Bopara scored a spectacular 45-ball century to lead Northamptonshire to a seven-run victory over Surrey in a rain-shortened T20 Blast quarter-final. The 40-year-old's unbeaten 105 guided his team to a total of 154-4 from their 14 overs after an early setback. Despite a strong chase led by Surrey captain Sam Curran, who scored an unbeaten 69, the home side fell just short, finishing on 147-6. The victory means Northamptonshire will advance to Finals Day for the first time since 2016, the same year they last won the competition.</p>

          <p>Governor Ron DeSantis has announced that Florida will become the first state in the nation to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates for school attendance. State Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo stated the move is intended to allow parents to make their own health decisions for their children, likening mandates to an "immoral" intrusion on rights. The plan was immediately criticized by physician groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, who warned that it is reckless, dangerous, and could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles and polio. The state will also create a "Make America Healthy Again" commission to promote medical freedom.</p>

          <p>The Idaho Attorney General's office has announced that no criminal charges will be filed against the four Pocatello police officers who fatally shot Victor Perez, a 17-year-old with autism. The decision concluded that prosecutors could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers' use of deadly force was unjustified. According to the investigation, officers were responding to a 911 call about an intoxicated man with a knife and were unaware of Perez's age or disabilities. The letter from the AG's office stated that the officers believed individuals were in danger and acted to protect them, making a criminal prosecution untenable under state law.</p>

This marks a significant return to form for Auger-Aliassime, who has struggled with injuries and confidence in recent years, falling from a career-high ranking of No. 6. The defeat is another quarter-final heartbreak for de Minaur, who has yet to advance to a Grand Slam semi-final in six attempts.</p>

Prosecutors argued that she set their house on fire and then ran him over with a van as he escaped the flames. Her first conviction in 2010 was overturned by a federal judge in 2018 due to prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel, leading to her temporary release. However, the state chose to retry her, resulting in the new conviction in May 2025.

Rayner stated she deeply regrets the error, has contacted tax authorities to pay the amount owed, and has referred herself to the prime minister's independent adviser on ministerial interests.

The bill has garnered support from across the political spectrum, from progressive Democrats to conservative Republicans, who argue the current rules erode public trust. Supporters are threatening to force a floor vote if leadership does not bring the bill for consideration by the end of the month. (not investment advice)</p>
