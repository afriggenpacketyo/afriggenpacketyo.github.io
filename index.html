        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is deploying 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, despite objections from California Governor Gavin Newsom. Trump is utilizing a federal law that allows the president to federalize National Guard troops under specific circumstances, such as invasion or rebellion, though the legality of this without the governor's order is unclear. The troops' role is to support immigration officers, raising concerns about potential use of force, and this deployment follows Trump's past willingness to use the military on US soil to quell protests, indicating a shift towards a more aggressive stance. The situation reflects escalating tensions between California's political leaders and the federal government, with Newsom accusing the White House of inciting chaos. The optimism score is a reflection of the potential for conflict and instability arising from the deployment. </p>

          <p>Primary school teacher Alice Cole returned to her job part-time after having her first child, emphasizing the importance of flexible working arrangements for new parents in addressing teacher recruitment and retention issues. Cole believes that offering flexible options will allow teachers to feel confident in balancing their personal and professional lives, and the government is attempting to improve flexible hours as part of its pledge to recruit new teachers. The overall number of teachers has fallen, with fewer entering the profession, and computer science teacher Sam Alner highlights the challenges of maintaining a work-life balance in teaching, leading experienced staff to seek better opportunities elsewhere. Schools in disadvantaged areas struggle to recruit teachers, limiting opportunities for pupils in specialist subjects, highlighting the need to address inequalities in education. </p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Donald Trump's self-dealing practices are more alarming than previously thought, as his personal wealth has more than doubled since starting his 2024 election campaign. The article draws parallels to Vladimir Putin's Russia and Viktor Orban's Hungary, where political leaders have allegedly used their power to enrich themselves and their associates. The author contends that the US political system is being transformed into one that no longer serves the people, with the nation's interests becoming indistinguishable from its leader's. The fusion of political and personal interests poses a fundamental danger to the integrity of the American political system. </p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, found that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, making this issue especially urgent. The study analyzed data from 23 countries and highlighted the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women. </p>

          <p>Nutritionists are cautioning that intermittent fasting, a popular eating plan, may be a socially acceptable disguise for disordered eating behaviors. While intermittent fasting is often touted for weight loss and health benefits, it can lead to restrictive eating and obsessive thoughts about food. Experts emphasize that individuals with a history of eating disorders or those genetically and environmentally vulnerable are at higher risk. They recommend intuitive eating, which focuses on balanced meals, variety, and listening to the body's hunger and fullness cues, rather than adhering to rigid food rules. </p>

          <p>UCLA's baseball team secured a 5-2 victory against Texas San Antonio in the first game of the Super Regional, bringing them one win away from the College World Series.

While the lead author of the initial study stands by the findings, other researchers have not been able to replicate the results, highlighting the complexities of searching for extraterrestrial life.
