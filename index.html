          <p>Democratic lawmakers, led by Senators Schiff and Levin, are pressing the White House to release financial transaction reports of senior employees, citing concerns about potential insider trading related to President Trump's tariff decisions. They are requesting transparency to ensure officials adhere to ethics and conflict of interest requirements. The lawmakers point to unusual market activity before Trump's tariff pause announcement as raising suspicions. The White House has not yet responded to the request, but has dismissed the claim as partisan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Train service through San Clemente has been halted for an estimated six weeks due to emergency repairs needed to reinforce an unstable section of coastline. The closures affect Metrolink's Orange County and Inland Empire-Orange County lines, as well as Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner. The repairs are part of a larger project to address coastal erosion and landslide activity that has repeatedly disrupted the railway line. The project aims to stabilize the slope and protect the track.</p>

          <h2>Palantir Stock Soars Amid Tech Sector Downturn</h2>

          <p>Palantir's stock is soaring while its tech peers are struggling, due in part to President Trump's government overhauls. The software maker has gained 45% this year, benefiting from its artificial-intelligence-enabled tools and contracts with key U.S. government agencies. Trump administration policies are shifting dollars from consulting contracts to commercial software providers like Palantir. CEO Alex Karp has voiced support for American innovation and Palantir's role in national security. (not investment advice)</p>
