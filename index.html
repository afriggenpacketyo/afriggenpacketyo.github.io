        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's House of Commons has voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator for the top five divisions of men's football in England. The legislation, reintroduced by the new Labour government, aims to protect clubs by ensuring their financial sustainability and placing fans at the heart of the game. A proposed amendment by the Liberal Democrats to make more Premier League matches available on free-to-air television was voted down, with the government citing the need to balance public access with broadcasting revenue for investment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of placing $20,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account amidst market uncertainty. It calculates that short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher returns, while high-yield savings accounts can outperform over longer periods, assuming their variable rates remain stable. The analysis advises savers to weigh the fixed, less-liquid nature of CDs against the accessibility and variable rates of high-yield savings accounts, suggesting a split strategy could be optimal for some.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, a move aimed at boosting domestic production. The news caused copper futures to surge to a record high and increased the stock value of U.S. copper miners like Freeport-McMoRan. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that a national security investigation into copper imports was finished and stated the tariff would likely be implemented by the end of July, aligning it with existing duties on steel and aluminum.

The announcement comes amid widespread confusion over shifting deadlines for his broader "reciprocal" tariff plan, which was recently extended to August 1. The article notes that global markets have largely shrugged off the latest threats, with some investors seemingly betting that the most severe actions will not be fully implemented.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned a North Korean cyber operative from the "Andariel" hacking group for facilitating a scheme that places fraudulent IT workers in global companies. These workers, operating from China and Russia, pose as legitimate remote employees to earn income that is then funneled to North Korea's weapons programs. The sanctions also target a Russia-based network that aided the scheme, as part of a broader U.S. effort to disrupt the regime's illicit fundraising activities.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is beginning to lift its long-standing requirement for travelers to remove their shoes at security checkpoints in some U.S. airports. The rule, implemented in 2006 after the attempted "shoe bomber" plot, is being phased out due to advancements in screening technology. While the change has been reported at several airports, including in Philadelphia and Washington D.C., the lack of a formal nationwide announcement has led to some confusion among passengers.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece argues that a recent large-scale federal immigration operation in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park was a political stunt designed for media optics rather than effective enforcement. The author describes the deployment of heavily armed agents and military-style vehicles as a "farce" that terrified local residents while accomplishing little of substance. The article posits that the action is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to intimidate and punish immigrant-friendly cities through spectacle and fear.</p>

          <p>During a Cabinet meeting, President Donald Trump launched a personal attack on CNN reporter Natasha Bertrand, calling for her to be fired. Trump criticized Bertrand's reporting on an intelligence assessment concerning recent U.S. strikes in Iran, labeling her a "scammer" and her work "fake." He also brought up her previous reporting on Hunter Biden's laptop, continuing his pattern of using his official platform to single out and condemn journalists from news outlets he dislikes.</p>

          <p>As the death toll from the Texas flash floods surpasses 100, officials are facing intense scrutiny over the handling of the disaster and the timeliness of emergency warnings. During a press conference, the Kerr County sheriff and other authorities were repeatedly questioned about why public alerts were not issued sooner, despite the National Weather Service's early morning warnings of "life-threatening" conditions. Officials largely deflected these questions, stating that their focus remains on search and recovery, which has intensified calls for accountability.</p>

The survey found that 65% of managers utilize AI for these tasks, yet a third of them have no formal training in the technology. This trend is raising significant concerns about fairness, potential algorithmic bias, and the legal risks for companies that increasingly outsource sensitive human resources functions to AI.</p>
