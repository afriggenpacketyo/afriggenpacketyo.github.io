          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang voiced his concerns about potentially being locked out of China's artificial intelligence market, estimating its value at $50 billion within the next few years. He emphasized that selling to China would generate revenue, taxes, and jobs in the United States, while also stating that Nvidia would support whatever policies are in the best interest of the country. Huang acknowledged Huawei as a formidable technology company and stressed the importance of American AI leading the way globally. Nvidia is set to report earnings on May 28, with analysts expecting revenue growth of 65% from the previous year.</p>

Buffett reassured shareholders that he plans to remain involved and praised Abel's management capabilities. Investors are looking to see what's next for Berkshire under Abel, as the company has run circles around the S&P 500 under Buffett.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Trump digressed to criticize the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago, calling it "a disaster" and blaming "woke" construction workers and DEI initiatives for the project's alleged problems. Trump claimed the center is millions of dollars over budget and that Pres. Obama "wanted to be very politically correct and he didn't use good, hard, tough, mean construction workers that I love." A spokesperson for the Obama Foundation refuted Trump's claims, stating they were not based in fact and referenced a dispute between subcontractors. The foundation maintains the center is on track to open in 2026 and will be an economic engine for Chicago.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston is considering whether non-citizens in the U.S. have the same free speech rights as citizens, particularly in cases involving the Trump administration's revocation of foreign student visas. Judge William Young suggested that it is "not clear" that noncitizens have the "full rights to free speech" that citizens have. The case involves a lawsuit by academic organizations claiming the government is terrorizing students and faculty for exercising First Amendment rights, while the government denies enforcing ideological deportations. The court aims to determine if the government committed any retribution against people for their speech, creating a chilling effect.</p>

          <p>Israel's security Cabinet has unanimously approved a plan to widen the military offensive in Gaza, dubbed "Gideon's Chariots," which includes the "conquest of Gaza" and occupying the territory, as well as the forcible displacement of the civilian population to the south. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the offensive aims to defeat Hamas and that the population will be moved for its own protection, though under international law, forced displacement of civilians during armed conflict is a war crime. The plan also involves dismantling Hamas, releasing hostages, and establishing a new aid mechanism after the operation begins. The UN estimates that since Israel resumed its offensive, some 70% of the territory is either part of a "red zone" or under "evacuation orders."</p>

NBC Sports President Rick Cordella stated that Fagan's voice evokes nostalgia for a special time in NBA history and perfectly captured the magnitude of heavyweight matchups and stars.

The settlement, approved by the New York Supreme Court, involves 576 women and is intended to hold the institution accountable for enabling the abuse.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wall Street experienced a pullback for the second consecutive session, influenced by the lack of trade deals and an overbought market condition. Interest rates dipped in reaction to a strong government auction, but volatility is expected with the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting announcement. The healthcare sector faced downward pressure due to tariff and drug pricing-related uncertainty, following a report in The Times. There also seems to be some volatility â€” especially in vaccine related stocks like Moderna and Pfizer â€” tied to Vinay Prasad's appointment to director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</p>
