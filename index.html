          <p>Tesla is carefully considering entering the Indian market, according to CFO Vaibhav Taneja, due to the country's large middle class, but is also facing significant tariff challenges. India's high import tariffs and luxury taxes on EVs could double the price of Teslas sold there, creating tension as the company evaluates the right time to expand. Elon Musk has also discussed technology collaboration with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, indicating ongoing negotiations to address these obstacles and establish a manufacturing base in the country.

          <p>In a Bronx neighborhood, residents reportedly tracked down and assaulted a man accused of attempting to sexually assault a 70-year-old woman in broad daylight. The community's response came after the NYPD released surveillance footage of the suspect, Oswaldo Ramos, leading to his identification and subsequent hospitalization due to the beating. Ramos, who has a history of arrests, now faces charges of attempted sexual assault and burglary, highlighting community intolerance for such crimes. This incident underscores the frustration with repeat offenders and the community's desire for immediate justice.</p>

          <p>Despite the introduction of Teen Accounts with enhanced protections, Instagram still poses serious risks to children, according to campaigners. Researchers were able to bypass age checks using fake birthdays and were subsequently exposed to sexualized content, hateful comments, and recommendations for adult accounts. The 5Rights Foundation raises concerns about the addictive nature of the app and exposure to commercialized content, prompting calls for stronger age verification and content moderation under the UK's Online Safety Act. Meta maintains that its Teen Accounts have built-in protections and it shares the goal of keeping teens safe online.</p>

          <p>Tesla's profits have plummeted, leading CEO Elon Musk to announce he will reduce his involvement with the "department of government efficiency" (DOGE), though he will not entirely abandon it. Tesla's quarterly earnings report showed a 71% year-over-year decline in net income, and Musk attributed blowback against his DOGE work to those who were receiving wasteful dollars. Analysts believe this shift could benefit Tesla, with shares rising in after-hours trading, although Musk maintains that Tesla's long-term profitability relies on robotaxis and autonomous robots.</p>
