          <p>According to a military article, China is actively exploring tactics to counter artificial intelligence in future battlefields, focusing on undermining the data, algorithms, and computing capacity of adversaries. The article suggests methods such as data pollution, logical deception of algorithms, and irregular drone maneuvers to confuse enemy AI systems. This reflects China's increasing focus on adapting to and countering the growing role of AI in modern warfare, signaling a strategic shift towards "deceptive warfare" to gain an advantage in future conflicts. The People‚Äôs Liberation Army has long discussed the idea of such ‚Äúdeceptive warfare‚Äù.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has reported the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, specifically in two samples of Aedes vexans mosquitoes. While there have been no cases of West Nile virus acquired within the UK to date, this discovery is not unexpected, as the virus is widespread in Europe. Experts emphasize the risk to the general public remains very low, but this detection is part of a wider changing landscape, where, in the wake of climate change mosquito-borne diseases are expanding to new areas. Public health officials recommend eliminating standing water sources and using mosquito repellent to minimize potential risks.</p>

          <p>Despite bipartisan support last year to remove marijuana from the government‚Äôs most restrictive drug class, progress has stalled due to resistance from the Drug Enforcement Administration and subsequent legal challenges, according to this New York Times article. Former President Biden had initiated the move to downgrade marijuana, but the DEA slowed the process, leading to legal battles. While Donald Trump had previously endorsed the idea, his administration has shown no signs of pursuing looser cannabis regulations, nominating a critic of cannabis legalization to head the DEA. Experts suggest the window of opportunity for cannabis rescheduling has narrowed considerably.</p>

          <p>Six civilians were killed in the crossfire of armed clashes between two groups near Acapulco, Mexico, according to authorities. The violence occurred in the town of Kilometro 30 on the highway to Mexico City, with five men and an elderly woman among the victims. Soldiers and police seized weapons and an armored vehicle at the scene, where several cars were set ablaze. Acapulco, once a thriving beach resort, has been plagued by violence linked to drug cartels, with the U.S. State Department advising Americans to completely avoid the state of Guerrero due to crime and violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK inflation has risen to 3.5% in April, the highest rate in over a year, primarily driven by increases in household bills such as water, gas, and electricity, according to official data. The Office for National Statistics noted that housing, household services, transport, recreation, and culture contributed most to the rise. The Bank of England expects inflation to peak at 3.7% later in the year before declining to its 2% target, leading analysts to reassess the likelihood of further interest rate cuts. Rising costs of airfares and services also contributed to the unexpected inflation figure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camp on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued permission was needed for camping. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public access to the commons for open-air recreation, naturally including camping. This decision is likely to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor National Park is a rare exception allowing wild camping. The Dartmoor National Park Association expressed delight and relief, emphasizing the need for responsible access and respect for landowners and farmers.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old Venezuelan man, Anthony Emmanuel Labrador Sierra, was arrested in Perrysburg, Ohio, for allegedly enrolling in a public high school using fraudulent documents.

An investigation revealed Labrador Sierra used fraudulent documents to enroll as a 16-year-old unaccompanied minor, obtaining a state-issued driver‚Äôs license, social security number, and Temporary Protective Status.

          <p>A Guardian investigation reveals that UnitedHealth Group secretly paid nursing homes bonuses to reduce hospital transfers for ailing residents, a cost-cutting tactic that saved the company millions but risked residents‚Äô health. UnitedHealth's medical teams stationed in nursing homes pushed to cut care expenses for residents covered by the insurance giant. In several cases, residents who needed immediate hospital care failed to receive it after interventions from UnitedHealth staffers. The program‚Äôs cost-cutting schemes were only possible because of the sprawling nature of UnitedHealth, a $300bn-plus conglomerate which has grown into one of the world‚Äôs biggest companies thanks to its relentless efforts to embed itself into nearly every corner of the healthcare industry.</p>

The Trump administration has eliminated language encouraging police to seek funds for initiatives to help underserved populations, boost diversity, and support community violence intervention. Instead, the administration lists "immigration and border security," "violent crime prevention" and "uplifting the image of the law enforcement profession" as programs that are priorities for the highly sought-after grants.

          <p>This article discusses President Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis and how it continues a long history of presidents concealing or downplaying health issues while in office. History abounds with examples of presidential maladies being minimized, or kept secret. Grover Cleveland underwent surgery for oral cancer on a yacht in New York Harbor to keep his condition from being widely known. Woodrow Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke, a fact covered up by his wife and confidants, who exercised extraordinary power in his stead. The article also notes that the capacity to misdirect, in Biden‚Äôs case, or mislead, as happened under Trump, illustrates one of the magical features of the White House: the ability of a president to conceal himself in plain sight.</p>

          <p>A new report on the failure of Skid Row Housing Trust highlights systemic issues endangering supportive housing in Los Angeles, including insufficient rental subsidies and inconsistent funding. The report suggests that without major changes, other providers are at risk, jeopardizing housing for vulnerable residents and exposing taxpayers to potential bailouts. The report cites 2015 as a turning point for trust properties. That year, the region implemented a new coordinated entry system for placing homeless residents into trust buildings and other supportive housing through a process designed to prioritize rooms for the neediest. The report advocates for overhauling the region‚Äôs funding system and setting subsidies to cover the cost of supportive housing.</p>

China is investing in soft power, attempting to fill gaps created by perceived American decline. Maintaining both hard and soft power is crucial, but restoring lost trust will be costly and require a renewed commitment to liberal international order.</p>
