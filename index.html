          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has publicly criticized his mayoral opponent, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, for living in a rent-stabilized apartment despite his substantial wealth. Cuomo argues that Mamdani, whom he describes as "very rich," should vacate the subsidized housing to make it available for a family in need, highlighting the city's severe affordability crisis. The criticism is part of a broader campaign by Cuomo, who is running as an independent, to portray Mamdani as a hypocrite, also pointing to his property ownership in Uganda. This political attack aims to question Mamdani's moral clarity and commitment to affordable housing for New Yorkers.</p>

Hines played a key role in shaping the administration's crypto policy, leading a working group that called for new, specific regulations for digital assets. His departure follows the recent signing of the GENIUS Act, a milestone law creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which Hines had supported. His work was part of a broader effort to fulfill a campaign promise to overhaul U.S. crypto policy and establish clear rules for the growing market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to strip the institution of its valuable portfolio of federally funded patents. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick accused Harvard of violating legal requirements associated with its research programs, initiating a "march-in" process under the Bayh-Dole Act that could allow the government to seize the patents. This action follows previous administration moves to freeze federal research funding over Harvard's handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests. Critics suggest these measures are a pretext to assert federal control over academic institutions and curtail academic freedom.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages," which promise benefits like calm and relaxation, is facing scrutiny over the validity of its health claims. An advert from a leading brand, Trip, was recently banned for suggesting its drinks could help with stress and anxiety. Nutritionists express skepticism, noting the small amounts of active ingredients like Lion's Mane or L-theanine in these drinks are unlikely to produce significant effects based on current research. While some consumers find them to be a good non-alcoholic alternative for unwinding, psychologists suggest the perceived calming effect may be more related to the ritual of taking a moment for oneself than the ingredients themselves.</p>

For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has been a beloved figure in the Saint-Germain neighborhood, selling papers like Le Monde with a shout. Despite the decline in print media and the shift to digital news, Mr. Akbar continues his work for the joy and independence it brings him. The honor, bestowed by President Emmanuel Macron who once bought papers from him as a student, recognizes his unique contribution to French culture and his persistence in a vanishing trade.</p>

The Rubí and Clemesí solar plants generate enough power for over 350,000 homes, yet the 150 villagers remain unconnected to the national grid, relying on candles, torches, or firewood. The paradox highlights a systemic issue where energy infrastructure prioritizes profitability over connecting sparsely populated rural areas. Although the plant's operator has invested in infrastructure to supply the village, the final connection remains the government's responsibility, leaving residents in a daily struggle for basic necessities.</p>

          <p>A dog named Petunia has won the title of the "World's Ugliest Dog" at the annual contest held at the Sonoma County Fair in California. The event, which has been running for nearly 50 years, celebrates the unique beauty of dogs regardless of pedigree and awarded Petunia's owner, Shannon Nyman, a $5,000 prize. Many of the contestants are rescue dogs from shelters and puppy mills, and the competition serves to promote adoption by showcasing these unique animals. Organizers describe the contest as a "wonderful show of pageantry and pride" that proves a pedigree does not define a pet.</p>

Zelenskyy's statement reflects Ukrainian and European anxiety that a bilateral meeting could marginalize their interests.

          <p>Singer Ed Sheeran recently sparked a debate about identity by describing himself as "culturally Irish," prompting both criticism and support. This article explores the complex and fluid nature of what it means to be Irish today, moving beyond simple definitions of birthplace or citizenship. It discusses how identity in both Ireland and the diaspora is a blend of heritage, personal experience, and cultural touchstones, from music and literature to a shared sense of humor. The piece argues that in an era of peace and easy travel, individuals can embrace multiple identities, reflecting a long history of cross-fertilization between Irish and British cultures and a move away from rigid, historical binaries.</p>

These "junk films" often build cult followings because their earnest failures, visible production struggles, and unintentional humor provide a unique viewing experience. Unlike slickly produced but soulless movies, these flawed creations are seen as having a certain charm and are celebrated for their unintentional comedy and audacious lack of quality.</p>

While the initial shock has subsided and concerns over data security with China persist, DeepSeek's arrival marked a turning point in the U.S.-China AI rivalry.

This move, along with President Trump's assurance that Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviated investor concerns about the financial impact of trade policies.

          <p>A group of masked thieves stole approximately $7,000 worth of collectible Labubu dolls from a store in the Los Angeles area. The suspects broke into the One Stop Shop in La Puente early Wednesday morning, taking the store's entire inventory of the popular toys. Surveillance footage captured the hooded individuals ransacking the establishment before fleeing. Labubu dolls, created by artist Kasing Lung, have become highly sought-after collectible items. The store's owners expressed their shock and urged the public for help in identifying the thieves, while the LA County Sheriff's Department investigates the incident.</p>

          <p>More than 40 million Americans are under alerts for dangerous heat and critical fire weather conditions this weekend. Extreme Heat Warnings are in effect for areas in Arizona and California, with temperatures expected to reach 115 degrees. Widespread heat advisories also stretch across the Plains and into the Southwest, with record highs possible in several cities. In the West, fire weather alerts are active in four states due to low humidity and gusty winds that could fuel rapid wildfire spread. The heat is also building in the Northwest, with warnings in place for Oregon and Washington, promising little relief with very warm overnight temperatures.</p>

          <p>The chief financial officer of Wilton, Connecticut, resigned after town officials discovered she was simultaneously employed as the town administrator and finance director for Greybull, Wyoming, a town 2,000 miles away. Wilton officials claim they were unaware of Dawn Norton's second, $210k-a-year job and that it would have violated employment terms. However, Norton insists she kept Wilton's leadership fully informed, stating she had been working remotely from Wyoming while on family medical leave and had submitted her retirement notice. The controversy emerged amid a review of Wilton's finance department, which had been struggling with issues like understaffing and audit weaknesses.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign criminals after they receive a custodial sentence. Under the proposals, offenders with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away and barred from re-entering the country, with their destination country deciding whether they serve any remaining prison time. The policy, which would not apply to those serving life sentences for crimes like terrorism, is intended to save taxpayer money and protect the public. Critics, however, have warned that some countries may refuse to accept the deported criminals, questioning the feasibility of the plan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A board-certified neurologist is advising people over 50 to eat more pomegranates to support healthy brain aging. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these nutrients may also help protect the brain from amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease. While pomegranates can be costly and are not available year-round, pomegranate extract can be an alternative, provided it contains no added sugars. The article also recommends other brain-healthy fruits like blueberries, dark grapes, and avocados, but advises consulting a doctor before making significant dietary changes.</p>

          <p>British police arrested 474 people in central London during a demonstration in support of Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian group recently banned under UK terrorism laws. Protesters intentionally defied the ban by displaying signs with messages like "I support Palestine Action," as part of an organized effort to challenge the law and strain the justice system. The government proscribed the group after activists vandalized military aircraft to protest UK support for Israel. While the Home Secretary defended the ban based on security advice, human rights groups like Amnesty International called the mass arrests a disproportionate threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>A Texas real estate developer and big game hunter, Asher Watkins, was killed by a Cape buffalo while on a hunting expedition in South Africa. According to the safari company, the attack was "sudden and unprovoked" and occurred while Watkins was tracking the animal. Cape buffalo are known for being one of the most dangerous animals to hunt in Africa, responsible for numerous injuries and deaths each year. The incident has sparked debate online, with animal rights activists highlighting the ethical issues of trophy hunting and arguing that cornered animals may retaliate in self-defense. Watkins was described as a lifelong outdoorsman and a long-standing friend of the safari company.</p>

          <p>The recent dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long was reportedly preceded by a clash with the White House over using confidential taxpayer data to locate undocumented immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security had requested the IRS cross-check a list of 40,000 names, but the agency declined to hand over verified information, citing taxpayer privacy rights. The incident highlights the administration's pressure on federal agencies to aid its immigration crackdown, a move that critics argue politicizes neutral government bodies. Long's removal after just two months makes his tenure the briefest in IRS history, adding to the turmoil within the agency. (not investment advice)</p>

Chasing 164, Fire suffered a top-order collapse, leaving Bairstow with a monumental task. He launched a stunning late assault, including back-to-back sixes, and shared a 100-run partnership with Chris Green, but the effort fell just short. Earlier, David Warner's unbeaten 70 anchored the Spirit's total of 163-5, helping them recover from being bowled out for 80 in their previous match and leaving both of Welsh Fire's teams winless in the competition.</p>
