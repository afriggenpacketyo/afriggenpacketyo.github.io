          <p>John Laurinaitis, a co-defendant in the lawsuit accusing Vince McMahon of sexual assault and sex trafficking, has agreed to cooperate with Janel Grant, the accuser, and provide evidence against McMahon and WWE. Laurinaitis also reached a confidential settlement with Grant, leading to the dismissal of the lawsuit against him with prejudice. Grant's representatives stated that Laurinaitis's cooperation is a crucial step towards holding McMahon and WWE accountable. McMahon resigned as TKO Group Holdings' executive chairman in January 2024 after the lawsuit was filed and previously settled SEC charges related to non-disclosure agreements with women. </p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new visa policy aimed at foreign officials who are responsible for censorship of protected expression in the United States. The policy targets those who issue or threaten arrest warrants against U.S. citizens or residents for social media posts, as well as officials who demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies that extend into the U.S. Rubio emphasized that free speech is a birthright and foreign governments have no authority over it. The exact implementation of the policy remains to be seen, but it is likely to affect officials from countries with a history of targeting dual nationals for online criticism.</p>

          <p>Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a significant increase despite the company's decision to slash its profit outlook due to tariffs, which are expected to impact its business by $50 million.

Despite the lowered guidance, Abercrombie reported fiscal first-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and raised its full-year sales guidance.

          <p>Namibia held its first national day of commemoration for the victims of the genocide committed under German colonial rule between 1904 and 1908, often referred to as "Germany's forgotten genocide." The event included a candlelight vigil and a speech by President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who pressed for greater reparations from Germany. While Germany recognized the crimes as genocide in 2021 and offered €1.1 billion over 30 years, a final agreement has not been reached. The Namibian government marked May 28 as the day German colonial authorities ordered the closure of concentration camps, ending systematic killings of the Herero and Nama peoples.</p>

The lawsuit, filed by several Democratic state attorneys general, claims that Musk, as a special government employee, has power similar to Senate-confirmed Cabinet officials. The states allege that Trump violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution by giving Musk and DOGE sweeping authority to carry out mass firings, terminate grants and contracts, and access sensitive government data without congressional approval. Musk has criticized congressional legislation, stating that it increases the budget deficit and undermines the work of the DOGE team.</p>

          <p>Reps. Joe Wilson and Greg Steube are urging Secretary Marco Rubio to impose sanctions on Iraq for its "complete subjugation" by Iran, as part of the U.S.’s "maximum pressure" policy toward Tehran. The lawmakers call for the U.S. to cut all foreign aid to Iraq until it comes out from under Iran’s influence. They also advocate for sanctioning Iraq’s importation of Iranian gas, designating the Popular Mobilization Forces as a foreign terrorist group, and sanctioning Iraqi state banks that financially support Iran. The U.S. initially invaded Iraq in 2003 and maintains a troop presence to partner with local forces against ISIS.</p>

This structure, where more shares come from investors than the company, is rare in tech IPOs with Facebook being a notable exception.

The film is directed by Andrew DeYoung, and the techniques used shroud the story in suspense: dramatic cinematography, slow zooms, and an off-putting lo-fi score.

          <p>The European Union has passed legislation to lift all economic sanctions on Syria, except for those based on security grounds. The Syrian Central Bank and other lenders can now access the European financial market again to facilitate the reconstruction of the war-torn country. The EU hopes that stabilizing the country will encourage Syrian refugees in the bloc to return home. However, sanctions against individuals and organizations linked to the al-Assad regime or responsible for violent repression remain in force.</p>

          <p>Porsche is facing significant challenges, including declining sales in China, slumping demand for electric vehicles, and newly imposed tariffs from the Trump administration. These factors have led the company to scale back its forecast for the year by about 2 billion euros and reduce its profit margin expectations. The company is bringing back models with combustion engines and expanding its offering of plug-in hybrid vehicles. German companies have grown wary of investing in the United States, citing the chaos caused by Mr. Trump’s trade policies.</p>

Having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor, such as a surprise car repair or medical bill.

          <p>A top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that President Donald Trump "is not getting enough information" about Moscow's war on Ukraine, after Trump criticized Putin for his apparent reluctance to pursue a peace deal. Yuri Ushakov claimed that Trump is not being informed enough about the massive terrorist attacks being carried out by Ukraine against peaceful Russian cities. The comments came after hundreds of Ukrainian drones crossed into Russia, with impacts reported in Moscow. Russia's Foreign Ministry said Moscow was still working on a peace memorandum.</p>
