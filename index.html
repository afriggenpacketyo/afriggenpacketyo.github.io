          <p>Microsoft has fired two employees for unlawfully entering President Brad Smith's office during a protest against the company's alleged involvement in Israel's military actions in Gaza. The protesters, affiliated with "No Azure for Apartheid," demanded Microsoft cease its support for Israel, claiming its software was used for Palestinian surveillance. This incident follows earlier protests and arrests on campus, and Microsoft stated it is investigating and cooperating with law enforcement regarding these serious policy breaches. The company's action mirrors Google's previous termination of employees over similar protests.</p>

          <p>CDC Director Susan Monarez is embroiled in a standoff with the Trump administration, with her lawyers asserting she will not resign despite the White House declaring her terminated. Monarez is accused of refusing to endorse unscientific vaccine policy changes and high-level staff firings sought by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This conflict, which saw the FDA narrow COVID vaccine eligibility, has led to a wave of resignations from senior CDC officials protesting the "weaponizing of public health" and the politicization of science within the agency.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading Thursday after the Bank of Korea maintained its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, aligning with economists' expectations. While South Korea's Kospi saw a slight gain, other markets like Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 declined. Regional news included Australian rare earths producer Lynas planning a discounted share sale and Qantas achieving record-high shares due to strong earnings. India's Nifty 50 also opened lower following new U.S. tariffs, while Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings influenced chip stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank kept its policy rate at 2.5% for the second straight meeting, aiming to further assess housing prices and household debt. Despite stable inflation and "modest improvement" in economic growth, the Bank of Korea (BOK) upgraded its inflation forecast for 2025 to 2% and GDP growth to 0.9%. The BOK expects a modest recovery in domestic demand, though exports may slow due to expanding U.S. tariffs. This decision follows recent agreements between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Donald Trump, including significant investment pledges and reduced tariffs for Korean exports.

          <p>The 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's death is being observed with a commemorative train ride from Chicago to Mississippi, retracing the fateful journey he took in 1955. Organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, the ride includes his cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping. Till, then 14, was brutally lynched after allegedly whistling at a white woman, and his mother's decision for an open-casket funeral ignited the modern Civil Rights Movement. The event serves as a solemn reminder of racial injustice and a reflection on progress, with Parker emphasizing the importance of remembering history.</p>

While a Philippine Navy spokesman stated it would take more than a tugboat to remove the BRP Sierra Madre, these incidents signal a return to elevated tensions after a period of relative coexistence in the area.</p>

Rural depopulation also contributes by leaving abandoned land overgrown, exacerbating the problem. The fires pose severe risks to ecosystems, soil, water quality, and human health.</p>

          <p>A Hollywood producer, David Brown, has been indicted on 21 federal counts for allegedly defrauding film and business partners out of $12 million. Prosecutors claim Brown used investor money for personal luxuries, including expensive cars, houses, and even a surrogate, operating a Ponzi-like scheme. Despite burnishing his credentials with films like "The Fallout," Brown is accused of siphoning funds and concealing a history of fraud allegations. He is currently in federal custody and will enter a plea in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>All NATO member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, a significant increase since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and demands from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, only three members—Poland (4.48%), Lithuania (4%), and Latvia (3.73%)—are currently achieving the new, higher goal of 3.5%. While the U.S. contributes the most in absolute terms, its spending is estimated at 3.22% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but stressed the importance of converting funds into actual military capability.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two employees at an Ontario surgery center, Jose de Jesus Ortega and Danielle Nadine Davila, on felony charges of assaulting and interfering with U.S. immigration officers. The incident occurred when landscapers fled into the facility to evade an ICE raid. Court documents allege the staffers actively obstructed officers by physically intervening and demanding they leave without a warrant, while agents were attempting to detain an allegedly unauthorized immigrant.

          <p>The resale value of pre-owned Tesla Cybertrucks has plummeted, with the average price falling nearly 30% in the past year to just over $84,000. This trend reflects a broader decline in used Tesla values and declining new car sales, which some experts attribute to CEO Elon Musk. Despite initial hype and promises of a lower list price, the Cybertruck's higher release price and dwindling resale value have led to questions about its market viability. Tesla's unprecedented decision to stop accepting Cybertrucks as trade-ins further signals market struggles. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the stock slipped in extended trading as data center revenue fell slightly short of estimates for the second consecutive period. The company expects $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end. Nvidia's growth is primarily driven by its data center business, though it faced challenges with H20 chip shipments to China due to geopolitical factors.

          <p>Southern California is facing a growing threat of intense dust storms, known as haboobs, with experts linking their increased frequency and severity directly to climate change. Factors like drying conditions, water overuse, wildfires, and construction contribute to these storms, which can reach thousands of feet high and carry dust across vast distances. The consequences are severe, including health risks from disease- and chemical-laden particles, decreased air quality, and environmental damage. Researchers are actively studying these storms to improve forecasting and prepare Californians for their arrival.</p>
