          <h2>Germany's Fertility Rate Drops to a Near 20-Year Low</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 06:34:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's fertility rate fell to 1.35 children per woman in 2024, its lowest level since 2006, raising concerns about the country's long-term demographic and economic stability. The data from the Federal Statistical Office shows the decline is particularly sharp among women with German citizenship, whose rate dropped to 1.23, a level not seen since 1996. While the pace of the overall decline has slowed compared to previous years, the persistently low birth rate puts pressure on Germany's pension and healthcare systems. The trend also reflects a broader European pattern, with Germany's 2023 rate matching the EU average.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PepsiCo reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by performance outside of North America. However, the company is experiencing softer domestic demand, with sales volume declining by 1% for its food division and 2% for its beverage segment in the region. In response, PepsiCo is focusing on new product offerings, including protein-based and multicultural items, and improving in-store availability to boost its U.S. sales. The company has maintained its full-year financial outlook, anticipating stable earnings and low-single-digit revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Unemployment Rate Reaches Four-Year High as Job Market Weakens</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 06:22:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is showing signs of weakening, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.7%, its highest level in four years. According to the Office for National Statistics, the annual rate of pay growth also slowed, and the number of job vacancies has been falling for three consecutive years. Analysts suggest these trends increase the likelihood of the Bank of England cutting interest rates next month to stimulate the economy. Businesses are reportedly freezing recruitment and considering redundancies, partly attributing the slowdown to a recent rise in employer national insurance contributions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A lightning strike at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey, resulted in one death and thirteen injuries on Wednesday evening. The incident occurred during a children's competition at the Black Knight Bowbenders club, with victims as young as seven years old. A volunteer instructor said the storm appeared suddenly, and the strike "exploded" the earth. Robert Montgomery, a 61-year-old club member, was killed while volunteering to help with the event. The other injured individuals were transported to local hospitals for treatment of various injuries, including burns.</p>

          <p>Consumer advocates are raising concerns that the Trump administration's overhaul of the federal student loan system will make monthly payments unaffordable for many borrowers. The Biden-era SAVE plan is now defunct, and a new "big beautiful bill" is phasing out other income-driven repayment options. For new borrowers after July 2026, only two plans will be available, with one income-based option projected to have significantly higher monthly payments than the SAVE plan. Experts warn this could increase the risk of default, as borrowers may be left with no manageable way to handle their education debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Consumers in these markets favor smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles suited for congested cities and high gas prices, while U.S. automakers predominantly offer larger, more expensive SUVs and trucks.

The piece highlights the Mann Act's history of being used to target interracial couples and political opponents, suggesting its modern application remains a poor mechanism for justice.</p>

          <p>U.S. Marines and National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles by the Trump administration to handle unrest related to immigration raids have reportedly seen little action. With protests subsiding, many troops have been guarding federal buildings or stationed at a base in Orange County, with some describing their duties as fighting boredom. California's Governor and L.A.'s Mayor, who opposed the deployment, are calling for the complete removal of the remaining forces, arguing they are being used as "political pawns." The situation has highlighted a tense standoff between state and federal authorities over the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement.</p>

Organizers stated they worked through the night on solutions and that the festival's campsite opened as scheduled on Thursday. The main stage is a central feature of the massive festival, which attracts up to 400,000 attendees, and its loss is a significant blow just before the event's opening weekend.</p>

          <p>Cities across northern Taiwan, including the capital Taipei, held a mandatory air raid drill on Thursday to prepare citizens for a potential missile attack from China. At 1:30 p.m., sirens sounded, and for 30 minutes, streets were cleared as people were directed into shelters. The annual "Wan An" drill aims to enhance public awareness and readiness amid increasing military pressure from Beijing, which views the democratically governed island as its own territory. The exercise underscores the heightened tensions in the region and Taiwan's commitment to bolstering its civil defense capabilities.</p>

In a recent interview, Abbott reiterated her view that racism based on skin color is distinct from prejudice experienced by Jewish people or Travellers, as their ethnicity is not always visible. She had previously apologized for a similar statement in a 2023 letter. A Labour spokesperson stated the party takes the comments "incredibly seriously" and will assess them under its internal rules, highlighting ongoing sensitivities around antisemitism within the party.</p>

          <p>The rise of AI-generated music, exemplified by the viral "band" The Velvet Sundown, is causing significant concern within the music industry. Platforms like Suno and Udio allow for the easy creation of entire songs, which can then be uploaded to streaming services and generate revenue, posing a new form of competition for human artists. While some see AI as a creative tool, many musicians and industry professionals view it as a threat that could devalue human creativity and clog the market with "soulless" content. The trend has also sparked legal battles, with major record labels suing AI companies for alleged mass copyright infringement.</p>

          <p>A segment of Donald Trump's supporters is growing impatient with his administration over the promised release of files related to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Despite the Justice Department stating it found no evidence of a "client list," the issue has become a fixation for some, leading to a rare backlash from within the MAGA movement. While some loyalists express faith that Trump will release the documents when the time is right, others are demanding accountability and transparency.

According to reports based on the cockpit voice recorder, the first officer expressed panic and questioned why the captain had moved the fuel switches to the cut-off position. This action led to a catastrophic loss of thrust just after takeoff, killing all but one of the 242 people on board. Investigators are also reportedly examining the captain's medical history amid claims he suffered from mental health issues, though no conclusions have been finalized.</p>

          <p>A recent surge in deadly attacks by the al-Qaeda-linked group JNIM across Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger is raising fears about the group's strategic ambitions. Analysts suggest JNIM is shifting from rural guerrilla tactics to a campaign aimed at encircling capitals and establishing a de facto state. The group, which has killed hundreds of soldiers in recent months, is employing more sophisticated tactics and exploiting local grievances to expand its influence. This wave of violence marks one of the deadliest periods in the Sahel's recent history, underscoring the growing jihadist threat as regional governments distance themselves from Western military partners.</p>

The president also continues to face pressure from his base regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, though he has expressed confidence in his attorney general.

A new law allows the state to tap into a multi-million dollar account, originally funded by fees on insurance plans, to provide grants to abortion funds. These non-profits have seen a surge in requests for financial aid for procedures, travel, and lodging since the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
