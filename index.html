          <h2>Walmart Instructs Some Chinese Suppliers to Resume Shipping Amid Trade Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 23:00:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart has reportedly instructed some of its Chinese suppliers in key export regions to resume normal shipments to the United States, signaling a potential shift in trade dynamics. This decision comes after a period of slowed shipments due to escalating tariff hikes between the U.S. and China. The costs associated with the new import duties are expected to be absorbed by the U.S. clients, alleviating concerns for the Chinese manufacturers. This move suggests a possible recalibration of supply chains and trade relations amid ongoing economic tensions. </p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, is projected to secure a fourth consecutive victory in the federal election.

The election outcome suggests continued political stability and policy direction under the Liberal Party's leadership, though the final seat count will determine whether they form a majority or minority government.</p>

          <p>CNN's Harry Enten suggests that the Republican Party could face challenges in the upcoming midterm elections due to President Trump's declining poll numbers. Recent polling data indicates a significant shift in voter sentiment, particularly among independents, who now favor Democrats over Republicans by a substantial margin. Enten emphasizes that this shift could jeopardize the GOP's chances of retaining control of the House of Representatives. The analysis underscores the potential impact of presidential approval ratings on down-ballot races and the broader political landscape.</p>

          <p>Two federal judges who lost their homes in the Pacific Palisades fire have joined a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), alleging the utility failed to prepare for and respond to the wildfire adequately. The lawsuit claims that empty reservoirs and energized powerlines contributed to the fire's spread. The judges argue that LADWP was unprepared despite warnings of critical fire weather conditions. The suit has been consolidated with other similar cases against LADWP, seeking compensation for damages caused by the utility's alleged mismanagement.</p>

Cruz cautioned against permanently imposing high retaliatory tariffs, which he believes would be disastrous for the economy. He emphasized that Trump has a choice between two paths: one that leads to lower tariffs and increased trade, and another that results in protectionism and economic harm. This highlights the ongoing debate within the Trump administration regarding trade policy.</p>

The Houthis, backed by Iran, have been targeting ships in solidarity with Palestinians since the start of the conflict in Gaza.

          <p>The government is considering extending the sugar tax, formally known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to milkshakes and other milk-based drinks. The government is consulting on proposals to end the exemption from the tax for dairy-based drinks, as well as non-dairy substitutes such as oats or rice. The Treasury also confirmed proposals to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml. Opponents of the levy argue it disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.</p>
