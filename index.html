          <p>The fragile US-China trade truce is showing signs of unraveling as both countries accuse each other of breaching the agreement made last month. The deal, intended to pause the escalating trade war, involved slashing tariffs on imports. However, renewed tensions have emerged with the US expressing frustration over China's stalling on export licenses for rare earths, while China points to US curbs on chip design software. With the 90-day pause expiring soon, the prospects for a lasting ceasefire remain uncertain, and a call between Trump and Xi is anticipated to potentially break the deadlock.

          <p>Erin Patterson is on trial, accused of killing three relatives and attempting to murder another by serving them a beef Wellington containing death cap mushrooms. Prosecutors allege that Patterson used kitchen scales to weigh out a lethal dose of the toxic fungi, with photos found on her phone depicting mushrooms being measured. Patterson denies intentionally poisoning her guests, claiming it was a tragic accident and that the mushrooms may have been mixed accidentally. The trial has heard evidence that Patterson repeatedly lied to police about foraging mushrooms and having a food dehydrator, further complicating her defense.</p>

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator is warning women using weight-loss jabs that these medications may affect the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises women to use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro, and for a period afterward, due to potential harm to unborn babies. The agency also recommends that women on Mounjaro using oral contraceptives should use condoms for four weeks after starting the drug or switch to another contraceptive method. The MHRA is concerned that the growing popularity of these drugs means many women are not using them safely or receiving adequate advice.</p>

The defusal operation took approximately an hour, and while such discoveries are common in Germany, the prominent location near Cologne's historic center made this event particularly significant.

          <p>President Trump has signed a new travel ban restricting entry to the US from nationals of 12 countries, citing national security risks. Additionally, partial travel restrictions are imposed on nationals from seven other countries. The White House asserts that these restrictions will protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors, while critics are condemning the move as discriminatory and racist. The ban, set to take effect on Monday, includes exemptions for athletes traveling for major sporting events, lawful permanent residents, and dual nationals from unaffected countries, with the Secretary of State having the authority to grant individual exemptions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two major convenience store chains in Japan, Family Mart and Lawson, have begun selling government-released stockpiled rice at select stores in Tokyo and Osaka. This initiative aims to increase the availability of affordable rice for consumers struggling with rising prices. The rice, from the 2021 harvest, is being sold in smaller portions to make it accessible to individuals and smaller households. Other retailers are already selling it in larger bags, and these convenience stores are offering 1-kg and 2-kg packages with sales limited to one per customer.</p>

          <p>Automotive industry groups are expressing increasing concern over potential rare earth shortages due to China's recent export restrictions. Several European auto supplier plants and production lines have already experienced shutdowns, according to CLEPA, with warnings of further disruptions as inventories deplete. The restrictions, imposed in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff increases, affect rare earth elements and magnets crucial for both combustion engines and electric vehicles. The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) has warned that these restrictions could halt production, urging German and EU lawmakers to address the issue with China.</p>

The papers also cover the potential chaos of recovering the payments from bereaved families and Nigel Farage's call for all pensioners to receive the benefit. Immigration policies are also a key focus, with contrasting approaches from Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch highlighted. Other stories include the government's expansion of free school meals and Trump's tariffs increasing US debt.</p>

          <p>The article examines the increasing militarization of the US-Mexico border under President Trump, including the deployment of Stryker combat vehicles previously used in Iraq and Afghanistan. The use of military force to deter migrants has raised legal questions, particularly concerning the Posse Comitatus Act. The Pentagon has created National Defense Areas along the border, allowing the military to detain migrants as trespassers, leading to accusations of bypassing conventional distinctions between the armed forces and domestic police. Despite the increased military presence, migrant crossings have slowed, raising questions about the effectiveness and necessity of these tactics.</p>

          <p>The charity Thin Blue Paw is advocating for pensions to support retired police dogs, whose lives are often put at risk in the line of duty. These dogs, after years of service, are often adopted but come with significant medical needs, including chronic health issues and injuries. The charity estimates that adopting a retired police dog costs an average of Â£3,000 more per year compared to other dogs, and it can be difficult to find insurance. The article highlights stories of retired police dogs and the financial burdens faced by their adopters, arguing for a responsibility to provide them with the care they need in retirement.</p>

          <p>Japanese police investigated a record number of stalking cases in 2024, reaching the highest figure since the anti-stalking law was enacted in 2000. The increase is attributed to the National Police Agency's emphasis on stalking cases and closer coordination between prefectural headquarters and local stations. The data also revealed a record number of restraining orders issued, reflecting the heightened awareness and response to stalking incidents. The police revised their statistical methods in 2024 to include all relevant cases, regardless of when the initial consultation occurred.</p>

While the agreement includes compensation for families and improvements to Boeing's compliance programs, critics argue that the financial penalties are too lenient and do not adequately address the company's criminal liability.</p>

Biden has dismissed these claims as "ridiculous" and accuses Trump of attempting to distract from his administration's policies. The investigation follows increased scrutiny over Biden's mental and physical capacity, particularly after a new book alleged a cover-up of his "physical deterioration" during his re-election campaign.</p>

It emphasizes the need for indigenous manufacturing to mitigate rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals.
