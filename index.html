          <p>A shooting incident occurred at Emory University's Atlanta campus, resulting in the death of the suspect and serious injury to a law enforcement officer. The suspect, described as heavily armed, was located on the roof of a CVS where an exchange of gunfire with police took place. The event prompted a temporary shelter-in-place order for the campus, which is located near the CDC headquarters. The White House and state officials are monitoring the situation as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>Protests against the UK government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers are increasing, driven by local residents' safety concerns. An incident in Epping, Essex, involving an asylum seeker charged with sexual assault, has fueled demonstrations organized by community members, including some with far-right activist involvement. The article explores the tensions between locals, asylum seekers, and activist groups, highlighting a lack of official information about the hotel occupants, which contributes to community anger and fear. The government's policy is under scrutiny as the cost and social impact of the asylum hotels become more prominent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by Andrew Lownie, titled "Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York," provides a deeply unflattering portrayal of Prince Andrew, likely cementing his removal from public life. The book details his arrogance, poor judgment, and extensive connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, supported by numerous interviews and research. It recounts anecdotes of his rudeness and lavish lifestyle while also exploring a more vulnerable side, suggesting his behavior stems from a lonely and insecure upbringing. The biography is seen as severely damaging to his reputation and the monarchy.</p>

          <p>The city of Seoul has opened "warm-hearted convenience stores" as a novel approach to address growing social isolation and loneliness, particularly among young people and the elderly. These centers, which offer free ramen and a welcoming café-like atmosphere, have seen unexpectedly high visitor numbers since launching in March. The initiative aims to provide a safe space for connection and support, prompted by a rise in "lonely deaths" and the increasing prevalence of single-person households. The program seeks to destigmatize asking for help in a society grappling with the social side effects of rapid modernization.</p>

          <p>A recent trend of fans throwing sex toys onto the court during WNBA games is causing disruptions and drawing condemnation from players and coaches. Multiple incidents have occurred, with one game being paused in its final seconds, and two arrests have been made. Players have called the acts "super disrespectful" and immature, while coaches have labeled it a "distraction" and a form of sexualization. A meme-coin group has claimed responsibility for some of the incidents, stating they were viral stunts to promote their cryptocurrency, though not all occurrences appear to be linked.</p>

          <p>While the U.S. housing market remains tight overall, home prices are showing modest declines in certain regions, particularly in the South and West. A Realtor.com report indicates that cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant price drops from their 2022 peaks, largely due to increased housing inventory from a pandemic-era building boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face "sticky high" prices and limited supply, with cities like Milwaukee experiencing notable price increases. The data reveals a divided market driven primarily by regional supply and demand dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>USC cornerback Prophet Brown, who had been a standout performer in preseason camp, will miss the beginning of the season due to a noncontact injury. Coach Lincoln Riley confirmed Brown would be out for at least the first few games, a significant blow to the team's defense. Brown was considered a top contender for the starting slot corner position, and his absence will put more pressure on younger defensive backs to step up. Defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn had recently praised Brown as one of the most trusted players on the defense.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is demanding a $1 billion settlement from UCLA to restore hundreds of millions in suspended federal research grants. The administration froze the funding after a Department of Justice investigation concluded that UCLA was "deliberately indifferent to a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students" during pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024. The University of California president stated that a payment of this size would be devastating to the public university system. This action marks a significant escalation in the administration's targeting of universities over alleged civil rights violations.</p>

          <p>Health officials in China's Guangdong province are implementing a massive public health response to the country's largest-ever outbreak of the chikungunya virus, which has infected thousands. The mosquito-borne virus causes fever, rash, and severe joint pain. The response, reminiscent of COVID-19 tactics, includes widespread insecticide fogging and isolating infected individuals. While chikungunya is rarely fatal, the population's lack of immunity justifies some measures. The virus is spreading in a dense urban area, and experts warn it could move beyond the province despite declining case numbers.</p>
