          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, accompanied by key European and NATO leaders, will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington to discuss ending the war with Russia. This high-stakes meeting follows a Trump-Putin summit where the U.S. dropped its demand for a ceasefire, instead calling for a permanent peace deal. A U.S. envoy has suggested that Russia agreed to security guarantees for Ukraine similar to NATO's Article 5, a claim that European leaders are keen to clarify. The united front from European allies aims to support Zelensky and prevent a repeat of a previous contentious meeting with Trump.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region are largely expected to open higher as investors await further details from the upcoming talks between the U.S. and Ukraine. The recent conclusion of a U.S.-Russia summit without a ceasefire has shifted focus to the new diplomatic efforts. Meanwhile, U.S. equity futures saw a slight increase, driven by hopes for potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which contributed to a positive week on Wall Street. This market sentiment reflects cautious optimism about potential resolutions to geopolitical and economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler claimed victory at the BMW Championship with a stunning performance, highlighted by a miraculous chip-in for birdie from the rough on the 17th hole. This clutch shot secured a two-stroke win over Robert MacIntyre, marking Scheffler's fifth victory of the season. The win places him in elite company alongside Tiger Woods as the only players in the last 40 years to achieve at least five PGA Tour wins in consecutive seasons. Scheffler's dominant 2025 season also includes two major titles, bringing him closer to a career grand slam.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel engaged in a nationwide strike, blocking roads and closing businesses to pressure the government into securing a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the release of remaining hostages in Gaza. The demonstrations reflect growing public frustration after 22 months of war, with fears that a planned military offensive could further endanger the approximately 50 hostages still held. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the protests, claiming they benefit Hamas, while far-right cabinet members reiterated their opposition to any deal that leaves Hamas in power. The protests highlight deep divisions within Israel over the war's direction.</p>

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center warn that the storm is likely to strengthen again as it moves north of the Caribbean. While not expected to make a direct impact on the U.S. East Coast, its large size poses a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast coast. A tropical storm warning has been issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands and parts of the Bahamas, which are bracing for heavy rain and potential flooding.</p>

          <p>Several key European and NATO leaders are traveling to Washington to join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his crucial meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. This move is seen as a deliberate show of support for Zelensky, aimed at presenting a united front and avoiding a repeat of a contentious previous encounter in the Oval Office. European officials are reportedly concerned that Trump might pressure Ukraine into an unfavorable peace deal following his recent summit with Vladimir Putin. The collective presence underscores Europe's determination to have a voice in any potential resolution to the war in Ukraine.</p>

Among the additions are "skibidi," a versatile nonsense term from a viral YouTube series, and "tradwife," a portmanteau for "traditional wife." Other new entries reflect modern life, such as "mouse jiggler," a device for feigning work activity, and "broligarchy," describing powerful male tech leaders.

          <p>Scottish golfer Robert MacIntyre voiced his immense frustration after squandering a four-shot overnight lead to lose the BMW Championship to Scottie Scheffler. MacIntyre struggled on the final day, carding a three-over-par 73 after a "horrific start" that included three bogeys in the first five holes. He was unable to explain why his shots were traveling much farther than expected, leading to his poor performance. The loss was particularly bitter as Scheffler sealed his victory with a dramatic chip-in on the 17th hole, leaving MacIntyre to lament his collapse.</p>

          <p>A court-ordered ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai has sparked significant conflict between city authorities, health activists, and animal lovers. The ban was implemented due to health risks associated with pigeon droppings, which can cause respiratory illnesses. However, it has faced fierce opposition from protesters, including members of the Jain community for whom feeding pigeons is a religious duty. The debate highlights a clash between public health concerns and long-standing cultural and religious traditions, as pigeons are deeply woven into India's urban fabric.</p>

This trend indicates a significant structural improvement in the companies' business models and revenue streams. (not investment advice)</p>

In contrast, his opponents, co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns, argue for continuing the more moderate, locally-focused strategy that led to record electoral success in the last general election.

Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump appears to have shifted his stance, abandoning calls for a ceasefire and seeming open to Ukraine ceding territory, a move Ukrainian officials view as a betrayal. This analysis suggests that Zelensky and his European allies face the difficult challenge of steering Trump back to a unified position without antagonizing him.

          <p>Recent trade negotiations between the United States and China signal a mutual interest in de-escalating tensions and establishing a more stable, albeit competitive, relationship. According to Jing Qian of the Asia Society, both nations recognized the need for a "breathing space" amid market volatility and dimmed global economic forecasts. The talks, described as a continuation of principles set by both presidents, involved high-level officials from both sides engaging in tough negotiations. The outcome suggests a strategic move towards managing their rivalry rather than seeking outright confrontation, aiming for a more predictable economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The D.C. National Guard has stated that its members deployed on the streets of Washington, D.C., as part of the Trump administration's increased policing initiative "may be armed." This appears to be a shift from an earlier Army statement that Guard members would not carry weapons and would primarily serve as a "visible crime deterrent." The deployment, which is part of a plan that also federalized the city's police, has been met with significant criticism from local officials and residents who view it as a federal overreach. The move raises concerns about the role of the military in civilian law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a restraining order preventing former congressman Beto O'Rourke and his political group, Powered by People, from sending funds raised in Texas to Democratic lawmakers who left the state. The Democrats fled to prevent a quorum for a special legislative session on a controversial Republican-led redistricting plan. The order was granted in response to a complaint from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argued the fundraising was deceptive. The ruling escalates the political and legal battle over the redistricting effort, which has drawn national attention.</p>

          <p>A critical error by Manchester United's goalkeeper Altay Bayindir led to the only goal in a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford. Manager Ruben Amorim's decision to start Bayindir over the recently fit Andre Onana backfired when the Turkish keeper failed to handle a corner, allowing Arsenal to score easily. The mistake has reignited debate about the club's goalkeeping situation, a position that has been a point of concern. Despite a more threatening attack, United could not overcome the early deficit, putting the focus squarely on the goalkeeping controversy.</p>
