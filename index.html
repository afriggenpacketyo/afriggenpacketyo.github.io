          <p>Criminal organizations are exploiting legal loopholes in Europe to smuggle ketamine, a dual-use substance, for illicit sale. Ketamine is classified as a legal medicine in some countries, making it easier to transport across borders. Smugglers are switching ketamine for salt or sugar during transit and establishing front companies to import it under the guise of legitimate use, then diverting it into illicit markets. The BBC reports that European police forces are planning to liaise with Indian authorities to tackle the problem at the source, as Germany imports far more than they need for medical use. The rise in ketamine consumption has led to an increase in deaths and health problems.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government will release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to combat rising prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that the rice, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, will be sold directly to retailers at a reduced price. This move aims to alleviate shortages in stores and address public frustration over elevated rice prices, which have doubled compared to the previous year. The ministry suspects some wholesalers and farmers are hoarding rice in anticipation of further price increases. The government hopes that releasing the cheaper rice will bring down overall prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>A civilian think tank in Taiwan has initiated a two-day war game involving retired US and Japanese generals to simulate the island’s defense against a potential military attack from mainland China. The Taipei School of Economics and Political Science Foundation organized the exercise to identify defense issues that Taiwan urgently needs to address and provide recommendations to the government. The simulation aims to discuss the feasibility of Taiwan’s military strategy and operational concepts in response to a hypothetical Chinese invasion by 2030. Invitees include former high-ranking military officials such as Michael Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Takei Tomohisa, a former chief of staff of Japan’s Maritime Self-Defence Force.</p>

          <p>Israeli authorities are preparing to deport a group of activists, including Greta Thunberg, who were detained aboard a Gaza-bound aid boat. The yacht, carrying 12 people attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, was intercepted by Israeli forces and towed to Ashdod. Israel has dismissed the effort as a "selfie yacht" and stated that those who refuse to sign deportation documents will be brought before a judicial authority. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the vessel, said the boat was carrying symbolic aid to Gaza in defiance of an Israeli naval blockade. The incident highlights ongoing tensions surrounding aid delivery to Gaza and Israel's security measures.</p>

The response from senior civil servants stated that while the department wanted to see "healthy challenge", resignation was an "ultimate recourse" for those with profound disagreements.

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an unprecedented decline in world fertility rates. The report indicates that hundreds of millions of people are unable to have the number of children they desire, citing the prohibitive cost of parenthood and the lack of suitable partners as primary reasons. UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people in 14 countries, with one in five respondents saying they have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The findings reveal that financial limitations are a significant factor, with 39% of people citing this as a barrier to having children.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have seen a significant decline, particularly due to a reduction in fatalities caused by fentanyl. Data from the CDC indicates that fatal overdoses among those under 35 dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Experts attribute this trend to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and less risky drug use among teens. However, challenges remain for individuals with severe addiction, and potential cuts in funding for addiction services could jeopardize this progress.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests following immigration raids, leading to arrests and the deployment of National Guard troops by President Donald Trump. The protests began after ICE officers conducted raids in areas with large Latino populations, resulting in clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Trump has deployed additional troops and marines to the city, sparking a political row with state politicians. The unrest has included vehicles being set alight, a freeway being shut down, and reports of looting, prompting police to declare downtown LA an "unlawful assembly" area.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized President Donald Trump's deployment of thousands more troops to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration raids, calling the move "deranged".

Protests have spread to other US cities, with demonstrators taking to the streets after ICE officers raided Latino areas.

          <p>More than 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have signed an open letter criticizing the Trump administration's policies, expressing concerns that research is being politicized and that budget and staff cuts are hindering the agency's ability to conduct important research. The letter calls for the reinstatement of staff and the restoration of funding. Scientists speaking in their personal capacity say they have tried to raise concerns internally without success, leading to the urgency of speaking out publicly. The NIH director has responded that the letter contains misconceptions but acknowledges that respectful dissent in science is productive.</p>
