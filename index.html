          <p>Two Labour MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, were denied entry to Israel while attempting to visit the West Bank, sparking criticism from UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Israeli authorities accused the MPs of intending to "spread hate speech" and supporting boycotts against Israel, citing their past statements on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch defended Israel's right to control its borders, while the MPs expressed their dismay and concern over parliamentarians being targeted for expressing their views. The UK Foreign Office has offered support to the MPs, emphasizing the importance of allowing parliamentarians to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory firsthand.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are investigating the death of a rare snow leopard found on a mountain highway in Qinghai province, suspecting it was a hit-and-run incident. Tyre marks with traces of blood were discovered near the animal's body, prompting a police inquiry. Snow leopards are a protected species in China, with approximately 5,000 living in the wild, and the local grasslands bureau urged drivers to exercise caution due to frequent wildlife activity in the area. The snow leopard is listed as 'vulnerable' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover Automotive is pausing shipments to the United States in response to the 25% tariff on vehicle imports imposed by President Donald Trump, a move expected to be followed by other British carmakers. The company stated the pause would allow them to address the new trading terms and develop mid- to longer-term plans for the US market, which is important for JLR's luxury brands. Analysts anticipate similar actions from other producers as the tariffs add pressure to an industry already facing declining demand and the need to transition to electric vehicles. The UK car industry is heavily reliant on exports, with the US being a major market.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent suggestions about seeking a third term in office, despite constitutional limits, have sparked debate and concern.

The idea has gained traction among some Republicans, raising questions about the erosion of democratic norms and the potential for political upheaval. Democrats are countering Trump's remarks by reaffirming support for the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms.</p>

          <p>Experts are raising concerns that the Trump administration's decision to move the federal student loan program to the Small Business Administration (SBA) could put borrowers at risk of defaulting. The SBA's lack of experience with student loans, combined with recent changes to repayment plans and workforce reductions, are cited as reasons for concern. The move comes as the Biden administration's Save Plan faces legal challenges, adding to the uncertainty for borrowers. Some suggest the Treasury Department would be a more suitable agency to manage the complex student loan system.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese seismologists warns of a heightened risk of major earthquakes in China and neighboring regions, linking seismic cycles to fluctuations in the Earth's rotation. The research, published shortly before a devastating earthquake struck Myanmar, has sparked debate about whether the planet's tectonic stress fields are entering a dangerous new phase. The study analyzed 150 years of seismic data to identify six major earthquake "active periods" correlating with shifts in the Earth's rotational speed.</p>

          <p>The article examines the concept of the "white working class," arguing that its distinctiveness is often misrepresented and misunderstood. It challenges the notion that ethnicity is the primary factor defining this group, instead emphasizing the role of geography and socioeconomic factors. The author highlights the diversity within the white working class and critiques the use of "ventriloquised xenophobia" to portray their views on immigration. The article also questions the decline of class politics and the left's neglect of working-class interests.</p>

          <p>The article argues that Britain should not be cowed by President Trump's trade policies but should instead seize opportunities in Europe, Canada, and beyond. It criticizes Trump's view of trade and his imposition of tariffs, calling for Britain to combine with other nations to sustain a rules-based global trading system. The article suggests closer ties with Canada and the Commonwealth, advocating for a new global trade order that challenges US dominance.

          <p>The PLA's Shandong aircraft carrier is believed to have taken an alternative route to the east of Taiwan ahead of a drill last week. Analysts say this move was likely to be training to counter American warships nearby and to explore alternative routes in the event of a conflict over the island. The Shandong appears to have bypassed the wider waterways between Taiwan and the Philippines, instead transiting via narrower waterways of the Philippine archipelago. This new route could give the PLA alternative southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel.</p>

          <p>Southampton's poor performance this season has raised the possibility of them surpassing Derby County as the worst team in Premier League history. Derby County's record of 11 points in the 2007-08 season is currently the lowest in the league's history. With Southampton currently sitting at 10 points with eight games to go, they could break this record. Their relegation could be confirmed as early as Sunday if they lose at Tottenham.</p>
