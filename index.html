          <p>In a case that hinged on modern technology, investigators in Wisconsin solved the 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden. Her boyfriend, initially the prime suspect, was exonerated by data from his Fitbit which confirmed his alibi. Police then used DNA evidence to identify a new suspect, George Burch, and location data from his Google account to trace his movements on the night of the crime. This digital trail placed Burch at the scene of the abduction and where the body was found, leading to his conviction and a life sentence, highlighting the pivotal role of personal tech data in criminal justice.</p>

          <p>Actress Jennifer Love Hewitt has commented on long-standing rumors of a feud with her "I Know What You Did Last Summer" co-star, Sarah Michelle Gellar. Hewitt stated she has not spoken to Gellar since the movie's release when she was 18, dismissing the speculation as a manufactured narrative. The rumors intensified after Gellar made seemingly curt remarks and omitted Hewitt from a social media post, which she later explained were due to NDA concerns and an Instagram tagging issue. Despite not interacting at a recent premiere, both actresses have publicly expressed positive sentiments toward one another, attempting to quell the persistent online gossip.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 22:00:20 EDT</div>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly revised the number of people considered missing following devastating floods earlier in the month. Through extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies, the count of unaccounted-for individuals has dropped from a peak of over 160 to just three. Many who were initially reported missing have since been verified as safe. This update brings a measure of relief to the community, which suffered 107 fatalities in the disaster, part of a statewide death toll exceeding 130. Authorities expressed gratitude for the tireless efforts of the more than 1,000 responders involved in the recovery operations.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive six-try win against the US Eagles in a match marked by significant weather delays in Washington D.C. Despite the challenging humidity and lightning interruptions, the English side, featuring several new players, demonstrated superior precision and control. The US team struggled, committing errors that led to several of England's tries, including an early score after a US player was sin-binned. England established a 19-0 lead by halftime and continued to dominate, finishing with a final score of 38-5. The event drew a record crowd for a women's game and a large attendance for the men's match.</p>

          <p>Players at the WNBA All-Star Game made a unified statement by wearing warm-up shirts that read "Pay us what you owe us." This protest follows stalled negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the players' union and the league. The players, who opted out of their last CBA, are seeking an improved revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, better benefits, and a more flexible salary cap. With a large discrepancy reported between the players' demands and the league's offers, prominent players have suggested a potential walkout if a new deal is not reached by the October deadline, underscoring the serious nature of the dispute.</p>

          <p>More than three years after his death, charges have been filed in the case of Iran Moreno, a 13-year-old boy killed by a stray bullet in his Pasadena home. Muhammad Abdul-Malik, 38, and Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings, 31, face murder charges for allegedly being the shooter and getaway driver, respectively. Authorities stated Moreno was not the intended target. A breakthrough came from recently enhanced surveillance video and subsequent police sketches, which led to the suspects' arrests. The case had previously highlighted concerns over gun violence in the community, with officials now expressing their commitment to securing justice for the Moreno family.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans for a new law aimed at stopping violent individuals before they can carry out mass attacks. The proposed legislation would target those who plan mass killings but lack a specific ideological motive, a gap exposed by the Southport attack. Currently, terror suspects can be jailed for life for preparing an attack, but this doesn't apply to individuals without a clear ideology. The new power would allow police to apprehend suspects for preparatory actions, such as researching a target, mirroring existing counter-terrorism laws. This move aims to address the growing threat from lone, violence-obsessed individuals radicalized online.</p>

The former president has vehemently denied the report, calling the letter a fake. The lawsuit faces a high legal bar, as public figures must prove "actual malice."

The government plans to launch a new campaign, reminiscent of the 1980s "Tell Sid" ads, to promote investment and will require banks to inform customers with money in low-interest accounts about investment opportunities. The discussion also includes potentially reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize a shift to stocks and shares ISAs.

          <p>A widely circulated image claiming to show Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein posing with a young girl has been confirmed as a fake, created using artificial intelligence. The image, which has resurfaced multiple times on social media, contains several telltale signs of AI generation, such as deformed hands, distorted faces in the background, and unnatural body positioning. A reverse-image search revealed a full version of the picture with even more obvious AI flaws. While authentic photographs of Trump and Epstein together do exist from the past, this specific, incriminating image is a fabrication and serves as an example of AI-driven misinformation.</p>

The incident resulted in the deaths of at least 34 people, with a search continuing for eight individuals who remain missing. According to state media, all victims were Vietnamese tourists, including approximately 20 children. Strong winds reportedly caused the vessel, named the Wonder Sea, to overturn. Rescue workers managed to save 11 people, including a 14-year-old boy who was trapped in the hull for four hours, as a tropical storm approaches the region.</p>

          <p>A new season of the Iowa Public Radio podcast "Unsettled" examines the multifaceted gender gap in the United States, moving beyond the pay gap to explore divides in politics, education, and concepts of masculinity. The series was inspired by the growing gender divide in voting patterns among young people, which has been amplified by the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the influence of social media. The podcast also delves into the education achievement gap, where boys are increasingly falling behind, and concludes by featuring diverse male voices discussing what it means to be a man in 2025, advocating for a more authentic and less rigid definition of manhood.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating the death of a 61-year-old man who was fatally injured after being pulled into an MRI machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. The man was reportedly wearing a large metallic chain when he entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress. The machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the chain, drawing the man into the device and causing a fatal "medical episode." The FDA warns that the strong static magnetic fields of MRI machines pose significant physical hazards by attracting metallic objects, which can become dangerous projectiles, underscoring the critical need for careful screening of people and items entering the environment.</p>

          <p>After years of rapid growth, interest in learning Mandarin appears to be waning in the United States and other Western countries. Data from the U.S., UK, and New Zealand shows significant drops in university and secondary school enrollments for Chinese language studies since their peaks in the mid-to-late 2010s. While once hailed as the language of the future due to China's economic rise, the decline is notable. This shift reflects a changing geopolitical and cultural landscape, as students and institutions reassess the linguistic skills needed for the future. Even in European countries where Mandarin learning is still growing, the pace is modest compared to other popular languages.</p>

The pledge is part of a broader plan to reform the water sector, which also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and reducing phosphorus pollution.

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and is threatening to terminate a major partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions that forced airlines to relocate from Mexico City's main airport to a newer, more distant one, which the U.S. claims violates a bilateral trade agreement. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the actions give Mexican airlines an unfair advantage and that all Mexican carriers must now seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. The decision could escalate trade tensions and significantly impact air travel between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

A former State Department lawyer suggests this policy is a departure from decades of U.S. practice, which avoided sending people to countries where they might face persecution. Critics argue these deals, which may involve financial incentives for receiving nations, turn deportees into political pawns and violate international obligations like the Refugee Convention.
