          <p>India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after escalating tensions, with President Trump announcing U.S. mediation, a claim India disputed, and later accusing Pakistan of violating the truce hours later. Explosions were reported in Indian-administered Kashmir, and residents reported a blackout in Srinagar and Jammu. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of breaching the agreement and retaliating, while Pakistan denied any violations, marking the latest development in the ongoing conflict between the two nuclear powers. Despite the ceasefire announcement, reports of cross-border shelling and gunfire continued, underscoring the fragility of the agreement and the deep-seated tensions between the nations.</p>

          <p>Heavy flooding in eastern Congo, triggered by torrential rains, resulted in at least 62 fatalities and 50 missing individuals as entire villages were swept away along Lake Tanganyika's shores. The village of Kasaba was particularly devastated, with witnesses recounting the floods surging early Friday morning. Rescue operations are being hampered by a lack of resources and communication infrastructure, with the Red Cross being the only humanitarian organization currently on-site. The disaster compounds the existing humanitarian crisis in the region, which has been exacerbated by decades of conflict between government forces and rebel groups.</p>

          <p>As the Philippines prepares for midterm elections, many young voters are advocating for an end to political dynasties, which they believe hinder effective governance and perpetuate inequality. A recent report indicated that a significant number of provincial governments are led by members of political dynasties, some of which are considered "obese" with numerous family members seeking elected positions. Critics argue that these dynasties prioritize self-enrichment over the needs of the Filipino people, particularly in areas such as education and healthcare. While political dynasties are technically prohibited by the 1987 constitution, the rule has never been enforced, leading to calls for greater accountability and reform.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Homeland Security to add 20,000 officers to bolster deportation efforts, as part of the administration's plan to incentivize undocumented immigrants to self-deport.

This move comes as other deportation methods have faced legal challenges, and the administration seeks to expand its reach by deputizing local law enforcement to assist with border enforcement.

          <p>Chelsea Women's Football team completed an "immaculate" season in the Women's Super League (WSL), finishing unbeaten and 12 points clear of their nearest rivals. The team, led by a new manager, demonstrated consistency and resilience throughout the campaign, often securing narrow victories and scoring crucial goals in the late stages of matches. The team's success was attributed to their mentality and ability to find ways to win, even when performances were not at their best. With this win, Chelsea remains the best team in England for the past five years.</p>

          <p>Officials from the United States and China have initiated trade talks in Geneva, Switzerland, marking the first face-to-face discussions since President Trump imposed new tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods. The meetings aim to address the ongoing trade war that has disrupted financial markets and bilateral trade. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are leading the U.S. delegation, while China's vice premier for economic affairs, He Lifeng, is the confirmed participant for China. While a swift resolution is unlikely, the commencement of talks is viewed as a positive step towards de-escalation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is fast-tracking refugee applications for a small number of white South Africans, citing persecution by the Black-led government, leading to controversy and raising questions about prioritization. The South African government denies these allegations, stating that Afrikaners are among the most economically privileged in the country. Claims of persecution center on farm attacks and affirmative action policies, with the U.S. alleging racial motivation and government inaction. Critics argue that these claims are exaggerated and that the refugee program disproportionately favors Afrikaners over other vulnerable groups.</p>

The settlement covers two decades of sexual assaults by Hadden, with previous settlements already exceeding $200 million. Victims accuse the hospitals of knowing about Hadden's behavior and allowing him to continue practicing medicine, with some calling for greater accountability and patient protection. Hadden was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring patients across state lines to sexually abuse them.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Barry Diller's memoir, "Who Knew," shares his perspective on decision-making, emphasizing the importance of instinct over relying solely on data and research. Diller argues that data can be harmful to instinct and that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea. He uses examples from his career at ABC, including the success of "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," to illustrate the power of trusting one's gut feeling. He also criticizes the over-reliance on data by MBA students, highlighting the need for simple human instinct in business decisions.</p>

          <p>At least seven people have died in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, after a combination of heavy rains, an overwhelmed drainage system, and a growing urban population led to severe flooding. Several houses collapsed, and major roads were severely damaged, leaving residents stranded and disrupting public transport. In response to the disaster, the country's energy and water ministry reported that the rainfall exceeded 115 mm in over 8 consecutive hours. The ministry also issued a warning about flash floods in other regions outside the capital.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration patterns by affecting food sources, increasing extreme weather events, and changing habitat conditions, according to a DW report. Warmer temperatures may lead to shorter migration routes or abandonment of traditional habitats, while rising sea levels threaten coastal stopover points. The slender-billed curlew was declared extinct in 2024, believed to have failed to adapt to habitat loss. Recommendations include expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly environments to mitigate the risks posed to migratory birds.</p>
