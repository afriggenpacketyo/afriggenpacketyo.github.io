          <p>According to witnesses and medics, Israeli military forces killed 23 Palestinians near an aid distribution site in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry reports over 400 Palestinians have died in similar incidents since late May, while al-Awda hospital confirmed receiving 23 bodies and over 100 wounded. Witnesses claim tanks and drones fired on thousands near a US- and Israeli-backed aid center. Local sources suggest the renewed strikes may be targeting Hamas security elements attempting to reassert control amid a breakdown in law and order, coinciding with a temporary easing of Israeli aerial surveillance due to the focus on Iran. The Israeli military launched their campaign in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and the ongoing conflict has resulted in a dire humanitarian situation for the people of Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a national security expert, a U.S. attack on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility may not be effective, even with massive bunker-buster bombs. The facility is said to be built 300 feet deep inside a mountain and reinforced with concrete, making it a difficult target. Joe Cirincione, who has researched nuclear proliferation, suggests that even the GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, capable of penetrating 200 feet, may not guarantee success. Cirincione also noted that even if there's some damage done, Iran's government has the knowledge, experience and enough enriched uranium and centrifuges in other locations to move forward with relative ease.</p>

          <p>Apollo, a U.S. asset management firm, is set to provide a £4.5 billion loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK to address a funding shortfall. This private capital investment aims to support the construction of two nuclear reactors, the first to be built in Britain in decades. China General Nuclear Power Corp (CGN) halted its funding in late 2023, leaving EDF to finance the project alone, with the first reactor expected to be online in 2029. The Hinkley Point C project is expected to generate electricity for around six million homes when complete, highlighting the UK government's commitment to nuclear energy despite controversies.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activists broke into RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and sprayed two military planes with red paint.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the act as "disgraceful," and the Ministry of Defence is expected to review security at UK military bases. Palestine Action said the activists used repurposed fire extinguishers to spray red paint into the planes' engines, similar to a previous incident in Ireland.</p>

Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff and Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi have been in communication, though no meetings are planned. The administration cites heavy losses in Iran's senior leadership and nuclear policy experts as a reason for giving Iran "breathing room."

          <p>States are increasingly offering tax breaks to attract data centers, resulting in the forfeiture of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue. These exemptions benefit tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, but watchdog groups question the tradeoffs, citing low job creation and high electricity consumption. A CNBC analysis found that 42 states provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to data centers, with 16 states granting nearly $6 billion in exemptions over the past five years. Some states, like Virginia, classify the exemption as a "moderate economic benefit" despite the lost revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

An amber heat-health alert is in place until Monday, with the UKHSA warning of likely significant pressures across health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths among vulnerable populations.

          <p>Experts express concern that pandemic preparedness is "dramatically eroding" under the Trump administration due to controversial dismissals, lackluster responses to outbreaks, and weakened monitoring systems. They cite issues such as a lack of quality information from officials, reduced virus monitoring, and public health cuts at all levels. The H5N1 outbreak has been plagued by incomplete information, and fewer people are being tested after exposure to sick animals. The cancellation of a $766m contract with Moderna for H5N1 vaccine research also raises concerns.</p>

          <p>Despite claims of a rightward shift among Gen Z voters, recent data suggests this may be a misinterpretation of a one-off election event. While young adults voted for Trump at a higher rate in 2024 compared to 2020, they have not become more likely to identify as conservative or hold broadly conservative views. In fact, young adults have become less likely to identify as conservative since 2008, and their positions on specific political issues are mostly more liberal than previous generations. The shift appears to be driven by young independent voters who broke for Trump in 2024 due to dissatisfaction with the economy.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado is pitching a democratic Venezuela as a trillion-dollar opportunity to attract international investors. Machado's team highlighted sectors like tourism, real estate, and fossil fuels, projecting 10% annual growth and $1.7 trillion in potential gains over 15 years. The presentation to Wall Street did not address the precondition for unlocking this bonanza: the end of a 26-year dictatorship whose leader doesn’t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon. Machado appears to be trying to reconcile both sides, and has a message for the pragmatists: Working with us will bring more financial benefits than dealing with Maduro.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how the top priority of progressive politics, expanding the welfare state, may be slipping out of reach due to political and economic factors. Democrats face challenges in winning full control of the federal government and have grown averse to raising taxes on anyone but the super-rich. The potential passage of President Donald Trump’s tax cut plan could further elevate interest rates and inflationary risk, limiting space for new welfare programs. The article suggests that Democrats may need to scale back their ambitions or find a way to enact broad-based tax increases to fund a comprehensive welfare state.</p>

          <p>Multiple analysts predict that Bitcoin's value could nearly double by the end of 2025, potentially reaching $200,000. Bernstein calls its year-end estimate "high-conviction and conservative," while Standard Chartered analysts foresee a series of sharp increases. Bitwise analysts estimate Bitcoin's fair value at $230,000 but expect it to reach $200,000 by year-end, and 21Shares strategists also anticipate the cryptocurrency hitting this mark. Factors supporting this increase include rising U.S. fiscal debt, shifting ETF flows from gold to Bitcoin, and cooler inflation potentially leading to reduced interest rates.

          <p>A new PBS documentary, *Caregiving*, explores the historical context behind the lack of resources and support for family caregivers in America. The film traces the evolution of caregiving policies, from early 20th-century almshouses to the exclusion of domestic workers from Social Security benefits and Medicare's decision not to cover long-term care. Activists are now trying to craft a new era of caregiving policy, with some signs of progress, including proposed tax credits for family caregivers. The director noted the overwhelming response they received when announcing the project, highlighting the urgent need for this story to be told.</p>

The Guardian Council ensures legislation aligns with Islamic principles, and the Expediency Discernment Council mediates disputes.

The items, with their allure of “unknown surprises,” have become highly sought-after by young consumers, but hide “commercial traps” that induce impulsive spending.
