          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones stated that the decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons was based on salary cap mathematics rather than any personal issues. He explained that trading one player on a massive contract allows the team to afford multiple other top-tier players, increasing overall on-field availability and depth. This context follows Parsons signing a record-breaking contract with the Green Bay Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the City of Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu, and the Police Commissioner over its sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit alleges that the city is violating federal law by refusing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, specifically targeting the Boston Trust Act.

          <p>Lululemon's stock plunged after the company issued a full-year earnings and revenue forecast that fell significantly short of Wall Street estimates, largely attributing the reduction to the financial impact of tariffs. Although its second-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, a slight revenue miss and slowing comparable sales growth raised concerns. CEO Calvin McDonald acknowledged that the brand's product offerings have become "stale" and outlined plans to innovate and refresh styles to regain momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas Representative Ronny Jackson has filed a federal lawsuit against California Governor Gavin Newsom, labeling the state's new "Election Rigging Response Act" as unconstitutional and retaliatory. The law, if approved by voters, would allow for the creation of a new, more partisan congressional map specifically designed to counteract a recent Republican-favored redistricting plan in Texas. The suit argues that this action violates California's own constitution by permitting partisan gerrymandering and unfairly altering the power dynamics in Congress.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Key takeaways include Kennedy's defense of firing CDC Director Susan Monarez, whom he accused of lying, and his heated clashes with both Republican and Democratic senators over vaccine access and safety. The hearing underscored growing confusion over new COVID-19 vaccine guidelines and Kennedy's combative defense of his leadership.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race has seen a new level of political maneuvering after former Governor Andrew Cuomo challenged Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani to a series of debates. In response, Mamdani dismissed Cuomo as a "puppet" and instead challenged President Trump himself to a debate. This development occurs amid reports that the Trump administration is attempting to persuade other candidates to exit the race, aiming to create a direct contest between Cuomo and Mamdani.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Postal Service facility in Torrance, California, has been temporarily shut down and thousands of pieces of mail and packages have been destroyed following the discovery of asbestos contamination. Although tests confirmed no asbestos in air ducts or public-facing areas, its presence elsewhere in the building prompted the immediate closure and relocation of services. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is overseeing the disposal of all contaminated mail in adherence with federal and state safety protocols.</p>

          <p>Florida has become the first state in the nation to eliminate all vaccine mandates for children attending school, a decision announced by the state's surgeon general. The policy was justified on the grounds of individual rights and bodily autonomy, with the surgeon general questioning the government's right to compel medical decisions for children. Public health experts warn that this move, which aligns with the agenda of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., risks dismantling herd immunity and could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in San Francisco has ordered Google to pay $425.7 million in damages for violating the privacy of nearly 98 million U.S. smartphone users. The verdict in the class-action lawsuit concluded that the tech giant improperly tracked users' online activity between 2016 and 2024, even when they had enabled privacy settings to prevent it. While Google has denied any wrongdoing and plans to appeal, lawyers for the plaintiffs celebrated the outcome as a major victory for consumer privacy rights.</p>

The massive funding cut directly led to the elimination of over 400 jobs, contributing to the leadership change amid a broader political campaign targeting higher education.</p>

          <p>This article provides an analysis of the complex and debated legacy of Daniel Levy, who has stepped down as Tottenham Hotspur's executive chairman after nearly 25 years. He is widely acknowledged for transforming the club's business operations and infrastructure, building a world-class stadium and making the club highly profitable. However, his tenure is simultaneously defined by a stark lack of on-field trophies and a high turnover of managers, which has made him a deeply polarizing and contentious figure among the team's supporters.</p>
