          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling widespread predictions.

The New York Giants traded back into the first round to pick Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart, marking a night of surprises and strategic maneuvers for various teams as the draft was held in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

          <p>California's economy has overtaken Japan's, making it the fourth-largest globally, with a GDP of $4.10 trillion in 2024. Governor Gavin Newsom attributed this growth to California's leadership in manufacturing, agriculture, and technology. This places California behind only the US, China, and Germany in economic size. However, Newsom expressed concern that the state's progress is threatened by the federal administration's tariff policies, which disrupt global markets and trade.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants traded with the Houston Texans to select former Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart with the No. 25 pick in the NFL Draft. Dart, known for his passing ability and running threat, will be the youngest QB in the NFL for the 2025 season. The Giants' interest in Dart was fueled by speculation after their general manager's son shared a video of Dart on social media. Dart's stock rose during the draft process due to his performance at the NFL combine, and he shares an alma mater with Giants legend Eli Manning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robert Douglas, the founder of the Black Dog on Martha’s Vineyard, has died at the age of 93. Douglas transformed his tavern's logo, inspired by his Labrador-boxer mix, into an internationally recognized emblem of summertime. He initially moved to Martha's Vineyard in 1960 and designed the topsail schooner, the Shenandoah. He later established the Black Dog restaurant as a reliable gathering place at the harbor, known for its New England chowder.</p>
