          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap has issued an apology to the families of Sir David Amess and Jo Cox, two murdered Members of Parliament in the UK, following the emergence of a video where a band member appeared to advocate violence against Tory MPs. The group denies inciting violence and condemns attacks on civilians, stating they do not support Hamas or Hezbollah. Their statement comes amidst scrutiny from counter-terrorism police and calls for the revocation of government funding. The Prime Minister's office has deemed their comments completely unacceptable and has halted further public funds to the group.</p>

          <p>An angry mob mistakenly targeted a home in Santa Ana, California, believing it belonged to the brother of Alejandro Oliveros Acosta, who was recently released on bail after allegedly confessing to killing dozens of cats. The crowd vandalized the property and pepper-sprayed the resident, who is related to Acosta's brother-in-law but claims to have had no contact with him since the arrest. Police have condemned the violence and vandalism, declaring the assembly unlawful. The Santa Ana Police Department is investigating Acosta for multiple reports of animal abuse and killings in the neighborhood.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal party is projected to win the Canadian election, although without a majority, according to CBC and CTV News. The election was heavily influenced by US President Donald Trump's renewed calls for Canada to become the 51st state, a proposition rejected by both Carney and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. The election took place amidst a cost-of-living crisis and threats of tariffs from the US, prompting both candidates to pledge efforts toward a free trade deal. Early voting saw a record turnout, potentially influenced by Trump's statements.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is now targeting unaccompanied minors for deportation as part of a broader immigration crackdown. The Department of Homeland Security is conducting "welfare checks" on children who arrived in the US alone, often across the US-Mexican border, sparking concerns about "backdoor family separation." The president has also signed executive orders targeting "sanctuary cities" that obstruct federal immigration laws. These actions are generating fears and alarm among critics who view them as overly aggressive and harmful to vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following allegations that the legal journal selected articles based on the authors' race rather than merit. These investigations are in response to information about policies and practices for journal membership and article selection that may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This action comes amidst an ongoing feud between the Trump administration and Harvard over demands that the university dismantle its DEI programs and screen international students for ideological red flags.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is reorganizing its diversity, equity, and inclusion office, renaming it the Office of Community and Campus Life, in a move that appears to respond to pressure from the Trump administration. The decision follows similar reorganizations by other universities facing conservative criticism of diversity offices. This announcement coincides with a lawsuit filed by Harvard against the administration, accusing it of unlawfully interfering in the university's affairs. The Trump administration has also opened an investigation into the Harvard Law Review for alleged racial discrimination in journal membership and article selection.</p>

          <p>President Trump has decided to provide some relief to automakers regarding tariffs, marking a partial reversal of his policy aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and government revenue.
