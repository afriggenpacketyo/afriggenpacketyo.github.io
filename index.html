            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny after a second Signal chat revealed he shared details about a Yemen strike with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. Democrats, including Sen. Tammy Duckworth, are calling for his resignation, citing national security concerns. The shared information included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets involved in the attack. The Pentagon's inspector general is already evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app for official business, raising questions about compliance with DoD policies and procedures. Optimism surrounding the administration is waning as internal investigations persist. Optimism Score: 20</p>

            <p>China has warned it will retaliate against countries that cooperate with the U.S. in ways that compromise Beijing's interests, as trade tensions between the two countries escalate. This warning comes as the Trump administration is reportedly planning to use tariff negotiations to pressure U.S. partners to limit their dealings with China. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that China will not accept any deals made at its expense and will take reciprocal countermeasures. The ministry also criticized the U.S. for "abusing tariffs" and engaging in "unilateral bullying." Optimism Score: 35</p>

While some episodes capture the moving heights of Season 1, the show's limited imagination becomes more glaring as it delves into a violent turf war in Seattle.

            <p>Men tend to visit doctors less often than women, often delaying medical help until symptoms become severe, influenced by societal pressures to "tough it out." A recent NHS survey reveals many men feel unable to discuss health concerns, fearing they'll be perceived as weak. Experts point to factors like appointment systems clashing with work schedules and services not aligning with how men discuss health. Encouraging men to seek preventative care and creating more accessible, male-friendly healthcare services are crucial for improving men's health outcomes. Optimism Score: 50</p>
