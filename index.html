          <p>Several UK newspapers lead with former Prime Minister Tony Blair's skepticism about current net-zero policies, deeming them "doomed" and politically unpopular, while others focus on Prince William and Kate Middleton's 14th wedding anniversary trip to the Isle of Mull. The Daily Mail celebrates Kate as "lady of the smiles" and reports on a cyber raid on M&S, allegedly by a British-American hacking group. The Financial Times features Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's election victory following Trump's tariffs. The Daily Mirror highlights a desperate plea from Gaza regarding starving children due to the Israeli blockade. Optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>Shipments from China to the U.S. have significantly decreased following the Trump administration's imposition of steep tariffs, leading major retailers to warn of potential supply shortages. The trade war has escalated with import duties as high as 145% on Chinese products and 125% on U.S. goods. The Port of Los Angeles reports a 10% drop in shipments, with expectations of a further 35% decline, and retailers fear consumers may encounter out-of-stock situations by summer.

          <p>President Donald Trump has continued his trend of publicly criticizing Democrats and the media, using new nicknames and direct attacks. He confronted Maine's governor over transgender athletes, clashed with Democrats during a joint address to Congress, and rebuked reporters for their questions.

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders that walked back some tariffs for carmakers, removing levies on steel, aluminum, and certain imports from Canada and Mexico. Carmakers will also be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components, though those benefits will be phased out over the next two years.

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order softening some of the automotive tariffs his administration put into place earlier this month. Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports. Additional 25% tariffs on auto parts that were set to start by May 3 will also still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years. Optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to ease some tariffs on automakers to ensure the companies aren't hit twice by its tariffs, which now apply a 25% import duty to car parts as well as 25% on steel and aluminum. The 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but automakers won't be subject to the additional 25% import duty on imported steel and aluminum. Reimbursements will also be given to automakers who have already paid the double tariffs, the administration said. Optimism score is 60.</p>
