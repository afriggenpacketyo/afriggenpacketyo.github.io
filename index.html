          <p>For the first time, mosquitoes have been found in Iceland, a country previously known as one of the world's few mosquito-free regions alongside Antarctica. An insect enthusiast discovered the Culiseta annulata species, which can survive winter, in a glacial valley near Reykjavik. This discovery follows a period of record-breaking high temperatures in the country, raising concerns about the impact of climate change on delicate ecosystems. Scientists will now monitor whether the species has permanently established itself on the island.</p>

          <p>Over 850 prominent figures, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoff Hinton, have signed a statement urging a halt to the development of "superintelligence." The signatories warn that creating AI surpassing human cognitive abilities poses significant risks, ranging from economic obsolescence to potential human extinction. The statement calls for a ban until there is broad scientific consensus and public support ensuring such technology can be built and controlled safely. This comes as major tech companies actively pursue more advanced AI models.</p>

          <p>Eurostar has announced a major fleet expansion, ordering up to 50 new double-decker trains from manufacturer Alstom, a first for the Channel Tunnel route. This €2 billion deal is part of a broader strategy to increase passenger capacity to 30 million annually and introduce new routes from London. The new trains, expected to enter service starting in 2031, will significantly boost seating capacity. The plan also includes an €80 million investment in a key London depot, which is currently at the center of a regulatory review regarding access for potential rival operators.</p>

          <p>Two NHS trusts, located in Shropshire and Leeds, have been removed from a national rapid review of maternity failings in England. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust was dropped due to an ongoing police investigation into catastrophic failures that may have led to hundreds of deaths. The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust was removed following the announcement of a separate, focused inquiry into its services after a BBC investigation revealed dozens of potentially preventable deaths. This decision has caused shock among affected families, who feel their stories may not be fully heard in the national review.</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays has upgraded its full-year financial guidance and announced an unexpected £500 million share buyback. The lender now anticipates a Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) of over 11% for the year, reflecting strong and consistent capital generation. This positive announcement came despite third-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.1 billion falling slightly below analyst expectations, partly due to a £235 million charge related to the U.K.'s car loan scandal. The bank's investment banking division showed an 8% year-on-year income increase, contributing to the overall positive outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rangers chairman Andrew Cavenagh has defended the club's process for hiring new head coach Danny Rohl, admitting it may have appeared "clunky" externally but was not mismanaged. The club had engaged in talks with other high-profile candidates, including Steven Gerrard and Kevin Muscat, before finalizing the deal with Rohl. Cavenagh clarified that the club pursued multiple candidates simultaneously and that the failure to secure others was largely due to timing and complexity. He expressed strong confidence in Rohl's appointment, stating he was one of five candidates the club would have been happy with.</p>

Protesters, including prominent activists and politicians, argued that women's safety was being used as a justification for hard-line, discriminatory migration policies.

It also notes that while overall food inflation has slowed from its peak, it remains high, and producers are substituting ingredients to manage costs.

          <p>A woman in Richmond, west London, was fined £150 after being stopped by enforcement officers for pouring the last bit of her coffee down a road gully. Burcu Yesilyurt said she was shocked by the penalty, as she believed she was acting responsibly to avoid spilling the liquid on the bus she was about to board. The fine was issued under the Environmental Protection Act, which prohibits depositing waste in a way that could pollute water. Richmond Council defended the action, stating its officers acted professionally and that the fine was consistent with its policies to protect waterways.</p>

          <p>The head of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has described the situation in Gaza as a health "catastrophe" with consequences that will last for "generations to come." He stated that the combination of famine, widespread injuries, a collapsed healthcare system, and disease outbreaks has created a crisis beyond words. While a recent ceasefire has allowed more aid into the territory, Dr. Tedros emphasized that the amount is far below what is needed to rebuild. He called on Israel to allow full and unconditional humanitarian access to address the population's complex needs.</p>

          <p>The Spanish soccer league has canceled its plan to host a regular-season match between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami this December. The decision was made following growing opposition within Spain from players, some clubs, and fans who argued it would compromise the integrity of the competition. Real Madrid was a vocal opponent, and players held brief on-field protests over the weekend. While the league expressed deep regret over the missed opportunity for international expansion, the game's promoter cited insufficient time to properly execute the event amid the uncertainty.</p>

          <p>China's unemployment rate for individuals aged 16 to 24, excluding students, saw a slight decrease to 17.7% in September from 18.9% in August. Despite the modest improvement, the rate remains high, reflecting the ongoing pressure in the youth job market following a record graduation season. The data highlights the challenges young graduates face in securing employment, with many, like computer science graduate Zhu Yiran, finding it difficult to enter even the competitive public sector after submitting numerous applications. The figure underscores a key area of concern for the country's economic stability.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation exposing misconduct, over 300 people have contacted the BBC with allegations of racism and misogyny against various police forces. A primary theme is the mishandling of domestic abuse and sexual violence cases, with women describing dismissive and damaging encounters. One victim stated the experience of reporting her sexual assault "was like being raped again," a direct quote from the article. Another woman was told to "grow a pair" after reporting an assault, highlighting a culture of disbelief. The National Police Chiefs' Council responded by stating it is working to reform procedures.</p>

          <p>The new president of Peru, José Jerí, has declared a 30-day state of emergency in the capital city of Lima to address a significant surge in violent crime. This move comes shortly after his predecessor was impeached and removed from office for failing to tackle the same issue. Homicides and violent extortion have been on the rise, with police reporting 1,690 killings between January and September. The government is considering deploying soldiers to assist police and restricting rights such as freedom of assembly, adopting what the president described as a new "offense" strategy against crime.</p>

The criticism came after NASA announced it would accept proposals from rivals to SpaceX for building moon landers, a move Duffy said was to avoid waiting for one company and to win the new space race against China. Musk accused Duffy of "trying to kill NASA" and asserted that SpaceX is moving far faster than the rest of the industry.

          <p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation has formally requested that the Trump administration halt demolition on the White House's East Wing for a planned ballroom. In a letter to federal oversight commissions, the group expressed concern that the proposed 90,000-square-foot annex is too large and will "overwhelm the White House itself." This follows similar objections from other architectural societies regarding the scale and design of the addition. The White House has dismissed the criticism, framing the privately funded project as a visionary and much-needed enhancement for hosting major functions.</p>

          <p>A new poll from the Public Religion Research Institute reveals that a majority of Americans are concerned about President Donald Trump's use of power. When presented with two options, 56% of respondents agreed with the statement that Trump is a "potentially dangerous dictator whose power should be limited," compared to 41% who see him as a strong leader. This margin has nearly doubled since a similar poll in April. The findings suggest that the message of recent anti-Trump rallies, which Republicans have sought to marginalize, resonates with a significant portion of the American public, including independents.</p>
