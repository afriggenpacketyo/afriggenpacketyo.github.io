          <p>A stampede during the annual Shri Lairai Zatra festival at a Hindu temple in Goa, India, resulted in the deaths of six people and injuries to dozens more. The incident occurred despite a heavy security presence, with tens of thousands of devotees attending the festival, which is known for its fire-walking events. Police officials are investigating the cause of the stampede, which took place on a steep slope near the temple's approach road. Political leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, have extended their condolences and promised support to the affected families.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has contributed to the development of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies found in Friede's blood have shown protection against fatal doses from various snake species in animal tests, potentially leading to a universal antivenom. Friede's motivation stemmed from a desire to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, after nearly dying from cobra bites early in his self-experimentation. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies in his blood that target common neurotoxin classes, creating an antivenom cocktail that has shown significant protection in mice.</p>

The reforms involve merging ministries, closing media outlets, and eliminating public sector jobs, potentially affecting 100,000 positions. This restructuring aims to address bureaucratic dysfunction and external pressures like potential US tariffs. It also serves to consolidate power for To Lam, the new party chief, ahead of the 14th National Congress in 2026, by reducing the number of provinces and party branches.</p>

As these companies raise prices and shift to local fulfillment models, they are reducing their advertising spending, leading to a decline in revenue for the tech giants.

          <p>The Chinese military's mouthpiece, the PLA Daily, has likened its ongoing anti-corruption drive to preparations for war, stating that such campaigns have historically been necessary before key conflicts. The commentary emphasized the need for political loyalty and readiness for combat, citing past rectifications that ensured military mission success. This comes as the anti-corruption efforts deepen within the People's Liberation Army's leadership, amidst growing national security concerns.</p>

          <h2>New US Tariffs on Imported Auto Parts Expected to Raise Car Prices</h2>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, which are expected to significantly increase prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. This action, ordered by President Trump, aims to promote domestic manufacturing but will likely result in higher costs for consumers. The tariffs will not apply to parts from Canada or Mexico that meet the requirements of the North American trade agreement. Automakers and suppliers warn that relocating assembly lines will take years, and the uncertainty surrounding trade policy discourages investment in domestic manufacturing.</p>

Coastal cities like Cape Town, Durban, and Port Elizabeth are experiencing erosion, flooding, and loss of infrastructure. Researchers from Germany believe drought and resulting water loss due to global warming may be causing parts of South Africa to lift out of the ocean. The study suggests that climate variability is an important determinant of systematic variations in land surface elevation across the region compared to a traditional idea, based upon a tectonic uplift of the land surface.</p>
