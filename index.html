            <h2>Majority of Americans Experience Financial Strain Due to Tariffs and Inflation</h2>

            <p>A recent CNBC/Survey Monkey poll reveals that 73% of Americans are financially stressed, with 66% attributing this stress to tariff wars. Rising prices for essentials like food, energy, and shelter are major contributors, with 86% citing inflation as the top reason. The increased prices during 2022 have reduced purchasing power, and experts believe President Trump's trade war could further inflate prices. Consequently, many Americans have delayed purchases or adjusted investments due to stock market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering placing Columbia University under a consent decree due to allegations of failing to protect students from antisemitism. This action follows the suspension of $400 million in federal grants and contracts to the university. If Columbia resists, the Justice Department would need to present its case in court, potentially jeopardizing the university's federal funding. The move is part of a broader effort by the administration to address campus protests and enforce its political objectives on various issues.</p>

            <p>China plans to reduce the number of Hollywood films allowed into the country amidst escalating trade tensions with the United States. While stopping short of a complete ban, the China Film Administration stated that fewer U.S. films would be granted entry. This move reduces access to what was once a vital market for U.S. blockbusters. China has invested heavily in its local production industry, leading to a decline in enthusiasm for U.S. movies.</p>
