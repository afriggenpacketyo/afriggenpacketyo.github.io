        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey is increasing its geopolitical influence in the Western Balkans, using "soft power" tactics such as funding the construction of large mosques, like the Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania. This strategy, described by some experts as "infrastructure imperialism," extends beyond religion to include economic, political, and military interests, positioning Turkey as a regional power and heir to the Ottoman Empire. While this has allowed Turkey to surpass nations like Saudi Arabia in regional influence, local actors in the Balkans still retain some autonomy in these partnerships.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," recounts the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling incognito, Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) observed the changes to the river towns and landscape that had been central to his youth, noting a sense of decay and provinciality. Despite the changes and his own fame, returning to a steamboat's pilot house brought him immense joy, allowing him to reconnect with a cherished past and the feeling of freedom he associated with his time as a river pilot.</p>

          <p>Ignacio Alejandro Roaro, a city council secretary in Apaseo el Grande, Mexico, was assassinated by a gunman during an amateur basketball game in the state of Guanajuato. The attack occurred in a sports hall filled with families and children, and local officials have condemned it as a cowardly act. Guanajuato is Mexico's most violent state, largely due to turf wars between powerful drug cartels like the Jalisco New Generation cartel and the Santa Rosa de Lima gang, contributing to the nation's high homicide rate.</p>

          <p>The European Union is in a critical week of negotiations with Washington to prevent a potential 50% tariff on its exports to the US, threatened by President Donald Trump. With a July 9 deadline approaching, EU leaders are divided on strategy; Germany favors a quick deal to avoid a trade war, while France is willing to hold out for better terms. The EU is now aiming for a "framework deal," similar to the one the UK secured, acknowledging that a comprehensive agreement is unattainable and bracing for a new baseline tariff of at least 10%.

          <p>Critics and governance experts are warning that President Donald Trump's recent executive actions represent a significant and deliberate expansion of presidential power, potentially setting new precedents for future administrations. Actions such as ordering a military strike on Iran without congressional approval, taking control of a state's National Guard, and using the Justice Department against political opponents are seen as undermining democratic norms and checks and balances. While his supporters see these moves as necessary to get things done, analysts worry about the long-term erosion of congressional and judicial oversight.</p>

          <p>Laura Loomer, a right-wing online influencer known for promoting conspiracy theories, has emerged as a powerful and controversial adviser to President Donald Trump, particularly on national security matters. Despite holding no official government position, she has had direct access to Trump and successfully pushed for the firing of multiple National Security Council staffers and even the director of the NSA. Her influence highlights a dynamic where fealty to Trump is paramount, and she has become a de facto enforcer, purging those she deems disloyal to the "America First" agenda.</p>

          <p>Despite its significant economic ties and oil dependency on the Middle East, China played a minimal role in de-escalating the recent conflict between Israel and Iran, highlighting its limitations as a global superpower. The article argues that while Beijing seeks influence, it lacks the military projection, robust alliances, and political will to supplant the United States as the region's primary security provider. China's relationships, even with partners like Iran, are largely transactional and cautious, preventing it from acting as a decisive mediator in major geopolitical crises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s renewed focus on disproven theories linking autism to environmental toxins and vaccines is causing alarm in the scientific and autistic communities. Researchers at a major autism conference expressed dismay that Kennedy is ignoring decades of genetic research and using "tragedy framing" that stigmatizes autistic people. His plan to create a massive data platform to investigate his theories has also sparked fear among parents, who worry about privacy and the potential for their children to be marked by a system driven by outdated and harmful rhetoric.</p>

          <p>The American flag and patriotism have a complex and often painful history for Black Americans, but a new wave of artists and thinkers are engaging with and reclaiming its symbolism. The article explores this dynamic, from the historical sacrifices of Black service members who fought for a country that oppressed them to modern expressions of pride by figures like Beyoncé. This reclamation is not about excusing the nation's history of racism but about asserting ownership, celebrating Black America's contributions, and redefining patriotism on their own terms in a country that is, for them, home.</p>

          <p>This article explains the role of thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that has been the subject of vaccine safety debates despite a long record of safe use. Thimerosal is used in multi-dose vaccine vials to prevent contamination but has been largely phased out of childhood vaccines since 2001 and is absent from 94% of modern flu shots. Despite numerous scientific studies debunking any link to autism, a new CDC advisory committee is considering recommending its complete removal from flu shots, a move some experts see as solving a non-existent problem and potentially undermining vaccine confidence.</p>

          <p>The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has called for a major overhaul of policing in England and Wales, proposing that the current 43 forces be consolidated into 12 to 15 larger, regional "mega forces." He argues the current model, designed in the 1960s, is inefficient, too small to handle modern threats like organized crime, and hinders the adoption of new technology. The call for reform comes as UK police forces grapple with tight funding, staffing issues, and historically low public confidence following years of austerity and high-profile scandals.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the Labour government's recent reversal on a package of welfare reforms has made future spending decisions "harder." The climbdown, forced by a rebellion of Labour MPs, means planned savings of £5 billion a year will be delayed or lost, putting pressure on the upcoming budget. Phillipson did not commit to scrapping the controversial two-child benefit cap, a key demand of anti-poverty campaigners, noting that while it's an important consideration, its removal comes at a significant cost.</p>

However, Hamas is demanding guarantees that hostilities will not resume and that all aid be distributed by the UN, creating significant gaps that mediators must now work to bridge in the high-stakes proximity talks.</p>

This deep tie is rooted in a shared history, as Tanzania is one of several African nations where a former liberation movement party has maintained power since independence, fostering close bonds with China.</p>
