          <p>The U.S. Congress returns from its August recess to confront a critical September 30 deadline to fund the government and avert a shutdown. Lawmakers are facing significant partisan divisions over spending levels, with Democrats demanding bipartisan talks that have yet to materialize. In addition to the fiscal cliff, Congress is also set to tackle contentious issues including the confirmation of President Trump's nominees and a growing bipartisan push to compel the Justice Department to release files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The packed agenda signals a potentially chaotic and conflict-ridden legislative session ahead.</p>

          <p>Political ad spending for the current midterm election cycle is projected to reach an unprecedented $10.8 billion, a figure that is over 20% higher than the 2022 midterms. This surge is largely driven by a significant increase in spending on connected TV (CTV) and streaming services, which is expected to reach $2.5 billion. The report from AdImpact highlights the highly competitive national environment, with key congressional races in states like California and Michigan attracting the most investment. This trend indicates a new record for the most expensive midterm cycle in history. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article delves into the complex ethical questions surrounding advanced genetic testing for IVF embryos, such as polygenic screening, which can test for risks of diseases like cancer and even select for traits like IQ. While parents naturally want the healthiest child possible, the technology raises concerns about a modern form of eugenics, creating a societal gap between the rich who can afford it and the poor who cannot. The piece also explores the psychological impact on a child who may not live up to their genetically "selected" potential. It advises parents to resist commercial pressure and consider the broader implications of treating children like customizable products.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young, single men report feeling miserable and lonely, a sentiment supported by research showing they are less satisfied with single life compared to women. This article explores the underlying causes, suggesting that traditional masculinity norms discourage men from building deep, emotional friendships, leading them to place all their emotional needs on a single romantic partner. This dependency can make being single particularly difficult and contributes to a cycle of emotional isolation. Experts suggest that men could improve their well-being by fostering more vulnerable and diverse platonic relationships, thereby developing crucial emotional skills.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic landslide has completely destroyed the village of Tarasin in Sudan's Darfur region, resulting in an estimated 1,000 fatalities with reportedly only a single survivor. The disaster occurred following days of heavy rainfall in the Marrah Mountains, an area controlled by the Sudan Liberation Movement-Army rebel group. Rescue and aid efforts are severely hampered by the ongoing civil war that has made much of the region inaccessible to international organizations. The rebel group and the region's army-aligned governor have both issued urgent appeals for international assistance to help recover bodies and support the area.</p>

He frequently uses social media to connect with the public, notably through his "#Söderisst" ("Söder eats") hashtag where he posts photos of his meals, which has even led to a cookbook. While critics view his antics as a distraction from substantive policy, his approachable and often humorous persona resonates well with his Bavarian constituency.

          <p>China's electric vehicle market showed a strong rebound in August, with major manufacturers like BYD, Nio, and Xpeng reporting record or near-record delivery numbers. This resurgence in demand follows a summer slump and is largely attributed to the successful launch of several new, more affordable models. For instance, Nio's deliveries were significantly boosted by its new family-oriented Onvo sub-brand, which targets a more budget-conscious consumer segment. The trend indicates that despite an intense price war, consumer interest in EVs remains high, particularly for competitively priced vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

The article traces the crisis back to the social and economic turmoil of deindustrialization, which created conditions of "alienation" and despair in many communities. Experts express grave concern that the recent arrival of deadly synthetic opioids called nitazenes could reverse the recent decline in deaths. The situation is described as a deep-rooted public health emergency, with poverty being a major contributing factor to the high rates of addiction.</p>

          <p>The British pub industry is facing a severe crisis, with estimates from the British Beer and Pub Association suggesting that one pub is set to close every day in 2025. This alarming trend is driven by a combination of rising operational costs, including increases in the minimum wage and business rates, alongside reduced spending from consumers. Pub owners are struggling to absorb these financial pressures without passing them on to customers, leading to higher prices for staples like a pint of beer. Industry leaders are calling for urgent government intervention to prevent further closures and protect a vital part of British culture and the economy.</p>

          <p>The price of gold surged to a new record high on Tuesday, surpassing $3,508 per ounce as investors continue to seek safe-haven assets. This significant rise, part of an upward trend that has seen the precious metal's value increase by nearly a third this year, is attributed to several factors. Analysts point to ongoing global economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions exacerbated by U.S. trade tariffs, and widespread expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. These conditions make non-yielding assets like gold a more attractive investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Indonesian human rights group, KontraS, has reported that at least 20 people remain missing following a week of widespread protests and unrest across the country. The demonstrations were initially sparked by public anger over a new government housing allowance for lawmakers that critics deemed excessive. The unrest escalated after footage circulated showing paramilitary officers running over a protester. In response to the growing crisis, which has resulted in at least eight deaths and over a thousand arrests, President Prabowo Subianto has announced he will revoke the controversial perks.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck remote, mountainous villages in eastern Afghanistan, killing at least 800 people and injuring more than 1,800 others. Rescue operations are extremely challenging due to the rugged terrain and roads blocked by debris, forcing authorities to rely on helicopters to search for survivors and airlift the injured. The disaster compounds an already severe humanitarian crisis in the country, which is grappling with hunger and the withdrawal of foreign aid. The Taliban government has made an appeal for international assistance to cope with the devastation.</p>

          <p>In a series of memos presented to the Franco-German Council of Ministers, economists have advised that the European Union should effectively abandon its efforts to compete with China in the solar panel industry. French economist Jean Pisani-Ferry argued that China's industry is so far ahead that it is no longer practical for Europe to try to build a competing sector. He suggested that since solar panels do not create the same kind of ongoing energy dependence as gas, it is a technological battle that Europe should admit it has lost. (not investment advice)</p>

The review highlights the series' raw and honest portrayal of the 1990s Dallas Cowboys dynasty, delving into not just their on-field success but also the off-field chaos, including drug use and legal troubles. Unlike many sanitized sports documentaries, this one features candid interviews from key figures like owner Jerry Jones and coach Jimmy Johnson, who openly discuss their long-standing feud.

          <p>The value of shares purchased with borrowed money on mainland China's stock exchanges has reached a record high of 2.28 trillion yuan (US$319.2 billion). This surge in margin trading, driven by leveraged hedge funds and retail investors, is fueling a rally in the market, particularly in technology and biotech stocks. However, this record level of leverage is also raising concerns among analysts about the market overheating. The situation is drawing comparisons to the period just before the dramatic market crash in 2015, prompting warnings about the potential risks of a liquidity-driven bubble.
