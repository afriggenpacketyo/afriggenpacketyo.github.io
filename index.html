          <p>A shooting at a school in Graz, Austria, resulted in the deaths of at least nine people, including the alleged shooter, according to the city's mayor. Austrian state police confirmed the incident and evacuated the school, BORG DreierschÃ¼tzengasse, bringing all individuals to a safe meeting point. Emergency vehicles, including Cobra tactical vehicles, were dispatched to the scene in the southern Austrian city, which is the second-largest in the country with about 300,000 residents. The incident is under investigation, and further details are expected to be released as the situation develops. The small town is in utter shock and will try to recover. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has denounced President Trump's decision to send thousands more troops to Los Angeles amid ongoing protests against immigration raids, calling it a "deranged fantasy of a dictatorial president." Approximately 700 US Marines have been deployed to the LA area, and the National Guard contingent has been doubled to 4,000. Newsom's administration is suing the president for deploying troops without the governor's permission, arguing it violates the US Constitution and California's sovereignty. Protests have spread to other US cities, resulting in arrests and clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. The governor and president continue to exchange blows. </p>

          <p>President Trump claims Los Angeles is under siege due to protests over immigration policies, asserting that the city would have been "completely obliterated" without the deployment of National Guard troops. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom dispute this portrayal, accusing Trump of sensationalizing the violence and acting illegally by mobilizing the National Guard without their consent. The protests, triggered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, have been concentrated in downtown Los Angeles, while the rest of the city has largely continued as normal. Newsom has announced the state is suing the Trump administration over the troop deployment, alleging an abuse of power. The situation is very tense in the state of California. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has activated approximately 700 active-duty Marines for potential deployment to Los Angeles to assist with protests related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions. California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned the move as illegal and suggested he will pursue legal action to prevent the deployment. U.S. Northern Command stated that the Marines will integrate with National Guard troops to protect federal personnel and property, and they have been trained in de-escalation and crowd control. Local officials, including Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDowell, have expressed concerns about the logistical challenges of integrating federal military forces, emphasizing the need for clear communication to avoid escalation. The issue has become highly contentious between the state and federal governments. </p>

          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on two fugitive sons of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, the incarcerated leader of the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel, and is offering a reward of up to $10 million each for information leading to their arrest or conviction. The Treasury Department announced sanctions on Archivaldo Ivan Guzman Salazar and Jesus Alfredo Guzman Salazar, believed to be in Mexico. These sanctions also target a faction of the Sinaloa cartel known as the "Chapitos," which is identified as a main exporter of fentanyl to the U.S. In 2023, indictments revealed the Chapitos' violent methods, including torture and feeding victims to tigers. The US is hoping to see a reduction in crime and violence. </p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a crucial government panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on vaccines. Kennedy stated that a "clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science," raising concerns among health policy experts about politicized recommendations. This move follows other actions by Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, including halting routine COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. Experts worry that these changes could undermine vaccinations in the U.S. and create distrust in the CDC. </p>

          <p>Gen Z has been showing an increasing interest in religion, reversing recent trends of declining religious attendance in America. Experts are exploring the reasons behind this phenomenon, with hypotheses ranging from rebellion against atheist parents to the search for community and answers in a chaotic world. Catholicism is seeing a rise in young men. Some suggest that in a society where men feel overlooked, the church provides a place where they have a privileged position in that hierarchy. The phenomenon has been noticed by political scientists and religious leaders alike, with many seeing it as a reaction to the current social and political climate. </p>

In other news, U.S. drug-related deaths among young people are declining after a decade of increases, with provisional CDC data showing a significant drop in fatal overdoses last year. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as better healthcare and increased caution among young people regarding drug use, though concerns remain about potential budget cuts to addiction programs.

          <p>President Donald Trump has frequently used Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to block the entry of noncitizens into the United States. This law allows the president to ban foreigners if their entry is deemed "detrimental to the interests of the United States." Trump has invoked this section for travel bans on Muslim-majority countries, restrictions on noncitizens unable to pay for healthcare, and halting most legal immigration during the COVID-19 pandemic. While some of these attempts have been challenged in court, Trump has succeeded in getting the Supreme Court to affirm his broad powers to ban foreign nationals under immigration law. The Supreme Court has sided with the president. </p>

          <p>Social media platforms like TikTok and X (formerly Twitter) are buzzing with user-generated recession indicators, from bars skimping on snacks to ramen noodle sightings on Facebook Marketplace. These informal signs echo a long-standing tradition of people seeking small, everyday signals of economic downturns. Examples include the "Hemline Index," men's underwear sales, cardboard box sales, parking lot occupancy, and frozen pizza sales. While serious economists may not rely on these indicators, the prevalence of such discussions can reflect and potentially influence economic sentiment, as theorized by John Maynard Keynes regarding the impact of "animal spirits" on the economy.

The incident occurred while Tomasi was reporting on the demonstrations, which began in response to President Trump's immigration crackdown. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the incident as "horrific" and unacceptable, stating that Tomasi was clearly identified as a reporter and should not have been targeted. The Australian government has raised the issue with the Trump administration. Tomasi confirmed she was okay, calling it one of the unfortunate realities of reporting on such events. </p>

          <p>Missouri GOP Senator Josh Hawley plans to introduce legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, aligning himself with some of the most liberal members of Congress. The "Higher Wages for American Workers Act" would raise the federal standard starting in 2026 and adjust for inflation in subsequent years. Vermont Democratic Senator Peter Welch is co-sponsoring the bill. This move puts Hawley at odds with conservative party orthodoxy, which has traditionally opposed a federal minimum wage increase. The legislation is part of Hawley's "Pro-Worker Framework for the 119th Congress," which includes proposals to strengthen protections for union jobs. (not investment advice)</p>
