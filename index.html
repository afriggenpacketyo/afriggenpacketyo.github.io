          <p>Steve Goncalves, father of murder victim Kaylee Goncalves, has strongly criticized the plea deal offered to suspect Bryan Kohberger, stating the victims' families were unprepared and not adequately consulted. Prosecutors offered Kohberger life in prison without parole to avoid a trial, citing risks like a hung jury and the emotional toll on families. Goncalves expressed profound disappointment, arguing that negotiating with the alleged killer is not justice and that the families' wishes for a trial were largely ignored in the sudden resolution.</p>

          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the number of babies born to fathers aged 60 and over in England and Wales saw a significant 14.2% increase in 2024 compared to the previous year. This trend of older fatherhood coincides with a continued decrease in births to parents under 30, reflecting a broader pattern of delaying parenthood. While total births in England rose slightly for the first time since 2021, experts and charities point to the high cost of living as a major barrier for younger people starting families.</p>

          <p>NYU Stern professor and author Suzy Welch suggests a powerful question for job seekers to uncover a company's true values: 'What kind of person should not work at this company?' This question often elicits more honest and less rehearsed answers from hiring managers, revealing the real workplace culture beyond corporate platitudes about innovation and excellence. Welch advises asking this question late in the interview process, as the responses can provide crucial insights into whether a company's actual operational values align with a candidate's personal ones.</p>

          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not led to a significant surge in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies 'front-loading' inventory to pre-empt the tariffs, absorbing some costs to avoid losing customers, and using logistical loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, experts caution that these are temporary buffers and that price increases are still likely to materialize in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The public dispute between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump has escalated, with Musk proposing the formation of a new political party and threatening to back primary challengers against Republicans who support a major spending bill. In response, Trump suggested that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an entity Musk once led, could investigate and penalize his business interests. The conflict centers on the bill's spending levels and its rollback of green energy tax credits, highlighting a major rift between the president and a former high-profile supporter.</p>

          <p>The jury in the federal trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs has resumed deliberations after their first day concluded without a verdict. Jurors are considering charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution, following seven weeks of testimony. The judge addressed a jury question regarding instructions on drug distribution, a component of the racketeering charge. The case hinges on whether jurors believe Combs coerced women into illegal sex acts or if, as the defense argues, the encounters were consensual.</p>

          <p>A new report from a defense acquisition data firm warns that the U.S. is not prepared for a potential war, citing a significant reliance on Chinese suppliers within its defense industrial base.

          <p>A Yale Budget Lab analysis concludes that the major legislative package being advanced by Senate Republicans would financially harm the lowest-earning Americans while benefiting the wealthiest. The report models that the bottom 20% of households would see an average annual income reduction of 2.9%, while the top 20% would experience a 2.2% income gain. This disparity is attributed to sharp cuts in programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which would outweigh any tax cut benefits for low-income families, effectively shifting resources up the economic ladder.
