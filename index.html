          <h2>Germany Debates How to Approach the Far-Right AfD Party</h2>

          <p>Germany is increasingly concerned about societal polarization, particularly regarding the far-right AfD party. The domestic intelligence service has classified the AfD as "confirmed right-wing extremist," a decision the AfD is contesting in court. While most Germans believe the AfD's agenda opposes democracy, the rule of law, and human dignity, determining the best way to address the party is contentious. Some advocate for a ban, while others argue it would deepen social divisions, although experts suggest that if the AfD does not endanger basic democratic order, it should be dealt with in parliament. The article also notes the importance of media coverage and public discourse in addressing polarization, suggesting that engaging with opposing viewpoints can help bridge divides.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Israel have announced a plan to allow food and essential supplies into Gaza after a ten-week Israeli ban, but leading aid groups object to the idea. The plan, a result of U.S. pressure, would initially provide aid to only about 60% of Gaza's civilians in a zone cordoned off by the Israeli military. A private charity would manage distribution, but major aid organizations are refusing to cooperate, citing violations of humanitarian principles, and the U.N. and its aid partners will not participate in any scheme that does not adhere to the global humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between India and Pakistan, brokered after U.S.-led mediation talks, was quickly jeopardized by overnight clashes in Kashmir. Both sides accused each other of violating the agreement, with India citing border intrusions and Pakistan blaming Indian forces. The escalation followed a gun massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan. Despite the agreement to halt military action, reports of heavy exchanges of fire emerged, traumatizing residents on both sides of the Line of Control, although the U.N. welcomed the deal as a positive step.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are both claiming victory in a recent conflict, even as a fragile truce holds following initial skirmishing. President Trump announced a ceasefire with U.S. mediation, but India has downplayed the American role, framing the situation as a bilateral matter between Indian and Pakistani officials. India claims its military response forced Pakistan to seek a ceasefire, while Pakistan asserts it successfully withstood a major Indian offensive. Despite the claims, uncertainty remains about the durability of the ceasefire, with reports of cross-border shelling occurring shortly after its declaration, although the situation is currently calm.</p>

The escalating trade war has seen both countries impose steep tariffs on each other's goods, disrupting global supply chains and impacting both economies, and the BBC found that Chinese exporters were struggling with the US's tariffs.</p>

President Putin proposed talks in Istanbul on May 15, but Zelensky expects Russia to confirm a cease-fire starting on Monday. President Trump questioned whether either side wants a deal, but urged both to take the meeting, while European leaders set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face more sanctions.

          <p>Prince Harry‚Äôs public plea to reconcile with King Charles III has brought renewed attention to the ongoing rifts within the British royal family. Despite King Charles's efforts to fulfill his duties amidst cancer treatment, the focus remains on the estrangement between him and Prince Harry, as well as Prince William. Some royal watchers believe that unless Charles finds a way to heal the rift, it could define his reign, undercutting the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness that he has long championed. The palace has pushed back on Harry‚Äôs contention that his father could have done more to spare him the loss of automatic, publicly funded police protection when he visits Britain.</p>

They also allege that the Department of Homeland Security is misrepresenting the events and that ICE officers had opportunities to de-escalate the situation.

While Trump's legal team has deemed the gift permissible, critics argue that it violates the Constitution's Emoluments Clause and constitutes bribery in broad daylight, especially given the Trump Organization's recent deal for a $5.5 billion golf course in Qatar.</p>

          <p>A potential trade war is brewing between the U.S. and Europe over food safety standards, particularly regarding American beef and chicken. European officials consider their food regulations a ‚Äúred line,‚Äù while the Trump administration argues that American meat is superior and wants Europe to buy more. The EU bans hormones and certain treatments in meat production, leading to a clash over differing agricultural practices and consumer preferences. Despite the possibility of other trade concessions, European policymakers are firm on maintaining their food standards, protecting both their food culture and smaller family farms.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's Premier League loss to Newcastle has put their Champions League qualification hopes in jeopardy. The defeat places a heavy load on their final two games, particularly against Manchester United and Nottingham Forest, as they vie for a top-five finish. Coach Enzo Maresca's future is on the line, and Nicolas Jackson's indiscipline, resulting in a red card and suspension, has made the task even more challenging. The article implies that if Chelsea wins the Conference League but fails to qualify for the Champions League, the season will be judged as a failure.</p>

          <p>A recent conflict between India and Pakistan, marked by new military technologies and entrenched religious nationalism, raises concerns about future battles. The four-day clash involved airstrikes, antiaircraft volleys, and weaponized drones, escalating to strikes on military bases. While international diplomacy played a role in the ceasefire, the positions of both sides appeared more extreme, fueled by political realities and a determination to gain the upper hand. The reliance on foreign weapons sales suggests that outside pressure can influence the conflict, but the underlying tensions and political climates in both countries remain unchanged.</p>
