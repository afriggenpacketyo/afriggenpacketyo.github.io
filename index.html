          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, died by suicide at the age of 41, according to her family. Giuffre alleged that she was trafficked to Prince Andrew when she was 17, which he denied, although he did reach an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022. Her family stated that the "toll of abuse" became too heavy, confirming her death occurred on her farm in Western Australia. Giuffre was known as a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking, and her family mourns her loss deeply.</p>

          <p>A measles case has been confirmed in a Los Angeles County resident who recently returned from Texas, which is experiencing a significant outbreak of the disease. This is the third measles case reported in L.A. County this year, highlighting the ongoing risk of infection due to outbreaks and international travel. Symptoms of measles include high fever, cough, runny nose, and a rash, and the disease is highly contagious, spreading easily through the air. Health officials urge people to ensure they are vaccinated, as two doses of the measles vaccine are 97% effective against infection.</p>

          <p>A Japanese research team discovered that listening to a specific sound for one minute may prevent motion sickness. The study found that a 100 hertz sound stimulates the inner ear, improving balance and reducing symptoms like lightheadedness and nausea. This research is particularly relevant with the rise of self-driving vehicles, where passengers are more prone to motion sickness. The team hopes to implement this method practically after confirming its safety, offering an alternative to traditional medication.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Russia and Ukraine are "very close to a deal" following talks between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Trump indicated that "most of the major points are agreed to" and urged both countries to finalize the agreement. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the need for "real pressure on Russia" to accept an unconditional ceasefire. Reports suggest the proposed deal may involve Ukraine ceding territory to Russia, a condition Zelensky has previously rejected.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people protested in Oldenburg, Germany, and other cities following the fatal police shooting of a Black man, identified as Lorenz A. The 21-year-old died after being shot by police following an altercation outside a nightclub, sparking nationwide condemnation and accusations of structural racism within the police force. Protesters are calling for a full investigation into the shooting, with many arguing that the multiple shots fired from behind cannot be justified.
