          <p>The FBI is investigating an attack in Boulder, Colorado, as a potential "targeted terror attack" that occurred at the Pearl Street Mall during a pro-Israel peaceful demonstration. Police responded to reports of a man with a weapon who was allegedly setting people on fire, resulting in multiple victims with burn injuries. The area was evacuated and contained while authorities investigate the incident, which Colorado's Governor Jared Polis has described as a "heinous act of terror". Local and federal law enforcement are collaborating to support the ongoing investigation into the incident. Optimism is low as authorities assess the motive and extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>Exit polls in Poland's presidential election suggest a close race between conservative historian Karol Nawrocki and Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski. Initial exit polls showed Trzaskowski with a narrow lead, but a second poll indicated Nawrocki ahead, creating uncertainty. Both candidates have expressed support for Ukraine, but differ on their approach to the EU, with Trzaskowski favoring stronger ties with Germany and France, while Nawrocki supports a sovereign Poland and opposes EU climate and migration policies. The official result is expected to be published on Monday morning.</p>

The review includes a commitment to spend £15 billion on its nuclear warhead program and £1.5 billion to build six new factories for munitions production. The government also plans to build up to 7,000 long-range weapons and establish a "cyber and electromagnetic command" to improve military capabilities in cyberspace. These investments are projected to support 30,000 jobs and apprenticeships, signaling a significant boost to the UK's defense sector and technological capabilities.</p>

Faced with restrictions in the US market, these companies are focusing on cost-cutting measures and open-source collaborations, particularly in areas like AI and electric vehicles. Zhang anticipates that Chinese firms will aggressively pursue opportunities in other markets, such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and seek deeper trade relationships with Europe. The future remains uncertain, but Chinese firms are expected to face considerable challenges under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter who was pardoned for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing to accept the pardon. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and whitewash the events of that day. She is working with Senator James Risch to formally reject the pardon, stating that she feels guilty accepting it knowing she was involved in the events. Her actions contrast with other Jan. 6 defendants who actively sought and celebrated their pardons.</p>

While the extent of the damage is debated, the attack sends a critical message to both Russia and Ukraine's western allies, demonstrating Ukraine's continued resolve and capability in the conflict. This action aims to counter perceptions that Ukraine has already lost the war and to strengthen its position in upcoming ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>Senior officials at the US Department of Veterans Affairs have mandated that VA physicians and scientists obtain clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking publicly. The directive followed the publication of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine by two VA pulmonologists warning about the impact of staff reductions on veterans' healthcare. Critics argue that this policy represents censorship and a "war on science" by the Trump administration. The VA maintains that the policy is simply to ensure proper coordination with public affairs staff, while veterans advocates fear it will stifle independent research and harm veterans' care.</p>
