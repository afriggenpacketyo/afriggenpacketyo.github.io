            <p>China is focusing on modernizing its agriculture to become a "strong agricultural country" by 2050, addressing food security and rural-urban divide challenges. The plan emphasizes improving farming supplies, technology, and industrial resilience, especially with global economic uncertainties and trade tensions with the US. The goal is to maintain self-sufficiency in key agricultural products and achieve technological breakthroughs. This initiative reflects China's broader vision for a prosperous and modern nation, acknowledging that agriculture is a crucial component of its socialist framework.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the US and Iran would hold direct talks regarding a possible new nuclear deal, which was followed by Iran's foreign minister stating the talks would be indirect and held in Oman. This announcement comes after Trump withdrew the US from a 2015 nuclear agreement and amid threats from Israel to strike Iranian nuclear sites. Iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful, but has breached restrictions imposed by the existing deal. The potential talks are seen as an opportunity to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and to avert possible US military action.</p>

            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the US has a significant advantage over China in the escalating trade war. Bessent believes China made a "big mistake" by escalating tariffs, as the US exports far less to China than China exports to the US. He characterizes China's position as "playing with a pair of twos," suggesting their leverage is limited. This statement reflects the US's perspective on the trade dynamics and potential outcomes of the trade dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Senator Adam Schiff, along with Senator Tim Sheehy, is proposing a federal tax credit for homeowners who retrofit their homes against wildfires and other natural disasters. The FIREWALL Act would cover up to half the costs of qualified upgrades, capped at $25,000 for families making less than $200,000 annually. This initiative aims to help families protect their homes and encourage insurers to cover more homes in vulnerable areas, especially in light of increasing climate-related disasters. The bill reflects a bipartisan effort to address the growing risks and costs associated with natural disasters.</p>

            <p>More than 40 Labour MPs are urging the government to introduce digital IDs to control the migration system and improve public services. The MPs believe digital IDs could tackle illegal employment and streamline identification processes. While the government has made strides in digitizing identification, there are no plans to introduce mandatory digital IDs. The proposal falls short of compulsory identity cards previously introduced by the Labour government.</p>

The strike, which has been ongoing since January, has led to a backlog of waste, prompting the city council to declare a major incident.</p>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has vowed to "fight to the end" after President Trump threatened to impose additional tariffs. The ministry accused the US of "blackmail" and stated it would take countermeasures to protect its rights and interests. This comes in response to Trump's threat to escalate tariffs if China does not withdraw its 34% tariff on American products, signaling a continued trade conflict between the world's two largest economies. The escalation reflects a hardened stance from both sides, with potential long-term economic consequences.</p>

The across-the-board tariffs reflect diminishing hopes for a trade deal, and the broadened tariff scope could significantly impact China's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's new tariffs have created economic chaos in the US and abroad, reminiscent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs during the Great Depression. These tariffs, imposing a minimum 10 percent tax on almost all imports, have led to a plunge in the S&P 500 and retaliatory measures from other countries. Economists warn that these tariffs will likely increase prices for American consumers and trigger a global trade war, potentially leading to a significant decline in economic growth. The situation is viewed as a declaration of economic independence.</p>

The ruling said the court was not resolving the validity of the administration’s reliance on that law to carry out the deportations, but found that the challenge to the wartime law must take place in Texas, where the migrants were held, and not in Washington DC.</p>
