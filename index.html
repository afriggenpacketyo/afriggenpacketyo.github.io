          <p>A look at the mixed legacy of former Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, whose tenure has concluded. Supporters praise his integrity and efforts to unify the nation, while critics point to his autocratic tendencies, human rights abuses, and flawed economic policies. The article highlights events like the violent crackdown on #EndSARS protests and economic mismanagement, which led to a recession and earned him the nickname "Baba Go Slow." His leadership has sparked national conversations on accountability and democratic reform, leaving behind a complex record of both commendation and condemnation for the country to assess.</p>

Analysts suggest that increasing institutional adoption and potential policy clarity are key factors fueling investor confidence. While the long-term outlook appears bullish to some, potential risks include future interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in response to tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Greece's ruling party will request a parliamentary investigation into a long-running scandal involving the fraudulent acquisition of EU agricultural subsidies. The move comes after the EU fined Greece €392 million for the misuse of funds by its payment agency between 2016 and 2023. The EU prosecutor also alleges political involvement in the fraud, which has already led to the resignation of four ministers. The government's proposed investigation would date back to 1998, but opposition parties have accused them of attempting a cover-up by broadening the timeline to implicate previous administrations.</p>

          <p>A shooting spree in Lexington, Kentucky, ended with two women killed at a local church and the suspect dead after a confrontation with police. The incident began when the suspect shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop, then carjacked a vehicle and fled to the Richmond Road Baptist Church. Inside the church, he fatally shot two women, aged 72 and 32, and wounded two other men before being killed by responding officers. Authorities believe the shooter may have had a connection to the victims at the church.</p>

          <p>The process of appointing judges to Germany's highest court has devolved into a political crisis, after a planned vote in parliament was abruptly canceled. The governing coalition could not guarantee the necessary two-thirds majority for one of its nominees, a jurist whose liberal stance on abortion drew opposition from within the conservative bloc and from the far-right AfD party. The failure to elect the judges has been called a "bad day for democracy" by opposition leaders and has exposed a serious rift within the ruling coalition, prompting calls for a special session to resolve the impasse.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve potentially poised to cut interest rates later this year, savers are considering how to best lock in current high yields on certificates of deposit (CDs). Experts offer differing advice on the ideal CD term to choose. Some suggest short-term CDs remain attractive as banks are offering competitive rates, while others argue that a longer-term CD could be advantageous to secure a high rate before they fall. For those unsure, building a CD ladder with staggered maturity dates is presented as a balanced strategy to manage interest rate risk while maintaining some liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. announcement to send Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, this article explains the capabilities of the advanced air-defense weapon. The Patriot is a mobile, surface-to-air system designed to intercept threats like tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft—all of which Russia uses in its attacks. While effective against high-altitude threats, it is less so against smaller, low-flying drones. The deal, which will be paid for by European allies, provides Ukraine with a much-needed defensive tool, building on previous supplies of Patriots and other systems used to counter Russian aerial bombardments.</p>

          <p>General Motors and LG Energy Solution are upgrading their joint-venture battery plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to produce a new, lower-cost type of electric vehicle battery. The facility will manufacture lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, which are significantly cheaper than standard lithium-ion batteries because they do not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel. GM states this move will help diversify its EV portfolio and make electric vehicles more affordable. Commercial production of the new LFP cells is expected to begin by late 2027, supporting GM's clean energy strategy.</p>

          <p>Customs officials at Germany's Cologne Bonn airport made an unusual and unsettling discovery: approximately 1,500 young tarantulas packed into plastic containers inside chocolate sponge cake boxes. The shipment, which originated from Vietnam, was flagged due to a suspicious smell that did not match the declared contents. Most of the venomous spiders did not survive the journey, and the surviving animals were handed over to an expert handler.

Leijdekkers, known as "Chubby Jos," is a fugitive believed to be hiding in Sierra Leone and was sentenced in absentia to 24 years in prison for murder and cocaine trafficking. The seized assets were determined to be profits from his criminal activities, including drug shipments and gold purchases.

          <p>China's exports of rare earth elements increased significantly in June, reaching their highest point since 2009. The 60% year-over-year surge comes as Beijing appears to be relaxing some of its stringent export controls on the critical minerals. This development is seen by analysts as a potential sign of a thaw in trade relations, possibly stemming from behind-the-scenes agreements with the United States. The increase follows reports that China had begun issuing new six-month export licenses to select American manufacturers and was working to streamline the approval process for European businesses.
