            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen visited Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported to El Salvador due to an administrative error, and found him "traumatized" by his initial prison experience. The Trump administration insists Abrego Garcia is a violent MS-13 member, allegations his family denies. Despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate his return, the administration claims El Salvador now has authority. The case has drawn criticism from Republicans and highlights ongoing debates about due process and immigration enforcement, especially concerning individuals with alleged gang affiliations.</p>

The group warns that the deportations are proceeding despite previous court rulings requiring adequate notice and opportunity for legal challenges.</p>

Despite some exemptions, potential tariffs and export controls threaten Apple's operations.

The company's future strategy and its impact on both economies remain uncertain (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>The case of Kilmar Ábrego García, mistakenly deported from Maryland to El Salvador, has become a focal point in debates about immigration and due process. Despite the Trump administration's claim of an administrative error, they maintain that Abrego Garcia has ties to the MS-13 gang. While a judge has ordered the government to "facilitate" his return, El Salvador's president has stated he will not allow it. The case highlights the complexities of immigration law and the rights of individuals facing deportation.</p>
