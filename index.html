          <p>Circle's stock experienced a significant rally after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, proposed stablecoin legislation. The bill aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Coinbase shares also rose, benefiting from interest earned on Circle's USDC reserves. The GENIUS Act is expected to enhance payment rails, improve transparency, and promote dollar dominance, while adding consumer protections and regulatory oversight for stablecoins.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Students seeking loans for the fall of 2025 can benefit from slightly decreased federal student loan rates. Federal undergraduate loan rates are set to drop to 6.39%, offering some relief, while private loans may offer more competitive rates, especially for borrowers with good credit or a cosigner. Maximizing federal funding options by completing the FAFSA is recommended before exploring private loans. Optimizing credit profiles, using a cosigner, and considering shorter repayment terms can further lower rates; comparing options from various lenders and taking advantage of discounts is crucial for securing the most affordable student loan.

          <p>The UK Parliament has passed a bill allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales to end their lives, marking a significant step towards legalizing assisted dying. The bill permits individuals over 18 with less than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, subject to approval from two doctors and a review panel. Supporters argue this offers a compassionate choice, while critics fear potential pressure on vulnerable individuals.

          <p>The FDA has proposed a new national priority voucher plan to expedite drug reviews for companies supporting U.S. national interests. This plan aims to reduce drug review times to one to two months, significantly faster than the current 10-month standard or six-month priority review. The program targets companies addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, meeting public health needs, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. While the plan is seen as potentially positive for the pharmaceutical industry, concerns remain about the risks of accelerated reviews and potential political influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a legal scholar, President Trump has the constitutional authority to strike Iran without congressional approval. This argument stems from a distinction between Congress' power to declare war and the president's authority to use force abroad. While lawmakers debate their role in authorizing military action, the expert suggests that Congress' true power lies in its ability to control military funding. Resolutions in the Senate and House aimed at requiring congressional approval before any force is used against Iran are viewed as "political opportunism" by the scholar.</p>

          <p>A security review has been initiated across UK military bases after pro-Palestinian activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and sprayed military planes with red paint. The incident, condemned by Prime Minister Starmer, prompted an investigation by counter-terrorism police. Palestine Action claimed responsibility, stating they evaded security to put the air-to-air refueling tankers "out of service," though the RAF is assessing the damage and does not expect operational impacts. The activists targeted the base, alleging Britain continues to support Israel militarily, despite public condemnation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that fossil fuel companies can challenge California's ability to set stricter emission standards for vehicles. This decision supports a challenge by oil and gas companies and Republican-led states against a waiver allowing California to exceed federal pollution standards. The ruling overturns a lower court decision that had dismissed the lawsuit. While the ruling does not immediately end California's standards, it opens the door for legal challenges that could unravel key tools used to curb planet-heating emissions.</p>

Despite using the conflict to rally support, the regime's perceived failure to protect its top officials has raised doubts among the public. Experts suggest that the possibility of regime collapse depends largely on the presence of a viable political alternative, though opposition forces remain divided. While the regime is attempting to use nationalist rhetoric to firm up support, it is difficult to ascertain the true feelings of the Iranian people amid fear and anger.</p>

The vote by MPs to approve Kim Leadbeater's bill is arguably the biggest vote regarding bodily autonomy since the legalisation of abortion in Great Britain in 1967. The Terminally Ill (End of Life) Bill will now go to the Lords, where it is likely to spend several months undergoing the same line-by-line scrutiny that it did before MPs. The government has said it could take up to four years to set up an assisted dying service, meaning it could be 2029 or even 2030 before the first medically-assisted death happens.</p>

          <p>River Island plans to close 33 shops in the UK, putting hundreds of jobs at risk, due to increased online shopping and higher costs. The clothing retailer is also seeking rent cuts at a further 71 stores that are at risk. River Island made a significant loss in 2023 after sales fell, prompting the need for restructuring. The company aims to minimize job losses and has a turnaround plan in place.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration to Shutter Specialized LGBTQ+ Suicide Lifeline Option</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is terminating a specialized LGBTQ+ suicide lifeline option, known as 988 option 3, sparking backlash. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration announced that the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline will no longer silo LGB+ youth services, but will focus on serving all help seekers. Critics argue that this decision removes a crucial resource for LGBTQ+ people in crisis, particularly during Pride Month. The Department of Health and Human Services stated that the "Press 3 option" ran out of congressionally directed funding, leading to the decision.</p>
