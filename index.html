          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un held their first formal talks in six years in Beijing, a significant diplomatic event following their joint appearance at China's Victory Day parade. The meeting, which included Russia's Vladimir Putin at the parade, was interpreted as a deliberate show of unity against the West. This marked Kim's first appearance on a multilateral stage since taking power and represents a key moment in his diplomatic outreach, historically reliant on Beijing's support.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests AI Has Changed How Students Cheat, Not Necessarily How Many</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An education researcher argues that the panic over students using AI to cheat is misplaced, as evidence suggests the technology has primarily changed the method rather than the overall frequency of cheating. Studies indicate that cheating rates were already high before the advent of generative AI like ChatGPT. The article explores the nuances of AI use in academics, noting that students use it for various purposes from brainstorming to generating entire essays, creating a complex challenge for educators to define new rules and expectations.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka has reached the semi-finals in 12 of her last 13 Grand Slam tournaments, a level of consistency unmatched in women's tennis. However, her powerful style has often been undermined by a tendency to lose emotional control at critical moments, resulting in only three titles from those deep runs. As she prepares for the US Open semi-final against Jessica Pegula, her team, now including doubles champion Max Mirnyi, is focused on helping her manage these fluctuations to secure another major victory.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that China has been more effective at checking President Donald Trump's radical policies than domestic U.S. institutions like the courts or financial markets. The author argues that while Wall Street and others have failed to act as guardrails, Beijing has successfully forced Trump to back down on certain issues. The piece cites Trump's attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Labor Statistics as evidence of a severe erosion of governance standards within the United States.</p>

          <h2>Nasdaq Proposes Stricter Listing Rules for Small Chinese Companies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Nasdaq stock exchange has proposed new listing requirements that would make it more difficult for small Chinese companies to go public in the U.S. The key change would require companies operating primarily in China to raise a minimum of $25 million in their initial public offering. This move is a response to a recent flood of microcap Chinese IPOs that have been linked to manipulative trading schemes and pose a higher risk to investors, coming amid broader U.S.-China financial and political tensions.</p>

A victory or draw will guarantee England wins Pool A, while Australia needs at least a bonus point to ensure their progression to the knockout stage.</p>

          <p>China has implemented anti-dumping tariffs ranging from 33.3% to 78.2% on several American fiber-optic companies, including Corning. The announcement from the Ministry of Commerce came hours after the U.S. sanctioned a Chinese chemical firm over its alleged role in fentanyl production. Beijing stated that the tariffs were the result of its first-ever anti-circumvention investigation, which concluded that U.S. exporters were altering trade practices to undermine existing anti-dumping duties, further escalating trade tensions between the two nations.</p>
