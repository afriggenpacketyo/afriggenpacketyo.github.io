          <p>President Trump has terminated trade talks with Canada, a move that experts suggest could raise prices for goods like cars, auto parts, and home appliances. The decision was reportedly a response to a Canadian ad featuring Ronald Reagan that was critical of tariffs. Existing 35% tariffs on many Canadian goods, and specific levies on steel and aluminum, may remain in place longer, increasing costs for U.S. manufacturers and consumers. The halt also casts uncertainty on the upcoming review of the USMCA trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Early tallies in the Irish presidential election indicate significant support for independent candidate Catherine Connolly over her main rival, Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys. Voters are choosing a successor to President Michael D Higgins in a race that saw a third candidate withdraw too late to be removed from the ballot. Initial results from various constituencies show Connolly with a commanding lead in first-preference votes, though turnout is projected to be low. The official result is expected to be announced later from Dublin Castle.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa has resulted in at least four deaths across Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with forecasters warning it could intensify into a hurricane. The storm has caused destructive landslides and flooding, destroying nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and disrupting water supplies for over half a million people. The U.S. National Hurricane Center predicts the storm may bring "catastrophic" rainfall of up to 25 inches to parts of Hispaniola and Jamaica. This storm is the 13th of what is predicted to be an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham is preparing for the upcoming El Clasico against Barcelona, a match that provides a crucial stage for him to showcase his form after a challenging start to the season due to injury. The game is notable as it's expected to be the first El Clasico featuring two English players, with Barcelona's Marcus Rashford also in form. Having been left out of the recent England squad, Bellingham will be eager to impress national team manager Thomas Tuchel. His recent match-winning goal in the Champions League suggests a return to the influential play that defined his debut season.</p>

While a few small, local markets have been called off for various reasons like renovations or low revenue, major markets across the country are scheduled to open as planned. The viral claims originated from an article on a low-credibility site that cited unaffordable security costs, but officials in the towns mentioned have confirmed their markets are proceeding.

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein case remains a persistent issue for President Donald Trump, with public and political pressure mounting for the full release of unredacted "Epstein files." Despite Trump's friendship with Epstein in the 1990s, he has since tried to distance himself from the disgraced financier. The recent publication of a posthumous memoir by survivor Virginia Giuffre has intensified speculation about Epstein's network.

          <p>President Trump has accused Ontario's provincial government of "dirty play" for delaying the pause of a controversial trade advertisement until after the first two World Series games. The ad, which features Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs, was cited by Trump as the reason for halting trade talks with Canada. Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the ad would be paused on Monday to allow talks to resume but intentionally kept it airing over the weekend. The ad was broadcast during Game 1, which featured the Toronto Blue Jays, further irritating the President.</p>

          <p>The upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur will focus on pressing regional security issues, including the long-standing border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia and the ongoing civil war in Myanmar. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to attend and oversee the signing of a peace accord aimed at resolving the Thai-Cambodian tensions, which flared into deadly combat earlier this year. However, diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in Myanmar have been largely ineffective, and the bloc remains divided on how to handle the country's upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>The East Wing of the White House has been completely demolished to make way for a new $300 million ballroom personally commissioned by President Donald Trump. This action contradicts an earlier promise that no existing structures would be torn down for the project, which is being privately funded by corporations and individuals. The East Wing, first built in 1902 and later expanded, housed the first lady's offices and served as the public entrance for tours and events. The demolition has drawn sharp criticism from presidential historians and former White House staff.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the prosecution of several current and former Justice Department and FBI officials, including special counsel Jack Smith and former Attorney General Merrick Garland. Trump accused them of illegal conduct related to an FBI investigation that reportedly examined the phone records of nine Republican lawmakers following the 2020 election. This marks an escalation in Trump's calls to prosecute political adversaries, following the recent indictments of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p>

          <p>Russia is facing a severe demographic crisis, with a shrinking and aging population that President Vladimir Putin has called a crucial national issue. Birth rates have fallen to near-record lows, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and an exodus of young men. In response, the government has implemented policies promoting "traditional family values," including laws that restrict abortion access and ban the promotion of "child-free ideology." Critics argue these restrictive measures fail to address the underlying economic uncertainty and will not solve the demographic problem.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has imposed sanctions on several subsidiaries of the South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group, including its shipping and shipyard entities. The ministry accused Hanwha of assisting a U.S. investigation into Chinese competitors that led to new port fees. The sanctioned companies are now barred from conducting business with Chinese entities. This move comes as Hanwha's recent acquisition of a Philadelphia shipyard is being promoted by Seoul as a key part of a U.S.-South Korea initiative to revitalize the American shipbuilding industry.</p>

For example, some donors have received large government contracts, are seeking regulatory approval for mergers, or have benefited from favorable policy shifts from the Trump administration. The White House has dismissed concerns, stating private funding is preferable to using taxpayer money. (not investment advice)</p>
