          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is conducting a high-profile state visit to the United Kingdom, marked by royal pageantry and meetings with King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Despite the focus on strengthening Franco-British ties in areas like defense and trade, the visit is overshadowed by the looming threat of new US trade tariffs from the Trump administration. European leaders are anxiously awaiting details of the tariffs, which could significantly impact the continent's economy, making transatlantic trade a critical topic during the diplomatic events.

          <h2>New "Superman" Film Sparks Political Debate Over Superhero's Role</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, is generating political controversy by portraying the iconic hero as a protector of "universal morality" rather than a symbol of American exceptionalism. This depiction has drawn criticism from right-wing commentators, who label it as "woke" and call for a boycott. The article explores the long-standing debate over the political leanings of superhero franchises, contrasting the perceived conservatism of DC characters with the more liberal-leaning Marvel universe, and notes the director's history as an outspoken critic of Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The FBI is actively searching for Benjamin Hanil Song, a 32-year-old U.S. Marine Corps reservist, who is the 12th suspect in an organized ambush on an ICE detention center in Alvarado, Texas. The attack, which occurred on July 4th, involved a group dressed in military-style gear firing AR-15 style rifles at officers, resulting in one officer being shot in the neck. Song is charged with attempted murder of federal officers, and authorities have issued a Blue Alert, considering him armed and dangerous. A $25,000 reward is being offered for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued after a section of a large industrial tunnel collapsed deep underground in Los Angeles. The workers were approximately six miles in from the entrance and 400 feet below the surface when the cave-in occurred. They managed to navigate over a significant debris pile to reach a tunnel boring machine, from which they were transported to safety. Authorities praised the workers for their calm and professional response, and Mayor Karen Bass celebrated the outcome as a "victory" with no major injuries reported.</p>

          <p>A large-scale overnight Russian aerial assault has struck Kyiv, killing at least two people and injuring thirteen others, according to Ukrainian officials. The attack involved numerous drones and missiles, causing fires in multiple districts and significantly damaging residential buildings and a primary healthcare center. Air defenses were active for hours, but wreckage from intercepted drones still caused destruction on the ground. This attack is part of an escalating campaign by Russia, which recently launched its largest-ever drone assault on Ukraine, further diminishing hopes for a diplomatic resolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has suspended deliveries of its electric ID.Buzz van to the United States, citing multiple factors for the decision. The move is reportedly influenced by the 27.5% tariff imposed by the Trump administration on new cars imported from Europe, which makes the vehicle less competitive. Additionally, the model is subject to a recall by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration because its third-row seats do not meet federal safety standards. This halt comes as VW reports a nearly 7% drop in vehicle deliveries to North America for the first half of the year.</p>

          <p>Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, has given Royal Mail permission to stop delivering second-class letters on Saturdays as part of a significant reform to its service obligations. The change, which also allows for second-class mail to be delivered every other weekday, is intended to help the company cut costs amid a sharp decline in letter volumes. While Royal Mail welcomed the move for financial sustainability, it must still deliver first-class letters six days a week. The regulator also adjusted delivery targets to allow for slightly slower service while introducing new penalties for long delays.</p>

This system, composed of both municipally owned and limited-profit association housing, serves a wide range of income levels and helps keep overall rent prices down. The article explores the historical origins of this model in "Red Vienna" and its financing through a levy on employee salaries. While praised for its stability and affordability, the system faces challenges, including complex allocation processes that can be difficult for newcomers to navigate.</p>

The device, weighing only 74 milligrams, is strapped to the bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses to its brain. These pulses create illusions that allow scientists to command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat. In tests, the bee obeyed the commands with a 90% success rate, representing a significant advancement in micro-robotics and bio-integrated technology.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Poor Countries Paying Millions to Trump-Linked Lobbyists for Aid</h2>

          <p>An investigation by Global Witness has found that some of the world's poorest countries, including Somalia, Haiti, and Yemen, are paying millions to lobbying firms with ties to Donald Trump. These deals are reportedly an attempt to offset the impact of US cuts to foreign humanitarian assistance. The report details how nations are signing contracts worth millions and, in some cases, bartering access to crucial natural resources like minerals in exchange for humanitarian or military support. This trend raises concerns about the exploitation of vulnerable countries in a new era of transactional diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative Party chairman and cabinet minister, has defected to Reform UK, marking a significant political victory for Nigel Farage's party. Berry, who was knighted by Boris Johnson, issued a sharp rebuke of the last two decades of Conservative and Labour rule. His defection follows that of several other former Tory MPs, signaling a clear trend of right-leaning figures moving to Reform. The development is forcing a strategic shift in the Labour government, which is now turning its attention toward countering Reform's growing momentum and influence.</p>

          <p>Poland has reinstated spot border checks with Germany, mirroring a move made by Germany in 2023 and further straining the principle of free movement within the Schengen Area. The checks, implemented by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, are a response to Germany's toughened migration policies. For residents in the intertwined border cities of Frankfurt an der Oder and Slubice, the new controls are causing significant daily disruptions, including traffic delays and difficulties for cross-border commuters and students.

          <p>The article examines how Roy Barclay, a man on Suffolk Police's most-wanted list, was able to evade capture for two years before murdering 57-year-old Anita Rose. Despite being wanted for a parole violation since 2022, Barclay left a significant digital footprint, using a bank card and posting hundreds of reviews on Google Maps. He lived in makeshift camps but remained active online, raising serious questions about the police's efforts to track him down. The case is now subject to a partnership review between the police and probation service to determine how this failure occurred.</p>

          <p>In an effort to stabilize its labor market, the Chinese government has announced a new one-time subsidy for companies that hire unemployed young people between the ages of 16 and 24. Employers can receive up to 1,500 yuan (US$209) for each new hire who is given a formal contract and full social insurance benefits for at least three months. This measure, funded by unemployment insurance reserves, aims to combat persistent youth unemployment amid slower economic growth.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California, arguing that the state's animal welfare laws for egg-laying hens create "unnecessary red tape" that illegally drives up egg prices nationwide.
