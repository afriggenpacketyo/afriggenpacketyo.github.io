        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With economic uncertainties impacting retirement savings, annuities are gaining traction as a means to secure financial stability during retirement. These financial products involve investing money with an insurance company in exchange for regular income payments. Experts highlight the guaranteed lifetime income and market volatility protection as key advantages, while noting fees and limited access to funds as potential drawbacks. Before investing, it's crucial to balance investments, research the company's financial strength, create a retirement budget, and review current economic conditions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's diagnosis with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, Dr. Ben Davies, a professor of urology, provides insights into the condition and available treatment options. Despite the severity of Biden's diagnosis, Davies emphasizes that hormonal treatments, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy can effectively manage the cancer and extend his life. Davies also notes that Biden's age should not necessarily limit treatment options, but the focus will be on his overall physiology and tolerance of therapies. The American Cancer Society estimates over 300,000 new cases of prostate cancer in the U.S. in 2025.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sleep specialists suggest that dietary habits significantly impact sleep quality, recommending practices such as incorporating foods rich in tryptophan, swapping sugary and processed foods for fruits and vegetables, and avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon and evening. Tryptophan, found in foods like almonds and turkey, converts to serotonin and melatonin, promoting sleep. Fruits and vegetables provide sleep-supporting nutrients and fiber, while limiting caffeine and alcohol intake before bed can prevent sleep disruption. Avoiding heavy meals close to bedtime also aids digestion and improves sleep.</p>

The deal extends existing access for EU boats in exchange for reduced checks on food exports. Salmon Scotland, however, welcomes the agreement as a way to cut red tape and improve access to the EU market. The agreement is part of a broader UK-EU summit aimed at improving trade relations.</p>

          <p>Researchers are puzzled by a recent surge in baby monkey kidnappings among capuchin monkeys on Jicarón Island in Panama. Young male capuchins have been observed abducting baby howler monkeys, often leading to the infants' deaths due to lack of nourishment. This behavior, documented through wildlife cameras, is seen as a potentially pointless activity driven by boredom or a need for stimulation. The capuchins' actions, which are similar to certain human behaviors, raise questions about the origins and purpose of this destructive trend.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of former President Joe Biden's diagnosis with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, well wishes have poured in from across the political spectrum. President Trump, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Barack Obama were among those who offered their support and prayers for Biden's recovery. While many expressed concern and support, Vice President JD Vance raised questions about Biden's health during his time in office, although there has been no indication Biden had symptoms while president.</p>

          <p>Israel has declared an expansion of its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, aiming to seize more territory and pressure Hamas to surrender after over 19 months of conflict. The announcement follows a deadly week for Palestinians in Gaza, which has been devastated by the war and a recent aid blockade. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israeli troops could take control of all of Gaza, but the extent of the operation remains unclear amidst ongoing cease-fire negotiations and pressure from the Trump administration.</p>

Her departure suggests a settlement may be close, and CBS News President Tom Cibrowski and CBS Stations President Jennifer Mitchell will now report directly to CBS Chief Executive George Cheeks.</p>

Dan has promised to strengthen the rule of law and will hold talks with democratic parties to form a government.

After a two-month blockade, Israel allowed limited aid into Gaza, a decision driven by concerns over potential famine and criticism from foreign allies. Simultaneously, the military is escalating its ground offensive, though the extent of the operation remains uncertain due to disagreements within the leadership. This strategic ambiguity reflects the need to satisfy both right-wing political allies and international demands for humanitarian relief.</p>

The agreement on plant and animal health, or sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS), goes further than envisaged a few months ago.
