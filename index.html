            <p>US envoy Steve Witkoff met with Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg for over four hours, coinciding with Donald Trump's call for Russia to expedite a ceasefire in Ukraine. The meeting, Witkoff's third with Putin this year, occurred as European defense ministers expressed concerns about the ongoing conflict. Earlier, Witkoff met with Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, who recently visited Washington. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war and alleged the involvement of Chinese nationals in the Russian army, while also reiterating the need for air defense systems for Ukraine.</p>

            <p>An immigration judge has ruled that Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported, agreeing with the Trump administration's assertion that his presence poses adverse foreign policy consequences. The ruling, based on a memo by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, stunned Khalil's supporters and raises concerns about the targeting of international students. Khalil, a green card holder, addressed the court, criticizing the lack of due process and fairness in his case. His attorneys argued that the government failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims, citing Khalil's involvement in protests against the war in Gaza.</p>

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield has topped 4.5% after a steep rise this week, fueled by President Trump's trade policies.

The White House is closely monitoring the bond market, with officials acknowledging the potential impact of rising yields on their economic agenda.

            <p>The State Department is instructing staff to report colleagues for instances of "anti-Christian bias," reflecting President Trump's efforts to reshape government policy on religious expression. An internal cable establishes a short window for employees to report perceived religious discrimination, with emphasis on Christianity. Examples include mistreatment for opposing displays of flags or policies related to preferred personal pronouns. Some employees expressed shock at the request, fearing it would create a culture of fear.</p>

            <p>The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage surged to 7.1%, the highest since mid-February, due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the bond market. Bond yields spiked higher mid-week with the new tariffs. A monthly report on consumer sentiment came in substantially lower than expected, with expectations for inflation jumping to the highest level since 1981. This comes during the critical spring housing market, potentially impacting consumer investment.</p>

            <p>Wells Fargo reported mixed first-quarter earnings with revenue misses offset by lower expenses and better provisions. Despite the cloudy economic outlook due to tariffs and trade wars, the analyst is willing to look past these results because of a key catalyst on the horizon. Wells Fargo may be off to a slower start to the year than expected, but we continue to appreciate the changes the bank has made under Charlie Scharf who became CEO in 2019. We think Wells Fargo should be in a relatively better position to weather the storm. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK government is considering taking control of a major British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, which is at risk of imminent closure. MPs have been called back from their Easter break to pass an emergency law which would keep the Chinese-owned site operating. The government is weighing up options to protect the site. This intervention stops short of nationalisation - when a government takes ownership and control of a company - but Sir Keir said the government would do "everything possible" to "protect" the UK's steel industry.</p>

            <p>A glitch in U.S. Customs and Border Protection's system is delaying tariff collection for freight shipments, including those affected by recent tariff changes. The glitch affects the entry code used to exempt freight from tariffs, causing delays in payment processing. Customs is advising importers to file cargo release forms separately and pay duties later, adding to the uncertainty surrounding trade policy. The delay raises questions about Customs' ability to handle the rapid pace of tariff changes and collect revenue.</p>
