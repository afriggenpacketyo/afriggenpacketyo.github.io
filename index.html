          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks WNBA team faced backlash on social media for a post featuring rookie guard Sarah Ashlee Barker in what some users deemed a sexualized manner, with critics questioning the focus on "thirst traps" instead of team uniforms. Some fans expressed concern that such posts undermine the credibility of women's sports, while others defended the team's marketing choices. This incident follows similar criticism directed at Sparks forward Cameron Brink, who was accused of prioritizing off-court activities over rehabbing her ACL injury. Brink defended her dedication to recovery, emphasizing her passion for basketball and dismissing accusations from those she deemed not real fans. Optimism remains relatively low, given the contentious nature of social media debates and the potential impact on team morale.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies is seeking to strengthen its position as a key global supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G infrastructure for network operators, even as the telecoms industry experiences market saturation. Huawei deputy chairman Eric Xu Zhijun outlined four key growth areas: new user groups, high-definition video, intelligent connected vehicles, and expanded fiber-to-the-room for small businesses. Xu did not address the geopolitical challenges Huawei has faced since the U.S. imposed sanctions in 2019, which have hindered its overseas expansion. Despite these challenges, Huawei is committed to working with global carriers to achieve sustainable growth in the evolving telecoms landscape.</p>

The availability and timing of potential evacuation options remain unclear, as Ben Gurion International Airport and all Israeli seaports are currently closed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Californians struggle with high transportation costs, making car ownership unaffordable and forcing individuals like Franchescoli Andrade to endure long commutes via public transit. A study by United Way reveals that 35% of California households cannot afford basic living expenses, including transportation. The annual cost of owning a new car averages over $12,000, posing a significant financial burden on families. While moving to more affordable areas might seem like a solution, it's often impractical due to family and community ties, leading many to seek ways to manage transportation expenses within their current circumstances.</p>

          <p>A New Yorker known as "Streeter" has turned reporting idling vehicles into a six-figure income by leveraging the city's Citizens Air Complaint Program. The program allows citizens to report trucks and non-city buses idling for over three minutes, entitling them to 25% of the resulting fines. George Pakenham, who helped create the law, emphasizes it as a public health measure to reduce air pollution. While the program has generated significant revenue for the city, some truck drivers view it as a "bounty hunter program" and argue that idling is sometimes necessary for their operations.</p>

While the Buss family, who have owned the Lakers since 1979, will retain a minority stake, the change in leadership is expected to bring a renewed focus on sustained championship contention and a significant investment in the team's infrastructure and resources.</p>

The court's majority found that the law is not subject to heightened judicial review, while the dissenting justices argued that the law discriminates based on sex and inflicts harm on transgender children and their families.

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention, based on clinical trial data showing a 99.9% effectiveness rate. Gilead Sciences, the drug's manufacturer, hails the approval as a significant milestone in the fight against HIV. While this approval marks progress, some experts express concern over the Trump administration's decision to cut funding for HIV vaccine research, which they believe is still essential. The CDC estimates that there were 31,800 new HIV infections in the United States in 2022, underscoring the need for continued prevention efforts.</p>

          <p>Leading climate scientists warn that the Earth could breach the 1.5C warming limit in as little as three years if carbon dioxide emissions continue at their current rate. This assessment comes from an updated analysis of global warming, highlighting the urgency of reducing emissions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The study reveals that the "carbon budget" for keeping warming to 1.5C has shrunk significantly due to continued record emissions. While the rate of emissions increases appears to be slowing, the authors emphasize the critical need for rapid and stringent emissions cuts to mitigate the severity of climate change.</p>

This comes as the OfS publishes guidance for universities in England on upholding free speech under a new law. The guidance aims to provide clarity to universities on how to balance freedom of speech with the need to protect students from harassment and unlawful discrimination. The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom, with the OfS having the power to impose sanctions for failures.</p>

          <p>Two breakthrough Alzheimer's drugs, donanemab and lecanemab, have been deemed too expensive for the NHS due to their limited benefits relative to the cost. NICE concluded that funding these drugs would be a poor use of taxpayers' money and could lead to cuts in other essential services. While the drugs can slow the disease's progression, their high cost and the resources required for administration and monitoring outweigh the modest benefits, according to NICE. Pharmaceutical companies involved plan to appeal the decision, arguing that the NHS is not adequately prepared to tackle Alzheimer's.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly being sold in a historic deal to billionaire financier Mark Walter, CEO of TWG Global, for an estimated $10 billion. The Buss family, who have owned the team since 1979, have agreed to the sale, which will mark the most expensive sale of a US sports team in history. Walter, who also has a controlling stake in the Los Angeles Dodgers, became a co-owner of the Lakers in 2021 with a 20% stake. Jeanie Buss will reportedly retain her position as the Lakers' governor under the terms of the sale.</p>

          <h2>State Department Issues New Social Media Vetting Guidelines for Student Visas</h2>

          <p>The State Department has issued new guidelines for more extensive social media vetting of international student visa applicants, instructing consular officers to look for signs of "hostility" toward the United States. Applicants will be asked to set all their social media accounts to "public," and failure to do so could be seen as evasive. U.S. officials are instructed to look for "any indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States." Counselors are already advising foreign students to purge their social media accounts of potentially problematic posts.</p>
