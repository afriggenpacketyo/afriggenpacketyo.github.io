          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani defended his proposal to increase taxes on what his plan describes as "richer and whiter neighborhoods." Speaking on NBC, Mamdani stated the language is an objective assessment of current tax imbalances and not racially motivated, but rather aimed at creating a fairer system. He also reiterated his belief that billionaires should not exist, viewing their extreme wealth as a symptom of profound inequality. The democratic socialist's platform has generated significant debate as he campaigns in a city with one of the world's highest concentrations of billionaires.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, citing a desire to step away from Washington's partisan gridlock. His decision came just hours after former President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him for his opposition to parts of a major Republican-backed spending and tax bill. In his statement, Tillis lamented that bipartisanship and independent thinking have become an "endangered species" in modern politics. The announcement opens up a competitive race for a key Senate seat in a state that has trended Republican in recent presidential elections.</p>

          <p>Insiders at AI chip manufacturer Nvidia have sold more than $1 billion of the company's stock in the past year, with approximately $500 million of those sales occurring in the last month. The sales coincide with the stock reaching new highs, having risen over 17% this year. Filings show that CEO Jensen Huang recently sold around $15 million in shares as part of a pre-announced plan to sell up to 6 million shares. Despite the significant insider selling, the company's stock continued to rally, briefly regaining its position as the world's most valuable company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An early morning explosion in Philadelphia's Nicetown-Tioga neighborhood resulted in the death of one person and injuries to two others. The blast caused the partial collapse of three rowhomes and damaged at least seven properties, prompting the evacuation of adjacent buildings as a safety precaution. The two injured individuals, an 82-year-old woman and a 62-year-old woman, were hospitalized, with one in critical condition. Officials have launched a thorough, multi-agency investigation into the cause of the explosion, which will involve a slow, methodical examination of the debris to prevent any secondary collapses.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United States is dangerously vulnerable due to its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for modern technology and defense systems. The author contends that despite knowing about this vulnerability for over 15 years, the U.S. has failed to create a coherent strategy, allowing Beijing to weaponize its control over these critical supply chains. Recent Chinese export controls and invasive licensing requirements are presented as evidence of this leverage.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary highlights a significant shift among the party's voters, particularly regarding Israel. As an outspoken critic of the Israeli government, Mamdani's success in a city with the largest Jewish population outside of Israel shows that a pro-Palestinian stance is no longer a disqualifier in Democratic primaries. His win has alarmed some in the Jewish community who are concerned about rising antisemitism, while many of his supporters, including progressive Jews, see it as a rejection of efforts to equate criticism of Israeli policy with antisemitism.</p>

          <p>An intense and early-season heatwave has brought record-breaking temperatures to several parts of Europe. In Spain, the national heat record for June was broken with a temperature of 46Â°C (114.8Â°F), while 21 cities in Italy were placed on high alert for extreme heat. Meteorologists warn that such heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense due to human-driven climate change, with this year's high temperatures arriving much earlier than usual. The extreme weather is also impacting biodiversity, with wildlife organizations in France reporting that they are overwhelmed with birds suffering from the heat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As temperatures rise, animal welfare charities are urging dog owners to take extra precautions, as dogs are highly susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Unlike humans, dogs have a limited ability to cool themselves and can overheat quickly, especially during exercise. Key signs of overheating include heavy panting, excessive drooling, and lethargy. Experts advise against walking dogs in hot weather, recommending instead to check pavement temperatures and provide walks only in the very early morning or late evening. Keeping dogs indoors in a cool environment is the safest option during peak heat.</p>

          <p>The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has stated that Iran could restart its uranium enrichment program in a matter of months. This assessment follows recent U.S. military strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities, which the Trump administration claimed had "totally obliterated" the program. Grossi noted that while the facilities suffered severe damage, it was not total, and Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity to rebuild. He stressed the importance of resuming diplomatic talks and allowing international inspectors back into the country to verify its nuclear activities.</p>
