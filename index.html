          <p>A sense of economic optimism is returning to Europe, with major financial conferences in Munich, London, and Paris set to highlight positive developments. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has expressed a notably more optimistic outlook on Germany's economy, citing a "window of opportunity" for growth. In London, Canary Wharf is experiencing a revival, with office leasing expected to hit a decade high as the financial sector leads a return-to-office push. This positive sentiment is echoed in the private markets sector, where investors are looking for opportunities despite some recent reductions in capital inflows. (not investment advice)</p>

She argues that college offers a unique concentration of intelligent, ambitious peers who can become future friends, co-founders, and employees.

          <p>The USC Trojans football team improved their record to 4-0 after defeating Michigan State 45-31 in a game marked by offensive firepower and defensive penalties. Wide receiver Makai Lemon was a standout performer, accounting for over half of the team's passing yards with 127 yards and scoring two crucial touchdowns. Despite racking up 517 total yards, USC's defense struggled with discipline, allowing the Spartans to stay within one score late in the fourth quarter. A decisive 13-play drive, capped by Lemon's second score, ultimately sealed the victory for the Trojans ahead of a challenging stretch of games.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, has been arrested in connection with a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. The incident occurred Friday afternoon when at least three rounds were fired into the building's lobby, striking a window but causing no injuries. Hernandez-Santana was initially arrested by Sacramento police on local charges and released on bail before being taken back into custody by the FBI on a federal charge. The motive for the shooting remains under investigation, and the act has been condemned by officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, as an attack on democracy.</p>

          <h2>Stalled Chinese Real Estate Developments Find New Purpose as Sets for Micro-Dramas</h2>

          <p>In China, a booming micro-drama industry is repurposing stalled real estate projects into lavish film sets, creating a stark contrast between on-screen luxury and real-world construction delays. As the audience for these short, online dramas surpasses 660 million, the demand for high-end shooting locations like opulent sales halls and apartments has surged. This trend provides a new, albeit temporary, use for commercial and residential properties left unfinished due to cash flow shortages and stricter regulations in the country's struggling property sector. The popularity of urban romance dramas, in particular, has fueled this creative reuse of otherwise idle spaces.</p>

The move has drawn sharp criticism from the Israeli government and has been described by some UK conservatives as a "reward for terrorism."

          <p>Top Premier League teams like Arsenal and Manchester City are increasingly adopting a more direct, long-ball style of play, a tactic once associated with lower-league football. This strategic shift is a response to the effectiveness of the high-press defense now common among elite clubs, which makes building up play with short passes from the back riskier. Managers like Mikel Arteta and Pep Guardiola are using long goal-kicks and quick transitions to bypass the press, minimize errors in their own half, and exploit the physical strengths of forwards like Kai Havertz and Erling Haaland. This evolution shows a pragmatic adaptation to modern defensive systems.</p>

While supporters argue it provides Palestinians with a stronger standing in future negotiations and reaffirms their right to self-determination, critics deem it merely "political theater" without tangible benefits. The recognition alone is unlikely to halt the war in Gaza or change the reality of Israeli occupation. However, it could increase diplomatic pressure on Israel and obligate recognizing countries to review their legal and political ties with both Israel and Palestine, potentially leading to more substantive actions.</p>

This discovery challenges the conventional wisdom that the moon's internal activity has largely ceased. The findings, published in the National Science Review, have important implications for future lunar missions and the establishment of permanent bases, as they highlight potential geological hazards that must be considered for long-term infrastructure projects.</p>
