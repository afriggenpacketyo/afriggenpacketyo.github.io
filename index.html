            <p>Former Trump White House border czar Tom Homan defended the administration's decision to deport Kilmer Abrego Garcia, alleging he is a violent MS-13 gang member and a threat to public safety, despite court orders to facilitate his return to the U.S. Homan argued that Abrego Garcia is under the authority of the El Salvador government and criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador. Abrego Garcia's attorneys and family deny the gang allegations, and the Supreme Court has ordered the administration to facilitate his return for a trial.

With the Supreme Court potentially intervening, the administration faces a choice between complying with judicial directives or continuing to defy legal processes.

            <p>A 19-year-old from Kansas City, Missouri, was arrested for allegedly setting fire to Tesla vehicles at a dealership, facing federal charges. Owen McIntire is accused of damaging two Cybertrucks using a Molotov cocktail. This arrest follows another suspect being charged with arson attacks on a Tesla dealership and Republican Party headquarters in Albuquerque. Authorities emphasized the seriousness of the crime and vowed to prosecute those targeting Tesla properties. Tesla vehicles have faced vandalism and protests since Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is pushing forward with a new rule to reclassify tens of thousands of career civil servants as "at-will" employees, potentially making it easier to fire them. The White House claims this is to address "unaccountable" federal employees and ensure they align with the president's policies. The proposed rule would affect career employees with policy-determining roles, but they would still be filled through merit-based hiring processes. The American Federation of Government Employees has criticized the move, arguing it undermines the professional civil service.</p>

            <p>Humberto Duran, an East L.A. man, was declared factually innocent after serving nearly 30 years in prison for a 1993 murder he maintained he did not commit. The case unraveled when the sole eyewitness recanted her testimony, claiming she was pressured by sheriff's deputies to identify Duran. His lawyers argued he was framed and had an alibi, leading the district attorney's office to concede evidence of "actual innocence." Duran is now eligible to seek compensation for his wrongful imprisonment, marking a significant victory after a decades-long fight for justice.</p>

            <p>Gary Shapley was removed as interim IRS commissioner just two days after his appointment due to an internal power struggle involving Elon Musk. The dispute centered on Musk's alleged role in bypassing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's authority to install Shapley, known for his whistleblower claims in the Hunter Biden tax probe. Bessent complained to President Trump, leading to Shapley's replacement with Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender. Shapley will continue serving as an advisor to Treasury Secretary Bessent.</p>

            <p>The article explores the use of dark humor as a coping mechanism and form of resistance in the face of political repression and authoritarianism. Drawing historical examples from Franco's Spain to Communist East Germany, it illustrates how sarcastic jokes and mockery can undermine the perceived inevitability of oppressive regimes. The piece also examines the use of humor by authoritarian leaders themselves and contrasts it with the anti-totalitarian laughter that reclaims humor for resistance. The rise of dark humor may reflect a broader sense of unease and uncertainty in contemporary society.</p>

            <p>Aurangzeb Alamgir, a Mughal emperor who died over 300 years ago, has become a central figure in India's political landscape, with his legacy leading to sectarian violence. Considered a tyrant by many Hindu nationalists, Aurangzeb's actions, such as razing temples and forcing religious conversions, have been seized upon to highlight historical injustices against the majority faith. This has caused fear among India's Muslim population, as right-wing groups demand the erasure of Aurangzeb's memory, reflecting rising tensions between the two communities.</p>

            <p>A Texas school district has banned the Virginia state flag and seal from younger students due to concerns over a depiction of a naked breast on the Roman goddess Virtus. The district removed a section about Virginia from its online learning platform for third through fifth graders. The decision has sparked controversy, with critics calling it censorship and questioning the school's definition of appropriate material. The Virginia flag has been a subject of debate in the past, with some officials even creating modified versions to cover the breast.</p>
