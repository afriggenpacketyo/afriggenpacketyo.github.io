          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced intense questioning from Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Maria Cantwell during a hearing, particularly regarding his stance on vaccines and the COVID-19 death toll. Kennedy stated he did not know how many Americans died from COVID-19, despite publicly available CDC data, and was labeled a "charlatan" by Senator Cantwell for his views. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy also raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest among Kennedy's hand-picked members for the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, many of whom hold vaccine-skeptic views and have received revenue as expert witnesses for plaintiffs suing vaccine makers. Kennedy disagreed, classifying these as biases rather than conflicts of interest, highlighting the contentious nature of the discussion.</p>

          <p>The first trailer for Emerald Fennell's adaptation of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights" has been released, revealing a sexually charged and erotic tone that appears more overt than the original 1847 gothic novel. Starring Margot Robbie, Jacob Elordi, and Owen Cooper, the film suggests intense, suppressed sexual urges and passionate conflict, with scenes like a topless Elordi toiling outdoors and suggestive bread kneading. Warner Bros. secured the rights to the project after a competitive bidding war, promising a wide cinema release for its Valentine's Day 2026 premiere. Despite some backlash regarding Elordi's casting as Heathcliff, the production team defended the artistic choices, emphasizing the film's visual beauty and powerful performances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tropical Storm Lorena, previously a hurricane, is currently weakening in the Pacific but continues to pose a significant threat to parts of Mexico, with landfall anticipated on Friday or early Saturday. Baja California Sur and southwestern Sonora are particularly vulnerable to life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides, as forecasters predict rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches, potentially reaching up to 15 inches in localized areas. The storm's trajectory is expected to move generally parallel to the west coast of the Baja California peninsula, bringing a tropical storm warning to the region. Additionally, the storm is generating powerful swells that are likely to cause dangerous surf and rip current conditions along the coasts through Friday, presenting a serious hazard to marine activities.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, undertook their first official engagement since their summer break, visiting the Natural History Museum gardens in London. Their planned tour with a group of schoolchildren was unexpectedly cut short by a sudden rainstorm, forcing the royal couple and children to quickly move inside the museum. Catherine, who is a patron of the museum, and Prince William were showcasing outdoor learning areas designed to help people feel more connected to nature, a cause Catherine has championed previously. This engagement marked the official start of their autumn program of events, which will include Prince William's visit to Brazil to commemorate the fifth anniversary of his Earthshot environmental prize.</p>

          <p>Scottish First Minister John Swinney has called for the UK government to agree to a Scottish independence referendum if the SNP secures a majority in next year's Holyrood election. Swinney argued that a new generation of voters, too young in 2014, warrants another vote, referencing the precedent set by the 2011 SNP majority. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer dismissed the proposal as "distraction politics" and criticized Swinney's immigration rhetoric. The Scottish government released a new paper, "Your Right To Decide," reiterating the people's right to self-determination, while the SNP prepares to finalize its independence strategy next month.</p>

Orsted alleges that the Interior Department's justification, citing national security concerns, is merely a pretext, pointing to President Trump's long-standing animosity towards wind power.

This action follows a similar legal challenge in California and comes amidst Trump's expressed interest in expanding military asset use to tackle crime in major cities. D.C. officials contend the deployment undermines local autonomy and poses dangers, as out-of-state, untrained military personnel police its streets.</p>

While specific details on who would be mandated to acquire a digital ID are still being worked out, Starmer suggests this initiative could play a crucial role in immigration control.

Lower courts have rejected his claims, with the Federal Circuit concluding the IEEPA does not explicitly authorize such tariffs. The Supreme Court's ruling will be pivotal for both tariff policy and the broader scope of presidential power, potentially signaling its stance on executive emergency declarations.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, reaffirming Beijing's unwavering commitment to their traditional friendship, state media reported. Kim's rare visit to China, which included attending a military parade alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin, has fueled speculation about a united front against the United States. While Trump commented on the three leaders "conspiring" against the U.S., Putin dismissed the notion. Experts suggest Kim's outreach aims to restore ties with China, North Korea's main ally and aid provider, especially as he prepares for the potential end of the Russia-Ukraine war and seeks leverage in future talks with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Giorgio Armani, the legendary Italian fashion designer, has passed away at the age of 91, his company officially announced. The visionary founder of the luxury fashion house in 1975, Armani maintained his roles as CEO and sole shareholder until his death, dedicating himself tirelessly to collections and ongoing projects. Renowned for dressing Hollywood celebrities and cultivating a distinctive lifestyle brand, Armani's 50th-anniversary celebrations are still scheduled for later this month. His meticulously planned succession involved a gradual transition of responsibilities to close associates and family members, aiming for an organic and seamless continuation of his globally recognized legacy rather than an abrupt change in leadership.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines is discontinuing flight services in a dozen cities, including key locations like Oakland, Sacramento, and San Diego, less than a week after filing for bankruptcy for the second time this year. The discount carrier, which had previously emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization, attributed its financial struggles to weak demand for domestic leisure travel and adverse market conditions. In a swift response to Spirit's withdrawal, rival airlines such as United and Frontier immediately announced new flight lineups to capture the newly available market share. Spirit apologized for the inconvenience, offering refunds to affected passengers as it actively seeks to cut money-losing routes during its ongoing restructuring process.</p>

          <p>Giorgio Armani, the legendary Italian fashion designer who died at 91, is remembered as a pioneer who revolutionized fashion for nearly half a century. Known for his minimalist aesthetic, his signature "greige" color, and deconstructed suits, Armani's androgynous designs resonated with the women's movement of the 1970s. Despite his immense wealth, he led a reclusive life, maintaining creative and managerial control of his empire until his death.

The unemployment rate holds at a low 4.2%, but job openings have decreased, and recent jobs reports indicate a sharp slowdown in hiring. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring these trends, with Chairman Jerome Powell signaling a potential interest rate cut to stimulate the economy amidst uncertainties from tariff policies.
