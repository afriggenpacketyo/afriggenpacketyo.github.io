          <h2>Trump's Iran Nuclear Deal Strategy Risks Military Conflict</h2>

          <p>As nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran stall, geopolitical tensions are rising, with oil prices spiking due to concerns about potential military confrontation. Trump has expressed declining confidence in reaching a deal with Tehran, accusing them of delaying negotiations, while Iran insists on its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. The IAEA has declared Iran in non-compliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations, further escalating the situation. Despite ongoing talks, the risk of military conflict remains, with Israel considering action, although some analysts believe confrontation may be averted through diplomatic pressure, and that the primary obstacle is Iran's insistence on domestic uranium enrichment. Optimism regarding a peaceful resolution has waned amid these developments.</p>

The protests and the upcoming midterm elections could create an opportunity for eased tensions or warmer ties between China and the US. This shift in focus could potentially lead to a period of reduced pressure in the relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Uranium mining is experiencing a resurgence in the United States due to increasing electricity demand from AI models and a global push for cleaner energy. The U.S., once a leader in uranium mining, now imports over 95% of its uranium, creating a policy incongruence. Government support, including a ban on Russian uranium imports and federal funding, aims to expand domestic uranium enrichment. Despite this, experts believe the U.S. will continue to rely on other countries for uranium due to limited domestic reserves.</p>

          <p>Two police officers who defended the Capitol on January 6, 2021, have filed a lawsuit seeking a court order to install a plaque honoring police heroes, citing a 2022 law requiring its installation by March 2023. The plaque remains in storage due to GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson's lack of commitment, angering victims and inflaming political divisions. The lawsuit argues the delay violates the Equal Protection clause and contends the Architect of the Capitol has failed to fulfill their duty. The officers point to the contrast between honoring Trump and the lack of recognition for those who defended the Capitol.</p>

The Reserve Bank of India has relaxed monetary policy, cutting its benchmark repo rate to 5.50%, amid these easing inflationary pressures.
