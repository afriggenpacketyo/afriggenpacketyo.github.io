          <p>A previously overlooked manuscript in Harvard Law School's library has been identified as an original 1300 version of the Magna Carta, a foundational document for modern liberties. Two British academics authenticated the manuscript, which was purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II, using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging. The discovery is particularly timely given the ongoing pressures faced by Harvard from the Trump administration, underscoring the document's enduring relevance in safeguarding against unjust rule. This finding brings the total number of extant original copies from 1300 to seven, highlighting the significance of preserving historical artifacts.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the key elements that contribute to winning performances at the Eurovision Song Contest. It suggests that successful acts often sing about personal liberation, preferably in English, and incorporate elements of folk music without being strictly folk songs. The article also highlights the importance of elaborate staging, including the use of fire and pyrotechnics, while cautioning against novelty acts and dramatic key changes. The piece uses past winners as examples to illustrate these points, offering a guide for future Eurovision hopefuls.</p>

          <p>A luxury hotel project in Serbia, backed by the Trump and Kushner families, faces complications after a Serbian official admitted to forging a document that allowed the demolition of a protected site. The project, slated to include a Trump International Hotel on the site of a bombed-out Defense Ministry building, has sparked outrage in Serbia. Opposition leaders are alleging that the forged document is evidence of a special deal secured by the Trump and Kushner family businesses.</p>

The loan aims to alleviate financial pressures as Vanke seeks to meet US$3.4 billion in debt obligations this year. Shenzhen Metro has provided Vanke with loans totaling 10.3 billion yuan this year, following a government-led shake-up. Despite this support, Fitch Ratings has downgraded Vanke's bonds further into junk territory.</p>

The judge refuted the government's claims he had ties to Hamas through his wife, whose father was a government official in Gaza. The Trump administration is still seeking to deport Suri in separate proceedings.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is prioritizing white South African refugees, reversing traditional refugee policies and halting aid to South Africa. The move, driven by President Trump's long-held views and influenced by conversations with Afrikaner activists and golfer Gary Player, is based on claims of "race-based discrimination" and a "genocide" against white farmers. The decision has faced criticism for its racial undertones and for ignoring the economic disparities faced by Black South Africans.</p>
