        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China and North Korea's foreign ministers recently convened in Beijing, where they affirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties and collectively opposing "all forms of hegemonism," a stance implicitly directed at the United States. This high-level meeting occurred weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin attended a significant military parade in the Chinese capital. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized the unswerving strategic policy of developing relations with Pyongyang, while his North Korean counterpart, Choe Son Gui, advocated for close cooperation in multilateral affairs to resist unilateralism and promote a more equitable global order. Analysts believe Kim is looking to reinforce his country's relationship with China, anticipating the eventual end of the conflict in Ukraine, despite previous strains due to Pyongyang's deepening security links with Moscow.</p>

          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy publicly condemned the "unacceptable and abusive behaviour" witnessed at the recent Ryder Cup, revealing that his wife, Erica, was hit by a drink thrown by an American fan. The incident, which occurred on the 17th tee during a Saturday match in New York, contributed to what McIlroy described as a "rough week" for the European team amidst a hostile crowd. Despite these challenges, Europe clinched a 15-13 victory over the United States. McIlroy passionately argued that golf, as a sport, should uphold higher standards of etiquette and respect, asserting that such conduct will not be tolerated at the next Ryder Cup, scheduled for Ireland in 2027.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, is poised for a decisive victory and a new parliamentary majority in elections crucial for the country's EU path. President Sandu had previously warned of "massive Russian interference" in the vote, citing its importance for Moldova's future. The PAS secured 50% of the vote, significantly ahead of the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc, despite claims of victory from opposition leader Igor Dodon. The election was marked by bomb scares at polling stations and arrests related to alleged unrest plots, which the head of Sandu's party attributed to Moscow-backed criminal groups.</p>

Speaking on a BBC podcast, Rooney characterized the club as "broken," admitting he now approaches matches expecting a loss, a sentiment fueled by their 14th-place standing in the Premier League. The team has only secured 34 points in Amorim's 33 league games, failing to achieve successive victories. Rooney further criticized certain players, suggesting they are unworthy of the Manchester United shirt, and called for extensive changes across the organization, lamenting that the club's "soul has gone."</p>

          <p>United States Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley has strongly advocated for a change to the "envelope rule" following his team's 15-13 defeat by Europe. This controversial rule mandates that if a player withdraws due to injury, a designated golfer from the opposing team also sits out, resulting in both teams receiving half a point for that match. Bradley expressed significant frustration when Europe's Viktor Hovland was forced to pull out, leading to a pre-match half-point award that made the US team's uphill battle even steeper. While European captain Luke Donald defended the rule as a long-standing agreement, Bradley insists it needs revision before the 2027 Ryder Cup in Ireland to ensure more equitable competition.</p>

          <p>Devastating flooding in Arizona, triggered by an unprecedented amount of rain in a short period, has resulted in at least three confirmed deaths. Two fatalities and one missing person were reported in Globe, a city east of Phoenix, with another individual found dead near a submerged vehicle in suburban Phoenix. The Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport recorded its highest one-day rainfall in nearly seven years, causing rapid inundation. A critical hazard emerged in Globe when approximately 1,000 residential-sized propane tanks were swept through the downtown area from a distributor, though fortunately, no explosions occurred. Local authorities have declared an emergency, initiating massive search and rescue operations while advising residents to avoid floodwaters.</p>

          <p>An opinion article critiques Kamala Harris's memoir, "107 Days," suggesting it reveals a profound lack of self-awareness within her campaign and the Democratic establishment. The author argues that Harris's campaign prioritized "vibes and spectacle" over substantive policy, failing to offer a distinct vision from Joe Biden's unpopular presidency. The piece portrays Harris as a politician focused on the machinery of politics rather than conviction, with her book inadvertently highlighting a "calamitous, mythical quality" to her defeat. It concludes that the Democrats' continued reliance on presentation and avoidance of risks indicates a deluded approach that will struggle against future challenges.</p>

          <p>A BBC cyber correspondent was recently targeted by a criminal group known as Medusa, which offered a substantial sum of money for insider access to BBC systems. The reporter engaged with the group, posing as a potential collaborator, to gain insight into their methods of leveraging employees for ransomware attacks. Medusa, identified as a ransomware-as-a-service operation with suspected ties to Russia, claimed a track record of successful insider deals. The situation intensified when the criminals attempted an "MFA bombing" attack on the reporter's phone, prompting the BBC's information security team to temporarily disconnect the reporter from all internal systems as a precautionary measure.

The recommendation for this change was prominently featured in the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel report, which highlighted the recurring suspicion and mistrust caused by police officers' Freemason ties during inquiries into the 1987 murder of private detective Daniel Morgan. The proposed policy aims to enhance transparency and public trust without outright prohibiting membership in such organizations.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs analysts are forecasting a probable easing of China's monetary policy in the fourth quarter, predicting a 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio. This projection arises from concerns over slowing economic momentum, with year-on-year growth potentially decelerating significantly from last year's high base. The People's Bank of China's recent shift in language, describing the economy as "making strides while maintaining stability" rather than "showing positive momentum," suggests a more cautious official outlook. While these data-dependent measures aim to bolster growth, the possibility of no action persists if the nation's "around 5 percent" full-year growth target appears achievable.

          <p>Denmark has enacted a comprehensive ban on all civilian drone flights throughout the current week, a measure implemented in anticipation of a significant European Union summit taking place in Copenhagen. The nation's transport ministry justified the decision by emphasizing the necessity to "simplify security work" for law enforcement, stating an intolerance for "foreign drones creating uncertainty and disruption," particularly after recent sightings over Danish military installations. This proactive step is part of a wider European effort to counter "drone incidents," with ten EU defense ministers previously agreeing to establish a "drone wall." Danish authorities are actively investigating the source of these incursions, not precluding Russia, which has faced accusations of hybrid attacks and airspace violations in other NATO member states.</p>

His exit now reconfigures the contest into a three-way race involving Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. Adams' tenure, which began in January 2022, was marked by a federal corruption scandal and scrutiny over his ties to the Trump administration.

While rents are still rising, the rate of increase has slowed, making previously unattainable prime commercial spaces more affordable.

          <p>The Phoenix Mercury, fueled by Alyssa Thomas's impressive 23 points and 10 assists, orchestrated a furious fourth-quarter comeback to stun the top-seeded Minnesota Lynx with an 86-81 victory in Game 4 of their semifinal series. This dramatic win propels the Mercury into the WNBA Finals for the first time since 2021. DeWanna Bonner was instrumental in the rally, scoring 11 of her 13 points and hitting all three of her three-pointers in the final period, enabling Phoenix to erase a 68-55 deficit. The Lynx faced challenges, playing without injured star center Napheesa Collier and with their head coach serving a suspension. The upcoming WNBA Finals will uniquely feature a best-of-seven format for the first time in the league's history.</p>

This remarkable raptor, known for its ability to fly at speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, faces significant threats from habitat loss and predation, with current estimates placing its population between 5,000 and 8,000. Organized by Forest & Bird, the contest serves to elevate public awareness regarding New Zealand's imperiled native bird species, 80% of which confront varying degrees of threat. The environmental group also emphasizes concerns over reduced governmental investment in conservation, despite the critical role native avifauna play in the country's ecological health and tourism economy.</p>

          <p>Shares in Sony Financial Group experienced a substantial 36% increase on its market debut Monday, following its spin-off from parent company Sony Group. The newly independent financial arm, which encompasses Sony Life Insurance, Sony Assurance, and Sony Bank, was assigned a reference price valuing the company at approximately 1 trillion yen, equivalent to over $6.7 billion. Sony Group explained that the separation was motivated by competing investment demands across its entertainment and semiconductor divisions, allowing the financial unit to independently raise its own growth capital while maintaining crucial brand ties. This successful debut occurred amidst a generally rising trend in broader Asia markets, although Japan's key indices saw slight declines. (not investment advice)</p>

Conversely, the White House defended the deployment as a lawful exercise of presidential authority, aimed at protecting federal assets and personnel after "months of violent riots." Both Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson have strongly opposed the move, labeling it unlawful and asserting it could compromise the safety of residents.</p>

Author Radhika Sanghani suggests that the emotional state experienced after an interaction serves as a primary telltale sign. The article advocates for direct and honest communication with the friend, establishing clear boundaries regarding time spent together or permissible conversation topics, and exploring alternative activities like walks or exercise to alter the dynamic and prevent one person from dominating.</p>
