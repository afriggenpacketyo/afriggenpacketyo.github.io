          <p>The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a case challenging South Carolina's attempt to remove Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program.  The case has significant implications for access to reproductive healthcare and the broader debate over abortion rights.  The state argues that funding Planned Parenthood enables abortions, while Planned Parenthood emphasizes its provision of other essential healthcare services.

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the Trump administration to restore legal funding for unaccompanied migrant children in immigration court.  The order comes in response to a lawsuit filed by nonprofits challenging the termination of their contract.  The judge cited the government's legal obligation to provide representation to vulnerable children under a 2008 anti-trafficking law.  The temporary restoration prevents immediate harm to children awaiting legal proceedings.</p>
