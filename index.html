          <p>The Trump administration has restored federal research grants to Brown University following a new agreement between the two parties. In exchange for the renewed funding, Brown has committed to donating $50 million to local workforce development programs and implementing changes related to women's sports, antisemitism surveys, and admissions data transparency. The university, which explicitly denies any wrongdoing or liability, noted that the agreement does not grant the government authority over its curriculum or academic speech. This resolution follows a similar multi-million dollar settlement reached by Columbia University earlier in the month.</p>

CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted that AI advancements are driving efficiency in the company's advertising systems, which saw revenue grow to $46.56 billion. Despite a $4.53 billion operating loss in its Reality Labs division, overall net income rose 36% year-over-year to $18.34 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is launching a major initiative with companies like Google and Amazon to encourage millions of Americans to upload their personal health data to new private-sector apps and systems. The program aims to improve convenience in accessing medical records and monitoring wellness, focusing initially on diabetes and weight management. While officials state patient participation will be voluntary and data will be secure, digital privacy advocates express significant concern. Critics worry the system could expose sensitive medical information to monetization and misuse, given the lack of strong federal regulation over health apps.</p>

He believes that highly advanced AI, capable of teaching itself and surpassing human intellect, will empower individuals to solve complex problems and achieve personal goals. In a blog post, Zuckerberg suggested this technology could help people be more creative, fulfilled, and better connected with others. He also emphasized the role of wearable devices, predicting that AI-integrated glasses will eventually become our primary computing platforms, constantly interacting with our environment.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that Americans' views on the national economy have improved slightly, though they remain net negative. This uptick is partly influenced by more positive ratings of the stock market, especially among higher-income individuals. However, a majority of people are concerned about future price increases, with two-thirds expecting the cost of goods to rise in the coming months. This outlook is dampening spending plans, as half of the respondents, particularly those with lower incomes, intend to cut back on discretionary purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Trump administration's grand strategy to disengage from global conflicts to focus singularly on containing China has failed. Instead of pulling back, the U.S. has become more deeply entangled in Europe through its support for Ukraine and in the Middle East with strikes against Iran. These commitments have drained American resources and diplomatic attention, undermining the intended pivot to Asia. The piece contends that the administration now owns the very conflicts it pledged to end, which has inadvertently given Beijing more strategic breathing room.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 50% tariff specifically targeting imported copper pipes, wiring, and other semi-finished copper products. The move, intended to protect national security, is narrower than initially expected, as it excludes raw copper materials like ores and cathodes. This distinction caused U.S. copper prices to fall sharply, as markets had anticipated broader restrictions that would have boosted domestic producers more significantly. The policy is seen as a benefit to manufacturers but offers little support to the U.S. copper mining industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>By deciding not to run for governor of California in 2026, Kamala Harris has strategically kept the door open for a potential 2028 presidential campaign. An analysis suggests that running for governor would have likely required her to renounce any immediate White House ambitions to win over California voters. The move avoids the practical difficulties of governing the nation's largest state while simultaneously campaigning for president. While her path is unclear, she remains a nominal front-runner for the Democratic nomination due to her name recognition and fundraising network, though she would likely face a large field of challengers.</p>

Robert Violante, who was blinded in the 1977 shooting that killed his first date, Stacy Moskowitz, recounts the night that permanently altered his life. Another survivor, Carl Denaro, who was shot months earlier, recalls the confusion before police realized a serial killer was at large. Both men expressed relief at Berkowitz's capture but continue to live with the physical and emotional scars of his violent rampage that terrorized New York City.</p>

          <p>Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Bill Long has stated that the agency's Direct File program will be eliminated after its initial pilot and one full tax season. The free filing option, which was available in 25 states for the 2025 season, allowed taxpayers with simple returns to file directly with the IRS. Long's comments confirm that funding in a recent bill is intended to replace such programs. While the program was popular with users, it faced opposition from some Republicans and was already slated to be ended by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The wildfire relief organization FireAid has retained the law firm Latham & Watkins to conduct a comprehensive review of its grantmaking process. The move comes after the charity, which raised $100 million for victims of Southern California fires, faced misleading criticism from President Trump and other right-wing politicians. While FireAid has published detailed reports on its fund distribution to non-profits, critics have alleged a lack of transparency. The organization stated the review will assess its governance and ensure recipient organizations are using funds in alignment with FireAid's mission of providing community relief.</p>

          <p>President Trump has offered new, and at times conflicting, explanations for his falling out with the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, creating fresh questions about their relationship. Trump recently claimed the split occurred after Epstein poached female employees from his Mar-a-Lago club, including Virginia Giuffre, an accuser who was a minor at the time. However, this timeline appears inconsistent with Trump's past praise for Epstein in a 2002 magazine profile and his 2019 statement that he hadn't spoken to Epstein in 15 years. The White House has not clarified the discrepancies in the president's accounts.</p>

          <p>Former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas has been arrested and charged with operating an illegal high-stakes poker and gambling ring from a mansion he owned in Los Angeles. According to a federal indictment, Arenas and five co-conspirators, including a suspected member of an Israeli organized crime group, ran the operation between 2021 and 2022. Prosecutors allege women were hired to provide drinks and "companionship" to players. This marks another significant legal issue for Arenas, whose successful basketball career was famously overshadowed by a 2010 felony gun possession charge.</p>

          <p>Environmental groups are criticizing a new trade agreement under which the European Union would significantly increase its energy imports from the United States, warning it could undermine the bloc's climate goals. The deal, aimed at replacing Russian energy, would see Europe purchasing vast quantities of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG). Critics argue this move represents a major U-turn from the EU's Green Deal priorities, risking decades of fossil fuel dependence and increased methane emissions. They contend that the agreement contradicts the EU's commitments to rapid decarbonization and renewable energy expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

The move accelerates a broader repeal of the exemption that was included in recent legislation.

          <p>Senate Republicans are contemplating a change to chamber rules to more quickly confirm President Trump's nominees, citing what they call an "unprecedented level of obstruction" from Democrats. Democratic senators have been using procedural tactics to slow-walk nearly all of Trump's appointments in protest of his policies. Majority Leader John Thune stated that interest in changing the rules is growing within the GOP caucus to break the logjam. This potential move would further alter the Senate's long-standing traditions and could escalate partisan conflict over the confirmation process for administration and judicial positions.</p>
