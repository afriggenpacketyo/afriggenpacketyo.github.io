          <p>Germany's coalition government is at odds over how to expand the Bundeswehr to meet NATO requirements. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius of the SPD is pushing for a more attractive voluntary service model, hoping to draw enough recruits with better pay and training. However, members of the center-right CDU/CSU coalition partners are skeptical, arguing that relying on volunteers is insufficient given the current security climate and are pushing for a faster return to compulsory service. The debate highlights a fundamental disagreement on national security policy within the German government.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old California man, Ryan Wardwell, was successfully rescued after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall for two days while canyoneering. While rappelling down the Seven Teacups on the Kern River, he was pushed off his lines by extreme hydraulics and became stranded in a cave behind the water. A search operation involving a drone located him, and a California Highway Patrol helicopter crew hoisted him to safety. Wardwell sustained only minor injuries and was treated for dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>Following the Supreme Court's decision to end race-based affirmative action, the Trump administration is now requiring universities to submit detailed admissions data to check for compliance. The administration suspects that institutions may be using "racial proxies" to circumvent the ruling, prompting a debate over the legality and implementation of class-based affirmative action. Proponents like Richard Kahlenberg argue that focusing on economic disadvantage can achieve both racial and economic diversity, but critics worry the administration may target any policy that increases minority enrollment, regardless of its legal standing.</p>

Zelenskyy is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump and several European leaders at the White House to discuss security guarantees and continued support. The meeting comes after Trump advised Ukraine to "make the deal" with Putin, raising concerns about the nature of U.S. support.

The airline is working to stabilize its schedule but warns that some cancellations may persist for up to 10 days. The core of the dispute remains unresolved issues over pay and unpaid work.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has weakened to a Category 3 storm but remains a significant threat, bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The National Hurricane Center has issued flash flood warnings for the region, with several inches of rain already recorded and more expected. While the storm is not projected to make direct landfall on the U.S. mainland, it is expected to generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast from Florida to New England as it moves northward this week.</p>

          <p>More than 2,500 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats since the UK and France implemented a new "one in, one out" returns agreement 11 days ago. The pilot scheme, intended to deter crossings, proposes that for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one with a strong asylum case. However, with removals yet to begin, the deterrent effect remains unseen, and the UK government faces pressure as the total number of arrivals this year approaches 28,000. Aid workers have also raised concerns about smugglers overcrowding larger boats, increasing the danger for those attempting the journey.</p>

          <p>South Korea's new presidential administration has ordered a significant reduction in radio broadcasts aimed at North Korea in an effort to de-escalate tensions. However, this policy change is raising alarm among human rights advocates, who argue it threatens the well-being of an estimated 400,000 Christians inside the isolated nation. For these individuals, who face severe persecution for their faith, foreign radio broadcasts are often the only source of religious teaching and outside information. Critics call the move a strategic mistake that cuts off a vital lifeline for a highly vulnerable population.</p>

In response to the outcry, at least three universities, including Central South University, have removed online announcements related to lectures and events featuring the researcher.

The move is framed as a direct response to Republican-led gerrymandering efforts in other states like Texas and a way to counter what he calls an assault on democracy by Donald Trump. This high-stakes political gamble, which would temporarily override the state's independent redistricting commission, could significantly impact control of Congress in 2026.

The BHA claims the tax hike would be catastrophic, predicting a revenue loss of £330 million and threatening nearly 3,000 jobs in the first year alone.

          <p>Police in Phoenix captured Bryan Patrick Miller, the notorious "canal killer" responsible for two murders in the early 1990s, through an undercover operation at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. A cold case detective, posing as if to clear Miller as a suspect, met him for a meal with the sole purpose of covertly collecting his DNA from a water glass. Eleven days later, forensic analysis confirmed a match with DNA found on the victims, Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. Miller, who was known locally for his "Zombie Hunter" persona, was subsequently arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death in 2023.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's AI Chip Export Deal with China Sparks Controversy</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has brokered a controversial deal allowing tech companies Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to China, on the condition that they share 15% of the revenue with the U.S. government. This move, which reverses a previous export ban, is being criticized by trade experts who fear it sets a dangerous precedent that national security-based export controls are for sale. The legality of the arrangement, which some view as an unconstitutional export tax, is still being reviewed. The deal highlights a new, transactional approach to U.S. trade policy regarding sensitive technologies.</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is hosting a major exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, with a focus on framing him as a quintessentially Russian artist. The collection, on loan from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, is designed to highlight his connection to St. Petersburg and Russian culture. This presentation comes as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has asserted that Repin, who was born in what is now Ukraine, is part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition underscores the use of cultural diplomacy and the ongoing historical disputes between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
