          <p>Worshippers at a Cincinnati mosque are expressing fear and anger after their imam, Ayman Soliman, was detained by ICE during a routine check-in. Soliman, an Egyptian-born journalist who was granted asylum in 2018, had his status terminated based on an alleged association with a "Tier III" organization, a claim his lawyers call weak and potentially retaliatory for a past lawsuit. The Department of Homeland Security later stated he was on an FBI terror watchlist, a claim Soliman has been trying to get information about for years. His detention has sparked protests and broad community support, highlighting the precariousness of asylum status in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight from Nebraska to Detroit was forced to make an emergency landing in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after a passenger became disruptive. The pilot reported to air traffic control that the passenger, identified as 23-year-old Mario Nikprelaj, was fighting with a flight attendant and trying to open an emergency exit door mid-flight. Law enforcement met the aircraft upon landing and took Nikprelaj into custody. He now faces multiple charges, including disorderly conduct and assault, with the possibility of additional charges as the investigation continues. The flight later proceeded to its original destination.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration to Seek Unsealing of Epstein Grand Jury Transcripts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 07:55:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following public pressure and media reports, President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the court unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move comes after a Wall Street Journal report detailed a letter from Trump to Epstein for his 50th birthday. While some supporters praised the decision, critics like Rep. Daniel Goldman argue that grand jury testimony is limited and that other evidence, such as videos and FBI interviews, would be more revealing. The release of these transcripts, which is not guaranteed due to strict secrecy rules, may not quell the widespread speculation surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>Russian customs officials have arrested a dual U.S.-Russian citizen at Moscow's Vnukovo airport for allegedly attempting to smuggle a firearm. The woman, who was traveling from the U.S. via Turkey, was stopped during a random check in the "green lane" for passengers with nothing to declare. Authorities report finding a Colt Commander pistol and three empty magazines in her suitcase. The woman claimed she was unaware of the need to declare the weapon. This arrest occurs amid heightened tensions and a history of Russia imprisoning American citizens, some of whom have been part of prisoner swaps.</p>

          <p>An NHS doctor and her husband have each been sentenced to 10 months in jail for stealing and selling hospital-grade personal protective equipment (PPE) on eBay. Dr. Attiya Sheikh and her husband Omer Sheikh made nearly £8,000 by selling items like gloves and masks during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a time of severe national shortages. The judge described the doctor's actions as an "egregious breach of trust," committed when the NHS was facing an unprecedented crisis. The couple was caught after an NHS supplier noticed its products being sold on the auction site.</p>

          <p>Former LSU gymnast and social media personality Olivia Dunne has spoken about a severe ankle injury that derailed her dream of competing in the Olympics. During the 2018 USA Championships, she competed on the injured ankle, which led to a condition where part of the bone died. Dunne explained that this painful injury effectively ended her chances at the elite level, though she was able to recover without surgery and later compete for LSU, where she won a national championship. She expressed pride in having never needed surgery throughout her gymnastics career, a rarity in the demanding sport.</p>

The decision was made after Slovakia dropped its veto.

          <p>Ahead of Japan's House of Councilors election, far-right parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are using rhetoric similar to Western nationalist movements, blaming foreigners for social issues and crime. This sentiment is fueled by a massive influx of tourists due to a weak yen and media reports on crimes committed by foreigners. While Japan faces significant labor shortages due to an aging population, these parties advocate for strict, temporary work permits rather than immigration, reflecting a deep-seated cultural and political tension.</p>

To address this, Beijing will reduce restrictive measures and work to enrich the supply of services. This strategic shift towards domestic demand aims to create a more reliable engine for economic growth, especially as the country navigates an uncertain global trade environment and ongoing trade disputes.

          <p>A scholar reflects on "The Turner Diaries," a 1978 neo-Nazi novel that has inspired decades of right-wing domestic terrorism, including the Oklahoma City bombing. The article notes the book's availability on Amazon, which frames it as a warning about certain immigration and racial policies, a description that sanitizes its violent, genocidal content. The author draws parallels between the novel's hateful rhetoric and the political discourse of the Trump administration, such as calls for mass deportations and the demonization of immigrants. The essay argues that such fiction has played a corrosive role in popularizing extremist ideas that now influence government policy.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of polling data suggests a "thermostatic" shift in American public opinion, with support for immigration increasing as President Trump implements his restrictive agenda. After years of rising anti-immigrant sentiment, polls from Gallup and Pew now show a significant reversal, with more Americans viewing immigration as a good thing and supporting legalization for undocumented residents. Support for Trump's more extreme enforcement measures, such as mass deportations and suspending asylum, has declined. This trend suggests that while the public may have supported Trump's ideas in theory, the reality of his policies is proving to be unpopular.</p>

He argues that without clear expectations, objective performance metrics, and transparent salary policies, these enterprises risk high turnover among non-family executives and foster a culture of insecurity. Gentine suggests implementing development plans and using independent advisors or board members to handle difficult decisions like promotions or terminations. By professionalizing the process, families can avoid personal conflict and ensure that relatives feel they have earned their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coordinated campaign by conservative groups and Republican state officials has successfully dismantled the momentum of ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investing in the United States. Led by organizations like Consumers' Research and funded by figures like Leonard Leo, the movement has used state-level legislation, legal threats, and political pressure to brand ESG as a "far-left agenda." This has caused major financial firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, and JPMorgan to retreat from their climate commitments and exit sustainability coalitions. The anti-ESG push has chilled corporate climate action, reversing a trend that once seemed poised to reshape finance.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Democratic Party is making a smart political decision by amplifying the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. While potentially hypocritical, the strategy is effective because it taps into a pre-existing, widespread belief that a cover-up is occurring, an issue that divides Trump's own base. The author notes that Trump's relationship with Epstein is genuinely questionable and his administration's contradictory statements have made him vulnerable. By focusing on this, Democrats can drive a narrative of corruption and betrayal that resonates more strongly with some voters.</p>

The preview highlights key factors for Dubois, including exploiting a perceived vulnerability in Usyk's body, which was the source of a controversial low-blow call in their first match.

          <p>In a satirical column, Marina Hyde observes that President Trump's sudden reversal on the "Epstein files" has exposed his underlying contempt for his MAGA base, whom he now calls "weaklings" and "stupid people." After months of promising to release a supposed "client list," the administration now insists no such list exists, infuriating supporters who believed this was a core mission. Hyde notes the irony of Trump, a master of conspiracy, being undone by a conspiracy theory he fueled. The situation is further complicated by a report of a "bawdy" letter from Trump to Epstein, which has prompted a lawsuit threat.</p>

The F-47 is being developed under the highly advanced Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, which aims to produce a sixth-generation successor to the current fleet of fighter aircraft.

The RCMP said the suspect acted with an "ideological motive to disrupt airspace," with social media posts under his name revealing extremist beliefs about climate change and claims of being a "messenger of Allah."

This intense rainfall comes as much of the country is under hosepipe bans following the driest start to a year since 1976.

          <p>A new analysis from KFF projects that premiums on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces are set to increase by an average of 15% next year, a record-setting pace. Insurers are citing the upcoming expiration of enhanced subsidies, a key provision of recent legislation, as a primary driver for the rate hikes. These subsidies, which made coverage more affordable and expanded eligibility, are set to lapse in 2025. The loss of these subsidies is expected to cause millions of healthier individuals to drop their coverage, leaving a sicker, more expensive pool of patients and driving costs up.
