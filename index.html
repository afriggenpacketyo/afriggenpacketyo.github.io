          <p>China decreased its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds in March, falling to the third position among foreign holders with a stockpile of $765.4 billion, a decrease of $18.9 billion from February.

Britain increased its holdings by $29 billion to $779.3 billion, surpassing China as the second-largest foreign creditor to the U.S. Moody's Ratings also downgraded the U.S. government's credit rating, leading to higher yields on Treasury bonds.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has suggested a youth mobility scheme could be part of a future agreement with the EU, potentially allowing young people to work in other countries for up to two years. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized the possible scheme, describing it as "free movement through the back door." The UK already has reciprocal agreements with countries like Australia. Prior to Brexit, young people in the UK had the right to travel and study freely, without a visa, in the rest of Europe and vice versa, which this deal could be returning to.</p>

          <p>A top adviser to the director of national intelligence reportedly instructed a senior analyst to revise an intelligence assessment regarding the relationship between Venezuela’s government and a gang, Tren de Aragua. This directive followed a disclosure that intelligence agencies disagreed with a key factual claim Trump made to invoke a wartime deportation law. The analyst, Michael Collins, was asked to "rethink" the earlier analysis, leading some officials to view this as an attempt to align the findings with the Trump administration's agenda. Despite re-examining the evidence, the council reaffirmed its original findings, leading to political fallout and the removal of Collins from his position.</p>

The escalation comes as mediators seek to broker a new truce to halt the war that began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

          <p>A DW Fact Check article discusses the growing use of AI chatbots for fact-checking and evaluates the reliability of their responses. Studies by the BBC and the Tow Center for Digital Journalism reveal significant shortcomings in the ability of generative AI chatbots to accurately convey news reporting, with factual errors and altered quotes being common issues. The article stresses that AI chatbots are only as good as the data they are trained on, and users should always double-check responses with other sources. AI systems should not be seen as fact-checking tools.</p>

          <p>Former White House lawyers, diplomatic protocol officers, and foreign affairs experts have expressed concern over Donald Trump’s receipt of overseas gifts and targeted investments, calling it “unprecedented.” They argue that this openness to foreign largesse could compromise U.S. foreign policy and create conflicts of interest. One example is Qatar's offer to give the U.S. Department of Defense a $400m Boeing 747-8, which Trump suggested could be used as Air Force One. Critics argue that such actions violate the emoluments clause of the constitution and signal that American foreign policy is being sold to the highest bidder.</p>

Reagan's program aimed to stimulate the economy and reduce the burden of government, while Trump's efforts are focused on reshaping and redirecting the federal government.

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is attempting to expand its reach beyond high-profile Cabinet agencies and, in some cases, beyond the executive branch, approaching close to 40 entities. Some of these entities, like the U.S. Institute of Peace, have been effectively dismantled, while others, like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Vera Institute of Justice, have rebuffed DOGE's requests. The meetings are conducted by young staffers with little federal government experience, according to lawsuits and interviews.</p>

          <p>Two drug smugglers, Bruce Knowles and Ferhat Gumrukguoglu, have been jailed after being caught with £37m worth of cocaine in an inflatable boat off the Suffolk coast. The pair attempted to smuggle 350kg of cocaine into the UK and were arrested by the National Crime Agency. The court heard how the pair had trialled a "dry run" of the operation in April before attempting the real thing two months later and they were intercepted by Border Force officers as they headed towards Lowestoft.</p>

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt emphasized the government's commitment to stopping criminal activities related to people smuggling. This new approach marks a shift from former Chancellor Angela Merkel's open asylum policy and reflects concerns over the electoral success of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD).
