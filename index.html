          <h2>Trump Announces Plans for Extensive US Missile Defense System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 13:48:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump revealed plans for a comprehensive missile defense shield, drawing parallels to Reagan's "Star Wars" program, with Gen. Michael Guetlein leading the project. The system aims to protect against threats from North Korea and elsewhere, potentially costing tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. Trump's push for the shield gained momentum after watching Israel's Iron Dome during Iranian attacks, despite military officials initially expressing no need for such a system. Critics question the necessity for the U.S., buffered by oceans and friendly neighbors, while others worry about the program's potential impact on funding for other vital defense initiatives. The scale of the project, whether to protect all U.S. territory or just major cities, remains unclear.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's attempt to persuade House Republicans from blue states to support a major tax bill failed, as the 'SALT Caucus' remains opposed due to insufficient increases in state and local tax deductions. The 2017 Republican tax bill capped SALT deductions at $10,000, impacting residents of high-tax states like New York and California. The current bill proposes raising the deduction to $30,000, but some GOP lawmakers from these states deem it inadequate. Despite Republican leadership offering a $40,000 cap for individuals earning $751,600 or less, five members of the SALT Caucus remain 'no' votes, jeopardizing the bill's passage before Memorial Day weekend.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article details Ukrainian reactions to President Trump seemingly stepping back from his efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Many Ukrainians expressed disappointment but were not surprised, viewing Trump's diplomacy as disconnected from the realities on the ground. Despite the disappointment, some Ukrainians see a potential reduction in pressure from Trump, who previously urged Ukraine to concede territory to Russia. Ukrainians express resolve to continue fighting for their future, regardless of U.S. involvement, with some noting increased support from European allies and expanding domestic weapons production. The negotiations are viewed as a cover for intensified attacks, with the situation in combat zones worsening.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has indicated he intends to scale back his political donations after significantly supporting Donald Trump's 2024 campaign. Musk stated he plans to do 'a lot less' spending in the future, though he would consider it if he saw a reason. This comes after Musk's backed candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court was defeated, despite significant financial support. Musk's increased political involvement had raised concerns about conflicts of interest, given his companies' contracts with the federal government. He also defended the performance of Doge, the White House effort to cut federal spending that he leads, despite criticism of its impact.</p>

          <p>A new law in Washington state mandates that priests report child abuse disclosed during confession, sparking intense backlash from the Catholic Church and the federal government. The Archdiocese of Seattle threatens to excommunicate priests who comply, while the Department of Justice has launched a civil rights investigation, calling the law 'anti-Catholic.' The church argues that the law violates religious freedom and the sanctity of confession, a core principle of Catholicism. Supporters of the law, like Senator Noel Frame, emphasize the need to protect children and end cycles of abuse, highlighting that far too many children have been victims of abuse.</p>

          <p>A new book titled 'Original Sin' alleges that President Joe Biden concealed his son Beau Biden's cancer diagnosis, misleading the public about his fitness. The authors claim this demonstrates the Bidens' capacity for denial and lack of transparency regarding health issues. According to the book, Joe and Beau Biden falsely touted Beau's 'clean bill of health' despite knowing about his advanced glioblastoma. The book also alleges that Beau continued serving as Delaware's attorney general while secretly undergoing treatments. A Biden spokesman has disputed the book's claims, while the authors say Beau's wife Hallie questioned the apparent cover-up.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited Capitol Hill to encourage House Republicans to pass his 'one big, beautiful bill,' addressing disagreements on Medicaid and state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps. He warned against 'f---ing around' with these issues, targeting specific representatives like Mike Lawler on SALT and Thomas Massie on spending. Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 initially capped SALT deductions, and while an increase to $30,000 has been offered, some Republicans remain unsatisfied. Members of the House Freedom Caucus are pushing for more aggressive cuts to Medicaid, while moderates are wary of significant changes to the program. Despite Trump's call for unity, lawmakers left the meeting with differing interpretations of his message.</p>

UCLA presented the West Coast premiere of Tod Machover’s “Schoenberg in Hollywood” at the Nimoy Theater. The opera begins and ends with Thalberg as a framing device. The 90-minute opera is basically a phantasmagoria of how Schoenberg got here. Machover's opera explores Arnold Schoenberg's integration into Los Angeles culture after fleeing Nazi Germany. The opera features flashbacks of Schoenberg's life, his meeting with MGM producer Irving Thalberg, and his interactions with figures like Shirley Temple and George Gershwin. The production uses film accompaniment and a complex score to evoke Schoenberg's spiritual progress and reinvention.</p>

However, the DOGE effort has faced scrutiny, with questions raised about its effectiveness and public polling showing disapproval. Musk's commitment to Tesla, his primary source of wealth, follows reports that the company's board may consider replacing him as CEO.

While the deals demonstrate negotiating agility, they also reflect Britain's diminished position in the post-Brexit era. The agreement with the EU allows British travelers to use electronic gates, while the U.S. deal reduces tariffs on British luxury cars. However, Britain had to make concessions, such as allowing European trawlers to fish in British waters and granting greater access to American agricultural products. These trade-offs reflect Britain's reality as a midsize economy operating among larger trading blocs.</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail was arrested for allegedly assisting 10 inmates in their escape by turning off the water to a toilet that covered a hole in the wall. Sterling Williams, the worker, reportedly admitted to officials that an inmate threatened to 'shank' him if he did not comply. Faulty locks, cell doors, and staffing shortages were identified as contributing factors to the escape. The sheriff, Susan Hutson, faces criticism and calls for her resignation amid investigations into the jailbreak, while four of the escapees have been captured.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver has been charged with felony assault for allegedly assaulting a federal law enforcement officer during a protest outside a Newark, New Jersey, ICE detention center. The U.S. Attorney's Office dropped trespassing charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested at the same protest. McIver denies the charges, claiming they are politically motivated and misrepresent the events at Delaney Hall. Footage shows McIver near the fence as Baraka is arrested, using her elbows to move past an officer. The U.S. Attorney's Office has not commented on the public announcement of the charges before they were unsealed.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the complexities of prostate cancer screening, prompted by former President Biden's recent diagnosis of an aggressive form of the disease. The article highlights that current guidelines advise against screening after age 70, and even men who test diligently may develop an aggressive cancer between checkups. Experts note that fast-growing prostate cancers can arise without any indication on PSA tests. The article also emphasizes the potential harms of treatment, including impotence and incontinence, and the limited evidence of screening benefits compared to other cancers.</p>

          <p>New research studies emphasize the importance of Medicaid in saving lives, adding data to the debate over potential changes to the program. One study found that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act saved 27,400 lives between 2010 and 2022. Another study examined the effects of Medicaid on Medicare beneficiaries, finding that loss of Medicaid coverage led to fewer prescriptions and increased mortality. The studies suggest that restricting access to Medicaid could have deadly consequences, particularly for vulnerable populations.
