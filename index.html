        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. This financial success is primarily driven by the robust and sustained demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components for artificial intelligence technologies used by companies like Nvidia. The company expressed confidence in continued strong demand for the remainder of 2025, citing stable customer inventories and the launch of new AI products. SK Hynix's performance has positioned it to challenge Samsung's long-held dominance in the global memory market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting this week, websites with pornographic content operating in the UK must implement robust age-verification systems to prevent access by children, with potential fines up to £18 million for non-compliance. Ofcom, the media regulator, has approved several methods including credit card checks and photo ID matching. However, concerns are being raised by cybersecurity experts and the public about the effectiveness of these measures, particularly regarding the use of VPNs to bypass them. Many users have also expressed significant apprehension about sharing sensitive personal data with third-party verification companies.</p>

          <p>The White House has forcefully refuted media reports claiming President Donald Trump's name is mentioned in Justice Department documents concerning the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A spokesperson characterized the claims as a continuation of politically motivated "fake news stories" by Democrats and the media. This development comes as a Florida judge denied a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury files from Epstein's 2006 case, citing secrecy rules. While being named in the documents does not imply wrongdoing, the administration is facing pressure to increase transparency regarding the case.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has reached a significant settlement with the federal government, agreeing to pay $221 million to resolve investigations into on-campus antisemitism and restore federal funding. The payment includes $200 million over three years to settle the antisemitism probes and an additional $21 million for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This deal follows intense pressure from the Trump administration, which had paused hundreds of millions in federal grants to the university. The agreement codifies a series of policy reforms at Columbia but preserves the university's autonomy over academic and admissions decisions.</p>

The released document, a 2017 House GOP report, focuses on the sourcing behind the intelligence community's assessment of Putin's motives.

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. In its decision, the court stated the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration argued the amendment's jurisdiction clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected as unmoored from established legal principles. This ruling upholds a lower court's block on the policy, marking a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic and wildly influential frontman of the band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. Osbourne, along with his bandmates, is widely credited with inventing the genre of heavy metal in the late 1960s, creating a dark, powerful sound that stood in stark contrast to the era's popular music. His distinctive vocal style and unpredictable stage presence, combined with Black Sabbath's sludgy, detuned guitar riffs, set a template for countless rock bands that followed. This article traces his journey from a working-class background in Birmingham to becoming one of rock and roll's most legendary and enduring figures.</p>

After being adamant about serving exclusively as a designated hitter with his former team, the Boston Red Sox, Devers stated he prefers playing a defensive position. He explained that being on the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This contrasts sharply with his stance earlier in the year when he reportedly shut down the idea of a position change while in Boston, making his new role and positive attitude a welcome development for the Giants.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a House resolution to stop a federal plan to shoot approximately 450,000 barred owls in the Pacific Northwest over the next 30 years. The controversial plan, approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is intended to protect the rapidly declining northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted by the more aggressive barred owl. Proponents of the resolution, led by Rep. Troy E. Nehls, argue the culling is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money. However, some scientists and conservation groups warn that halting the plan will likely lead to the extinction of the spotted owl.</p>

Researchers from the University of Birmingham concluded that fewer than a quarter of the tests gave clear guidance, and nearly half advised consulting a doctor regardless of the result, potentially adding strain to the NHS.

The study found that over 70% of teens have used AI companions, with many reporting daily interactions and finding conversations with AI as satisfying as those with human friends. Researchers and child development experts express concern that this trend could hinder the development of crucial social skills and redefine human relationships. They worry that relying on AI, which is always validating and non-judgmental, may leave teens unprepared for real-world interactions.</p>

          <p>Six months into President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a single year since the Obama administration. Internal data shows nearly 150,000 deportations in the first half of the year, projecting an annual total over 300,000 if the pace continues. This significant increase follows a sweeping mandate from the administration to crack down on illegal immigration. However, this figure still falls far short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations, highlighting the operational and legal constraints on mass removal efforts.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Riverside County have confirmed that a man's fatal overdose in March was caused by carfentanil, a synthetic opioid estimated to be 100 times more potent than fentanyl. Carfentanil, legally used as an anesthetic for large animals like elephants, has been increasingly appearing in illicit drug markets and poses an extreme risk, as it can be lethal in minuscule amounts. The CDC has noted a sharp rise in carfentanil-related deaths nationwide, warning that its reemergence threatens recent progress made in reducing overall opioid overdoses. Officials are urging the public to carry naloxone and avoid using any illicit substances due to the unpredictable danger.</p>

In a notable bipartisan move, three Republicans joined with Democrats to pass the motion, compelling the release of the documents.

          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing signs of a slight shift, though it remains a challenging environment for many prospective buyers. According to real estate experts, an increase in housing inventory is providing some relief, with 34% more sellers than buyers nationally in May. However, median home sale prices continue to hit record highs, driven by a lack of incentive for current homeowners with low interest rates to sell. The market varies significantly by location, with some cities in Texas and Florida favoring buyers, while areas in New Jersey and New York remain strong sellers' markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new AI Action Plan represents a significant bet on the private sector, prioritizing rapid, unregulated innovation to achieve global dominance in artificial intelligence. This analysis suggests the plan, which calls for stripping away environmental and state-level regulations, was heavily influenced by recommendations from major tech companies like OpenAI and Google. While the strategy could accelerate prosperity if AI proves transformative, it also risks pushing the nation toward a bust if the technology is a bubble. The plan frames the initiative as a geopolitical race against China, placing the nation's technological future firmly in the hands of Silicon Valley.</p>

The mission aims to provide a better understanding of "space weather," the dynamic conditions in space that can disrupt GPS signals, damage satellites, and even affect power grids on the ground. The twin spacecraft will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere. This research is considered critical for developing predictive models to help protect vital technological infrastructure and astronauts in space.</p>
