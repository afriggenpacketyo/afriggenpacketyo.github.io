          <p>Israeli officials are anticipating the release of hostages held by Hamas, with expectations set for "a few hours" as the ceasefire in Gaza appears to be holding. This crucial development marks a significant step in the ongoing efforts to de-escalate the conflict and address humanitarian concerns for those impacted by the prolonged conflict. The successful exchange of captives for prisoners is a key component of the brokered agreement, bringing a fragile sense of hope to families anxiously awaiting news. The international community watches closely, hoping this phase leads to further stability and lasting peace in the volatile region, underscoring the delicate nature of such agreements.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have arrested Ezra Jin, founder of the prominent "underground house church" Zion Church, along with dozens of staff and members, including a female pastor separated from her newborn. Jin, a father of U.S. citizens, was detained at his home, with others facing charges like "illegal dissemination of religious information." This crackdown reflects the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to control religious groups not registered with the government, viewing Christianity and Islam as "foreign" influences. U.S. officials have condemned these actions, calling for the immediate release of those detained and for China to allow religious freedom without fear of retribution.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant resurgence of measles, with 1,563 confirmed cases this year, marking the highest annual total in over three decades. Experts suggest the true number could be closer to 5,000, with outbreaks reported in states like South Carolina, Utah, Arizona, and Minnesota. This alarming spread is primarily attributed to declining nationwide vaccination rates, currently at 92.5%, below the 95% threshold needed for community protection against the highly contagious disease. Public health officials are urging vaccinations, emphasizing the serious health risks it poses, especially to young children, and noting that 1 in 8 cases have resulted in hospitalization.</p>

Many endured severe conditions, with some appearing emaciated in released videos, sparking widespread outrage. Their impending release brings a fragile sense of hope to families, who have tirelessly advocated for their return and faced immense emotional toll over two years of captivity.</p>

Posts on social media platforms incorrectly claimed O'Callaghan stated she would boycott the 2028 LA Games if transgender swimmers competed, with one quote suggesting it would be "an insult and a disgrace." Swimming Australia clarified that O’Callaghan has not commented on the issue and has requested the removal of these misleading posts. This incident underscores the challenges of misinformation in sports, particularly around sensitive topics like transgender participation, which is governed by World Aquatics guidelines prohibiting those who have undergone male puberty from competing in the female category.</p>

          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown has resulted in the temporary closure of several prominent institutions, including all Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo in Washington D.C. These closures highlight the immediate and visible impact of the funding impasse on public services and cultural attractions, affecting millions of visitors. With federal agencies ceasing non-essential operations due to a lack of congressional agreement on a spending bill, many public-facing entities are disrupted. The duration of these closures remains uncertain, pending a resolution to the budget standoff, which continues to impact federal employees and the public.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated he is considering sending advanced Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to settle the ongoing conflict. Trump, who recently spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about military aid, described Tomahawks as "incredible" and "very offensive" weapons. He indicated he might communicate this potential escalation to Putin, framing it as a measure to encourage a resolution to the war. This proposition signifies a potential shift in U.S. military aid strategy, aiming to pressure Russia amid its continued strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure and to strengthen Ukraine's long-range capabilities, though it could also be seen as an aggressive step.</p>

Rainfall rates could exceed half an inch per hour, prompting flood watches for burn areas due to increased risk of mudslides.

Sorkin highlights the erosion of post-1929 investor protections, such as stringent SEC rules and the Consumer Protection Bureau, as a significant concern.

Although Chinese nationals own less than 1% of U.S. agricultural land, these strategic acquisitions have prompted 29 states to limit or ban foreign ownership.

          <p>Maintaining adult friendships often becomes challenging amidst busy lives, leading to the common phenomenon of "ghosting" or fading connections. Research indicates that individuals lose about half their friends every seven years as life stages shift due to commitments like careers or family. Relationship experts emphasize honest communication, transparency, and creativity to sustain bonds, suggesting integrating friends into daily routines or even "mundane connection" like tidying together. Psychologists also stress the importance of embracing "messy" lives and prioritizing in-person meetings, as social interaction is crucial for combating "relational loneliness" and offers underestimated happiness. Trusting in the resilience of friendships and taking social risks are key to nurturing these vital connections.</p>

This non-invasive technique could be a "game changer" for stress research, offering an objective marker of a changing stress state and potentially identifying risks for anxiety or depression based on recovery time.

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), a prominent UK economic think tank, has cautioned Chancellor Rachel Reeves against "directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes" in the upcoming Budget. With pressure to raise tens of billions of pounds to meet self-imposed fiscal rules, the IFS warns that some potential tax rises could be "especially economically harmful." While acknowledging the challenge of raising revenue without breaking manifesto promises, the article suggests wider tax system reform, particularly in property and capital gains tax, as "fairer and more growth friendly." It advises against a wealth tax and calls for updating council tax values from 1991. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute declares coral reefs the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate "tipping point," calling it an "unprecedented crisis." Scientists confirm widespread coral dieback, with 70-90% expected to perish as global warming surpasses 1.5 degrees Celsius, a threshold set by the Paris Agreement. Coral bleaching, caused by heat stress, is now the most extensive and intense mass bleaching event ever recorded, impacting 84% of the world's reefs. The report warns other ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest and ice sheets are nearing similar thresholds, emphasizing an urgent need for decarbonization to mitigate further devastating consequences globally.</p>

          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance has warned that further "painful" job cuts are inevitable if the government shutdown continues, adding to the thousands of federal employees already laid off or working without pay. The impasse, now approaching its third week, stems from a Democratic refusal to pass a short-term funding bill without an extension of federal health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. While some CDC layoff notices were sent in error and later reinstated, the Department of Defense secured $8 billion to pay military personnel. Vance attributes the difficult situation to Democrats, while Republicans like Senator Lindsey Graham oppose the subsidy extension, leaving more government services impacted.</p>

The plant, currently not producing electricity, has relied on emergency diesel generators for nearly three weeks to cool fuel and prevent a meltdown.
