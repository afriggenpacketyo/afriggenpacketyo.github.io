          <p>A Florida federal judge has dismissed the majority of claims against celebrities and YouTubers, including Tom Brady and Steph Curry, who endorsed the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The lawsuit alleged that these stars violated advertising laws by not disclosing their financial incentives. Judge K. Michael Moore ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, failed to prove the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct. This ruling narrows the scope of the multidistrict litigation, which accuses them of using their fame to market a fraudulent platform, following FTX's collapse in November 2022.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that healthcare facilities across the United States are experiencing a rise in no-shows among immigrants due to fears of apprehension by immigration officials. This trend follows the Trump administration's announcement of mass deportations and the rescinding of protections for sensitive locations like hospitals and clinics. Doctors and social workers express concern that individuals with serious medical conditions are avoiding care, potentially leading to infectious diseases spreading, increased healthcare costs, and dangerous birth complications. The article highlights the dilemma faced by hospitals and the measures some are taking to protect patients' rights while others comply with immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article discusses how Chancellor Friedrich Merzâ€™s coalition in Germany is struggling to address the growing influence of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has been gaining traction in polls. The situation is complicated by Germanyâ€™s domestic intelligence service declaring the AfD an extremist organization. The coalition is considering various strategies, including potentially calling on Germanyâ€™s constitutional court to ban the right-wing party, while also navigating the challenges of governing with a narrow majority in Parliament. The article highlights the risks and potential consequences of each approach, as well as the potential for the AfD to disrupt the coalition's agenda.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that he will donate virtually all of his wealth, totaling $200 billion, to the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years, inspired by Andrew Carnegie's belief that dying rich is a disgrace. This decision will result in his net worth dropping by 99% as the Gates Foundation aims to close in 2045, earlier than initially planned. The foundation will focus on preventing deaths of mothers and children, eradicating infectious diseases, and promoting prosperity through education. Gates expressed concern that cuts to foreign aid by the U.S. and European countries could hinder progress, potentially leading to an increase in childhood deaths.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that the U.S. may announce new trade agreements, as his administration faces pressure to strike deals before a 90-day pause on tariffs ends on July 9.

Negotiations are ongoing with countries including Canada, Italy, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

Powell has stated that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the outlook for maximum employment and price stability, and will not be influenced by political pressure.

          <p>A New York Times article summarizes key points from an exclusive interview with Bill Gates regarding his plan to accelerate giving and dissolve the Gates Foundation in 2045. Before the foundation shuts down, Gates has committed to spending $200 billion, focusing on goals like eliminating preventable deaths for mothers and children, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and breaking the cycle of poverty. Gates believes that progress will be 'incredible' in the next 20 years but predicts childhood mortality will increase in Trumpâ€™s term due to foreign aid cuts.</p>

          <p>A trial is set to begin in Denmark for two men accused of burning a copy of the Quran at a folk festival in June 2024, marking the first case under a new law criminalizing the "inappropriate treatment" of religious scriptures. The law was introduced amid international tension caused by a series of Quran burnings in Denmark, which triggered outrage in the Muslim world and led to diplomatic incidents. Critics fear the law will curtail freedom of expression, while supporters argue it will prevent provocations and strengthen national security.</p>

While intended to build community and engage students, these events often require parents to coordinate costumes and outfits, sometimes with little notice, adding to parental stress. The article also notes that spirit days can expose wealth disparities among families and may alienate those who don't celebrate certain holidays. The author suggests reducing the number of spirit days or shifting the focus to collaborative, in-school activities.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Office for Students (OfS) indicates that more than four in 10 universities in England are expecting to be in a financial deficit by this summer.

Universities are closing courses and selling buildings to cut costs, but the OfS emphasizes the need for "significant reform and efficiencies".
