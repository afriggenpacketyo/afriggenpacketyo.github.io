          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a "Compact for Academic Excellence" to nine U.S. universities, requiring them to freeze tuition, ban sex/gender as admissions factors, and cap international students. Institutions signing the agreement would receive priority access to federal grants and engagement with White House officials. This initiative is part of the administration's broader effort to reshape higher education, with some universities currently reviewing the demands while others, like the University of Pennsylvania chapter of AAUP, criticize it as a threat to self-determination. The compact also targets units perceived as hostile to conservative ideas and aims to prioritize American students.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved Evita Solutions' generic version of mifepristone, making it the second such approval for the abortion pill. This regulatory action, which allows the drug for pregnancies up to 10 weeks, has drawn immediate criticism from anti-abortion groups and Republican politicians, who question the FDA's leadership and the drug's safety. Despite calls for a review by Trump administration health officials, the FDA states its discretion in generic approvals is limited, as the drug must be identical to the brand-name version. The approval is unlikely to significantly alter access due to existing state-level restrictions and ongoing lawsuits.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals persistent negativity among Americans regarding the U.S. economy and job market, with a majority believing conditions are worsening due to rising prices. Over half of respondents view the job market as poor, and most anticipate difficulty finding desired employment. Furthermore, there's widespread skepticism about artificial intelligence, with many expecting it to negatively impact job availability in their fields and the broader economy over the next decade. This pessimism spans various demographics, though it is slightly less pronounced among younger Americans, highlighting broad concerns about financial stability and technological disruption.

This follows the Trump administration's recent equity stakes in other rare earth miners, including Lithium Americas and MP Materials, aimed at bolstering the domestic supply chain and reducing dependence on China. Humpton expressed support for these investments, stating that the rare earth sector will require many players. The company is developing a mine in Texas and a magnet facility in Oklahoma, keeping the administration informed of its plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Delta Air Lines planes, operated by subsidiary Endeavor Air, experienced a low-speed collision on a LaGuardia Airport taxiway in New York. Endeavor Air Flight 5047, arriving from Charlotte, struck the wing of Flight 5155, which was preparing to depart for Roanoke. One flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was hospitalized, but airport operations were not impacted. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, recovering flight recorders for analysis. Passengers were safely deplaned and offered new flights and hotel accommodations, as Delta apologized for the disruption.</p>

          <p>The article explains the perceived chaos at the Pentagon under Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, highlighting his unorthodox leadership style and the influence of President Trump. Hegseth, a former TV host, is criticized for focusing on public image over deep experience, with accusations of impulse control issues, sexual assault allegations, and financial mismanagement. The department has experienced high-profile resignations and leaks, indicating internal concern and paranoia. Sources suggest Hegseth's tenure shifted from initial ambition to fear and a focus on implementing executive orders after a "Signal Gate" scandal, demonstrating his loyalty to Trump.</p>

          <p>A Goldman Sachs study indicates that a rising number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are living paycheck to paycheck, making retirement savings increasingly unattainable. Approximately 42% of Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X workers have no spare savings after covering essential expenses, a figure projected to exceed half by 2033 due to escalating costs of housing and healthcare. The report challenges the simplistic advice to "save more," emphasizing that basic expenses consume a larger share of income. This financial strain highlights a critical "financial vortex" that leaves many unprepared for retirement, necessitating broader solutions beyond individual savings efforts.

          <p>President Trump is using the ongoing federal government shutdown as an "unprecedented opportunity" to pursue permanent cuts to what he terms "Democrat Agencies," a strategy outlined by budget director Russ Vought. Vought, a key architect of the conservative Project 2025, has already announced cancellations of $8 billion in energy projects and $18 billion in infrastructure funding for New York City. While critics, including law professors and labor unions, argue these threats are an illegal abuse of power and a misunderstanding of executive authority during a shutdown, some Republicans defend the administration's actions, claiming Democrats forced their hand. Labor unions have sued, asserting the moves unlawfully disregard statutory requirements.</p>

While Democrats seek to restore healthcare access for "lawfully present" immigrants who would lose coverage under Trump's recent bill, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries explicitly stated that federal law prohibits taxpayer-funded medical coverage for undocumented individuals, and they are not seeking to change this.</p>

          <p>Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old British man of Syrian descent, has been identified as the attacker who killed two people and injured three others at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur. The incident involved a car being driven at people and subsequent knife attacks, with security staff and Rabbi Daniel Walker preventing the attacker from entering the building before he was shot dead by armed officers. Three individuals have been arrested in connection with what police declared a "terrorist incident." Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the antisemitic attack, vowing increased police presence and support for the Jewish community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has openly declared the ongoing government shutdown an "unprecedented opportunity" to cut federal agencies and projects associated with Democrats, directly contradicting earlier statements from Vice President JD Vance. Trump announced plans to meet with OMB Director Russ Vought, co-author of Project 2025, to determine which "Democrat Agencies" should face temporary or permanent cuts. This follows recent freezes of $18 billion in New York City infrastructure and $8 billion in climate-related projects in Democratic-leaning states. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated potential mass firings of federal workers, emphasizing the administration's intent to target entities not aligning with its values.</p>

          <p>The article explores the surprising and often contentious history of college rankings, tracing their evolution from informal lists in the 1930s to today's influential U.S. News & World Report. Early attempts, like Edwin Embree's 1934 list, faced intense backlash and even federal suppression, highlighting the sensitivity surrounding institutional prestige. However, as higher education became a mass-consumer good by the 1980s, rankings transformed into a vital tool for navigating the American meritocracy. The article details how institutions have adapted to, and sometimes gamed, these metrics, revealing how rankings have shaped public perception and admissions practices despite their initial controversial reception.</p>

Many hail from provinces known for strong business cultures and combine their experience of past scarcity with market and technological opportunities.

          <p>Conservationists are urging the public to avoid U.S. national parks during the government shutdown, warning of limited facilities and visitor safety risks due to skeleton staffing. The National Park Service has furloughed over half its workforce but kept parks partially open, a decision criticized by conservation groups and former rangers. Concerns include vandalism, looting, wildlife poaching, and delayed assistance for visitors, echoing issues from the 2018 shutdown. Many sites are already strained from earlier layoffs, raising fears of further damage. Both Democrats and Republicans, despite political blame, have scrambled to keep parks open, citing economic and emotional impacts.</p>

While Steele acknowledged the "odd day," analysts believe Musk's call for a boycott is unlikely to significantly impact Netflix's subscriber numbers or stock value.
