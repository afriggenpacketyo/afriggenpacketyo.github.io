          <p>After being found abandoned in a USPS truck for three days, thousands of chicks have been adopted by local families, rescues, and farms in Delaware. The chicks were part of a 12,000-bird shipment left unattended, leading to many deaths due to high temperatures and lack of food and water. The First State Animal Center and SPCA cared for the survivors and ensured they were adopted by those who would not use them for meat, with some adopters taking hundreds at a time. Stephanie Bruzdzinski adopted a handful of chicks after her daughter expressed concern for their well-being, highlighting the community's response to the unfortunate incident.</p>

          <p>The German economy saw an unexpected 0.4% growth in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis), when compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. This growth is attributed to a surge in exports ahead of US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Simultaneously, Germany's new government is considering extending the Bundeswehr's involvement in three foreign missions, balancing economic progress with international security responsibilities. The German economy, Europe's leading economy, navigates global trade tensions while maintaining its commitments to international peacekeeping efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling foreign students, citing the university's alleged failure to address antisemitism and its ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program has been revoked due to an unsafe campus environment hostile to Jewish students. Harvard has rejected these allegations and vowed to support its nearly 6,800 international students, who comprise over a quarter of the student body. China has criticized the move as a politicization of educational exchanges, vowing to protect the rights of its overseas students.</p>

          <p>Opinion columnist Lydia Polgreen discusses the recent Oval Office meeting between President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, highlighting the stark contrast between the two leaders. While both are wealthy businessmen turned politicians, Trump used the meeting to promote a racist narrative about white South Africans facing genocide, rather than engaging in serious discussions on issues like tariffs and aid cuts. Ramaphosa, known for his deal-making skills, was met with theatrics and misleading information, reflecting Trump's preference for scoring political points over fostering meaningful diplomacy. The incident underscores the challenges of engaging with an unreliable and chaotic American administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to block Harvard from enrolling international students has resonated deeply in China, where American universities are still widely admired. The move could significantly impact the relationship between the two countries, as Chinese students make up the largest share of Harvard's international student body. While some Chinese commentators view this as an opportunity for China to strengthen its own educational institutions, others express concern over the implications for Chinese students seeking a world-class education. Despite increasing geopolitical tensions, American universities like Harvard have remained a source of aspiration for many Chinese, but this may now be in question.</p>

          <p>Apple has raised trade-in prices for iPhones in China to stimulate demand in a key market where it faces increasing competition from local rivals. The trade-in value for the iPhone 15 Pro Max has increased to 5,700 Chinese yuan, up from 5,625 yuan previously. This move is part of Apple's ongoing strategy to offer discounts and incentives, especially around holiday periods. In the first quarter of the year, Apple's China shipments fell by 8% year-on-year, and its market share declined from 15% to 13%, highlighting the need for Apple to revitalize its sales amid competition from Xiaomi and Huawei.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced a 7% fall in energy bills for households in England, Scotland, and Wales starting in July, marking the first drop in a year. This decrease means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will see their annual bill fall by £129. While charities welcome the cheaper bills, they emphasize that many people still struggle to pay, with millions of customers owing about £4 billion to suppliers. The drop reflects a fall in the international price of wholesale gas, but prices remain high, and concerns persist about energy affordability for vulnerable households.</p>

          <p>North Korea has initiated a probe into an accident during the launch of its second naval destroyer, with leader Kim Jong Un deeming the incident criminal negligence. Sections of the newly built 5,000-ton naval destroyer were crushed during the launch ceremony due to a transport cradle detaching early. The country's Central Military Commission has summoned the manager of the shipyard as investigations begin, emphasizing that those responsible will not evade their responsibility for the crime. Despite initially calling the incident "serious," North Korea now claims the damage is "not serious."</p>

          <p>The US Mint is preparing to produce its final penny following President Donald Trump's decree to abolish the coin, citing its wasteful production cost. Trump claims that the penny, made from zinc with a copper coating, costs more than two cents to mint, leading to annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs. While advocates support ditching the penny due to its high production cost and limited utility, others point to its usefulness in charity drives. The move requires congressional legislation to ensure prices are rounded up, eliminating demand for the coin.</p>

A significant number of athletes on Harvard's 42 varsity sports teams are international students, with some teams having more than half of their players from foreign countries. The Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's ability to enroll international students, citing an unsafe campus environment that allows "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators" to assault Jewish students.

The article examines how this prejudice creates a climate where success for individuals from non-traditional backgrounds is met with suspicion and doubt. Hinsliff highlights the case of Wayne Brown, Britain’s first black fire chief, who faced relentless harassment and ultimately took his own life, and the challenges faced by successful women and minorities who experience "impostor syndrome" due to societal prejudices.
