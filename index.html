          <p>Stitch Fix, the online personal styling service, is showing early signs of a successful turnaround after a period of significant decline. Under CEO Matt Baer, the company reported its first revenue growth in three years, driven by increased average order values and better customer retention. The strategy has involved streamlining operations, revamping its private brand portfolio, and offering more flexible service options, including larger curated boxes and an on-demand shopping catalog. While the company's stock remains far below its pandemic-era peak, these positive indicators suggest its focus on core client needs and operational efficiency is beginning to yield results.

          <p>Dame Stephanie Shirley, a celebrated technology pioneer and philanthropist, has passed away at the age of 91. Arriving in Britain as a child refugee fleeing Nazi Germany, she later founded a software company in the 1960s that famously employed women working from home, a revolutionary practice for its time. Known for adopting the name "Steve" to navigate the male-dominated tech industry, she amassed a fortune and dedicated most of it to philanthropic causes, particularly supporting autism research and services. Her life is remembered as an inspirational story of overcoming adversity and challenging gender stereotypes.</p>

          <p>The recent agreement requiring Nvidia and AMD to share 15% of their China-derived revenue with the U.S. government is viewed as a net positive by investors, as it secures market access that was previously blocked. Analysts describe the deal as an "unusual" and transactional move characteristic of the Trump administration, effectively creating an "indirect tariff at source." While it provides short-term certainty for the chipmakers, concerns remain about potential future demands from the U.S. government. The arrangement is seen as specific to the strategic semiconductor sector and is unlikely to be replicated for other industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An unusual agreement has been reached where U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the federal government 15% of the revenue from their AI chip sales to China. This arrangement was a condition for receiving export licenses, allowing them to sell specific, less-advanced chips like Nvidia's H20 to the Chinese market. The deal follows U.S. efforts to restrict China's access to high-end semiconductor technology for national security reasons. This revenue-sharing model is a highly unconventional approach to export controls, as companies do not typically pay a portion of their sales directly to the government for such licenses.

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, located west of the Cabo Verde islands, according to the National Hurricane Center. With maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, forecasters predict it could strengthen into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season. Current projection models show the storm moving westward but indicate it does not pose an immediate threat to land or the United States. This development aligns with predictions for an above-normal hurricane season, which anticipates between 13 and 18 named storms.</p>

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has stated that his country would inevitably be drawn into any military conflict over Taiwan due to its geographical proximity and the large number of Filipino workers on the island. His comments drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing, which warned the Philippines not to "play with fire." Tensions were further heightened by an incident in the South China Sea where a Chinese navy vessel and a coast guard ship collided while pursuing a Philippine patrol boat. President Marcos affirmed that his nation's vessels would not back down in defending their territorial interests in the disputed waters.</p>

Judge Paul Engelmayer sharply criticized the DOJ's request, calling its premise that the materials would reveal significant new information "demonstrably false" and "disingenuous." He ruled that the testimony, which consisted of summaries from two law enforcement agents, was "garden-variety" and would not contribute meaningfully to public knowledge. The decision emphasizes the long-standing policy of grand jury secrecy and suggests the government's motion may have been more for public relations than for genuine transparency.</p>

          <p>When deciding between a high-yield savings account (HYSA) and a certificate of deposit (CD), financial experts advise considering liquidity needs and interest rate trends. A HYSA is recommended for emergency funds or when easy access to cash is a priority, as it offers flexibility without penalties. Conversely, a CD is better for those who can lock away their money for a set term to guarantee a higher, fixed interest rate, which is advantageous in a falling-rate environment. For those seeking a balance, a strategy of splitting funds between both or using a CD ladder can provide both liquidity and optimized earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

Provision rates were significantly higher in states with abortion restrictions and in poorer counties.

          <p>Heavy rainfall and severe storms have caused extensive flash flooding across several Midwest states, including Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Illinois, leading to at least one death. The storms produced high winds and torrential rain, with the Milwaukee area receiving up to 14 inches, resulting in significant river flooding and numerous water rescues. Thousands of residents lost power, roads were closed, and major events like the Wisconsin State Fair were canceled. The fatality occurred in eastern Nebraska when a tree fell on a vehicle during a storm. Flood watches and warnings remain in effect as more rain is expected.</p>

          <p>Prominent venture capitalist Mike Moritz has publicly defended Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, urging the company's board to resist what he called President Trump's "artless bullying." The defense comes after Trump demanded Tan's resignation over alleged conflicts of interest and ties to Chinese companies. In an op-ed, Moritz, who has known Tan for decades, praised his past success in turning around Cadence Design Systems and called him uniquely equipped to lead Intel's transformation. Tan is scheduled to visit the White House to address the concerns, while Moritz framed the situation as a test of corporate backbone against political interference.</p>

The trust structure means that staff will now have a say in how the firm is run and will receive a share of future profits.

          <p>A new bill in the Texas legislature aims to allow private citizens to file lawsuits against anyone involved in the manufacturing, mailing, or prescribing of abortion-inducing medication. The proposal, known as the Women and Child Protection Act, would also permit wrongful death lawsuits if the medication harms a fetus or the mother. The bill is designed to target the use of telemedicine for abortions and directly challenge "shield laws" in other states that protect doctors who prescribe pills to patients in states with bans. This represents a new legal strategy in the state's ongoing efforts to restrict abortion access since the procedure was outlawed.</p>

          <p>A new executive order from President Trump grants political appointees sweeping authority over federal research funding, a move scientists warn could politicize the grant-making process. The order allows appointees to overrule recommendations from scientific peer-review panels and terminate existing grants based on political priorities, citing a need to stop funding for "far-left initiatives." Critics, including a Nobel laureate, have slammed the order as a "Soviet-style politicization of American science" that threatens to replace scientific merit with ideological loyalty. This action is the latest in a series of administration moves seen as undermining scientific independence and research freedom in the U.S.</p>

          <p>In a notable shift in Malawian politics, several presidential candidates have selected women as their running mates for the upcoming September election. This trend follows advocacy from civil society organizations pushing for greater female representation, especially since women constitute a majority of registered voters. However, analysts note that most of these female candidates are with smaller parties, suggesting the move may be partly strategic rather than a complete overhaul of the political landscape. While it is seen as a positive step, voters are expected to prioritize pressing issues like food shortages and the economy over the gender ticket alone.</p>

The key to the market's response lies in the major exemption Trump offered: the tariff would not apply to companies that are building or have committed to building manufacturing facilities in the United States. This caveat has lifted some uncertainty, as it aligns with the administration's broader strategy of encouraging domestic production of critical technologies. The move is seen as a way to pressure high-end companies to onshore their manufacturing operations. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposal involves a constitutional amendment and a special election to adopt new maps designed to make GOP seats more competitive.

A key consideration is whether one carries a balance, as high interest rates can quickly negate any rewards earned.
