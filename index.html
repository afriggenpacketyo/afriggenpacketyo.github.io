          <p>China is set to hold its largest military parade, commemorating the 80th anniversary of World War II victory, where advanced unmanned systems, including drones and "robobeasts," are anticipated to be showcased. This display aims to underscore the People's Liberation Army's significant advancements in integrating autonomous technologies across air, land, and sea, indicating a strategic pivot towards AI-enabled, multi-domain operations. While new and previously unseen models might be unveiled, security concerns suggest these systems will likely be presented in static displays rather than in motion. Officials emphasize that these "new-domain forces and new-quality combat capabilities" highlight China's growing strength in safeguarding national sovereignty and contributing to world peace.</p>

          <p>Wales is launching a pilot program to offer significantly reduced bus fares, with £1 single tickets and £3 day passes for individuals aged 16-21, later extending to 5-15 year olds. This initiative, backed by £15 million from the Welsh government, aims to enhance young people's access to education, training, employment, and leisure opportunities. Transport for Wales has already received over 10,000 applications, indicating strong public interest. While seen as an "attractive proposition" for encouraging public transport use, an independent watchdog notes that young people's satisfaction with bus fare value in Wales is currently lower than in other UK regions. This program represents a concerted effort to foster sustainable travel habits among the younger demographic.</p>

          <p>Luxury jewellery retailer Vashi Dominguez is at the center of a £170 million investment scam, with BBC Panorama revealing that staff were instructed to pose as customers to deceive investors. The deception helped Dominguez secure fresh capital for his business, which collapsed in 2023, leaving investors with total losses as promised diamond stock valued at £157 million was later assessed at only £100,000. Despite the scale of the alleged fraud, neither the Metropolitan Police nor the Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation, prompting outrage from victims who question the lack of official action. This article details the elaborate methods used to inflate sales figures and misrepresent company assets.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, urging member states to enhance artificial intelligence cooperation while explicitly rejecting a "Cold War mentality." The summit, the largest to date, included leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with China positioning itself as a global peacemaker amidst ongoing international tensions. Xi highlighted China's significant investments in SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education programs. The meeting aims to foster high-quality development and cooperation, with analysts suggesting improved relations with India could bolster Beijing's influence and challenge the narrative of China as a global troublemaker.</p>

BYD acknowledged that increased price competition and excessive marketing had an "adverse periodic impact" on the sector, with retail car prices falling sharply over the past two years. Chinese authorities have warned against these price cuts, as automakers like BYD continue expanding globally amidst intense domestic rivalry.</p>

          <h2>China's Private Manufacturing Survey Shows Unexpected Growth in August</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with a private survey indicating the fastest expansion in five months, driven by a recovery in new orders and export business. The RatingDog manufacturing PMI reached 50.5, surpassing Reuters' estimates and rebounding from July's contraction. This improvement was partly fueled by resilient external demand, despite tariffs, though domestic demand showed less significant improvement. While overall business confidence rose, employment in the manufacturing sector remained challenging, with job reductions continuing for a fifth consecutive month. Experts caution that the durability of this upturn depends on sustained export stability and a stronger pickup in domestic demand.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court Judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's attempt to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came after immigrant advocacy groups sought an emergency injunction, citing reports of children being placed on planes for repatriation to Guatemala, where lawyers argued they faced risks of abuse and persecution. While the Guatemalan President and U.S. Justice Department claimed the action was for family reunification, advocacy groups disputed this in some cases, arguing it violated federal laws designed to protect unaccompanied minors. The order will remain in place for 14 days, preventing further removals without proper legal process.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met, with the engagement "turbocharged" by recent US tariffs on Indian imports, pushing India to seek new opportunities. This meeting, occurring after a seven-year hiatus in Modi's visits to China, signals India's policy of "strategic autonomy" amidst strained US-India ties. Key takeaways include a resumption of direct flights and simpler visa processes, though significant roadblocks like border disputes and India's burgeoning trade deficit with China remain.

This decision comes after the committee learned that Mueller is facing significant health issues, specifically Parkinson's disease, which would prevent him from appearing. Committee Chairman James Comer had initially sought Mueller's testimony as part of a wider investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files, given Mueller's previous role as FBI director from 2001 to 2013.

This move, framed by a state insider as "a matter of conscience and decency," ensures Harris will maintain dignitary-level security.

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares experienced a substantial jump of almost 19% following the company's better-than-expected net income for the June quarter. This positive financial performance was largely propelled by accelerated sales within its cloud-computing unit and a continued revival of its core e-commerce business. Despite overall revenue slightly missing analyst estimates, net income increased significantly, partly attributed to gains from equity investments and the disposal of a Turkish e-commerce firm. The article emphasizes the robust growth in Alibaba's cloud division, which saw a 26% year-on-year revenue increase, driven by strong AI demand and aggressive investments in artificial intelligence and new e-commerce models.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is set to announce stricter family reunion rules for migrants granted asylum, alongside reforms to the asylum appeals system. The changes aim to align the UK with European policies, requiring family members to meet tougher English language standards and demonstrate sufficient funds. This initiative comes as the government seeks to overhaul a "broken" asylum system, reduce the use of hotels for migrants, and combat people smuggling, with a record increase in disruptions of immigration crime networks. The article highlights ongoing legal challenges against housing asylum seekers in hotels and political debate over the effectiveness of current policies.</p>

          <p>The Guatemalan government has stated it proposed to the US Department of Homeland Security the return of unaccompanied Guatemalan minors from the US, aiming to reunify them with families and integrate them into social programs. This claim was made after a US federal judge temporarily halted the children's removal, which lawyers argued violated federal laws and constitutional rights. The Guatemalan government asserted that all actions prioritize the children's human rights and due process, despite attorneys for the children disputing this.

          <p>Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with multiple injuries, including fractured thoracic vertebrae, lacerations, and contusions to his left arm and lower leg, after his vehicle was struck from behind at high speed in New Hampshire. The crash occurred on Saturday night, reportedly after Giuliani had stopped to assist a domestic violence victim and contacted emergency services. State police confirmed the collision involved a vehicle driven by a 19-year-old woman and the car Giuliani was riding in, driven by his associate, with all three occupants sustaining non-life-threatening injuries. His spokesperson later clarified that the incident was not a targeted attack, and Giuliani's son publicly lauded his father's resilience.</p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal Vietnam has expanded all 21 of its occupied features in the contested Spratly Islands, including artificial land and infrastructure like munitions storage. This significant reclamation effort, which is on track to surpass China's previous activities, signals Vietnam's resolve to solidify its territorial claims in the South China Sea. Rival claimants to the archipelago include Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and China, which claims the islands as the Nansha Islands. Maritime analysts suggest these Vietnamese actions, while not immediately altering the strategic balance, could prompt Beijing to upgrade its own defense posture in the highly sensitive region, potentially escalating tensions.</p>

This aesthetic transformation, which he personally funded, has drawn mixed reactions, with some calling it a symbol of a "golden age" and others criticizing it as "vulgar."
