          <p>In a game against Albany, Iowa's Xavier Williams rushed for 122 yards and a touchdown, contributing to Iowa's 34-7 victory. With this win, Kirk Ferentz, the Hawkeyes' coach, tied Woody Hayes for the most wins in Big Ten history with 205 victories. Quarterback Mark Gronowski, in his first start after transferring from South Dakota State, threw for a touchdown and ran for another before experiencing cramping issues. The Hawkeyes responded quickly, driving 65 yards on seven plays, concluding with Williams' 3-yard touchdown run, marking Ferentz's 23rd season-opening win at Iowa, extending his record to 205-124 with the program.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the case of Alix Tichelman, who pleaded guilty to prostitution and involuntary manslaughter in connection to the heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes. Michael Daly, a "48 Hours" consultant, reflects on the ethical questions surrounding the incident, noting that Hayes invited Tichelman to his yacht and asked her to inject him with heroin. Daly questions whether Tichelman is solely responsible, arguing that Hayes contributed to his own demise by creating the situation. The article highlights the complexities of blame and accountability, suggesting that the answers lie in ethics rather than forensics.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party is experiencing anxiety over who will succeed Eric Chu Li-luan as chairman in October. This leadership transition comes at a volatile time in Taiwanese politics, as favorability towards the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has decreased. A recent poll indicates that the KMT's favorability rating has risen, surpassing that of the DPP, while discontent with the DPP has reached a record high. The KMT faces the challenge of capitalizing on this shift in public sentiment while navigating its internal leadership dynamics.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is escalating his conflict with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker over crime in Chicago, criticizing the Democrat for refusing federal assistance after a violent weekend. Trump warned Pritzker to address the situation quickly or face federal intervention, and mocked Pritzker's weight loss, suggesting it indicates a potential 2028 presidential run. Pritzker responded by calling Trump's approach "unconstitutional" and "a dangerous power grab," while Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order rejecting the deployment of federal troops. The ongoing feud benefits both men politically.</p>

          <p>Pupils in England who missed school during the first week back in September 2024 were more likely to miss large parts during the rest of the year, figures suggest. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize attendance at the start of the 2025 term. Data shows that over half of pupils with partial absence in week one became "persistently absent", highlighting the importance of a strong start to the school year. The Department for Education is supporting schools through regional improvement teams to address attendance issues.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst plans to announce that she will not run for reelection in 2026, prompting a potential Senate race. Rep. Ashley Hinson is reportedly planning to announce a run for the open Senate seat, as Ernst was first elected to the Senate in 2014. Several Democrats have announced plans to run for the Senate in 2026, and Ernst has served as Iowa's junior senator since 2015. The race could be competitive, despite the state's recent Republican lean.</p>

          <p>With the United Nations often paralyzed by competing national agendas, a search for a new international framework has become a pressing need. Indonesia, with its extensive relationships and position as a bridge between ideologies, is uniquely positioned to offer a new, pragmatic roadmap. Prabowo Subianto's message of "constructive pragmatism" presents a corrective model for a dysfunctional international system. The true power of his address will be in its ability to present Indonesia’s philosophy as a corrective model for a dysfunctional international system.</p>

          <p>New evidence suggests that Pauline Mullins Pusser, the wife of legendary Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, was killed by her husband, not in an ambush as previously believed. A Tennessee Bureau of Investigation report revealed inconsistencies in Buford Pusser's statements, leading investigators to conclude the crime scene was staged. A new autopsy revealed cranial trauma and a self-inflicted gunshot wound to Buford Pusser's cheek. The sheriff's story inspired the movie "Walking Tall", but investigators now believe they have enough probable cause for a criminal indictment for murder had he been alive.</p>
