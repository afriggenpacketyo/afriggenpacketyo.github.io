          <p>Reports indicate that at least 45 Palestinians were killed and hundreds injured near an aid distribution site in Khan Younis, Gaza, due to Israeli strikes. Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry and a local hospital reported the incident, stating that the casualties occurred as people were heading to receive aid. Eyewitness accounts suggest that Israeli drones and tanks fired upon the citizens, leading to a high number of casualties. The Israeli army has not yet issued a comment on the situation, which raises concerns about humanitarian access and civilian safety in the ongoing conflict. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, supported by Israel and the US, has been distributing aid as an alternative to UN and NGO assistance, further complicating the aid landscape.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has adopted a more critical stance towards Beijing at the G7 summit, accusing China of monopolizing the global supply of rare earth elements and weaponizing reliance on these chains. This marks a shift from her earlier toned-down criticism of China, influenced by President Trump's return. Von der Leyen's remarks set the stage for potential confrontations at the upcoming EU-China Summit in Beijing. She echoed Trump's concerns, emphasizing that the biggest collective problem originates from China's accession to the WTO in 2001, indicating a potential realignment of EU policy towards China.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have reportedly created the world's first 6G-powered electronic warfare system, which utilizes a next-generation signal processing mechanism. This system is designed to provide significant advantages against modern military radars, potentially rendering traditional electronic countermeasures ineffective. The 6G weapon can intercept enemy signals and generate over 3,600 false targets to confuse enemy pilots at high frequencies. It can also function as a powerful communication device, simultaneously transmitting battlefield data to more than 300 platforms via optic fibers, marking a major advancement in 6G military applications.</p>

          <p>Poundland, a budget retail chain, has announced it will be closing 68 stores as part of a turnaround plan to revive its financial performance. In addition to store closures, the company plans to shut down a distribution center in Darton, South Yorkshire, and its national distribution center in Bilton, West Midlands, by early 2026. Poundland is also seeking rent reductions from landlords, which could lead to approximately 70 more store closures in the future.

He also predicted that Israel would not slow down its attacks on Iran and mentioned he would be monitoring developments from the White House Situation Room. Trump also addressed the potential threat to U.S. interests, warning Iran against harming U.S. troops, and stated he had not reached out to Iran for peace talks.</p>

The actor was banned from the awards ceremony for 10 years after the incident, which he described as "shocking, painful, and inexcusable." Smith has since released his first album in 20 years, seeking advice from Jay Z and Kendrick Lamar during the writing process, with the new music offering an exploration of personal authenticity and imperfection.</p>

While the order also addressed steel and aluminum, it did not specify the removal of charges on steel imports, a major part of the original tariff pact. The UK government has stated it will continue to work towards achieving 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed, with the deal also including a tariff-free quota of 1.4 billion liters of US ethanol for the UK.</p>

The case, initiated by Structured Asset Sales (SAS), claimed that Sheeran's song copied Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On." The Supreme Court's decision effectively ends a decade-long legal battle, with previous rulings already in Sheeran's favor. Wadge described the copyright trials as having "haunted" her for the last 10 years, emphasizing the significant impact the song had on her life and career.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that the US immigration system is a flawed construct that dehumanizes individuals for corporate profit. The author contends that the system's origins lie in xenophobia and racism, evolving into a tool for multinational corporations to exploit cheap labor. Agreements like NAFTA are cited as examples where free movement of capital and goods is prioritized over the rights of workers, leading to wage stagnation and exploitative working conditions.

          <p>A recent KFF poll reveals that Medicaid's popularity is increasing, with 83% of the public holding favorable views, including three in four Republican voters. This rise in popularity coincides with increased awareness of Republican-led efforts to cut nearly $800 billion in federal Medicaid spending. The proposed cuts are part of a broader budget bill aimed at funding tax cuts and increased border security, which is significantly less popular than Medicaid itself. Concerns are growing among current Medicaid recipients about potential loss of coverage and the impact on their access to healthcare and medications.</p>

Critics argue that this approach prioritizes ease of use and efficiency over human expression, potentially disenfranchising artists and cheapening creativity.

          <p>An explosion at a fireworks factory in Hunan province, central China, has resulted in at least nine fatalities and 26 injuries. Rescue operations are ongoing but are complicated by the risk of further explosions and the lack of a nearby water source. China's Ministry of Emergency Management has dispatched a team to oversee the rescue efforts and investigate the cause of the explosion. Industrial accidents are frequent in China due to lax safety standards, with previous incidents involving chemical plants and warehouses containing flammable materials resulting in numerous casualties.</p>
