          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly automating white-collar functions across major industries, leading to significant workforce changes. Executives from companies like JPMorgan Chase and Salesforce report AI handling substantial workloads and reducing hiring needs, with estimates suggesting millions of jobs could be displaced by 2030, though new roles are also expected to emerge. While the overall labor market data hasn't yet shown massive shifts, experts warn of ongoing turbulence and the need to prepare the workforce for this multi-decade technological progression. Companies are encouraging employees to adapt to AI tools to foster more efficient, leaner teams.</p>

          <p>Beyond Meat shares saw extreme volatility, initially surging over 100% before paring most gains, as a meme stock rally faltered. The stock's dramatic rise was fueled by its inclusion in a meme stock ETF and a short squeeze, alongside news of expanded distribution at Walmart. This comeback is reminiscent of pandemic-era retail trading frenzies, occurring despite long-term stock pressure and broader market concerns about elevated valuations and a potential AI bubble. The article highlights the speculative nature of such trading surges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione, held without bail for the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, reportedly claimed he was beaten by a group of transgender women in Thailand months before the incident. This detail emerges from a New York Times report on Mangione's travels and growing disdain for the American health insurance industry. Prosecutors allege Mangione sought to incite national debates about healthcare shortcomings, with bullet casings found at the scene referencing a critical book. He faces state and federal charges, with potential for life imprisonment or the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. states are warning that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits may be disrupted in November if the federal government shutdown persists. The USDA informed state agencies of insufficient funds for full November payments, leading to potential delays for over 40 million Americans who rely on food stamps. Advocates warn of devastating consequences for low-income families, who often live paycheck to paycheck. The article notes that while contingency funds exist, it's unclear if the USDA will use them, making benefit disbursement a policy choice.</p>

          <p>Maine Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner announced he has covered a chest tattoo that resembled a Nazi SS symbol, claiming he was unaware of its association when he got it in 2007. This revelation follows controversy over past online statements, including one dismissing sexual assault in the military, for which he apologized in a video. Platner, backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, maintains he has learned from his past and is proud of his journey, resisting calls to withdraw from the race. The Democratic National Committee chair acknowledged the comments were indefensible but believes in second chances.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military carried out its eighth strike on an alleged drug vessel since September 2, this time in the Pacific, resulting in two to three fatalities. This incident follows seven previous strikes in the Caribbean, bringing the total death toll to at least 34. The Trump administration justifies these actions by declaring a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, citing the tens of thousands of American deaths caused by narcotics. Survivors of a previous strike were repatriated, with one facing prosecution in Colombia and another released in Ecuador due to lack of evidence.</p>

          <p>England rugby icon Emily Scarratt has announced her retirement from playing, stating that winning a second Rugby World Cup provided a perfect conclusion to her 17-year Test career. The 35-year-old, who holds England's all-time Red Roses scoring record with 754 points, expressed mixed emotions but felt the timing was right to step away on her own terms. Despite limited game time in her final World Cup, Scarratt emphasized her crucial role as a team player off the field. She will remain involved in rugby as a coach, pundit, and in talent development.</p>

          <p>Chapter 13 bankruptcy, a "wage earner's plan," does not take all of a filer's income but rather a portion known as "disposable income" after essential living expenses are covered. This type of bankruptcy allows individuals to create a three-to-five-year repayment plan to creditors while maintaining a basic standard of living. It's often suitable for those with regular income who are behind on secured debts or have assets they wish to protect, and it can be an alternative to Chapter 7 or debt settlement. Consulting a debt relief expert is recommended to determine the best path for individual financial situations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors announced ambitious plans to integrate advanced software initiatives into its vehicles by 2028, including Google Gemini AI for conversational interactions and an "eyes-off" driver-assistance system. These technologies aim to transform cars into intelligent assistants, with the hands-free system launching in the Cadillac Escalade IQ EV. GM is also developing a new centralized computing platform and expanding its GM Energy business, including EV charging and home battery leasing. These initiatives mark a renewed push to double revenue by 2030 and grow software services, despite past challenges in achieving similar goals.</p>

          <p>Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a TikTok streamer, is set to appear in federal court after being charged with assaulting a federal officer, following an incident where he was shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent. Authorities allege Parias rammed his car into agents' vehicles during an immigration enforcement operation, causing agents to fear for their safety. The incident, which also wounded a U.S. deputy marshal by ricochet, highlights the Trump administration's scrutiny-drawing crackdown on unauthorized immigrants. Parias's attorney reported being denied access to his client post-shooting.</p>

          <p>The White House East Wing is undergoing demolition, with offices including the First Lady's and other workspaces being torn down to make way for President Trump's privately funded ballroom project. This reconstruction, described by Trump as a modernization, is more extensive than initially suggested, impacting areas like the visitors' office and legislative affairs. Staffers have relocated, and while a family theater and gift shop are currently undisturbed, they may be affected by structural strengthening. The project, estimated at $250 million, is expected to be completed before Trump's term ends.</p>

The expert also feared the inquiry was being steered away from its specific focus on grooming gangs toward broader child abuse issues.

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called for Prince Andrew to appear before MPs to discuss his lease of Royal Lodge, seeking greater transparency into royal finances and the independently-run Crown Estate. Documents reveal Andrew paid a large upfront sum for a 75-year lease, effectively buying out future rent obligations, leading to accusations of a "rotten deal." This renewed scrutiny follows Andrew relinquishing titles due to links with Jeffrey Epstein.

The clarification states the fee does not apply to visa transfers or changes in status within the U.S. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit, arguing the fee is cost-prohibitive for businesses, especially smaller ones, and hinders access to global talent.

Many retirees face a shortfall in savings, making early Social Security income crucial. Additionally, concerns about the program's long-term solvency by 2034, despite misperceptions about complete payment halts, contribute to the decision to claim benefits earlier.
