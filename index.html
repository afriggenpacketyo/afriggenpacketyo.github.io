        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Portuguese forward Joao Felix, once the third most expensive transfer in history, is set to join Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr from Chelsea at age 25. This move is widely seen as an admission that he has given up on reaching the top tier of European football, despite his immense early promise at Benfica. Journalists and analysts attribute his stalled career to a lack of defensive work rate and an inability to adapt to the demands of top coaches like Diego Simeone at Atletico Madrid. His career trajectory is viewed as a frustrating case of unfulfilled potential.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the serious risks associated with filing for bankruptcy, which is seeing an uptick amid high credit card debt and inflation. Key risks highlighted include a severe and long-lasting negative impact on one's credit score, the potential loss of valuable assets like property or home equity through liquidation, and long-term personal and professional consequences. The article also suggests exploring alternatives like debt consolidation, forgiveness, or management programs before resorting to this significant financial step. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chelan County Sheriff's Office is reducing the scale of its search for Travis Decker, who is accused of murdering his three young daughters in early June. Officials state the decision is due to a decrease in credible leads and tips regarding his whereabouts after nearly two months of exhaustive searching. While the criminal investigation remains active, authorities admit there is insufficient information to determine if Decker is alive or deceased. A $20,000 reward is still being offered for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump's lawyers have filed a motion requesting that media mogul Rupert Murdoch be deposed within 15 days for a $10 billion defamation lawsuit. The suit stems from a Wall Street Journal article about a letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein. The motion cites Murdoch's advanced age of 94 and recent health scares as reasons for the urgency, arguing he may be unavailable to testify if the case proceeds at a normal pace. Trump's team is also seeking access to Murdoch's communications related to the article's publication.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide order requiring the Trump administration to continue providing Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood clinics. The ruling expands on a previous injunction and blocks a provision in Trump's tax bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by cutting off payments for non-abortion services like STI testing and cancer screenings. The judge noted that restricting these services would likely lead to adverse public health consequences, including a rise in unintended pregnancies. Planned Parenthood argued that without this funding, nearly 200 of its clinics could be forced to close.</p>

          <p>In celebration of Disability Pride Month, Berkeley-based artist and activist Maya Morya Selkie Scott is promoting a "Disability Justice Community Stories Quilt Project." The project invites people to create individual panels that tell their personal stories, weaving them together into a collective artwork that honors their experiences with family, love, and justice. Inspired by the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the project aims to make the disabled community more visible and carry their stories to a national audience. The quilt serves as a powerful artifact for education and advocacy, building on the legacy of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>

          <p>Despite two recent analyst downgrades from Mizuho and Guggenheim citing valuation concerns, the CNBC Investing Club is not worried about its position in GE Vernova. While the stock has more than doubled since its April lows, the club notes that one firm still raised its price target due to accelerating margin expansion. The club's host, Jim Cramer, expressed a wish for the company to expand its gas turbine production to meet strong and "ironclad" order levels. This analysis indicates a long-term bullish view on the company's fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

The pastor reportedly told his followers that "the Lord" had told him to start the venture.

The groups allege a "coordinated, deliberate action to destroy Palestinian society," pointing to the widespread bombing, displacement, starvation, and systematic destruction of Gaza's healthcare infrastructure.

This policy also allows for the organization of prayer groups during non-work hours.
