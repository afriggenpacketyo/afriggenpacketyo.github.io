The initiative provides a framework for investors to track performance across both asset classes, despite challenges in pricing private securities. (not investment advice)</p>

Federal officials plan a blitz of arrests targeting undocumented immigrants in the region, a move criticized by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. This deployment underscores the administration's aggressive stance on interior immigration enforcement, despite a recent Supreme Court pause on a lower court's order limiting such arrests.</p>

          <p>New draft guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advise both NHS and private fertility clinics to stop offering unproven "add-on" treatments, such as endometrial scratches and specific sperm injection methods. Experts emphasize that these unproven procedures offer false hope and subject patients to unnecessary interventions during an already difficult time. The guidance also recommends wider availability of fertility preservation services for various medical conditions.</p>

          <p>North Korea's state media is using propaganda to portray the deaths of its soldiers fighting for Russia in Ukraine as heroic sacrifices, aiming to reinforce loyalty and commitment to the homeland. Documentaries depict soldiers choosing suicide over capture, a narrative designed for domestic consumption and to signal Pyongyang's resolve to Moscow. Analysts suggest this also serves as a warning against desertion and an attempt to mask the reality of North Koreans dying for Russian interests.</p>
