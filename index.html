          <p>The NFL has suspended former Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker for 10 games following an investigation into numerous sexual misconduct allegations. The suspension, for violations of the league's Personal Conduct Policy, will apply regardless of whether he is signed to a team. Tucker, who was released by the Ravens in May, has been accused by at least 16 massage therapists of inappropriate conduct between 2012 and 2016. While his agent expressed disappointment with the decision, Tucker has accepted the resolution to move forward, though he continues to deny the allegations.</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is facing significant challenges in reducing hospital waiting times, a top government priority. Despite minor improvements, the key target of seeing 92% of patients within 18 weeks has not been met since 2015, causing concern among doctors and patient advocates. While the government expresses confidence in its long-term plan and highlights progress in tackling the longest waits, a BBC analysis found over a third of hospital trusts have seen their performance on the 18-week target worsen since November. The situation leaves many patients, like one grandfather living with constant back pain, waiting indefinitely for treatment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has indicated it may attempt to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a third country if he is released from jail, adding another layer to his complex legal case. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador in what the government called an "administrative error," despite a court order protecting him from removal to his home country due to gang threats. After a judge ordered his return to the U.S., he was immediately jailed on federal smuggling charges in Tennessee. His lawyers are now fighting to protect him from another deportation and secure his return to his family in Maryland.</p>

The drug, leniolisib, is the first targeted treatment for Activated PI3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS), a condition that weakens the immune system. The patient's family was instrumental in the research that identified the faulty gene responsible for the disease in 2013.

          <p>Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin offered a stark critique of her party, describing it as a "solar system with no sun" due to its lack of teamwork and internal divisions. Speaking at the Center for American Progress, she argued that the central split is between those who see a second Trump term as an existential threat and those who view it as merely survivable. Slotkin urged Democrats to refocus on fundamental "pocketbook" issues affecting the middle class, such as job creation, affordable housing, and healthcare. She emphasized that addressing economic struggles is the key to preventing the internal divisions that threaten American democracy.</p>

          <p>The Small Business Administration (SBA) is launching a full-scale audit of its government contracting officers dating back to 2010. This action follows the discovery of a massive, long-term bribery scheme at USAID, where a contracting officer pleaded guilty to accepting over $1 million in bribes in exchange for awarding lucrative contracts. SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler stated the USAID fraud reflects "systemic failures" and that the audit is necessary to crack down on potential abuses within her own agency.

The list included companies in solar energy (Enphase), mining (Freeport-McMoRan), cryptocurrency (Coinbase), data centers (Super Micro Computer), utilities (NRG Energy), and biotechnology (Incyte).

Remarkably, the pole missed all major nerves, tendons, and arteries by a narrow margin.

Scientists used a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph, which blocks the host star's bright glare, to reveal the faint planet.

Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assembly member, centered his campaign on bold affordability proposals, defeating the 67-year-old former Governor Andrew Cuomo. His win is seen by some as a sign of momentum for the party's younger, more progressive wing, while moderate Democrats and conservatives have raised concerns about his platform being too extreme. The outcome highlights the party's struggle to define its identity ahead of critical midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker officially announced he is running for a third term, releasing a campaign video that highlighted his administration's achievements. He touted seven consecutive balanced budgets, nine state credit upgrades, and progressive policies like raising the minimum wage and banning assault weapons. At his kickoff event, Pritzker positioned himself as a problem-solver in stark contrast to President Trump's administration, which he called a "malignant clown car." Despite speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run, Pritzker stated his current focus is on continuing to improve the lives of Illinois families.</p>

Adams, who is now running as an independent, framed the election as a choice between his practical progress and Mamdani's socialist ideals.

          <p>The S&P 500 is nearing a record high, completing a significant turnaround from its sharp decline in April following the announcement of new tariffs. The market's rebound is being driven by several key factors, according to analysts. These include easing investor anxiety as trade negotiations have entered a quieter phase, strong performance from the technology sector, and widespread optimism that the Federal Reserve will implement interest rate cuts later this year. Despite ongoing risks from tariffs and geopolitical tensions, many investors appear confident that a major downturn can be avoided in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following recent military strikes, the operational status of Iran's key nuclear facilities remains a subject of intense debate. Reports suggest significant damage to the primary enrichment site at Natanz and the uranium conversion facility at Isfahan, with some structures described as completely destroyed. However, the extent of the damage to the deeply buried Fordo facility is harder to confirm, though it is believed to be inoperable. A major uncertainty is the status of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium, which experts say is easily movable and could have been relocated to undisclosed, protected locations before the attacks.</p>

The lawsuit challenges the Trump administration's sudden termination of approximately $3 billion in Environmental and Climate Justice grants, which had been awarded to 350 groups for local projects like air quality monitoring and lead pipe replacement. The plaintiffs argue the termination was illegal and unconstitutional, as there was no evidence of noncompliance or fraud.

This trend is compounded by other countries' reluctance to rely solely on the U.S. currency and China's active efforts to establish a separate financial sphere centered on the yuan.

          <p>Californians will face higher prices for their Fourth of July celebrations this year, with a typical cookout for ten costing nearly $20 more than the national average. According to an American Farm Bureau Federation survey, the cost in California is $90.06, compared to the U.S. average of $70.92. Staples like ground beef, chicken, and even hamburger buns are significantly more expensive in the state. The article attributes the price hikes to a combination of factors, including Trump administration tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, reduced livestock availability, and agricultural labor disruptions from ICE raids.</p>

          <p>Suspended Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco has been found guilty of sexual abuse in the Dominican Republic and received a two-year suspended sentence. The charges stemmed from a relationship with a 14-year-old girl when Franco was 22. While found guilty of the abuse charge, he was acquitted of more severe charges of commercial exploitation and human trafficking. The girl's mother was also found guilty of consenting to the illegal relationship in exchange for money and was sentenced to a full 10-year prison term. Franco's attorney has stated they will appeal the ruling.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Dismisses Criminal Case Against Top Advisor to Former LA District Attorney</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 17:22:13 EDT</div>

          <p>A California appeals court has dismissed the remaining criminal charges against Diana Teran, a top advisor to former Los Angeles County District Attorney George GascÃ³n. Teran was charged last year with improperly downloading and using confidential police discipline records. However, her defense successfully argued that the records were publicly available court documents, not illegally hacked files. In a unanimous ruling, the court stated that the computer crime statute used by the Attorney General's office did not apply to Teran's actions, bringing an end to the politically charged prosecution.</p>
