        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was correctly disallowed by VAR due to a lesser-known rule. The decision was made because a Palace player was standing less than one meter away from Chelsea's defensive wall when the kick was taken. This regulation, introduced in the 2019-20 season under Law 13, is designed to prevent attacking players from interfering with the wall and causing delays. The referee announced the specific reason for the disallowance to the stadium crowd, providing clarity on the application of the rule.</p>

          <p>Irish author Sally Rooney has publicly stated her intention to continue supporting Palestine Action, even after the UK government proscribed the group as a terrorist organization. Writing in the Irish Times, she declared she would use her platform and earnings to support direct action, stating, "if this makes me a supporter of terror under UK law, so be it." Her stance comes as the UK Home Secretary defends the ban, citing incidents of property damage and a manual providing guidance for attacks. Rooney's decision highlights a significant clash between freedom of expression and national security laws.</p>

          <p>The recent investigation and expulsion of several high-ranking officials from ethnic minority communities signals a significant shift in China's political landscape. Cadres such as Qizhala from Tibet and Liu Hui from Ningxia, who once held top regional posts traditionally reserved for non-Han officials, are now facing corruption charges. Observers suggest this reflects a broader push for political discipline under President Xi Jinping, indicating that ethnicity-based leniency in elite politics is no longer a given. This marks a departure from past practices aimed at promoting ethnic inclusion within the Communist Party's structure.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the case against Bryan Patrick Miller, known locally as the "Zombie Hunter," for the violent murders of two young women in Phoenix in the early 1990s. The investigation went cold for over two decades until a breakthrough in 2014 using genetic genealogy pointed detectives toward Miller. The timeline covers the initial crimes against Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, Miller's earlier violent history, the undercover sting operation to obtain his DNA, and his eventual arrest. Miller was sentenced to death in June 2023 but maintains his innocence from death row.</p>

          <p>Investigators captured Bryan Patrick Miller, the "canal killer," through an elaborate undercover sting at a Phoenix Chili's restaurant in 2015. Cold case detective Clark Schwartzkopf posed as a security consultant offering Miller a job to get a DNA sample without arousing suspicion. Detectives worked with restaurant staff to ensure a clean sample could be collected from Miller's water glass. Despite Miller's mild-mannered demeanor during the meeting, the DNA provided a direct match to evidence from the two murder scenes from the early 1990s, leading to his immediate arrest and solving the decades-old case.</p>

          <p>In the trial of Bryan Patrick Miller for the Phoenix "canal murders," his defense team admitted his guilt but argued for insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother created a "monster." The defense presented evidence that Miller's mother subjected him to physical and psychological torment, causing him to develop dissociative amnesia with no memory of the killings. Prosecutors countered this by highlighting Miller's clear memory of other violent acts and presenting testimony from his ex-wife about his deviant behavior. The judge ultimately found him guilty and sentenced him to death, acknowledging the abuse but not finding it sufficient for an insanity defense.</p>

The investigation was triggered when a staff member at Craig's dental practice opened a package addressed to him containing the cyanide. Authorities also uncovered evidence of an extramarital affair and significant financial troubles as possible motives, while the defense has suggested Craig was suicidal and purchased the poison for himself.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data showing a three-year high in the Producer Price Index (PPI) has some economists worried, despite a calm market reaction. The surge was driven by inflation in the services sector, a trend also seen in the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which could complicate the Federal Reserve's next move. While a softening labor market suggests a need for rate cuts, this persistent inflation might call for restraint or even rate hikes. The data suggests broad-based inflationary pressures beyond tariffs, including rising wages and energy costs, creating a precarious situation for policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

In response to an inquiry from the opposition Green Party, the government argued that the legal concept of reparations is not applicable. It reasoned that the actions did not violate an international obligation at the time they were committed. This position stands in contrast to Germany's 2021 offer to pay Namibia €1.1 billion over 30 years as compensation for the Herero and Nama genocide of 1904-1908, highlighting a complex and evolving approach to its colonial past.</p>

          <p>Hollywood stuntman Ronnie Rondell Jr., famously photographed while on fire for the cover of Pink Floyd's 1975 album "Wish You Were Here," has passed away at the age of 88. His extensive career spanned decades and included stunt work in iconic films and TV shows like "Lethal Weapon," "Diamonds are Forever," and "Star Trek: First Contact." The iconic album photo required 15 takes, with the final attempt burning off Rondell's eyebrow and part of his mustache. He was a co-founder of the company Stunts Unlimited and was honored with a lifetime achievement award in 2004.</p>

          <p>The daughter of renowned 87-year-old Chinese artist Fan Zeng has claimed on social media that her father has been "taken away" by his new wife, Xu Meng, who is reportedly 50 years his junior. Fan Xiaohui stated she has lost contact with her father and, upon returning from overseas, found his Beijing home sealed and empty, with most of his valuable possessions missing. The artist announced his marriage to Xu, a 37-year-old state media TV presenter, last year. His daughter's post has sparked widespread concern online regarding the elderly artist's health, safety, and the security of his valuable artworks.</p>

          <p>Community violence prevention leaders argue that President Trump's plan to use increased law enforcement and military presence to combat urban crime is misguided and ineffective. Advocates state that safety is created through community investment and tailored prevention programs, not just police response. They point to the success of community-based initiatives in cities like Baltimore and Oakland, which have seen homicides decrease when such programs are well-funded. Critics note the irony of the administration's approach, as it recently cut nearly $170 million in federal grants to these very violence prevention organizations, undermining their work.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Department of Justice's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell case, stating they contain no significant new information. Judge Paul Engelmayer asserted that the documents are not an "untapped mine lode" and that the public would be "disappointed and misled" by their contents, as only two law enforcement officers testified. This decision renews questions about whether other, more revealing investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking network will ever be released. Critics and victims' advocates argue that the administration has the power to release these other files but is choosing not to.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flight operations after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by more than 10,000 flight attendants. The Canadian Industrial Relations Board ordered staff to return to work, and the Jobs Minister initiated binding arbitration to resolve the dispute over salaries and pay for ground time. The union, which had caused around 700 flight cancellations, accused the government of "caving to corporate pressure" and violating workers' rights. The airline cautioned that while flights will restart, it will take several days to stabilize its schedule completely.</p>

The shrine honors convicted war criminals among Japan's war dead, and the tributes coincided with the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II. Beijing condemned the act as a "blatant provocation against historical justice and human conscience."

The protests were condemned by far-right members of the Israeli government, who claimed such pressure undermines national security.

          <p>The Israeli military announced it conducted an airstrike deep inside Yemen, targeting an energy infrastructure site used by Houthi rebels. The attack, which occurred near the capital of Sanaa, was described as a response to repeated missile and drone attacks by the Iran-backed group against Israel. Since the start of the Gaza war, the Houthis have launched numerous attacks in what they claim is solidarity with Palestinians. Houthi-run media reported that a power plant was hit, though there were no immediate reports of casualties from the Israeli strike, which represents a significant escalation.</p>

New owner Mike Conner purchased the abandoned, off-grid island for £555,000 in 2017 and spent nearly five years and a significant investment to make it habitable. The historic 100-man fort, originally built in the 1850s, now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub.

          <p>Germany has suspended its humanitarian visa program, leaving approximately 300 Russian and Belarusian critics of the Kremlin in limbo despite many having already received approval. The program was a lifeline for activists, journalists, and others fleeing persecution for their opposition to the war in Ukraine. The German Interior Ministry cited a new coalition government agreement to toughen migration policy as the reason for the suspension. This leaves individuals, including one man persecuted over his daughter's anti-war drawing, in precarious situations in former Soviet countries where they face the risk of abduction or extradition.</p>

However, their center-left SPD coalition partners, including Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, strongly oppose compulsion and are pushing a bill to make voluntary service more attractive.
