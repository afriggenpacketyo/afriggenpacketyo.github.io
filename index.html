          <h2>German Intelligence Classifies AfD as Right-Wing Extremist</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 07:40:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency has classified the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party as a right-wing extremist group, allowing for increased surveillance and potential withdrawal of state funding. The agency stated that the AfD's views on ethnicity and immigration are incompatible with Germany's democratic order, specifically citing the party's stance on citizens with a "migration background from predominantly Muslim countries." AfD leaders have denounced the decision as politically motivated, while government officials maintain it was based on a comprehensive review. The classification could impact the AfD's standing in parliament, including eligibility to chair committees. Optimism Score: 30</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the classification of Germany's AfD party as a confirmed right-wing extremist organization, lawmakers are exploring the possibility of banning the party altogether. The move by the domestic intelligence agency allows for surveillance of AfD meetings, tapping telephones, and recruiting informants. Article 21 of the German constitution allows the Federal Constitutional Court to ban parties that seek to undermine the free democratic basic order. While some analysts believe a ban is urgently needed, others are skeptical about its likelihood of success, noting the AfD's current strength in opinion polls. Optimism Score: 40</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, although profits declined compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices.

          <p>As discussions intensify regarding President Trump's policy agenda, potential changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction limit could impact higher earners. The $10,000 SALT cap, enacted in 2017, is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress takes action.

          <p>Ryan Coogler's film "Sinners" uses the backdrop of a vampire story to reveal the harsh economic realities faced by Black people in the Jim Crow South. The film follows twin gangsters who open a juke joint but struggle to profit due to the systemic barriers of segregation, including lack of access to capital and exploitative labor practices like sharecropping. The film highlights the strict separations of the Jim Crow economy and how these economic constraints ultimately expose the twins and their customers to supernatural horror. The film is a period piece about the near-impossibility of upward mobility in the segregation economy. Optimism Score: 25</p>

          <p>In the wake of a Supreme Court ruling, California cities are rapidly changing their approach to homelessness by enforcing anti-camping bans and expanding "interim housing" options like tiny house shelters. Cities like San Jose and San Francisco are embracing this approach, with San Jose aiming to build over 1,000 new temporary housing units and San Francisco increasing arrests of homeless individuals. While critics worry about creating a two-tiered housing system, supporters argue that interim housing is a faster and cheaper solution than permanent supportive housing.

          <p>Zhao Xintong delivered a dominant performance against Ronnie O'Sullivan in their World Championship semi-final, taking a commanding 12-4 lead. Zhao won all eight frames in the Friday morning session, becoming only the fourth player to achieve an 8-0 session against O'Sullivan at the Crucible. O'Sullivan, struggling with his cue, made changes after the opening session but was unable to match Zhao's clinical potting. Zhao compiled breaks of 112 and 115, positioning himself to become the first player from China to win the title in Sheffield. Optimism Score: 75</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that greenhouse gas emissions from US oil and gas production are expected to increase under President Trump's administration. Despite tariffs hampering some drilling efforts, the US is still on track to increase oil and gas extraction, leading to a surge in planet-heating emissions. The expected amount of greenhouse gas emissions from active and planned projects in US oil and gas fields has jumped under Trump, after previously dropping under Biden. This shift threatens a pulse of new pollution that will further add to the fever of a planet already suffering from heatwaves, floods, droughts and other disasters accelerated by global heating.
