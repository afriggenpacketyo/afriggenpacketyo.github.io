            <p>Inflation eased in March 2025 to 2.4%, down from 2.8% in February, primarily due to lower gasoline prices. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also decreased to 2.8%, the lowest since March 2021, signaling a deceleration in underlying inflation trends. However, economists are concerned about rising grocery prices and the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which could push inflation to 4% by the end of 2025. While housing disinflation is expected to continue, tariffs pose a significant headwind to achieving the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for most countries, maintaining a 10% baseline tariff across the board, to allow for trade negotiations. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the importance of not retaliating to be rewarded, but the pause does not apply to China, where the total tariff rate has risen to 145%. This decision follows concerns about the potential economic impact of widespread tariffs and aims to encourage countries to engage in trade discussions with the U.S. Trump acknowledged that investor concerns and bond market declines contributed to his decision to rollback some tariffs.</p>

A message suggests that some local union members are dissatisfied with the dispute's handling, while Unite denies these claims. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner urged the union to accept what she called a "significantly improved" offer from the council, as thousands of tonnes of rubbish have accumulated on the city's streets. The dispute centers on the loss of a job role, with Unite arguing it would affect 150 workers and result in pay cuts.</p>

            <p>The Democratic National Committee is "doubling down" on town hall meetings in Republican-held districts, focusing on the GOP budget bill and concerns over affordability. These "People's Town Halls" will feature high-profile officials like Sen. Cory Booker. Democrats criticize the budget blueprint for potentially leading to cuts to key programs during economic uncertainty. Republicans argue that the budget will not threaten any benefits or entitlements.</p>

The framework allows for tax cuts and spending on defense, energy, and immigration policy. The vote came after intraparty drama over the level of spending cuts.</p>

South Carolina resumed executions last year, reviving the controversial method of shooting. Mahdi's lawyers have filed a clemency petition, but no governor has granted clemency to a death row defendant in nearly 50 executions.</p>

            <p>President Trump continues to fuel speculation about seeking a third term in 2028, despite constitutional limitations. His ambiguous responses keep the topic alive and maintain his central role in the Republican Party. Some Republicans dismiss the idea as a joke, while others, like Rep. Andy Ogles, propose amending the Constitution to allow a third term. The situation mirrors past instances where seemingly outlandish Trump ideas gained traction, potentially leading to pressure on Republicans to support his continued leadership.</p>

The government's latest consumer inflation data revealed inflation in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis. The situation is still too uncertain to call, according to most analysts.
