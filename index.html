          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers stated they denied ICE agents entry to Dodger Stadium, which ICE refuted, while DHS indicated their vehicles were briefly present for unrelated reasons. This occurred amidst heightened immigration raids in Los Angeles, prompting protests and federal responses. Dodgers player Kiké Hernández criticized the raids, expressing solidarity with the affected community. The team is expected to announce assistance for immigrants impacted by the raids, marking their first official response to the situation. This situation reflects ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement in the city. The current political climate exacerbates these issues, leading to community concern.

          <p>As President Trump considers potential strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, law enforcement officials are increasing surveillance of Iran-backed operatives within the United States, according to CBS News. The FBI has reportedly intensified efforts to monitor potential domestic sleeper cells linked to Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization supported by Iran. This action follows concerns about Iran's ability to direct or inspire attacks within the U.S., heightened since the assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in 2020. The Trump administration is also considering potential military action against Iran. The move aims to address perceived threats.</p>

          <p>The European Union is increasingly concerned about China's economic overcapacity, which they fear could flood European markets with subsidized goods. The EU believes that decades of overinvestment, state subsidies, and weak domestic consumption in China have created a situation where excess industrial production is being exported at discounted prices. This could potentially harm European companies in sectors ranging from industrial machinery to renewable energy technologies. The EU is urging Beijing to address this issue to avoid a trade backlash similar to the one experienced in the United States. The future remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring 20 Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement in order to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted an injunction, arguing that the states were likely to succeed in their claims that the administration was unlawfully attempting to coerce them into adhering to Trump's immigration policies. The states argued that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. This ruling is a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to pressure sanctuary jurisdictions. This reflects ongoing political and legal battles.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that a passing star could disrupt the solar system, potentially flinging Earth out of orbit or into the sun. Computer simulations indicate that passing stars are the most probable trigger for instability over the next four billion years. While the odds of a direct collision with Earth are low, the gravitational tug could significantly alter the orbits of other planets, including Mercury and Mars. The study highlights the vulnerability of the solar system to external forces. The chances of this happening are slim.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution, with a decrease of up to 47% in plastic bag litter collected during coastal cleanups. The study found that fee-based policies were more effective than full bans, and partial bans were the least effective. California's experience with plastic bag regulations serves as an example of how policy design impacts waste reduction. The findings support the implementation of stricter plastic bag laws to protect marine life. This shows progress.</p>
