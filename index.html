            <p>Cambridge secured victories in both the men's and women's races at the 2025 Boat Race, though the women's race began with significant drama after an early clash between the boats forced a restart. Oxford encroached on Cambridge's line, leading to the collision. Despite the initial disruption, Cambridge dominated the restarted race, achieving their 49th win in the women's event. The races proceeded despite concerns regarding water quality on the traditional Putney to Mortlake course, marking the tenth year that the women's and men's races were held on the same day and course.</p>

            <p>Bangladeshi authorities have issued an arrest warrant for British MP Tulip Siddiq amid allegations of illegal land acquisition, linked to an ongoing probe of her aunt, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Siddiq's lawyers vehemently deny the charges, claiming they are politically motivated and stating that no evidence has been presented nor has Siddiq been formally notified. The investigation also examines claims that Sheikh Hasina and her family embezzled billions from infrastructure spending. Siddiq had previously referred herself to the PM's ethics advisor who found no evidence of improprieties, though noted potential reputational risks due to family ties.</p>

            <p>Concerns are mounting among investors about a potential exodus of assets from the U.S. amid a decline in the dollar and Treasury values. Aggressive and fluctuating trade policies from Washington are fueling fears of long-term damage to the U.S.'s financial standing. The dollar has seen sharp drops against safe-haven currencies, and the 10-year Treasury yield has risen sharply, indicating a possible shift away from U.S. assets. Some analysts suggest the market is reassessing the dollar's attractiveness as a global reserve currency, leading to rapid de-dollarization. (not investment advice)</p>

The victory followed intense negotiations, including White House involvement, to bridge the gap between House and Senate budget proposals. A key point of contention was the level of spending cuts, with the House seeking significantly more than the Senate. Johnson and Senator Thune ultimately made a public commitment to deep spending cuts, which helped secure the necessary votes.</p>

            <p>A scandal surrounding Ireland's Magdalene laundries and mother-and-baby homes continues as religious organizations linked to the institutions refuse to contribute to a survivor redress scheme. These institutions housed and abused 'fallen women', and a mass grave containing hundreds of babies was discovered. Only two of the eight religious organizations have offered to contribute to redress, sparking outrage and calls for seizure of church assets.</p>

            <p>Financial therapists suggest that difficulties in sticking to a budget may be linked to one's attachment style. Anxious attachment to money may lead to compulsive checking and vigilance, while avoidant attachment may result in ignoring bills and financial responsibilities. Understanding one's emotional blueprint in relation to money can be key to managing finances effectively. Those with anxious attachment should set boundaries, while those with avoidant attachment should start with small, regular exposures to financial tasks. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Albert Saniger, former CEO of nate, has been indicted for allegedly defrauding investors by falsely claiming the e-commerce app was powered by AI. Instead, the app relied on human workers in overseas call centers to manually process transactions. Saniger allegedly raised over $40 million based on the promise of custom-built 'deep learning models' capable of automating the checkout process. The indictment follows the company's fallout in 2023, leaving investors with near-total losses.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff plan is expected to disproportionately affect low-income Americans. While Trump claims the tariffs will benefit small businesses, they are likely to raise prices on everyday goods, acting as a consumption tax. Lower-income households will spend a larger share of their income on these price hikes. Additionally, the tariffs could lead to a recession, further harming low-income families through job losses and reduced wages.</p>
