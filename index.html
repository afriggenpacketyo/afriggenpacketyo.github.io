            <p>Canada's major federal party leaders engaged in their final debate before the election, addressing critical issues such as trade relations with the US under President Trump, affordability, crime, and environmental policy. Liberal leader Mark Carney faced scrutiny regarding his ties to the previous Trudeau administration, while leaders debated approaches to US tariffs, with Carney advocating for targeted measures. The debate also highlighted policy differences on housing, crime, and social programs, with smaller parties vying for relevance amidst strong support for the Conservatives and Liberals.

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, a Maryland resident who was mistakenly deported.

            <p>The global economy is facing increasing volatility due to the Trump administration's trade wars and tariff policies. While some see tariffs as a negotiation tactic to address trade imbalances, they impose significant costs, disrupt global supply chains, and harm consumers. The possibility of reshoring manufacturing to the US could lead to enormous investment, escalated production costs, and inflation. The lack of a clear international response to these policies is concerning, as the economic and political costs become increasingly difficult to ignore.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration announced fees on Chinese-built vessels docking at U.S. ports, following a USTR investigation that found China's shipbuilding industry had an unfair advantage. The fees, initially proposed under the Biden administration, aim to address threats to the U.S. supply chain and encourage U.S.-built ships. The fees will be phased in over several years, with initial rates set at zero and gradually increasing. Vessel owners can receive a remission of fees by providing proof of a U.S. shipbuilding order.</p>

            <p>Most fire services in England are facing a funding shortfall after the government failed to provide the same level of compensation for tax increases as it did for the police. While police forces received extra funding to cover the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions, fire services only received top-up funds covering 50% of the increase on average. This shortfall could equate to the cost of a fully-staffed fire engine for some services. The National Fire Chiefs Council has stated that fire services will be £20 million short of the funding needed to cover national insurance increases.</p>

            <p>A pilot project called SeaCURE has begun operating on the south coast of England to test the feasibility of capturing carbon dioxide from seawater. The project removes carbon from the water before pumping it back into the sea, where it absorbs more CO2 from the atmosphere. While the amount of CO2 removed is currently small, those behind SeaCURE believe it has the potential to be scaled up significantly. Experts say carbon removal is necessary to reach net zero emissions, and capturing CO2 directly from seawater is one of several options being explored.</p>

While Trump has criticized Powell in the past, legal precedent suggests that presidents cannot easily fire or demote the Fed chair due to the central bank's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

The average price of a detached home in Vancouver is now over C$2 million, making homeownership unattainable for many young Canadians. The crisis is driven by a supply shortage, with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation estimating a need for over 3.8 million new homes in the next six years. Political parties are proposing plans to address the crisis, but experts caution that more comprehensive solutions are needed to address generational tensions.</p>

The CDC had been offering onsite assessments to hospitals to improve ventilation and air filtration, but the expansion of this service to schools has been halted. These cuts are largely related to the elimination of NIOSH by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first wave of layoffs earlier this month, as well as other CDC staff assigned to the effort had been let go. Multiple agency staff assigned to the measles response effort had been let go, and the agency is now "scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support" to Texas and other states now facing outbreaks.</p>
