          <p>The Israel Defense Forces have confirmed that remains handed over by Hamas are those of 76-year-old Eliyahu Margalit, who was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz. This marks the eighth confirmed deceased hostage returned since a peace deal was enacted. The agreement called for Hamas to return all hostages, but the recovery of the remaining bodies has been slow, complicated by the widespread destruction in Gaza. U.S. officials have urged patience, noting the logistical difficulties and have even shared intelligence to assist in the search efforts.</p>

          <h2>Pew Research Finds Majority of Divorced Americans Marry Again</h2>

          <p>A new analysis by the Pew Research Center reveals that two-thirds of divorced Americans eventually remarry, with men being slightly more likely to do so than women. The study highlights the significant economic benefits of remarriage, noting that the median household wealth of remarried adults is substantially higher than that of divorced individuals. While remarriage is common, experts also caution that second marriages have a higher rate of divorce, particularly among those over 50, a phenomenon known as "gray divorce."</p>

          <p>Dr. Corey Miller, president of the Christian organization Ratio Christi, argues that a form of cultural Marxism taught in American universities is fostering ideological intolerance and contributing to real-world violence. Citing the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, he posits that this academic worldview creates a lower view of human life and frames any inequality as injustice, igniting hostility among students. Miller suggests that what begins on campus eventually impacts the broader culture and advocates for more open debate rather than censorship.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has confirmed that team captain Marc Guehi will not be signing a new contract and intends to leave the club next year. The 25-year-old England defender's current deal is set to expire at the end of the season. According to Glasner, the club offered Guehi a new contract, but the player expressed a desire for a different challenge. This decision means Crystal Palace will likely look to sell him during the January transfer window to avoid losing him on a free transfer next summer.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Ministry has announced that it no longer considers itself bound by the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear deal, as the landmark agreement officially expired. The deal, known as the JCPOA, had placed caps on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The agreement has been in jeopardy since the United States withdrew in 2018, and subsequent negotiations to revive it have stalled. This development comes after European powers recently triggered the reinstatement of international sanctions, citing Iran's violations.</p>

          <p>The first T20 match of England's winter tour against New Zealand in Christchurch was washed out due to rain, preventing a result. Before the weather intervened, England had battled to a score of 153-6 on a difficult pitch. All-rounder Sam Curran was instrumental in their innings, scoring an unbeaten 49 from 35 balls to rescue the team from a precarious 81-5. However, persistent rain meant New Zealand's chase could not begin, leading to a frustrating conclusion for both teams and spectators.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he has commuted the seven-year prison sentence of former congressman George Santos, leading to his immediate release. Santos had served less than three months after being convicted of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. In his announcement, Trump cited Santos's Republican voting record and alleged mistreatment in prison as reasons for the clemency. The move was praised by some Republican allies but drew sharp criticism from other lawmakers who argued the short time served was not justice.</p>

          <p>Following a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump called for an immediate end to the war, urging both sides to "stop where they are." This marks a shift in his position, suggesting a peace deal based on current battle lines rather than a full Ukrainian victory. Trump also expressed reluctance to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing the need to maintain U.S. stockpiles. The comments came a day after Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin and announced plans for a future meeting.</p>

          <p>A new study has yielded exciting results for the Galleri blood test, which can screen for more than 50 different types of cancer. In a trial involving 25,000 adults in North America, the test successfully detected a wide range of cancers, over half of which were at an early, more treatable stage. Crucially, three-quarters of the cancers found are types that currently have no routine screening programs. The test, which identifies cancerous DNA in the bloodstream, is now undergoing a large-scale trial with the NHS in England.</p>

However, some Trump allies have labeled the protests as "Hate America" rallies and raised concerns about potential unrest, prompting the governors to activate troops as a precautionary measure.
