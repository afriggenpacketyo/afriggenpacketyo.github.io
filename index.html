          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Capital One, accusing the bank of deceiving customers by failing to inform them about a new savings product with substantially higher interest rates. The lawsuit alleges that Capital One marketed its "360 Savings" account as a high-yield option but did not notify customers about the "360 Performance Savings" account, which offered significantly better rates as interest rates rose in 2022. The Attorney General's office claims that Capital One instructed employees not to proactively inform customers about the new product, leading to New York customers missing out on millions of dollars in potential interest. Capital One disputes the claims and intends to defend itself in court.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Kennedy defended the cuts as necessary for fiscal responsibility, claiming that the department would achieve more with less and prioritize chronic disease management. Senators grilled Kennedy on the impact of these cuts, particularly on programs related to lead poisoning prevention, cancer research, and occupational safety, expressing concerns that the cuts would negatively impact patient care and public health. Kennedy also addressed his views on vaccines, stating that his personal opinions are irrelevant and that he defers to the expertise of the NIH and CDC, though this stance drew criticism from public health experts.</p>

          <p>Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade has voiced his doubts regarding the legitimacy of the NBA Draft Lottery, amid ongoing speculation about potential rigging. Wade emphasized that the NBA is a business and suggested that the league must ensure it is taken care of, without directly stating that the lottery is fixed. His comments come after the Dallas Mavericks, with a slim 1.8% chance, secured the top pick, leading to renewed suspicions about the fairness of the lottery process.

          <p>Alex Jacobsen, owner of Auratone, a Nashville-based loudspeaker company, is contemplating moving his family business overseas due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The tariffs have significantly increased the cost of imported parts needed for manufacturing, potentially doubling the price of Auratone's speakers. Jacobsen is considering relocating manufacturing to Europe to benefit from free trade agreements, as a substantial portion of his customer base is located there. This situation highlights the potential unintended consequences of tariffs, which could lead businesses to move operations out of the U.S. rather than bring them stateside.</p>

          <p>An article examines the reasons behind high prescription drug prices in the United States, noting that Americans pay significantly more than people in other high-income countries. The lack of universal healthcare and the limited negotiating power of Medicare are key factors contributing to the high costs. Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), intended to control drug prices, may instead contribute to higher costs due to their financial incentives. The article questions whether President Trump's executive order can effectively lower drug prices, pointing to past failed attempts and the strong lobbying presence of pharmaceutical companies.</p>

          <p>With inflation declining and interest rate cuts looking likely, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be a sensible option for homeowners seeking to borrow money. HELOCs offer relatively low interest rates compared to other borrowing options like personal loans and credit cards, making them attractive for financing large expenses. Elevated home equity levels provide homeowners with substantial funds to utilize. Borrowers should carefully consider their financial situation and potential payment scenarios before taking out a HELOC, as their home serves as collateral.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the immediate release of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher detained by immigration authorities, finding that his detention violated his First and Fifth Amendment rights. Suri, an Indian national married to a U.S. citizen, was detained based on alleged connections to a Hamas official and accusations of spreading Hamas propaganda. The judge refuted the government's claims and emphasized that Suri's detention was caused by his protected speech regarding the conflict in Gaza. The ACLU hailed the ruling as a victory for free speech rights.</p>

          <p>Joseph Nye, the international affairs scholar who coined the term "soft power," has died at the age of 88. Nye's concept of soft power emphasized the importance of influence gained through aid, culture, news, and the promotion of human rights, as opposed to military or economic coercion. He served in the State Department and the Pentagon under Presidents Carter and Clinton and was the dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Nye's ideas had a significant impact on U.S. foreign policy and were antithetical to the approach of Donald Trump, who Nye criticized for undermining institutions essential to soft power.</p>

          <p>To address a severe overcrowding crisis in prisons in England and Wales, the government will release more than a thousand inmates early. This measure, announced by the Justice Secretary, aims to free up spaces as the prison system faces running out of capacity. The change will apply to offenders serving one to four years who are recalled to prison for breaching their licenses, who will be released after 28 days, with exceptions for those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk. The move is intended to buy time while the government overhauls the system and invests in building new prisons.</p>

          <p>Republicans are pushing to cut Medicaid by imposing work requirements, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would save $300 billion over a decade and take health insurance from 7.6 million people. This measure is seen as a way to offset the costs of extending and expanding the 2017 tax cut. Critics argue that these work requirements are designed to fail, creating complex reporting demands that lead eligible Medicaid recipients to lose their health care, rather than encouraging employment. The plan is viewed as a way to finance a tax cut for the affluent by denying healthcare to those who need it most.</p>
