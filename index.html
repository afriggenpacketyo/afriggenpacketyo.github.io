          <p>Naoya "Monster" Inoue retained his undisputed super bantamweight world championship by defeating Ramon Cardenas via an eighth-round technical knockout in Las Vegas. Cardenas initially surprised Inoue with a knockdown in the second round, but Inoue regained composure and intensified his attack. The champion's relentless assault led to a knockdown in the seventh round and a final barrage in the eighth, prompting the referee to stop the fight. Inoue expressed surprise at Cardenas' toughness and confirmed his next fight would be against Murodjon Akhmadaliev in Japan.

          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons to reopen and significantly expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison located on an island near San Francisco. Trump stated that this move would serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice," aiming to house America's most violent offenders. Alcatraz, which closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, was once home to notorious gangsters like Al Capone. The decision has faced criticism, with some questioning the necessity and cost-effectiveness of reopening the facility, the optimism score reflects the general state of stability as the president exercises executive authority, however the president is using the move to instill fear, so the score is not very high.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside the United States, claiming it poses a national security threat. He has authorized the United States Trade Representative to initiate the process of taxing "any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands." The Motion Picture Association declined to comment, but the proposal raises questions about its impact on independent films, movies receiving foreign tax incentives, and post-production work done globally. The optimism score is moderate, as it represents a potential shift in economic policy and its possible effects on the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Two people died when a small plane crashed into two homes in a Simi Valley neighborhood in Ventura County, California, causing structural damage and fire. The aircraft, a Vans RV-10, had departed from William J. Fox Airfield in Lancaster and was en route to Camarillo Airport. Residents of the affected homes were safely evacuated, and the FAA and NTSB are investigating the cause of the crash. Neighbors reported that the plane circled the area multiple times before the incident, potentially indicating a loss of control.

          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to the United States in various technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence, and excelling in the commercialization and manufacturing of tech. They highlight the rise of Chinese AI models like DeepSeek and the global popularity of apps like TikTok and Temu. The authors suggest that the U.S. needs to openly share more of its AI technologies, innovate faster, and focus on diffusing AI throughout its economy to maintain its competitive edge.

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth place among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming the third position. The decline in Japan's ODA was primarily attributed to the depreciation of the yen, despite Japan viewing ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell, mainly due to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine. The OECD report highlights the challenges in maintaining development aid levels amid global economic and political shifts.

          <p>As a U.S. tax loophole ends, apparel makers in Guangzhou, China, are grappling with the impact of tariffs and rising costs. Many factory owners are considering relocating their operations to other provinces or countries like Vietnam to remain competitive. The tariffs have made it difficult for them to sell to the United States, leading to declining orders and suspended production lines. The Chinese government is encouraging domestic e-commerce platforms to help small businesses sell to their home market. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the challenges faced by businesses adapting to changing trade policies.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany's chancellor at a time of profound reckoning for the country, facing challenges such as soaring inequality, a struggling industrial base, and the rise of the far-right AfD party.

To turn things around, Merz needs to unify the nation and chart a path towards the future. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the challenges and uncertainties facing Germany's new leader.</p>

          <p>Patsy Widakuswara, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit fighting Donald Trump's order to dismantle Voice of America, has called for the media to resist attacks from the administration. She argues that VOA provides an important source of objective information, especially in illiberal environments. The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is attempting to unlawfully dismantle VOA's operations because they deem it contrary to the government's agenda. Widakuswara's efforts to save VOA have faced legal challenges, with a court of appeals issuing a stay on a preliminary injunction that would have restored funding.

          <p>A recent government survey revealed that the lack of trash bins in public areas is the biggest inconvenience for visitors to Japan. Many respondents reported having to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of trash bins in public spaces is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks.

He said, "by God's grace I did my duty that day to support the peaceful transfer of power under the Constitution of the United States of America.” His comments came hours after an interview with Trump aired in which he was asked whether U.S. citizens and noncitizens both deserve due process as laid out in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, Trump was noncommittal.

          <p>As high tariffs reduce U.S. orders for Chinese goods, China is striving to help exporters divert sales to the domestic market, a move that threatens to drive the economy into deeper deflation. Local governments and major businesses are supporting efforts to redirect products to Chinese consumers. An influx of discounted goods intended for the U.S. market would erode companies' profitability and weigh on employment. After hovering just above zero in 2023 and 2024, the consumer price index slipped into negative territory. The optimism score is low, reflecting the economic challenges faced by China.</p>

          <p>Workplace leaders are grappling with balancing between prioritizing people and profit making amid the rapid rise of artificial intelligence. Companies have a responsibility to protect jobs as the AI boom could drive unemployment and "potentially exacerbate inequality," CIMB Group's chief data and AI officer Pedro Uria-Recio told CNBC Make It at the GITEX Asia 2025 conference. The U.N. Trade and Development agency warned in an April report that AI could affect 40% of jobs worldwide and widen inequality between nations. Therefore, companies should work to not only equip employees with the right skills that will enable them to handle the AI revolution more effectively, but also work to create new employment.

          <p>A report from the Health and Social Care Select Committee warns that doing nothing to reform social care for older and disabled adults is an "active" and "untenable" decision. The report finds that a failure to fix England's social care system is costing the country in financial and human terms. Taxpayers are currently paying £32 billion a year for a broken system propped up by contributions from unpaid carers. The report also highlights a lack of available data into the system and calls for the government to publish annual assessments of the level of unmet care needs for adults.

          <p>Analysts suggest that China’s anti-corruption drive targeting the top brass of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) should not be taken as a sign that President Xi Jinping has weak control over the military. They add that the campaign’s impact on the military’s war readiness and modernisation was also limited, and that internal competition among Xi’s supporters could be a factor behind the high-level investigations. In the past two years, Beijing has targeted two of the seven members of its Central Military Commission (CMC), a powerful body led by Xi, while a third vanished from the public eye over a month ago.
