          <p>A passenger train collided with a slurry tanker near the German border in southern Denmark, resulting in the death of a 60-year-old woman and injuring 27 others, with two remaining in critical condition. The crash, which occurred at a level crossing, caused at least two carriages to derail, trapping some passengers. Authorities used a crane to lift the wreckage to search for more victims among the 106 people involved in the accident. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed her condolences as rail services along the line were suspended indefinitely.</p>

The test confirmed that the 21 YF-100K engines, which power the rocket's first stage and two boosters, can operate in sync under various power conditions. The 92-meter-tall superheavy launcher is designed to deliver a 27-tonne payload to a trans-lunar orbit. The current mission plan involves two separate Long March-10 launches for the crewed spacecraft and the lunar lander.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes summit in Alaska between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded without a significant breakthrough on ending the war in Ukraine. Trump described the talks as "productive," but stated, "There's no deal until there's a deal," while Putin called the meeting a "starting point" for improving bilateral relations. The discussions, held without Ukrainian representation, raised concerns in Kyiv about potential compromises affecting its sovereignty. Trump indicated he would update President Zelenskyy and NATO on the talks, emphasizing that the final decision rests with them.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, Manchester United and England football legend Wayne Rooney discussed pivotal moments from his career, his family life, and his transition into management and punditry. He credited a conversation with a youth manager at age 14 for turning him away from a troubled path and focusing him on football. Rooney reflected on the pain of losing the 2005 FA Cup final and the embarrassment of England failing to qualify for Euro 2008. He also spoke candidly about his difficult managerial stints and his new role as a pundit, where he aims to be fair and honest in his analysis.</p>

          <p>The summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska yielded more questions than answers, despite being framed as a step toward peace in Ukraine. Key outcomes included Putin's successful return to the world stage, complete with a red-carpet welcome, and his clear signal that Russia's maximalist demands for a ceasefire remain unchanged. The meeting ended earlier than expected without a joint press conference, and Trump's subsequent statement was notably vague and did not mention Ukraine. Putin's invitation for a future meeting in Moscow capped a day that was seen as a strategic victory for the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government is planning to tighten residency requirements for mainland Chinese nationals, a move critics are calling an "attack" on cross-strait spouses. The proposed amendments, announced by President Lai Ching-te, cite escalating security threats from Beijing, including infiltration through cross-strait exchanges. Under the new policy, applicants would need to provide notarized proof of relinquishing their household registration in mainland China. They must also prove they have renounced or invalidated their Chinese passport, reflecting a significant shift in cross-strait residency governance.</p>

          <p>California Democrats have unveiled a controversial proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps in an effort to gain up to five U.S. House seats. The move is a direct response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas and aims to bolster the Democratic party's chances of controlling Congress. The plan would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval in a special election. If passed, the new maps would significantly reshape several GOP-held districts to favor Democrats, a strategy critics are decrying as partisan gerrymandering that undermines the state's independent redistricting commission.</p>

The Russian president reiterated his maximalist demands for ending the war, effectively ensuring no real progress was made. The event was seen less as a negotiation and more as a photo opportunity that served Putin's strategic interests.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to scale back its federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force following a lawsuit from the city. Under the agreement, Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith will remain in command, reversing an earlier order that had placed the DEA administrator in charge. The deal was reached after a federal judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the administration's move during an emergency hearing. While the city retains command, a revised directive still requires the D.C. mayor to provide police services for federal purposes, including assisting with immigration enforcement.</p>

Officials hope this new type of "starter home" will be replicated across the state to help address the housing crisis.

One study found that post-meal glucose fluctuations were smaller after eating a mango compared to white bread.
