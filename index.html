          <p>Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is working to balance relations with a more assertive Russia and pressure from the U.S. for increased NATO contributions. Merz recently activated a German tank brigade in Lithuania as a deterrent against potential Russian aggression, while also advocating for Germany to take a more prominent leadership role within NATO. To modernize its military, Germany is increasing military spending by decoupling it from borrowing limits, aiming to become the strongest conventional military force in Europe. However, the German army faces challenges including dilapidated infrastructure, staff shortages, and insufficient equipment, requiring significant reform and investment. The country is trying to find its footing in a world with growing threats and pressure to increase its military spending, but is taking the initiative in bolstering its own defenses. Optimism is tempered by the challenges and the need for significant reforms.</p>

          <p>Japanese boxer Ginjiro Shigeoka will retire from professional boxing after undergoing brain surgery following his defeat in an IBF world minimumweight title match. Shigeoka lost consciousness in the ring after his split-decision loss to Pedro Taduran and was rushed to a hospital in Osaka. According to Japan Boxing Commission rules, boxers who have had brain surgery cannot hold a professional license. Shigeoka previously won the minimumweight title in 2023 and lost his belt to Taduran in July. The news of Shigeoka's surgery and subsequent retirement marks a somber moment for the sport.</p>

          <p>Former Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, has been pardoned by the former president after being convicted of fraud and bribery. Jenkins was found guilty of accepting over $75,000 in bribes in exchange for making businessmen auxiliary deputy sheriffs without proper training. Trump described Jenkins as a "wonderful person" and a victim of an overzealous Justice Department, claiming the judge unfairly restricted Jenkins's defense. Prosecutors argued that Jenkins abused his position by allowing individuals to avoid traffic tickets and carry concealed firearms in exchange for cash and campaign contributions. The pardon prevents Jenkins from serving his 10-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>A car ramming incident in Liverpool, England, injured almost 50 people, including four children, during a celebration of Liverpool F.C.'s Premier League title win. Police have arrested a 53-year-old man and are treating the incident as isolated, not terrorism. The incident occurred on Water Street near the end of the parade route, as video footage showed a dark-colored vehicle swerving into the crowd. While most injuries were minor, four people remain in the hospital in serious condition. This unfortunate event cast a dark shadow over what should have been a joyous day for the city and its soccer fans.</p>

          <p>Kim Jong-un's decision to skip Russia's Victory Day parade indicates a strategic move to balance relations with China and Russia. His absence spared him an awkward alignment with Xi Jinping, who was the "main guest" at the event, and avoided further straining ties with China, which is uneasy about Pyongyang's military alignment with Moscow. Instead, Kim visited the Russian embassy in Pyongyang, expressing his close friendship with Putin and hailing the alliance between North Korea and Russia. This decision reflects a calculated approach to navigate complex geopolitical relationships.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering removing the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts most families from claiming means-tested benefits for third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged that the policy has pushed people into poverty, but cautioned that unwinding it would be expensive. The decision is expected in the autumn, coinciding with the publication of the government's child poverty strategy. Phillipson emphasized that a Labour government would not have introduced the cap and that the cost of inaction is also significant.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, China's greenhouse gas emissions have decreased even as energy demand increased, largely due to the country's rapid expansion of clean energy sources. China's overall greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 1 percent over the past year, while its energy use and economic activity grew. This shift is a significant development for global climate change efforts, as China is the world's largest single greenhouse gas emitter. The decline in emissions is attributed to increased wind, solar, and nuclear power deployment, and a drop in coal and gas electricity production. However, the article also notes that emissions could rise again if China's economy grows even faster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why politicians prioritize boosting manufacturing in the U.S. economy, questioning whether these jobs are truly special compared to others. It analyzes the "manufacturing premium," the higher wages paid to manufacturing workers, particularly those without a college education. The article cites research indicating that manufacturing jobs offer a 35% pay bump compared to restaurant work, though this varies by subsector. It also discusses factors contributing to the premium, such as unionization, safety risks, and the need for skilled workers to operate expensive machinery. Ultimately, the article suggests that while manufacturing jobs can be valuable, policymakers should also focus on creating good jobs in the service sector.</p>

          <p>A group of British men scaled Mount Everest in record time using xenon gas to aid acclimatization, sparking debate about the ethics of performance enhancement in mountaineering. The Nepalese government is investigating the expedition, citing concerns that the use of gas is "against climbing ethics" and could harm the tourism industry. While some experts believe xenon can help acclimatize people to high altitudes, others argue its benefits are negligible and its side effects are unclear. The incident raises questions about whether scaling Everest should be made easier with the help of performance enhancers.</p>

Experts warn against restarting the plant under current conditions, citing the risk of nuclear disaster and the need to address the plant's status in peace talks.

          <p>This article explores the growing political divide between young men and women, with young men increasingly supporting right-wing parties and politicians. It argues that the shift is rooted in economic changes over the past half-century, particularly the decline of manufacturing and the rise of a two-tiered labor market. Men have lost social trust, adopted zero-sum mindsets, and embraced regressive gender norms. The crisis of masculinity is an opportunity to redefine men's role in an inclusive way of both caretaking and producing, though direct attempts to revive manufacturing are unlikely to succeed.</p>
