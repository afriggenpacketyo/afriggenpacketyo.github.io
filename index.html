          <p>The Trump administration is now seeking to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, to the African nation of Eswatini. This follows a previous mistaken deportation to El Salvador and a threat to send him to Uganda, despite his lawyers arguing he fears persecution. Abrego Garcia remains in ICE custody while fighting criminal charges and seeking asylum in the U.S., with the government contesting his eligibility due to alleged gang affiliations, which he denies. This complex legal battle highlights the administration's persistent efforts to remove him from the country, exploring multiple international destinations.</p>

          <p>Joseph Emerson, the off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot who attempted to cut the engines of a passenger flight in October 2023, has reached a plea agreement in both state and federal court. Emerson, who stated he was suffering from a mental health crisis after taking psychedelic mushrooms, expressed remorse for endangering the more than 80 people on board. He was sentenced to time served and five years probation in the state case, with a federal sentencing scheduled for November. The agreement also includes community service and restitution, and he is barred from being near aircraft.</p>

          <p>S&P Global announced that advertising technology firm AppLovin and stock trading platform Robinhood Markets will be added to the S&P 500 index, effective September 22. The inclusion caused shares of both companies, which went public in 2021, to jump significantly in extended trading. This move is significant as inclusion in a major index often boosts a stock's value due to automatic purchases by index-tracking funds. They will replace MarketAxess Holdings and Caesars Entertainment, whose stock prices have declined this year, reflecting a shift in the composition of the major market index.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order creating a new designation for state sponsors of wrongful detention, enabling the U.S. to impose penalties on countries that illegally hold American citizens. The measure provides tools like sanctions and travel restrictions, similar to those used against state sponsors of terrorism, to deter nations from using detained Americans as political leverage. The move was praised by families of formerly detained individuals, such as Robert Levinson and Paul Whelan, as a crucial step to curb hostage-taking.

          <p>New York Mayor Eric Adams held a press conference to confirm he is staying in the mayoral race, dismissing rumors he would drop out and vowing to defeat Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Running as an independent, Adams also strongly criticized former Governor Andrew Cuomo, another independent candidate, calling him a "snake and a liar." He positioned himself as a "working-class New Yorker" in contrast to his opponents, whom he labeled as "spoiled brats." Adams acknowledged his poor polling numbers but remained defiant, asserting he is the only candidate capable of defeating Mamdani.</p>

The SCO now includes 40 percent of the world's population and has a combined GDP of around $24 trillion, with stronger growth momentum than the G7 nations. With the recent inclusion of Iran and interest from countries like Turkey, the organization is expanding its influence.

          <p>A new study suggests that an age-related "positivity bias," where individuals interpret facial expressions as more positive than they are, may be a sign of cognitive decline rather than a psychological coping mechanism. Researchers found this bias was linked to reduced gray matter in the hippocampus and amygdala, brain regions involved in emotion processing, and was also associated with poorer cognitive performance. This finding distinguishes the bias from symptoms of depression. The study proposes that difficulty in recognizing negative emotions could serve as an early warning sign for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.</p>

          <p>The latest U.S. jobs report has raised alarms among economists, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, far below expectations, and the unemployment rate rising to 4.3%. A key concern is that hiring has stalled or declined in many sectors, with growth heavily reliant on healthcare and social assistance. Excluding the pandemic, this marks the weakest job growth for the first eight months of a year since 2010. Economists attribute the slowdown to uncertainty from the Trump administration's tariffs and now widely expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to stimulate the faltering economy.

The new FTC leadership argues the rule was an overreach of authority, though they maintain that some noncompete agreements can be "pernicious."

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a Hyundai-LG battery factory under construction in Georgia resulted in the detention of 475 people, most of whom are South Korean nationals suspected of working illegally. The operation, described as the largest single-site enforcement action in Homeland Security Investigations' history, was part of a criminal investigation into unlawful employment practices. The South Korean government has expressed "concern and regret" over the raid, urging the U.S. to respect the rights of its citizens. The event occurs amid President Trump's hardline immigration policies and could strain relations between the two allied nations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was unlawful. The decision by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen blocks the administration from revoking the legal protections and work permits for these individuals. The judge found that the Department of Homeland Security Secretary's action was unprecedented and violated the law, citing a "truncated and condensed" decision-making process. The Department of Justice is expected to appeal the ruling, continuing the legal battle over the crucial immigration program.</p>

          <p>A Boy Scout troop from Santa Barbara rescued a 78-year-old man who was lost and without food, water, or shelter in the Emigrant Wilderness. The man, Douglas Montgomery, an experienced hiker and former scoutmaster himself, had lost his backpack containing all his survival gear. The scouts and their leaders found him disoriented and unable to walk properly due to cold exposure. They provided him with food and water and used a satellite device to call for a helicopter rescue, providing a powerful real-world lesson for the troop on the importance of preparedness in the wilderness.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to rebrand the Department of Defense as the Department of War, restoring a name last used in the 1940s. The order states the change is intended to "project strength and resolve" and better reflect the department's mission of "warfighting." The agency will initially use the name as a secondary title while seeking congressional approval for a permanent change, which is expected to be a costly overhaul. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who will be known as the Secretary of War, said the move is about restoring a "warrior ethos" and going on offense.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the progress of the England men's national football team under manager Thomas Tuchel, who took charge at the beginning of the year. Despite his tenure approaching a year, Tuchel has only overseen four matches, making it difficult to fully assess his impact and tactical identity for the team. The analysis notes his preference for physically imposing, ball-dominant play and tactical flexibility, often shifting between 2-3-5 and 3-2-5 formations in possession. While some performance metrics show signs of a more aggressive pressing style, the overall impression is that his team's identity is still developing ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, financial strategists are advising investors to consider defensive measures to protect their recent portfolio gains. The weak August jobs report has increased expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, but it also signals potential trouble for the broader economy. Analysts suggest that investors may be over-concentrated in a few mega-cap technology stocks and should re-evaluate their risk exposure. They recommend broadening portfolios by shifting some capital from recent winners into value and defensive sectors that have been overlooked during the recent market rally.

In a social media post featuring a photo of the three nations' leaders, Trump wrote, "Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China." The comment reflects growing tensions in the U.S.-India relationship, which has been strained by the president's assertive tariff policies. A Chinese embassy spokesperson responded by stating that its relationships are not targeted at third parties and that the world should be a stage for cooperation.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores the Trump administration's ongoing struggle to fill key government positions, leading to a reliance on a small circle of advisors holding multiple, often conflicting, roles. For example, individuals have been nominated for one Senate-confirmed role while continuing to serve in another, raising ethical concerns and creating potential conflicts of interest. This practice of "dual-hatting" has led to short-staffing across the executive branch, impairing the government's ability to fulfill its statutory duties. The article argues this approach creates a worse-informed and less effective, yet simultaneously more powerful, presidency.</p>

After a review, the umpires confiscated the bat to be sent to the league office for further inspection. Trammell, who was confused by the challenge, stated he would never cheat, while Astros manager Joe Espada suggested the bat was simply worn down from regular use.</p>
