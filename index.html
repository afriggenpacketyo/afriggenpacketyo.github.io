            <p>As retirement nears, protecting savings from market volatility is crucial. Experts advise rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance, possibly shifting to a 60/40 stock-bond mix. Building cash reserves equivalent to two years of income is also recommended to avoid selling investments during market downturns, mitigating sequence of returns risk. Considering a bond ladder is another strategy for ensuring a steady income stream while preserving capital. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>This article analyzes the potential outcomes of a trade war between the US and China, arguing that the US is likely to lose due to its dependence on Chinese goods and lack of preparation. It suggests that a Chinese victory would strengthen its geopolitical position, embolden it militarily, and diminish the US's global standing. The article also discusses potential strategies for the US to win, including building a coalition with allies, but notes that the Trump administration's actions have made this unlikely.</p>
