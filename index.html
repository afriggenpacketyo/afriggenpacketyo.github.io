          <p>The Great North Run, one of the world's largest half marathons, saw approximately 60,000 participants race from Newcastle to South Shields. The event drew large crowds and featured elite runners, with Sheila Chepkirui and Alex Mutiso winning the women's and men's races, respectively. The run's founder, Sir Brendan Foster, noted the event's growing popularity and the increasing participation of women and younger runners. Many participants ran in costumes or for charitable causes, contributing to a festive and positive atmosphere.</p>

          <p>London Underground staff have initiated a five-day strike, causing significant disruption with little to no service expected on most lines from Monday to Thursday. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union is demanding a 32-hour work week and protesting over pay and fatigue management. Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay rise but deemed the reduced work week unaffordable. Commuters are advised to expect severe delays and much busier services on the Elizabeth line and Overground.</p>

          <p>The number of arrests at a London protest in support of the recently banned group Palestine Action has risen to 890, according to police. The majority of arrests were made under the Terrorism Act for supporting a proscribed organization. The Metropolitan Police also reported a significant number of arrests after the demonstration reportedly turned violent. The UK government proscribed Palestine Action in July, making any support for the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p>

          <p>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is facing criticism for instructing its broadcast partners to refrain from showing any crowd disruptions or negative reactions to Donald Trump's appearance at the US Open men's final. Critics argue this move is hypocritical, noting the tournament has previously televised other fan disturbances, and call it an un-American act of censorship that shields a politician from public disapproval. The op-ed contends that crowd dissent is a form of democratic expression and that by sanitizing the broadcast, the USTA is sacrificing the event's authentic and unfiltered character.</p>

          <p>Milda Mitkutė, co-founder of the online marketplace Vinted, developed the idea after realizing she had too many clothes while moving to a smaller apartment in 2008. She and co-founder Justas Janauskas launched a simple website that quickly gained popularity, eventually expanding into Germany and becoming the platform known today. The company, now Lithuania's first "unicorn" startup valued at over a billion dollars, overcame early challenges, such as a disastrous attempt to add commission fees. Vinted has since become a major player in the second-hand fashion market, with over 16 million users in the UK alone.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest drone and missile attack of the war, striking multiple locations across Ukraine, including the cabinet building in Kyiv, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukraine's air force reported that Russia launched 810 drones and 13 missiles, with Ukrainian defenses intercepting the majority of them. The attacks resulted in at least eight civilian deaths and 59 injuries nationwide, prompting President Zelenskyy to call for more international military assistance. The assault also triggered a temporary scramble of NATO fighter jets in neighboring Poland as a precautionary measure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of sauropod fossils from Brazil, dating back approximately 80 million years, reveals evidence of a destructive bone disease called osteomyelitis. Researchers analyzed the skeletons of six long-necked dinosaurs and found lesions consistent with the infection, which is caused by bacteria, fungi, or other pathogens. The bones showed no signs of healing, suggesting the infections were active at the time of death and may have been a contributing factor. The findings indicate that the swampy, wet environment these giant dinosaurs inhabited likely provided ideal conditions for such pathogens to thrive and infect multiple individuals.</p>

This move is seen by experts as characteristic of Prince, who has a history of seeking profit from foreign conflicts.

In 2017, Paxton's office raised concerns about a classroom being used by Muslim students for prayer, an action that opponents now highlight as hypocritical.

The article highlights Trump's use of high tariffs, personal dealmaking with corporate leaders, and exerting government control over private companies, such as taking equity stakes in Intel and MP Materials. These actions, combined with pressure on the Federal Reserve and the use of "emergency" powers to enact policy unilaterally, centralize economic decision-making in the presidency. This approach risks creating an economy dependent on political favors rather than consistent rules, mirroring the cronyism that characterized Peronism. (not investment advice)</p>

Demographers suggest that if net immigration falls significantly due to mass deportations and reduced arrivals, it could overcome the small natural increase from births minus deaths. Such a decline would have profound economic consequences, particularly in sectors heavily reliant on immigrant labor like agriculture, construction, and healthcare.

For readings of 140/90 or higher, starting on medication is recommended to protect long-term health.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Considers Using Military Sites to House Asylum Seekers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has stated that the government is exploring the use of military and other non-military sites to accommodate asylum seekers as an alternative to hotels. The Labour government has pledged to end the use of hotels for asylum seekers, where over 32,000 people are currently housed, before the next election. This "all of government effort" aims to address the issue, which has been a source of public protest. Two former military bases are already in use, and new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is expected to announce further proposals soon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's second term is characterized by a chaotic but systematic assault on the traditional U.S. economic model, blending deregulation with direct state intervention. His administration has imposed high tariffs, taken government equity stakes in strategic companies like Intel, pressured the Federal Reserve, and fired heads of labor agencies. This approach is dismantling the "Washington consensus" of free-market capitalism, creating a new model that is hard to categorize and introduces radical uncertainty. While the stock market has remained buoyant, fueled by the AI boom, the long-term consequences of this unpredictable, personality-driven economic policy remain a significant risk.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced he will step down, succumbing to pressure from within his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) following a significant defeat in the July parliamentary election. Ishiba, who had been in office for less than a year, initially resisted calls to resign, citing the need for political stability amidst key national challenges. However, facing a virtual no-confidence vote from his party, he opted to initiate a leadership election to choose his successor. The LDP's next leader will face the challenge of governing without a majority in either house of parliament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices surging to record highs this year, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic and political uncertainty. Financial experts generally recommend gaining exposure to gold through low-cost, liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). This method is considered more efficient than buying physical gold bars or coins, which involve higher transaction and storage costs. Despite the current rally, advisors caution against over-allocation, suggesting that gold should constitute less than 3% of a well-diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

Sinner, the current world number one, has been dominant in the tournament, though he had a minor stomach issue in the semi-finals.

          <p>An advocacy group has reported a massive 760% increase in inquiries from LGBTQ+ Americans looking to relocate to Canada since Donald Trump's re-election. The surge is attributed to a climate of fear created by rising anti-gay rhetoric, anti-trans executive orders, and hundreds of bills targeting LGBTQ+ rights at the state level. The charity Rainbow Railroad, which helps people escape persecution, stated that for the first time, the U.S. became the top country from which it received requests for help. While legal pathways for relocation remain limited, recent Canadian immigration cases have offered a glimmer of hope for those seeking asylum.</p>

          <p>Syrians are enduring a severe cash crunch, with citizens forced to wait in long lines for hours at banks, often to withdraw only a small fraction of their salaries. The country's banking system is in disarray following the civil war, with a shortage of physical currency and strict withdrawal limits crippling the ravaged economy. The situation forces many to rely on informal money changers and has led to widespread public frustration. The new government's attempts to address the liquidity crisis, including a push toward a fledgling e-payment system, have so far failed to provide relief for the general population.</p>

FTD attacks the brain's frontal and temporal lobes, leading to profound changes in personality, behavior, and language, often striking people between the ages of 45 and 60. The narrative highlights the initial misinterpretation of Marc's symptoms as personality flaws before the diagnosis brought clarity, but no cure. Julia has become a full-time caregiver and advocate, seeking to find purpose while facing the slow, heartbreaking loss of her husband.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has struck down the state's Republican-drawn congressional map, ruling that the legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of voters. In 2018, Utah citizens approved a proposition to create an independent redistricting commission, but the GOP-controlled legislature later gutted the commission and passed its own heavily gerrymandered map. The court's decision orders lawmakers to draw a new, fairer map, representing a significant victory for anti-gerrymandering advocates. The ruling is a notable pushback against the trend of state legislatures ignoring voter-led initiatives to pursue partisan advantages in redistricting.</p>
