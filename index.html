          <h2>Trump Accuses Zelensky of Jeopardizing Potential Peace Deal Over Crimea</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 22:29:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump criticized Ukrainian President Zelensky for refusing to recognize Russian control over Crimea, claiming it hinders peace negotiations. Trump suggested a deal to end the war was near but Zelensky's stance prolongs the conflict, hinting the US might accept Russia's annexation of Crimea. This statement aligns with US Vice-President Vance's proposal to freeze territorial lines, requiring both Ukraine and Russia to concede territory. The US administration has yet to publicly state what concessions Ukraine would need to make to achieve peace.</p>

          <p>Trading Standards officers in England have seized over six million illegal vaping products in the past three years, highlighting a widespread illicit trade. These vapes often exceed legal limits for tank size and nicotine strength, posing health risks to consumers, including children. The government is allocating additional funds to combat underage and illicit sales, with a ban on single-use disposable vapes set to begin on June 1st, carrying fines and potential prison sentences for offenders.

          <p>President Trump's approval rating has steadily decreased during his initial months in office, according to a New York Times polling average. His approval rating has fallen to approximately 45%, a decline from 52% a week after assuming office, with disapproval rates now exceeding approval. This trend aligns with the typical pattern of presidential support waning over time; however, Trump's decline appears to be occurring at a slightly faster rate compared to his predecessors. He began his term with one of the lowest approval ratings in modern history.</p>

          <p>South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix reported a 158% surge in quarterly operating profit driven by strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. The company cautioned about macroeconomic uncertainties and US tariff policies potentially impacting demand in the second half of the year. SK Hynix expects continued spending on AI by Big Tech, fueled by open-source AI models and sovereign AI projects, further boosting memory demand.

          <p>A Kyodo News feature explores the treatment of visa overstayers in Japan, who face the stigma of criminality and are often deported. While the law imposes penalties for remaining in Japan past the expiration date of a visa, some question whether it's appropriate to treat these individuals as common criminals. A Buddhist nun who provides shelter to Vietnamese residents argues that some overstay due to unavoidable circumstances and deserve another chance. The U.N. and European Parliament have encouraged the use of more neutral terms like "undocumented" to protect the human rights of foreign workers.</p>

          <p>A fossil discovery in northeastern China has revealed a unique prehistoric food chain, showcasing a dinosaur species that consumed a mammal, which itself may have preyed on dinosaurs. The fossilized remains of Huadanosaurus sinensis, a newly identified theropod dinosaur, contained two small mammals in its stomach cavity. One of the mammals was a gobiconodontid, a group known to include Repenomamus, which previously had fossils showing baby dinosaur bones in their stomachs. This suggests a complex predator-prey dynamic between dinosaurs and mammals 125 million years ago.</p>

          <p>A bill in California aiming to reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels is generating intense debate. The bill, proposed by a former Edison executive, would limit credits to 10 years and end incentives upon the sale of a house. Proponents argue it addresses inequities, while opponents, including environmental groups and the solar industry, contend it undermines long-term contracts and hinders renewable energy adoption. The debate centers on the fairness of the credits and their impact on electricity rates for non-solar customers.</p>

          <p>Water companies in the UK have admitted that self-monitoring of sewage pollution levels is damaging public trust and are proposing a new, third-party monitoring system. This recommendation is part of a submission made to the UK government's independent review into the water sector. Campaigners have long complained that the companies' self-reporting has prevented the true scale of pollution in UK water being revealed. The current environment minister has promised to review the system.</p>
