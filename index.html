            <p>Following a deadly helicopter crash on the Hudson River that claimed the lives of five Spanish tourists and the pilot, New York Helicopter Tours has announced an immediate shutdown of its operations, according to the FAA. The FAA is also launching a review of the tour operator's license and safety record, and will host a helicopter safety panel to discuss risks and mitigation options. Senator Chuck Schumer had called for the company to pause flights during the NTSB investigation, citing concerns about the industry's safety record and potential for 'cutting corners'. The crash, which involved a family from Spain, has renewed scrutiny over the safety of sightseeing helicopter excursions in New York City.</p>

            <p>A plane carrying six people, including family members coming in for a holiday celebration, crashed in an open field near Copake, New York, resulting in the deaths of all aboard. The NTSB is leading the investigation, noting that the aircraft was intact before the crash and descended at a high rate. Air traffic control attempted to contact the pilot after receiving a low altitude alert, but there was no response and no distress call. Among the victims were Karenna Groff, an MIT alumna and NYU medical student, along with her father, Michael Groff, and James Santoro, another MIT alumnus.</p>

            <p>Rory McIlroy dramatically won the Masters after defeating Justin Rose in a sudden-death playoff, finally achieving the career Grand Slam. McIlroy expressed immense relief at overcoming the decade-long 'burden' of needing the Masters to complete his set of majors, a feat only accomplished by five other golfers in history. The victory was secured after a missed 5-foot putt on the final regulation hole, followed by a clutch wedge shot in the playoff. McIlroy revealed that Angel Cabrera, a former Masters champion, had sent him a note of good luck before the final round, adding to the emotional weight of the victory.</p>

            <p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time after the city-state's GDP growth for the first quarter fell below expectations, at 3.8%. The MAS will reduce the rate of appreciation of its policy band, known as the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER). The Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2%, citing declines in manufacturing and some service sectors, as well as the impact of US tariffs and the US-China trade war. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledged that Singapore's growth will be significantly impacted, with a potential risk of recession.</p>

Throughout his career, he evolved from a supporter of the Cuban Revolution to a staunch advocate for economic and personal freedom, often criticizing leftist leaders he viewed as dictators. His remains will be cremated, as per his wishes, with no public ceremony planned.</p>

            <p>A Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Sumy, which resulted in the deaths of 34 people, including two children, and injured 117 others, has been strongly condemned by Ukraine's Western allies. The attack, which involved two ballistic missiles striking the city center, occurred during Palm Sunday celebrations. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the attack as 'horrifying,' while Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, accused Russia of committing a war crime. The attack comes as the US is pursuing negotiations to end the war, now in its fourth year, under President Donald Trump.</p>

            <p>The UK government is urgently working to secure raw materials for British Steel's Scunthorpe plant after rushing through emergency legislation to prevent its Chinese owner, Jingye, from shutting it down. Officials are attempting to obtain coking coal and iron ore to keep the plant's blast furnaces burning, as restarting a furnace after shutdown is costly and complex. The government intervened after talks with Jingye broke down, with the company reportedly losing Â£700,000 a day and rejecting a substantial financial offer. The Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people and is the last site in the UK capable of producing virgin steel, deemed crucial for the country's economic security.</p>

            <p>A CBS News poll indicates that Americans are divided on whether President Trump has a clear trade and tariff policy, with most believing the tariffs are temporary negotiation tactics. A majority anticipate that new tariffs will raise prices, impacting their bottom line and potentially worsening their financial situation. Consequently, Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have declined. However, Republicans are more likely to believe tariffs will lead to more U.S. manufacturing jobs and see the policy as a matter of fairness and patriotism.</p>

Workers express disappointment that the tariffs are imposed by the US, Canada's closest economic ally. The Canadian government is implementing plans to help the auto sector, including creating a fund to boost competitiveness and imposing counter-tariffs on the US.</p>

            <p>A Greenlandic geologist, Minik Rosing, cautions against the notion of a mineral bonanza in Greenland, dismissing it as a mirage. Rosing argues that assumptions about quick riches from untapped resources are based on a lack of knowledge about geology, mining, and minerals. He emphasizes that rare earth elements are neither rare nor unique to Greenland, and there are many places in the world where minerals are easier and cheaper to obtain. Rosing suggests that the focus should be on developing facilities for processing raw materials and fostering a competitive market, rather than acquiring territory.</p>

            <p>A landmark antitrust trial against Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has begun in Washington. The FTC alleges that Meta bought Instagram and WhatsApp to eliminate competition, effectively creating a monopoly. If the FTC wins, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be forced to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp. The trial is expected to run for several weeks, with Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg expected to testify. The case was filed during President Trump's first administration and risks becoming politicized during his second term.</p>
