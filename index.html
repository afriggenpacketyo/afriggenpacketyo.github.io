          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's recent meeting reveal officials are worried that tariffs could reignite inflation, creating a difficult situation for interest rate policy. Participants agreed that uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased, suggesting a cautious approach is necessary until the effects of government policies become clearer. While policymakers acknowledged solid economic growth and a balanced labor market, they recognized growing risks of economic weakness. The FOMC decided to maintain the benchmark federal funds rate, signaling a desire to wait for more clarity before considering further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump responded that the bill's passage required compromises and that it includes beneficial aspects, though he acknowledged some dissatisfaction. Despite Musk's concerns, House Speaker Mike Johnson praised DOGE's work, but many of DOGE's proposed cuts have faced resistance in Congress.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of the Swiss village of Blatten was destroyed after a glacier collapse sent a massive avalanche of mud into the valley. The village's 300 residents had been evacuated days prior due to warnings of the glacier's instability, but one person is reported missing and many homes have been flattened. Mayor Matthias Bellwald vowed to support the community, with the Swiss government promising funding to ensure residents can remain in the locality.

          <p>President Trump's proposal to redirect $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools faces significant obstacles, according to education experts. Federal grants are awarded competitively for specific research purposes, requiring specialized faculty, researchers, and facilities that trade schools typically lack. Experts argue that redirecting funds would be illegal and unrealistic, as the money is designated for scientific research. While trade schools can apply for similar grants, they generally don't meet the criteria for research-based funding, making a direct transfer of Harvard's grants unlikely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Tokyo University of Agriculture reveals that cats use their sense of smell to distinguish their owners from strangers. Researchers analyzed cats' behavior when presented with scent samples from their owners and unfamiliar humans. The cats spent more time smelling samples from strangers and favored their right nostrils, suggesting a different processing of familiar and novel scents. Personality traits also influenced behavior, with more "neurotic" male cats returning to scent tubes repeatedly, while more "agreeable" cats rarely did so, adding another layer to understanding feline-human interactions.</p>

The funding debate coincides with discussions within the Department of Homeland Security about potentially eliminating FEMA, with Secretary Kristi Noem suggesting states should have more control over emergency management.

          <p>Plans for the Joshua Tree Art Museum (JTAM) are under scrutiny due to legal issues surrounding the sponsoring Shane Townley Arts Foundation (STAF). The California attorney general's office issued a cease and desist order to STAF two years ago, halting all charitable activities. Despite this, JTAM has erected a billboard and is running a "community outreach project," while its founders claim to be raising funds for the museum. The foundation's tax returns also raise questions, as they designate STAF as "a church" rather than a public foundation, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the project's viability.</p>

          <p>Porsche is facing significant challenges, including declining sales in China, slumping demand for electric vehicles, and new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. These factors have led the company to scale back its forecast for the year, with profit margin expectations dropping. CEO Oliver Blume described the situation as a "violent storm," as Porsche manufactures its vehicles exclusively in Germany, making it particularly vulnerable to U.S. tariffs. The company is now bringing back models with combustion engines and expanding its offering of plug-in hybrid vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz have offered to relocate over 300 ostriches from a Canadian farm facing a cull due to suspected bird flu, to Dr. Oz's ranch in Florida. Kennedy, now the US health secretary, sent a letter to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to reconsider the kill order. The farm, Universal Ostrich in Edgewood, BC, was ordered to kill all its birds after testing positive for H5N1. (no optimism score)</p>

          <p>The judge in Sean Combs' federal trial denied a defense request for a mistrial after lawyers argued that prosecutors unfairly suggested that Combs was responsible for the destruction of fingerprint evidence. The request followed testimony from an arson inspector about a car fire at Kid Cudi's home. Police and fire officials testified about a trespassing and car fire at the Los Angeles home of Mr. Mescudi, who last week described being the focus of the music mogulâ€™s jealous rage.

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a unique object in the Milky Way galaxy emitting X-rays and radio waves in a repeating cycle. The object, located 15,000 light-years away, emits these signals every 44 minutes. The object could be a highly magnetized dead star or something entirely new, said Wang, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature. The hyperactive phase of this object â€” designated ASKAP J1832âˆ’091 â€” appeared to last about a month.</p>
