          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing discussions on tariff issues with the goal of reaching an agreement by mid-June, according to Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa. Despite failing to find common ground on tariffs so far, Akazawa believes that progress has been made during talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington. Japan is advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, while the U.S. seeks greater access to the Japanese market for American automakers and agricultural products; both sides aim for a mutually beneficial outcome. The leaders of both countries are expected to meet around the time of the Group of Seven summit in Canada to discuss the trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered coal and gas plants to remain operational, despite the fact that grid operators have not requested them to stay open.

The order highlights the ongoing debate between traditional energy sources and the transition to cleaner alternatives, with potential economic implications for both producers and consumers.

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is planning to overhaul Japan's rice policy in response to escalating public concerns over soaring rice prices and an upcoming national election. Rice prices have roughly doubled from the previous year, prompting Ishiba to target the country's long-standing production adjustment system, which has been in place for decades. The aim is to counter opposition parties advocating for a consumption tax cut and to boost rice production, although challenges remain, such as the risk of a price plunge due to oversupply. Critics have warned against using rice policy as a political tool, citing potential market turmoil and confusion among consumers.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly suggested the possibility of creating a new political party, potentially escalating his conflict with President Trump. Musk posted a poll on X, asking his followers if they believe it's time to establish a new political party in America representing the middle ground. He later endorsed the name "America Party," reminiscent of his America PAC, which supported Trump and other Republican candidates in 2024. This move could signal Musk's intention to remain involved in politics and challenge Trump's influence, though he has also entertained the idea of reforming existing parties.</p>

          <p>The government is struggling to reduce the amount of foreign aid it spends on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, with the Home Office planning to spend ¬£2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. This is only marginally less than the ¬£2.3bn spent in the previous year. The money is largely used to cover accommodation costs for asylum seekers, and the Home Office claims it is committed to ending asylum hotels to save taxpayers' money. However, critics argue the Home Office has no incentive to reduce ODA spending, leading to cuts in support for humanitarian and development priorities across the world.</p>
