          <p>A 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan, causing the death toll to rise to over 1,411 people, with another 3,124 injured. The quake, which occurred late Sunday, destroyed approximately 8,000 houses, primarily in Kunar Province, leaving thousands affected. Rescue operations are ongoing, complicated by the remote terrain, as emergency responders work to reach villages where more victims are feared to be trapped under rubble. The region is seismically active, having experienced several other deadly earthquakes in recent years.</p>

          <p>The technology company PlusAI has released performance results indicating significant progress toward its goal of launching factory-built autonomous trucks by 2027. The company reports reaching 86% safety case readiness and 98% autonomous miles, with plans to begin fleet trials later this year, initially focusing on the Texas Triangle freight corridor. This advancement in self-driving technology aims to address major challenges in the trucking industry, such as driver shortages, rising costs, and safety concerns. PlusAI is collaborating with major manufacturers to integrate its systems directly at the factory, which could accelerate mass production.</p>

The Tbilisi City Court heard that negotiations are underway between the defense and prosecution for a plea bargain involving a large financial payment. Culley, who faces up to 20 years or life in prison, was arrested in May at Tbilisi International Airport with 12kg of marijuana and 2kg of hashish. She has pleaded not guilty, claiming she was coerced through torture.</p>

          <p>A devastating landslide has destroyed the village of Tarseen in Sudan's Darfur region, with local groups reporting as many as 1,000 fatalities. Many of the victims were displaced individuals who had fled the country's ongoing civil war and were already facing starvation. The landslide occurred in the mountainous Jebel Marra area, a region that has become a refuge for thousands escaping intense fighting and famine. This tragedy exacerbates the world's largest humanitarian crisis, where aid delivery is severely hampered by the conflict and both warring factions are accused of obstructing assistance.</p>

Senior District Judge Charles R.

The judge warned that such actions could lead to the creation of "a national police force with the President as its chief."

          <p>Texas has enacted a new congressional map designed to favor Republicans, prompting a counter-effort in California where Democrats are pushing their own redistricting plan to gain seats. This unusual mid-decade redistricting was initiated by a Republican push to solidify their narrow House majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The new Texas map is already facing legal challenges alleging racial bias, while California's proposed map must be approved by voters in a November ballot measure. These moves in the nation's two most populous states highlight the intense political maneuvering to secure electoral advantages through gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>The interest rate on 30-year UK government bonds has surged to its highest level since 1998, increasing the cost for the government to borrow money and adding fiscal pressure on the Chancellor. This rise in bond yields reflects growing investor concern about the state of the UK's public finances and expectations of potential tax increases in the upcoming Budget. The increase is part of a global trend driven by geopolitical tensions and US trade policies, but it presents specific challenges for the UK government's spending plans. The pound also fell against the dollar, signaling broader market anxiety. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates soon, financial experts are advising savers to lock in current certificate of deposit (CD) rates before they decline. Although rates have likely peaked, they remain historically high, presenting a window of opportunity for maximizing returns. Experts suggest strategies such as CD laddering—staggering maturity dates to maintain flexibility—and considering no-penalty CDs, which allow for early withdrawal without a fee. They also caution against locking up too much cash in long-term CDs and stress the importance of shopping around for the best available rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial planners are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to potentially pay 0% on long-term capital gains, thanks to new deductions in President Trump's latest tax legislation. The 0% bracket applies to investors with taxable income below certain thresholds, which have effectively been raised for 2025. This allows for "tax-gain harvesting," where profitable assets held for over a year can be sold without triggering taxes, which is useful for rebalancing portfolios or resetting an asset's cost basis for future tax savings. More investors may now qualify for this benefit. (not investment advice)</p>

Constellation now expects its net beer sales to fall by 2% to 4%, a sharp reversal from its previous guidance of flat to 3% growth.
