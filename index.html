          <p>President Trump marked his 100th day in office with a rally in Michigan, celebrating his achievements and attacking political rivals. He highlighted a decrease in illegal border crossings and touted economic progress, while also criticizing his predecessor, Joe Biden, and the Federal Reserve chair. Trump insisted that negative polls were "fake" and promised further "profound change," though some of his claims, such as an 87% decline in egg prices, were factually inaccurate. The article notes the Democratic National Committee's counter-assessment of Trump's first 100 days as a "colossal failure."</p>

          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation held steady at 2.4%, a four-year low, slightly above Reuters' expectations. This is a significant drop from the 7.8% peak in December 2022, allowing the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut rates. The RBA anticipates continued economic growth and a strong labor market in 2025, although global uncertainties remain.

          <p>Gilead Sciences has agreed to pay $202 million to settle claims that it provided kickbacks to doctors to encourage them to prescribe its HIV drugs. The U.S. Attorney's Office alleges that Gilead used speaker programs to funnel money to doctors through honoraria, meals, and travel expenses from 2011 to 2017, violating the Anti-Kickback Statute. The settlement stems from a civil lawsuit filed by a physician, Dr. Paul Bellman, and aims to resolve allegations of false claims submitted to federal healthcare programs. Gilead stated that it entered the agreement to avoid litigation costs and defended its speaker programs as educational for healthcare professionals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed nearly 400 scientists involved in writing the National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report summarizing climate change impacts in the U.S. This move raises concerns about the report's future objectivity and scientific rigor, as the administration plans to "reevaluate" the assessment's scope. Critics argue that this decision aligns with Project 2025's goal to reshape the report and include "diverse viewpoints" on climate change, potentially undermining its scientific integrity. Some scientists fear the administration will appoint authors who represent alternative viewpoints on climate change.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity has contracted sharply in April, falling to a near two-year low as the trade war with the U.S. escalates. The official purchasing managers' index dropped below the 50-level threshold, indicating contraction, as tariffs imposed by the Trump administration take effect. Trade flows between the two countries have been severely disrupted, with a notable decline in cargo-carrying container ships departing from China to the U.S. This contraction follows a period of accelerated manufacturing growth in March as exporters tried to front-load shipments before the tariffs hit.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated criminal prosecutions against migrants for entering a newly established military buffer zone along the Mexico border. At least 28 migrants were charged in federal court in New Mexico for crossing into the militarized zone patrolled by active-duty U.S. troops. Civil liberties groups have expressed concerns about the militarization of border communities and the erosion of constitutional principles. The buffer zone was created by transferring federal land to the U.S. Army, allowing the Trump administration to use troops to arrest migrants.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders modifying tariffs for carmakers, aiming to reduce the impact on U.S. manufacturing by alleviating production costs and profit squeezes. While a 25% tariff on auto imports remains, carmakers paying this tariff will not be subject to other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum, or certain imports from Canada and Mexico. Carmakers can also qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of imported component costs, phased out over two years.

          <h2>Newsom Supports Felony Charge for Soliciting Older Minors for Sex</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly supported legislation to increase the punishment for soliciting a 16- or 17-year-old for sex to a felony, a move that contrasts with some members of his own party. Democrats in the state Assembly had initially weakened the bill, prompting criticism from Republicans. Newsom's stance aligns with his previous support for increasing penalties for sexual offenses against minors. The bill seeks to criminalize loitering with intent to buy sex and build on existing state law.</p>

          <p>Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are sharply declining due to high tariffs, leading to warnings of impending supply shortages. U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand as high as 145%, causing major retailers to express concerns. Retailers have likely stockpiled inventory, but consumers may face out-of-stock situations by summer. Economists predict potential "COVID-like shortages" for consumers and firms using Chinese products. Walmart and Target have cautioned President Trump about potential gaps on store shelves.</p>
