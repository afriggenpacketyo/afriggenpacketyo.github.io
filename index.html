          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees following a lawsuit filed by 21 states. The judge's preliminary injunction emphasized the department's need to fulfill its functions and obligations as mandated by Congress. The Trump administration's reduction in force, announced on March 11, would have significantly reduced the agency's staff. The lawsuit was filed after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling the Education Department, with additional parties, including the American Federation of Teachers, also suing to save the agency.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and a pro-crypto agenda from the Trump administration. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt have further fueled the rally. Bitcoin ETFs have seen steady inflows, and the number of bitcoins held by public companies has significantly increased.

          <p>A White House report, the product of a presidential commission led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., identifies ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lack of physical activity, stress, and excessive prescription drug use as drivers of chronic disease in American children. The report criticizes the overmedicalization of children and the influence of the pharmaceutical industry. It calls for more research into the causes of chronic diseases and prevention strategies, including long-term studies comparing whole foods to ultraprocessed foods. The report diverges from standard government thinking, focusing less on smoking and alcohol and more on environmental factors and the food system.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season, with a range of 13 to 19 named storms expected between June 1 and November 30. This forecast indicates a 60% chance of an above-normal season, a 30% chance of a near-normal season, and only a 10% chance of a below-normal season. Forecasters anticipate that six to ten of these storms will strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes. The neutral condition of the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation cycle is a significant factor influencing this prediction.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 deadlock, upheld a lower court's decision to invalidate a contract establishing the nation's first religious charter school in Oklahoma. Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate in the case. The tie leaves in place the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling that the St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School violated the state's requirement for charter schools to be nonsectarian. This case tested the separation of church and state and could have opened the door for public funds to flow directly to religious schools, however, the issue is likely to return to the Supreme Court with all nine justices.</p>

          <p>In times of frustration and cynicism, seeking moral beauty can be a source of happiness and inspiration, as demonstrated by stories like Maximilian Kolbe's self-sacrifice. Witnessing acts of kindness, compassion, and courage elicits moral elevation, stimulating specific areas of the brain and fostering a desire to be better. To cultivate moral beauty, one should surround themselves with generous individuals, dedicate leisure time to serving others, and practice gratitude. While true crime may be entertaining, focusing on moral ugliness can negate the positive effects of moral beauty, leading to depression instead of elevation.</p>

          <p>Most doctors and teachers in England will receive a 4% pay rise after the government accepted recommendations from pay review bodies. The awards are higher than the 2.8% previously budgeted, requiring ministers to find additional funding from existing budgets. While education unions have welcomed the decision, they warn of potential budget cuts for schools. Health unions have expressed anger over a smaller 3.6% rise for NHS staff other than doctors. The British Medical Association plans to ballot resident doctors over possible strike action due to the perceived inadequacy of the pay rise.</p>

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a sharp decline after House Republicans passed a tax bill terminating key clean energy credits. The legislation ends tax credits for residential solar installers like Sunrun that lease equipment to customers, impacting a significant portion of the rooftop solar industry. Analysts described the bill as "worse than feared" for clean energy, potentially undermining the Inflation Reduction Act. While the bill leaves the manufacturing tax credit relatively unscathed, the overall impact is expected to reduce demand for rooftop solar and negatively affect companies like Enphase and SolarEdge.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury has ordered its last batch of penny "blanks," signaling an end to penny production due to rising costs.

There are currently 114 billion pennies in circulation, with an annual production cost of $192 million. The decision aligns with President Trump's efforts to reduce wasteful government spending.</p>

The Trump administration supports the move, following similar actions by Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

The decline, driven by fewer people arriving to work and study, follows changes introduced by the previous Conservative government.

This has damaged Netanyahu's reputation as a geopolitical genius and the protector of Israel. By revealing Netanyahu to be a bit player, rather than an elite operator, Trump has not just put the Israeli leader in his place. He has exploded Netanyahuâ€™s carefully cultivated political personaâ€”an act as damaging to Netanyahuâ€™s standing as the Hamas attack on October 7.</p>
