          <h2>Trump Proposes 100% Tariffs on Non-US Films, Citing National Security</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 05:34:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the United States, claiming that the American film industry is rapidly declining and that foreign countries are incentivizing filmmakers to leave Hollywood, which he deems a 'National Security threat.' The announcement has sparked confusion and concern within the film industry, with questions arising about the scope of the tariffs and their potential impact on American production companies filming abroad, as well as on streaming services. Industry unions warn that the tariffs could devastate the sector's recovery from the pandemic, while governments of Australia and New Zealand have voiced their support for their respective film industries. Trump appointed Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone as special ambassadors to promote business opportunities in Hollywood, which he described as a 'great but very troubled place'.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas in Gaza, which reportedly includes capturing Gaza and holding the territory, as well as a plan to resume deliveries and distribution of humanitarian aid through private companies. The military has called up tens of thousands of reservists, aiming to increase pressure on Hamas to release hostages and defeat the organization. The plan's first stage reportedly involves seizing additional areas of Gaza and expanding the buffer zone along the borders with Israel and Egypt. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum criticized the plan, stating it prioritizes territories over the hostages, and the UN and other aid agencies have expressed concern that the proposal would breach basic humanitarian principles.</p>

This achievement marks a turnaround from previous struggles on clay, including a first-round exit at the French Open last year. Analysts attribute Draper's improved performance to his physical conditioning and greater belief in his body after enduring a series of grueling matches at the Australian Open.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that learning new languages physically alters the brain and enhances cognitive abilities, such as memory and problem-solving skills. Neuroscientists have found that neural pathways reshape as individuals learn a new language, improving communication between brain regions involved in attention, memory, and cognitive control. Studies show that learning languages at a young age is particularly advantageous due to the brain's greater adaptability during development. While it's debated whether multilingualism equates to higher intelligence, it undeniably expands verbal repertoire and offers diverse cultural experiences.</p>

He points out that Trump's actions, such as using emergency powers and disregarding statutory restrictions, build on precedents set by Nixon, Bush, Obama, and Biden. Goldsmith calls for reforms to limit presidential power, including judicial review, congressional action, and potentially even a constitutional amendment.

          <p>Scientists have developed a potentially universal antivenom using antibodies extracted from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who intentionally exposed himself to bites from multiple species of deadly snakes over many years. Friede's self-immunization process resulted in him becoming 'hyper-immune' to snake neurotoxins, enabling researchers to isolate antibodies effective against 19 of the world's deadliest snakes. The new antivenom has shown promise in mouse trials and could potentially be formulated for intramuscular delivery, making it more accessible in rural settings. The researchers plan to expand trials to treat dogs and develop another antivenom for viper bites.</p>

Dr. Kiran Rabheru, a geriatric psychiatrist, recounts his fight against the World Health Organization's attempt to designate 'old age' as a disease, arguing it would perpetuate ageism. The conversation explores the cultural conflation of aging and disease, the importance of challenging ageism, and the concept of 'healthspan,' focusing on extending the period of healthy living rather than simply prolonging lifespan. The podcast concludes with practical advice for promoting well-being at any age, including smiling, physical activity, and socialization.</p>

          <p>Kosmos 482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of reaching Venus, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere after an engine malfunction left it stranded in low Earth orbit for decades. While some parts of the spacecraft likely landed in New Zealand shortly after launch, the lander probe has remained in orbit. Experts predict that the lander, designed to withstand Venus's harsh atmosphere, may survive reentry largely undamaged, posing a small risk of impact on land or water across a large swath of the globe.</p>

          <p>President Trump confirmed that he had discussed with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum the possibility of sending U.S. troops into Mexico to combat drug cartels, an offer that Sheinbaum rejected. Trump stated that he made the proposal due to the cartels' violence and drug trafficking, but Sheinbaum reiterated Mexico's stance of collaboration within each country's own territory. Trump also commented on Sheinbaum's fear of the cartels, while acknowledging a better working relationship with her compared to Canadian leaders, despite strained relations with both countries over trade and immigration.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist candidate skeptical of the EU and against military support for Ukraine, won the first round of the Romanian presidential election rerun. Simion's victory reflects a shift in Romanian politics, with many voters from a previously annulled election switching their support to him. Simion's stance on Ukraine and the EU has raised concerns in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow, given Romania's strategic importance as a transit route for weapons to Ukraine. The Trump administration is reassessing its commitment to Romania.</p>
