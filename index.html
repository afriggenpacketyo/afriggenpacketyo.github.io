            <p>A Russian ballistic missile struck the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy on Palm Sunday, resulting in at least 21 deaths and numerous injuries, according to local officials. The strike targeted residential buildings and educational institutions, causing widespread damage and prompting a rescue operation.

            <p>Donald Trump is increasingly weaving his personal faith into his political persona, particularly after surviving an assassination attempt last year, asserting that God saved him to "make America great again." He often references his Presbyterian upbringing and emphasizes the importance of religion for the nation's soul, decrying what he sees as America's spiritual decline. Trump advocates for religious liberty as a cornerstone of his leadership and links America's founding ideals directly to faith, viewing his presidency as fulfilling a divine mission. He maintains a close relationship with evangelical Christian voters, believing his faith guides him.</p>

            <p>Attacks on Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps in Sudan's Darfur region, housing over 700,000 displaced people facing famine, have resulted in the deaths of more than 100 civilians, including children and aid workers. Relief International reported that nine of its workers, including doctors, were killed in the attack on Zamzam camp, which they allege was a targeted assault on health infrastructure by the RSF. Residents describe the situation as catastrophic, with ongoing shelling and closed routes, and the RSF denies responsibility, claiming the reports are fabricated. The conflict between the army and the RSF has created a humanitarian crisis, displacing millions and pushing communities into starvation.</p>

            <p>Sarah Palin's defamation case against The New York Times is set for a retrial after an appeals court found that the initial judge had erred in dismissing the case even as jurors deliberated. The case stems from a 2017 Times editorial that Palin argued falsely linked her to a mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona. The retrial will revisit First Amendment protections for the press and whether Palin can prove the Times acted with actual malice. This comes amid a changing media landscape with other high-profile defamation settlements.</p>

            <p>Stewart Lee uses Sam Peckinpah's film 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid' to reflect on the current political landscape, drawing parallels between the film's themes of American freedoms under attack from big business and the Trump administration's policies. He suggests that Billy the Kid represents those standing up to avaricious authoritarians, while Pat Garrett embodies those who bend the knee to tyranny for survival. Lee laments the transactional nature of modern politics, where ideals and ethics have been replaced by naked self-interest, and expresses concern that his stand-up show, once pessimistic, now seems prescient in the face of current events.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, requiring proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration, is raising concerns about potential disenfranchisement of married women. Since many women change their last names upon marriage, their birth certificates may no longer match their current legal names. Legal experts suggest states could accept secondary documents like marriage certificates, but obtaining these could pose challenges for some women. Concerns also exist about varying policies across states, potentially leading to uneven enforcement and disproportionate impact on married women's voting rights.</p>

            <p>Gaza is facing a humanitarian catastrophe, described as a "killing field" where Palestinians are being starved and killed, according to Arwa Mahdawi. Despite a litany of genocide experts and international organizations concluding that Israel is committing genocide, politicians continue to fund the conflict. Israel's actions, including cutting off supplies and using water as a weapon, have created a desperate situation where disease and starvation are becoming the primary killers. The article argues that the world must recognize the severity of the situation and take action to stop the annihilation of Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

            <p>A former co-worker of Rex Heuermann, the suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer, recalls an unnerving incident where he tracked her down on a cruise. She worked at Heuermann's company and received a sweater as a gift from him, now wondering if his wife's absence that summer gave him an opportunity to kill Maureen Brainard-Barnes. While she says she saw nothing alarming about Heuermann, she does remember a time when his tracking skills unnerved her. She also remembered a gift he gave her in the summer of 2007, this being a sweater that he asked his wife to bring back from a trip to Iceland.</p>

            <p>The "48 Hours" episode delves into the 1987 murder of Selonia Reed, where her six-year-old son, Reggie, may have been used as an alibi by his father. Retired police officer Charles Muse discovered Selonia's body in her car, and Lt. Barry Ward reopened the case years later. A newly hired prosecutor, Taylor Anthony, was assigned the case and with new evidence, the cigarette butt found in Selonia Reed's car was sent for DNA testing. Now an adult, Reggie Reed Jr. struggles with the possibility that his father was involved in his mother's death.</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists have developed an innovative solution for tackling toxic oil spills by turning moss into an oil-absorbing material. The treated sphagnum moss repels water and can efficiently soak up oil, offering a cost-effective and environmentally friendly cleanup method. This bio-based absorbent outperforms conventional materials with its high absorption capacity and reusability. The development addresses the urgent need for effective oil spill cleanup methods, which can take months or years and cause significant environmental damage.</p>

            <p>President Trump's changing tariff policies are causing panic buying and paralysis among US consumers, with households facing potentially significant price increases and possible shortages. Some consumers are attempting to stock up on goods, while others feel overwhelmed by the rapid changes and hope for policy reversals. The tariffs, including those on imports from China, are expected to lead to higher prices for clothing, electronics, and other essentials. Economists predict that the measures could lead to weaker consumer spending and a slowdown in economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Bosses are increasingly implementing surveillance technology to monitor employees, ditching previously held values in pursuit of competition and efficiency. This shift from pseudo-benevolence to a grim austerity in the workplace has created a mask-off moment, expecting total loyalty from employees while offering little in return. However, young workers are rejecting work that looks gruelling, prioritizing work-life balance and seeking companies with secure contracts and ample benefits. This generational friction may lead to less-productive and unhappy employees, ultimately undermining the effectiveness of hypervigilance.</p>

            <p>PGA Tour Enterprises is considering a bid to take part ownership of the United States element of the Ryder Cup, a move that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. This comes as the unification deal between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund remains stalled. The PGA Tour's commissioner, Jay Monahan, stated they are looking at opportunities to enhance the PGA Tour for fans and strengthen tournaments. Meanwhile, Tyrrell Hatton's prominence at Augusta National is pertinent with this year's Ryder Cup in mind, while Justin Rose could take on a vice-captaincy role.</p>

            <p>Heels are making a comeback in fashion, with their meaning, pain, and politics moving and merging in response to political unrest. While some embrace heels as a marker of retrogressive femininity, others wear them in a performance of protest. With a renewed interest in moneyed glamour, heels are now worn as a reminder of having a body, a constant reminder of remaining in slight discomfort. This is also a reminder to sit up, to think about how to get to where one is going, and to pay attention.</p>

            <p>Scientists at King's College London have successfully grown a human tooth under laboratory conditions, marking a significant breakthrough in regenerative dentistry. The team introduced a special material that enables cells to communicate with each other, mimicking the environment of growing teeth. This allows scientists to recreate the process of tooth development in the lab, with the potential to replace missing teeth with biologically compatible solutions. While still years away from clinical application, this research could revolutionize dental care and offer a more durable alternative to implants.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is supporting a recall campaign aimed at unseating opposition lawmakers in an effort to regain control of the legislature. The DPP accuses the opposition of paralyzing the constitutional court, altering budgets, and pushing through bills that threaten the island's security. Analysts warn that the campaign could deepen partisan divisions and political instability, particularly amid heightened pressure from Beijing. The DPP needs to unseat and replace at least six district-based KMT legislators to reclaim a working majority.</p>
