            <p>President Trump defended his existing tariffs on trading partners, acknowledging potential transition costs but expressing confidence in a positive outcome. The White House increased tariffs on Chinese exports to 145% following Beijing's retaliation. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson accused the U.S. of using tariffs for selfish gains. These actions signal continued trade tensions and potential economic repercussions as negotiations remain uncertain, impacting global markets and business strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump privately acknowledged that his tariff policies could lead to a recession but wanted to avoid a depression, according to the Wall Street Journal. Trump was willing to accept "pain" from the policy, while the White House cited commitments from trading partners as a reason for altering course. The bond market decline and investor concerns contributed to Trump's decision to roll back some tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett played roles in advising on the policy shift. (not investment advice)</p>

While federal inflation data doesn't yet show much tariff impact, economists anticipate noticeably higher prices for food and physical goods by May.
