          <p>Denise Moss, a 54-year-old mother, sought help for her sons' concentration issues in school, leading to their ADHD diagnoses. During a presentation on ADHD in women, Moss recognized similar challenges in herself, prompting her to seek her own diagnosis. Many adults discover their ADHD when their children are diagnosed, as it is highly genetic and manifests differently in adults, often mistaken for anxiety or depression. Moss, now diagnosed and medicated, has transformed her parenting and created a structured home environment for her children, feeling more manageable and excited about the future, including a family vacation to Italy.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. and Israel-backed aid group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has begun operating in Gaza despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organizations. The GHF reports distributing thousands of food boxes but faced security challenges, including incidents of crowds overwhelming distribution sites and Hamas allegedly blocking access. The UN has criticized the GHF's efforts as a distraction from the need to reopen crossings and lift Israeli restrictions on aid, while Hamas has warned Palestinians against cooperating with the new system. The GHF's operations began shortly after its executive director resigned, citing a lack of operational independence.</p>

The victims, identified as four men and one woman, were found alongside knives, machetes, and shovels. Guanajuato, a thriving industrial hub, is also Mexico's deadliest state due to conflicts between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the Jalisco New Generation cartel.

          <p>Former President Trump announced he is pardoning Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff convicted of accepting bribes in exchange for making businessmen sworn law enforcement officers. Jenkins was found guilty on fraud and bribery charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison, but Trump claims he is a victim of a politically motivated prosecution. Federal prosecutors stated that Jenkins accepted $75,000 in bribes for badges and auxiliary deputy status without proper training or vetting. Jenkins, a longtime Trump supporter, maintains his innocence, but the pardon marks another instance of Trump granting clemency to allies.</p>

Clark recounted being forced to take lie detector tests, accompanying Combs to confront Kid Cudi, and witnessing Combs beat his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. The defense questioned Clark's motives, highlighting messages where she sought to reconcile with Combs. Combs faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted on sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, while his lawyers argue his actions were a private matter and not criminal in nature.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States between 2016 and 2023. Only about a quarter of mothers reported having "excellent" mental health, down from 38.4% in 2016, while reports of "good" and "fair/poor" mental health increased. The declines occurred across all socioeconomic subgroups, with single female parents, those with lower education, and those with publicly insured children experiencing significantly lower mental and physical health. The study suggests these findings align with documented increases in depression and anxiety among pregnant and reproductive-aged women, highlighting the need for greater access to mental health care and support for mothers.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the removal of the CDC's recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination for healthy children and pregnant women, a decision not yet reflected in the agency's official immunization schedule. This move bypasses the usual advisory process and could affect insurance coverage and access to vaccines through federal programs. Experts warn that this change could limit access to COVID-19 shots for children and pregnant women, potentially increasing out-of-pocket costs. The decision contradicts the FDA's stance on the continued eligibility of pregnant women for COVID-19 vaccine approvals, raising concerns among health experts about the increased risk of severe disease for pregnant individuals and the lack of protection for newborns.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Canada could join the proposed U.S. missile defense shield, the Golden Dome System, without cost if it becomes the 51st state. Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to annex Canada since returning to the White House. He said that remaining independent would cost Canada $61 billion to join the missile system. The Canadian Prime Minister has dismissed the idea of losing its sovereignty or independence, while Trump's annexation proposals have angered many Canadians.</p>

Senator Elizabeth Warren warns that privatizing the firms could disrupt the mortgage market and increase housing prices, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasizes the importance of maintaining low mortgage rates.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the Colorado River basin has lost 27.8 million acre-feet of groundwater in the past 20 years, nearly equivalent to the full capacity of Lake Mead. The research, based on NASA satellite imagery, underscores the severity of the ongoing water crisis in the region, with groundwater disappearing 2.4 times faster than surface water. Overpumping for agriculture, particularly for large-scale industrial farming, is the primary cause of groundwater losses. The researchers advocate for better management of groundwater supplies, as the climate crisis is expected to exacerbate the region's water shortages.</p>
