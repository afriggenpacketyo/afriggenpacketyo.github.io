          <p>Shubman Gill, a 25-year-old top-order batter, has been named the new Test captain for the India men's cricket team, succeeding Rohit Sharma. Gill, with 1,893 runs in 32 Tests, will lead a somewhat inexperienced team in a five-Test tour of England starting on June 20. Mohammed Shami was excluded due to a late injury, while Rishabh Pant will serve as Gill's deputy in the Test squad.

          <p>Royal Mail is under investigation by Ofcom after failing to meet its delivery targets, with almost a quarter of first-class post arriving late. The company, already fined Â£16m in previous years, cited ongoing modernization efforts and the need for universal service obligation reform, as first-class stamp prices continue to rise. Citizens Advice criticized Royal Mail for hiking stamp prices despite unreliable service, while shareholders approved the sale of Royal Mail's parent company to a Czech billionaire. The company maintains that it will continue to improve service to meet customer expectations.</p>

Conservative estimates suggest that over 500,000 of these voters supported Dan, contributing substantially to his victory against the hard-right candidate George Simion. Viktor Orban's backing of the anti-Hungarian Simion proved ineffective as ethnic Hungarians prioritized the preservation of liberal democracy.

          <p>Prince Harry's legal battle against the UK government's decision to reduce his police protection has concluded with his appeal being denied. The courts determined that Harry misunderstood the workings of the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (Ravec) and that his decision to step back from royal duties justified the changes in his security arrangements. The case centered on Harry's belief that Ravec unfairly treated him and failed to adequately consider the risks he faces due to his birthright. Despite his disappointment, Harry has seemingly exhausted his legal options, expressing concerns about bringing his family back to the UK under the current security conditions.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex-trafficking trial has featured testimonies from Cassie Ventura, male escorts, and former Homeland Security Investigations agents, as the prosecution aims to prove Diddy led a criminal enterprise that sexually exploited women. While some experts believe the prosecution has corroborated Ventura's testimony and established elements of sex trafficking and racketeering, others argue that the defense is effectively using the prosecution's witnesses to support their theory that the charges are unsubstantiated. Testimony revealed instances of violence, control, and alleged coercion, but the defense argues that these do not necessarily equate to a criminal enterprise. (not investment advice)</p>

Unite, representing the workers, insists that the actions of its members on the picket line are legitimate. The dispute centers on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers, with the union blaming government-appointed commissioners for the lack of progress.</p>

Symptoms of PMDD, which include severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts, can be debilitating, with an average wait time for diagnosis of around 12 years. While the Welsh government has pledged to improve diagnosis and treatment, more research is needed to provide women with additional options beyond contraception and antidepressants, which may also need to be discontinued during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence tools to navigate the complexities of global trade under President Donald Trump's tariff policies. AI is being deployed to visualize global supply chains, understand how they're affected by tariffs, and make faster decisions on adjustments. Tech firms say that AI systems are enabling them to take decisions on adjustments to their global supply chains much faster. These technologies are allowing companies to quickly assess the impact of tariffs and simulate alternative sourcing strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite Israel allowing a limited number of aid trucks into Gaza, aid agencies warn of an impending famine due to severe restrictions and logistical challenges.

Supplies are stuck at distribution points due to security clearance issues, looting, and damaged infrastructure. The article highlights the dire situation, with the UN estimating that at least 500 trucks are needed daily to avert a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

          <p>Military air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter near the Pentagon, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at a Washington airport. The incident occurred on May 1 and was attributed to a temporary antenna's location. While the Army stated there was no risk to air traffic, the aborted landings added to unease about close calls between government helicopters and commercial airplanes. The NTSB is investigating the incident.</p>
