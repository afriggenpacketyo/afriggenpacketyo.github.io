          <p>Tennessee Representative Tim Burchett is strongly advocating for the Department of Justice to release its evidence files related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. While pushing for transparency, Burchett emphasized the need to protect the identities of victims and any innocent individuals who might be named in the documents. He also dismissed former President Trump's recent claims that the files are a "hoax," stating that while he was annoyed by the comments, he remains committed to pursuing the release of the information.</p>

          <h2>Exit Polls Indicate Japan's Ruling Coalition May Lose Majority in Key Election</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 09:18:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant election in Japan, exit polls suggest that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition is poised to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. This outcome would place the prime minister under considerable political pressure, potentially leading to his resignation. The election was held amidst widespread public frustration over rising consumer prices, a cost-of-living crisis, and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. A loss of majority would severely weaken the coalition's ability to govern and could destabilize Japanese politics.</p>

          <p>New research highlighted by author Olga Khazan suggests that personality traits, once thought to be fixed, can be consciously redesigned. Khazan, who documented her own journey of change in her book "Me, But Better," sought to overcome anxiety and neuroticism through deliberate actions like improv classes and journaling. University of Kentucky professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala supports this, explaining that intentionally altering thoughts and behaviors over time can lead to fundamental shifts in personality, offering a new approach to mental health and personal development.</p>

          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the events company Create & Cultivate, identifies a major red flag in job interviews as a candidate who arrives unprepared and lacks knowledge about the company. She values candidates who have done their research and can offer thoughtful feedback on the business's current operations. Conversely, Johnson is most impressed by applicants who can openly discuss their past mistakes and demonstrate problem-solving skills, particularly how they've handled a crisis. These qualities are especially crucial for a fast-paced, remote-first startup environment where adaptability is key.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for reinstating Confederate-era names for several U.S. Army bases, an action that circumvents a 2021 law. To bypass the legislation, the Pentagon claims the bases are being renamed after different historical soldiers who happen to share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes. This move has been condemned by lawmakers, including some Republicans, as a disingenuous attempt to flout congressional authority and honor figures who fought against the United States to preserve slavery.</p>

The article explores how the state was built on foundational violence, from the land runs that dispossessed Indigenous nations to the racial terror that shadowed its development. It also highlights the forgotten history of all-Black towns and the visionary effort by Edward McCabe to create a Black-governed state. The author argues that understanding Oklahoma's legacy of ambition, betrayal, and reinvention is essential to understanding the broader American story.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the policy. The decline is linked to perceptions that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals, and Hispanic approval has dropped significantly. The poll also reveals that most Americans, particularly those outside Trump's base, believe the administration should focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts.

She advises parents to validate their children's feelings rather than dismissing them, creating a safe space for all emotions. This approach helps children develop a strong sense of self-worth, which can protect their mental health and guide them through life's challenges.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has ordered the immediate evacuation of parts of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, an area previously spared from a ground offensive. The order has caused widespread panic among the tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians sheltering there, as it may signal an imminent attack. The area is also feared to be where Hamas is holding some of the remaining Israeli hostages. This development comes as health officials report more than 40 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire while awaiting aid trucks in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful earthquakes, the largest a magnitude 7.4, struck in the sea off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, initially prompting a tsunami warning. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later confirmed that the danger of significant tsunami waves had passed for the region. A separate tsunami watch for Hawaii was also canceled. The quakes, which occurred near the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, were followed by numerous aftershocks. Fortunately, there were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage from the seismic activity.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Beast in the Clouds" by Nathalia Holt, chronicles the 1928 expedition of Ted and Kermit Roosevelt, sons of the former president, into the unmapped regions of China. Their secret and ambitious goal was to find and hunt a giant panda, a creature so rare and mysterious at the time that many doubted its existence. The excerpt sets the scene for their adventure, highlighting the era's spirit of exploration and the allure of the legendary black-and-white bear, which had eluded Western explorers and remained a mythical figure.</p>

          <p>During the final curtain call for the opera 'Il trovatore' at London's Royal Opera House, a cast member staged a protest by unfurling a large Palestinian flag.

          <p>Scientists and health agencies are warning of an increased risk of Vibrio bacterial infections in European coastal waters, particularly the Baltic and North Seas. These bacteria, which can cause serious illness, thrive in warmer, low-salinity water—conditions that are becoming more common due to climate change and marine heatwaves. While infections remain relatively rare, the changing climate is expanding the favorable habitats for Vibrio. Health officials advise avoiding swimming with open wounds and not eating raw or undercooked shellfish to minimize the risk of infection.</p>

          <p>Amid recent conservative criticism of Superman being portrayed as an immigrant, comic book author Grant Morrison highlights the character's leftist origins. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original 1930s Superman was a "socialist figure" and a "Champion of the Oppressed" who fought corrupt bosses and tore down slums. Morrison, whose work influenced the new film, explains that Superman has always been an immigrant and has evolved over the decades to reflect the times, from a patriotic figure in the 1940s to a cosmic seeker in the 1960s.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has claimed that his party's newly elected councillors are being intentionally obstructed by officials in some of the 10 local councils they now control. Speaking to the BBC, Farage defended his party's governance, stating that in areas like Warwickshire, councillors are being "hamstrung" by existing bureaucracies that are resistant to change. He argued that hiring new political assistants is necessary to overcome this obstructionism and implement the party's agenda of cutting wasteful spending, a move that has drawn criticism from opposition parties.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that to effectively combat Donald Trump's political influence, his opponents must learn from his strategic successes. The author suggests that pro-democracy forces have been too focused on denunciation and need to adopt Trump's ability to tell a simple, repetitive story, appeal to national pride, and build a powerful movement outside of traditional party structures. The commentary calls for a more determined, aggressive defense of democracy, urging opponents to "smile less, swear more" and offer their own vision for constitutional reform to connect with ordinary Americans.</p>

The research raises concerns about data privacy, as many teens share personal information, and the potential for addictive behavior.
