          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 18:23:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's injunction that restricts the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive records of the Social Security Administration (SSA). The administration argues that the injunction impedes its ability to modernize government information systems and combat waste and fraud. A federal judge in Maryland imposed the restrictions due to privacy concerns, requiring DOGE team members to undergo training and background checks before accessing unredacted data. The Supreme Court has ordered challengers to respond by May 12, and the case highlights ongoing tensions between government efficiency efforts and individual privacy rights. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with weekly cases surpassing previous records set in 2019, marking the worst outbreak since the 1990s. The majority of cases are concentrated in Texas and neighboring states, with additional local outbreaks reported across the country.

          <p>United Airlines is reducing its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 roundtrip flights daily, representing approximately 10% of its Newark hub operations. CEO Scott Kirby attributes the decision to air traffic controller staffing shortages and the FAA's technology problems, which have led to significant flight delays. Kirby stated that a substantial number of air traffic controllers for Newark left their positions following technology failures. United is urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those in place at other congested airports, and the airline is working with the Transportation Department to address the infrastructure issues.

This change follows the Trump administration's decision to close a loophole that allowed low-cost Chinese goods to enter the U.S. without import fees. Temu had previously announced it would adjust prices and add import charges for U.S. customers buying items from China, and the company is now actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join its platform.

          <p>Former White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using a modified version of the Signal encrypted messaging app during a Cabinet meeting. While the White House states that Signal is an approved app for government use, the version Waltz was using appears to be from a company called TeleMessage, which adds archiving capabilities. This raises concerns about the security and privacy of messages, as TeleMessage could potentially undermine Signal's end-to-end encryption. The use of encrypted apps by top Trump administration officials has previously triggered controversy. Optimism score: 50</p>

Farage aims to establish a foothold in local government as a stepping stone to the next UK general election, and the party will now face scrutiny over its performance in office.
