          <p>Former President Donald Trump is demanding $230 million from the Department of Justice, alleging compensation for its criminal investigations into him, which date back to before his first term and continued after leaving office. These demands were submitted through an administrative claim process, often a precursor to lawsuits, and relate to probes like the 2016 election interference investigation and the 2022 Mar-a-Lago classified documents search. Trump has publicly stated his intention to donate any potential settlement money to charity. The situation raises ethical questions, particularly as some federal officials he appointed, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, previously represented him in related cases.</p>

          <p>Federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted a joint operation on Canal Street in New York City's Chinatown, leading to a significant law enforcement presence. Vendors reportedly packed up and attempted to flee, while protesters gathered in response to the action. City Hall officials monitored the situation, stating they do not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportation matters and were not involved. Mayor Eric Adams emphasized that undocumented New Yorkers pursuing the American Dream should not be targets, advocating instead for a focus on violent criminals.</p>

          <p>Irish police faced attacks with missiles and fireworks during a violent protest outside the Citywest Hotel in Dublin, which houses asylum seekers. A police vehicle was set on fire, and riot police were deployed to prevent protesters from reaching the hotel, with several thousand people reportedly gathered. Taoiseach Micheál Martin condemned the attacks on police, emphasizing there is no justification for such violence. Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan stated that those involved would be brought to justice, clarifying that the violence does not reflect the local community but rather the actions of criminals.</p>

Santos apologized to his former constituents and colleagues for betraying their trust, expressing a desire to 'rewrite the ending of his life' and work on prison reform.

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil accused the Trump administration of attempting to re-detain him through immigration courts, labeling them 'kangaroo courts' designed to control the process. His comments followed an appeals court hearing on his habeas corpus petition, challenging his detention after being arrested by ICE agents in March despite being a green card holder. Khalil's attorneys argued that immigration courts are ill-equipped to handle constitutional claims like freedom of speech. The government maintains that Khalil's presence harms U.S. foreign policy interests, asserting that visas are a privilege, not a right, for those posing national security threats.</p>

          <p>Construction has begun on President Donald Trump's new $250 million White House ballroom, raising questions about the identities of its wealthy donors. While Trump stated he would personally contribute and YouTube pledged $22 million, most donors remain anonymous, sparking concerns among ethics experts about potential 'pay-to-play' schemes. A dinner for potential donors included executives from major corporations, and a pledge form hinted at 'recognition' for contributions. Critics argue this model could grant undue access to the administration, despite White House assurances that the project is privately funded and will benefit future administrations.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study by 22 public service media organizations, including DW, found that four leading AI assistants misrepresent news content 45% of the time, regardless of language or territory. The evaluation of ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and Perplexity AI showed that nearly half of all answers had significant issues, with 31% containing serious sourcing problems and 20% major factual errors. This research confirms systemic distortion of news content by AI assistants, raising concerns about public trust and democratic participation as more people, especially younger demographics, use chatbots for news.

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Donald Trump's strong control over his administration and his reliance on personal chemistry could act as a 'guard rail' in US-China relations, despite ongoing trade tensions. While figures like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have adopted a hawkish stance, Trump has shown restraint in not directly antagonizing Chinese President Xi Jinping or challenging Beijing's 'red lines' like Taiwan. Experts believe Trump's direct, leader-to-leader diplomacy has become increasingly crucial in shaping ties, indicating that he ultimately 'calls the shots' in the US government. This approach, while unconventional, might prevent broader escalations by keeping his more aggressive team members in check.</p>

          <p>Despite internal infighting and diverse ideological factions, Democrats continue to find common ground in their opposition to Donald Trump, who remains a central unifying figure for the party. This strategy, observed since 2024, is seen by some as a 'seductive' way to generate small-dollar contributions and energize activists. However, critics within the party worry that an excessive focus on Trump distracts from developing a positive, forward-looking agenda, contributing to the Democrats' current unpopularity. The article suggests that both major parties increasingly define themselves by their stance on Trump, leading to a rise in independent voters and an uncertain political future once he is no longer president.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that planned face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the war in Ukraine have been put on hold, as he did not want a 'wasted meeting.' The White House confirmed no immediate plans for a summit, with a key sticking point being Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line. Trump had embraced a ceasefire proposal to freeze the conflict on the existing battle line, but Russia insisted on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from eastern regions. European leaders and Ukrainian President Zelensky also accused Russia of not being 'serious' about peace, highlighting the deep divisions that prevented a summit.</p>

Grijalva, elected to fill her late father's seat, has been unable to access her office or perform constituent services due to the delay. Supporters believe Johnson is stalling because Grijalva's swearing-in would provide the decisive 218th signature needed for a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein files.

          <p>The rapid surge in AI investments and valuations has sparked a debate among experts about whether the sector is experiencing an economic bubble. While some, like former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, believe it's already a bubble but with a long runway, others, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, see it as necessary capital expenditure for technological leadership. Concerns include the vast gap between current investments and credible future profits, exemplified by OpenAI's high valuation versus its revenue. However, some analysts also note that the market hasn't reached the 'mania' level seen in past bubbles, suggesting strong underlying demand for AI infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this revenue growth, net income of $2.5 billion fell below analyst projections, primarily due to a $619 million expense from a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities. The company anticipates another 17% revenue growth in Q4 and expects to more than double its ad revenue in 2025.

          <p>Modern electric vehicles, increasingly reliant on software updates like smartphones, face a new challenge: potential obsolescence as their hardware struggles to keep pace with evolving technology. While software updates offer new features, older vehicles may become incompatible with computationally demanding AI and autonomous functionalities. Unlike mechanical cars, which can be restored, software-dependent EVs risk becoming 'bricks' if their operating systems become outdated or unsupported, as seen with the 3G network shutdown affecting older connected cars. This trend raises questions about the long-term usability of EVs, which are otherwise designed for mechanical longevity, and the industry's commitment to sustained software support.</p>

The redrawing targets Rep. Don Davis's 1st Congressional District, which was already competitive. Critics argue the move is an attack on bipartisanship and could disenfranchise voters, particularly in majority-Black counties, though Republicans maintain it reflects the will of the voters.</p>
