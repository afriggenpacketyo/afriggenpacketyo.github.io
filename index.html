        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has delayed by one month a plan to cut off access to crucial satellite data used for hurricane forecasting. The decision came after scientists and NASA raised alarms, warning the move could set forecasting back decades. The administration cited a "significant cybersecurity risk" as the reason for the original plan, which involves decommissioning a data ingest system managed by the US Navy. The data is also vital for monitoring polar sea ice changes.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has publicly opposed his party's "One Big Beautiful Bill," arguing it breaks President Trump's promise to protect Medicaid. Tillis stated the bill would result in a $26 billion cut to the program in his state, pushing hundreds of thousands off their healthcare coverage. Despite his strong opposition and retirement announcement, it remains unclear if he can persuade any of his Republican colleagues to join him in voting against the legislation.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that Canada has rescinded its digital services tax after President Trump threatened to halt trade negotiations.

Following the reversal, trade talks between the two nations have resumed, with officials now aiming to secure a new deal by late July.

          <p>Recent polling from multiple sources indicates that a majority of Americans oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill." However, public opinion is more divided on some of the bill's specific components. For example, a Quinnipiac poll found 55% of voters oppose the bill overall, but voters were split nearly evenly on a provision to add new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Similarly, other polls show support for extending certain tax cuts for lower and middle-income individuals, revealing a complex public sentiment that doesn't align neatly with the bill's total package.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order lifting some U.S. financial sanctions on Syria to support the country's stability following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. The move would terminate a 2004 declaration that froze Syrian government assets, a decision made after Trump met with Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa. However, targeted sanctions will remain in place against former leader Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, and terrorist-linked entities, aiming to maintain pressure on the old regime while assisting the new transitional government.</p>

The film, starring Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, follows a predictable plot of adventurers getting attacked by dinosaurs on a remote island. Critics note that the movie is barely invested in its human characters and that the dinosaur action feels repetitive and bloodless. Despite a new cast and a respected director, the film is seen as a disappointment that fails to bring any new life to the long-running series.</p>

Used to label everything from a reality TV star's on-screen spiral to celebrity antics, the phrase serves as a catchall for moments of anger, stress, or mental health struggles. While some see it as a form of catharsis, mental health professionals express concern that the trend may normalize emotional dysregulation and discourage the development of healthier coping skills, blurring the line between authentic expression and performative vulnerability online.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has announced it will hear a Republican challenge to federal limits on coordinated campaign spending during its next term. The case questions the constitutionality of caps on how much money political parties can spend on advertising in direct coordination with their candidates, arguing they violate the First Amendment. A ruling in favor of the challenge could significantly alter campaign finance laws, potentially allowing for a massive increase in coordinated spending in future elections. Democratic committees have vowed to fight the effort to remove the long-standing caps.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing an ominous start to its wildfire season, with several fires igniting across Riverside and San Bernardino counties over the weekend. The largest blaze, the Wolf fire near Banning, has grown to 1,400 acres and forced hundreds to evacuate. Experts warn that after a below-average rainy season, vegetation across the state is extremely dry, creating prime conditions for an active and dangerous fire season ahead. Air quality alerts have been issued, and officials are concerned about new fire starts in Northern California due to potential thunderstorms.</p>

          <p>England's recent Test match victory over India highlighted the critical importance of efficiently dismissing the opposition's lower-order batsmen, often called the "tail." Fast bowler Josh Tongue was particularly effective, taking three wickets in each innings against India's tail, which offered little resistance. This skill, which involves aggressive and intimidating bowling, has been a weakness for England in the past. The ability to prevent the opposition's tail from scoring significant runs is seen as a key factor for England's future success, especially in the upcoming Ashes series.</p>

          <p>Mexican authorities discovered 20 bodies, including several that were decapitated, on a highway bridge in the state of Sinaloa. The gruesome finding is linked to escalating violence between warring factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel. The conflict pits loyalists of captured co-founder Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada against the "Chapitos" faction, led by the sons of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman. This internal war has led to a surge in brutal violence, with over 1,200 deaths recorded as the factions fight for control.</p>

          <p>Tyson Foods has announced a $23.5 million investment to expand its facility in Robards, Kentucky, aiming to increase production capacity and meet growing market demand for its protein products. The project is scheduled for completion by spring 2026. Simultaneously, the company is facing labor unrest at its beef-processing plant in Amarillo, Texas, where 3,200 unionized workers have voted overwhelmingly in favor of a strike. The workers are demanding higher wages and improved benefits, and the union has filed unfair labor practice charges against the company.</p>

          <h2>UK Food Delivery Apps to Implement Stronger Checks to Prevent Illegal Work</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 13:36:49 EDT</div>

          <p>Major food delivery companies in the UK, including Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat, have agreed to strengthen their security measures to prevent illegal work. The move comes after reports that some asylum seekers, who are not permitted to work, were using other people's accounts to make deliveries. The companies will increase the use of facial verification and other fraud detection technologies to ensure that only legally registered account holders are working. This agreement with the government aims to curb the illicit sharing of accounts within the gig economy.</p>

          <h2>Federal Investigation Concludes Harvard Violated Civil Rights Law by Failing to Protect Jewish Students</h2>

          <p>A Trump administration investigation has found that Harvard University violated federal civil rights law through its handling of antisemitism on campus. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights stated that the university was at times "deliberately indifferent" to the harassment of Jewish students, faculty, and staff following the events of October 7, 2023. Harvard has disputed the findings but faces a potential loss of federal funding as it grapples with the report's conclusions and its own internal task force on antisemitism.</p>
