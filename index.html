          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan was arrested on charges of obstructing immigration enforcement, accused of intentionally misdirecting federal agents away from an undocumented immigrant in her courtroom. Judge Dugan, a progressive figure elected in 2016, allegedly directed the immigrant through a side door while agents waited in the hallway. She has a history of working on behalf of low-income people and marginalized groups, and in 2023, she dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Republican Party of Wisconsin regarding get-out-the-vote efforts in Milwaukee. This incident has sparked significant debate regarding the role of judges in immigration matters.</p>

          <p>Amazon sellers have begun raising prices on numerous goods in response to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, with average price hikes nearing 30% on nearly 1,000 products. These increases affect a wide range of items, including tech accessories and clothing, as importers pass on additional costs to consumers. While Trump claims these tariffs will revitalize domestic manufacturing, retailers are struggling to adapt, facing uncertainty and the high costs of revamping supply chains. These tariffs are paid by importers, and they typically pass on much or even all of those additional costs to consumers. </p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine are facing challenges as Russian President Putin launched airstrikes on Kyiv ahead of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff's visit to Moscow. Trump insists a deal is possible and necessary to save lives, but his warnings to Putin appear to be ignored, mirroring similar outcomes from Biden's administration. The US has reportedly offered a "final offer" that would recognize Russian control over occupied territories, but Zelenskyy has rejected acknowledging Crimea as Russian territory. This situation highlights the complexities and mistrust surrounding negotiations to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>California is experiencing a surge in Valley fever cases, with reported cases doubling the 10-year average for the first three months of the year, driven by cycles of drought and precipitation. The disease, caused by inhaling fungal spores, presents symptoms similar to COVID or the flu, complicating diagnosis. Research indicates that drought followed by a wet winter and dry summer increases cases, with construction workers, firefighters, and archaeologists at higher risk. Health officials are working to address the rise, including efforts to reduce dust at large events, but concerns exist about potential drug resistance. </p>

          <p>Ethan Frisch and Ori Zohar transformed Frisch's New York apartment into a spice warehouse, founding Burlap & Barrel, a company that sources spices directly from small-scale farmers worldwide.

Starting with $40,000, the business has been profitable since day one, growing to nearly $8 million in annual gross revenue by 2024. Burlap & Barrel partners with chefs and has appeared on "Shark Tank," expanding beyond spices to include sugars and honey, but the company faces challenges due to its higher price point.</p>

Judge Joanna Seybert rebuked Santos for his repeated lies and lack of remorse, noting that his words won him a seat in Congress but ultimately landed him in court. Santos, who tearfully expressed regret for defrauding voters, faced a sentence of 75 to 87 months imprisonment, including a mandatory minimum two-year sentence for aggravated identity theft.

          <h2>Exploring the Intersection of Dreams and Reality in Literature</h2>

          <p>Two recently published books, Charlotte Beradt's reissued "Third Reich of Dreams" and Laila Lalami's novel "The Dream Hotel," connect dream behavior to real-world implications, suggesting that dreams might be our purest expressions of free will. Beradt's catalogue documents the dreams of Germans during Hitler's rise, showing how deeply the Nazis infiltrated their minds. Lalami's novel imagines a dystopian surveillance state that monitors people's dreams, incarcerating those deemed likely to commit crimes. Together, these works propose an intriguing argument: Dreams, though beyond our conscious control, might be our purest expressions of free will.</p>

While advocacy groups focus on acceptance and inclusion they avoid "uncomfortable truths about children like mine", Emily May, a mother of a child with autism, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece on Friday. </p>

          <p>An aid agency reports that Sudanese people are eating charcoal and leaves to survive after fleeing an attack on a camp for displaced people near el-Fasher.
