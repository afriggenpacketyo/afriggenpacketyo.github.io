        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with President Trump, extending the order that allows him to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, overriding a judge's previous order to return control to California Governor Gavin Newsom. The unanimous decision from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals supports the president's invocation of Title 10, which permits federalizing the National Guard in cases of rebellion or inability to enforce U.S. laws. The court found that the administration presented sufficient facts to suggest a valid basis for using Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents. Newsom expressed disappointment but affirmed his intent to challenge what he views as Trump's authoritarian use of the military against citizens.</p>

Durov mentioned that he began donating sperm 15 years ago and that the clinic informed him of the numerous conceptions across 12 countries. While acknowledging being the official father of six other children with three different partners, he intends to distribute his $13.9 billion fortune equally among all his offspring, who will not have access to their inheritance for 30 years. Durov stated his decision to write a will now is due to the risks associated with his work defending freedoms, which has earned him many enemies.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the protracted and politically charged process surrounding Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel underscores a growing fragility for businesses operating in the U.S. market. The U.S. government's intervention, driven by political motives, may deter global companies from making substantial investments and acquisitions in the United States. While the deal ultimately proceeded with added conditions, including significant investment obligations and government veto power, it has raised concerns about predictability and government involvement in business decisions. This situation may prompt companies to diversify their investments and reduce exposure to the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>China is allowing Indian pilgrims to resume visits to Tibet, a move some hope will help improve relations between the two countries after years of border tensions. The pilgrimages, which involve travel to Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar, sacred sites for multiple religions, had been suspended for five years due to COVID-19 and cross-border issues. This year, over 5,500 people applied, with 750 being allowed to travel.

The government defends the reforms as necessary to fix a broken system and support those who can work, while protecting the most vulnerable.

          <p>President Trump is considering whether to join Israel's attacks on Iran, specifically targeting the Fordow nuclear enrichment site. He is weighing whether the U.S. Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs, known as “bunker busters,” will effectively destroy the facility, which is built deep into a mountain south of Tehran. Trump has signaled that he will take two weeks to decide whether or not to strike, while Israel seeks the powerful bombs and aircraft to damage the secretive site.</p>

          <p>Niger's ruling junta has announced plans to nationalize Somair, a unit of the French uranium company Orano, amid escalating tensions between the two nations. The junta cited "irresponsible, illegal, and disloyal behavior" by Orano, which holds a majority stake in Somair. This decision follows a deterioration in relations after a military coup in 2023 and the subsequent withdrawal of French troops. The French company has been pursuing legal means to regain operational control, claiming the state's actions have been damaging the mine's finances.</p>
