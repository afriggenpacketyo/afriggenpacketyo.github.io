          <p>Microsoft has terminated two employees, Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle, following serious breaches of company policies and an unlawful break-in at President Brad Smith's office. These individuals, affiliated with the "No Azure for Apartheid" group, were protesting Microsoft's alleged software use by the Israeli military in Gaza and demanding an end to the company's direct and indirect support for Israel. Smith claimed protesters blocked office access, planted listening devices, and refused to leave until police intervention. The company is continuing its investigation and cooperating with law enforcement regarding these incidents, which also included earlier campus protests and 20 arrests.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair participated in a White House meeting with US President Donald Trump to discuss comprehensive plans for post-war Gaza. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff indicated a "very comprehensive" plan is being developed, aiming to conclude the conflict within four months, though little else has been disclosed. Blair previously served as a Middle East envoy, focusing on economic development and a two-state solution, a concept Israel's Foreign Minister has rejected. The meeting occurred as Israeli forces continued operations in Gaza City, facing international warnings about a horrific humanitarian impact and declared famine.</p>

          <p>Best Buy reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings for its recent quarter, showing a 1.6% rise in comparable sales, marking its highest growth in three years. Despite this modest recovery, the consumer electronics retailer maintained its full-year guidance, citing ongoing uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on consumers and its business. CFO Matt Bilunas expressed confidence in the second half but noted the prudence of maintaining current forecasts given the tariff situation. The company has already implemented "last resort" price increases on some items to offset higher tariff-related costs and launched a third-party marketplace to spur future growth.

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and other regions endured a massive Russian missile and drone attack overnight, resulting in at least 15 deaths, including four children, and 48 injuries across multiple city districts. Ukrainian officials reported shooting down most of the 598 drones and 31 missiles launched, though impacts were widespread. President Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as a clear rejection of peace efforts, urging stronger international sanctions against Russia and highlighting damage to the EU mission building. This major assault, one of the largest since the full-scale invasion began, underscores Russia's continued targeting of civilian infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A 17-year-old girl, Gianna Kistenmacher, is charged as an adult with accessory before the fact in the murder of her 16-year-old boyfriend, Trey Wright, in South Carolina. Authorities allege she set him up to be shot and killed by an older teen, Devan Raper, following an escalating argument. Wright's mother recounted the girlfriend's presence at the hospital after the shooting, unaware of her alleged involvement, and described her son as a pleasant, positive young man adored by many. Seven teens, including Kistenmacher and Raper, face charges in connection with the slaying, which was reportedly recorded on video, raising questions about motive.</p>

          <p>Botswana has achieved a monumental public health victory, reducing its childhood HIV infection rate by over 98% since the 1990s, when one in eight infants were infected. New cases in children are now exceptionally rare, prompting comprehensive audits for every diagnosis. This success is attributed to robust HIV prevention infrastructure, widespread free antiretroviral therapies since 2002, and early implementation of the WHO’s Option B+ strategy for pregnant women. Botswana is the first high-HIV-rate country to achieve Gold Tier status for eliminating mother-to-child transmissions, demonstrating what is possible with sustained political will and investment.</p>

          <p>Rwanda has confirmed the arrival of seven individuals deported from the United States in mid-August, as part of a controversial agreement to accept up to 250 people. This deal, negotiated by the Trump administration, is one of several arrangements to send deportees to third countries, including South Sudan and Eswatini. Three of the individuals have expressed a desire to return to their home countries, while four wish to stay in Rwanda, where they will receive training, healthcare, and accommodation.

Epping Forest District Council successfully argued the hotel's use breached planning laws, following local protests and an incident involving a migrant charged with sexual assault.

          <p>A new Stanford study indicates that artificial intelligence is significantly displacing entry-level workers, particularly those aged 22-25, in fields highly exposed to generative AI like software engineering and customer service. Since 2022, this demographic has experienced a 13% decline in employment in these sectors, while older workers in similar roles have seen growth. The research suggests AI can replace "book-learning" knowledge, making younger employees more vulnerable, whereas experienced workers possess tacit knowledge and soft skills less easily automated. The study highlights the evolving impact of AI on the labor market, emphasizing the need for workers to adapt by using AI to augment their skills. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have intensified bombardment of Gaza City's eastern suburbs, killing at least 16 Palestinians and wounding dozens in the southern enclave, according to local health officials. Residents are fleeing Gaza City, which Israel describes as Hamas's last stronghold, despite international warnings about a catastrophic humanitarian impact. The health ministry reports 71 Palestinians killed in the past 24 hours, and 317 deaths from malnutrition and starvation since the war began, including 121 children. Israel disputes these fatality figures and has asked a global hunger monitor to retract its assessment of famine in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will make his first visit to China in six years to attend a military parade, where he will meet with President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This event, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII and China's resistance against Japan, highlights a growing three-way alignment between Beijing, Moscow, and Pyongyang against US alliances. Kim's attendance at this multilateral event aims to bolster his international stature and solidify solidarity with Global South countries, while potentially seeking to restart diplomacy with the Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh government is proposing changes to its controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodations, which currently require properties to be let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower business rates. The proposed amendments include allowing an average of 182 letting days over several years and counting up to 14 charity days towards the target. While the government says it has listened to feedback, industry groups like PASC UK Cymru criticize the changes as "token gestures," arguing the 182-day threshold continues to harm the tourism sector. The consultation period is open until November 20. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively exploring and formalizing mechanisms to deploy federal troops and the National Guard into US cities, ostensibly to address crime. This initiative, exemplified by deployments in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, raises significant constitutional and legal questions regarding state sovereignty and the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in law enforcement. Critics view these actions as a move towards an authoritarian model, eroding the cultural prohibition against domestic military deployment. The administration is also expanding ICE's workforce, aiming to use these deployments to circumvent sanctuary policies and intensify immigration enforcement.</p>

NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy emphasized the importance of this milestone for beating China in space exploration. However, analysts caution that despite this breakthrough, China's momentum could still enable it to establish the first lunar base, intensifying the competitive dynamic in space exploration.</p>

Critics, including the newspaper's editor and opposition politicians, condemned the move as a "direct attack on the free press" and an "extremely dangerous step," likening it to tactics used by Donald Trump.
