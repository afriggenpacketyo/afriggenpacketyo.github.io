          <p>At WWE's SummerSlam event, social media personality Logan Paul and his partner Drew McIntyre defeated country music star Jelly Roll and Randy Orton in a tag-team match. A key moment involved Paul executing a "frog splash" maneuver, jumping from the top rope to crash through the announcers' table where Jelly Roll was positioned. Despite a late-match comeback attempt by Jelly Roll, Paul secured the victory for his team by pinning the musician. The match provided a significant highlight for the event, showcasing the crossover appeal of celebrities in professional wrestling.</p>

          <p>Over thirty years after the brutal 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, continuing to haunt the victims' families and investigators. The article recounts the horrific crime, the initial investigation, and a series of false leads and coerced confessions that led to wrongful convictions, which were later overturned. Although a small sample of male DNA was found on a victim, advanced Y-STR testing has so far failed to identify a suspect, leaving the case in limbo. The story highlights the enduring pain of the families and the hope that future technological advancements might finally bring justice.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare technique using a swarm of drones to create an "electromagnetic storm eye." This system is designed to jam enemy communications while simultaneously creating a protective null zone for friendly forces, where jamming signals are canceled out. By precisely adjusting the signals' waveform, amplitude, and timing, the drones can shield allied positions from interference. This represents a significant shift from traditional brute-force jamming, which disrupts all signals in an area, offering a more targeted and strategic capability for the People's Liberation Army.</p>

The author reflects on how recent films depicting the wartime event have introduced a new generation to the historical trauma, which continues to shape public consciousness and even foreign policy. The massacre is described not just as a historical tragedy but as a moral wound, exacerbated by the perception that the Japanese government has never fully acknowledged or atoned for the atrocities. This unresolved history helps explain its powerful and persistent presence in the nation's collective memory.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has been released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana after being detained for two months. She was taken into custody during what she believed was a routine green card application interview, despite having just given birth and being the mother of two young American children. Her detention stemmed from an old, unknown deportation order issued against her and her mother, who had abandoned her as a teenager. The case highlights the impact of the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement policies, which have led to arrests even in cases with strong family and military ties.</p>

This action follows a request from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's push for a "rushed trial" of Trump before the 2024 election constituted illegal political activity.

The decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirms that federal agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone and cannot base arrests solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over raids conducted by the Trump administration that advocates argued were unconstitutional and based on racial profiling.

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, offering a personal commitment from himself and President Trump to work for their release. The meeting took place during a protest in Tel Aviv, where families are urging the Israeli government to secure a deal amid growing fears for the captives' well-being. The situation has been intensified by recent videos released by Hamas showing hostages looking emaciated, which has triggered outrage and desperation among their families. The article also notes ongoing violence and civilian deaths near aid distribution sites within Gaza, highlighting the grim humanitarian crisis.</p>

The 25-year-old two-time Olympic champion's victory demonstrates her remarkable versatility and talent on the track. The trials also saw Jacory Patterson, who recently worked for UPS, win the men's 400m in a breakout performance.</p>

          <p>A group led by Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca has reportedly reached a deal to buy the WNBA's Connecticut Sun for a record-breaking $325 million. The deal, which is pending league approval, includes plans to relocate the team to Boston for the 2027 season and contribute $100 million for a new practice facility. The Sun, currently owned by the Mohegan Tribe, has been one of the league's most successful teams on the court but lacks a dedicated modern training facility. The sale price far exceeds previous WNBA team sales and expansion fees, reflecting the league's rapid growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of what killed "Winston," a platypus gifted to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill by Australia in 1943. The animal, a secret diplomatic gift during World War II, died just days before reaching England. For decades, it was rumored that the platypus died from shell-shock caused by a nearby German U-boat attack. However, by analyzing archived ship logs and attendant notes, researchers now believe the creature likely died from heatstroke, as records show water and air temperatures on the ship climbed well above the safe threshold for the species as it crossed the equator.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of large-scale theme parks to boost its economy and drive local consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest example in a rapidly growing attractions industry, which is forecast to expand by 19 percent annually over the next three years. According to the global theme park association IAAPA, these attractions act as significant economic drivers, with every yuan of revenue generating nearly four yuan in the surrounding economy. This strategy reflects a broader effort to cultivate domestic tourism and entertainment as key pillars of economic growth.</p>

          <p>Lebanon is mourning the death of Ziad Rahbani, one of its most cherished and influential artists, who passed away at age 69. A musician, composer, and playwright, Rahbani was known for his unique blend of jazz, traditional Arab music, and sharp social and political commentary that often challenged the country's sectarian leaders. Born to the famed composer Assi Rahbani and legendary singer Fairuz, he carved his own path, creating works that reflected the struggles of ordinary people during the Lebanese civil war. His collaborations with his mother, Fairuz, are particularly celebrated for bringing a more raw, human element to her iconic status.</p>

          <p>Kori Schake, a foreign policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, argues that President Trump's approach to foreign policy is dangerously isolating the United States. In an interview, she contends that his belief that allies are a burden undermines the cooperative international order that amplifies American power and keeps the world safer and more prosperous. Schake warns that other countries are already beginning to "hedge" against the U.S., which could lead to a less stable world and higher costs for protecting American interests. She calls on principled conservatives to challenge this approach and advocate for maintaining strong alliances.</p>

Folkenflik notes the difficulty of navigating internal meetings and sourcing while maintaining objectivity, particularly as President Trump and his allies move to defund public broadcasting.

          <p>In her new book, "From The Clinics To The Capitol," author Carol Mason argues that the American anti-abortion movement has become increasingly intertwined with white nationalist and insurrectionary ideologies. Mason traces the evolution of the movement's rhetoric from seeking to overturn Roe v. Wade to a broader defiance of the rule of law, culminating in participation in events like the January 6th Capitol riot. She contends that shared conspiracy theories about a "global cabal" and demographic replacement have created a bridge between anti-abortion activists and other far-right groups, framing their cause as a defense of "Western Christian civilization."</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offence targeting individuals who use social media and other online platforms to advertise services that facilitate illegal small boat crossings over the Channel. The proposed law, part of a broader immigration bill, could lead to up to five years in prison for those creating and sharing material that promotes illegal immigration, such as offering fake passports or jobs. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the measure is designed to disrupt the business model of "immoral" criminal gangs who exploit migrants. This comes as the number of migrants arriving via small boats in 2025 has already reached a record high.</p>

          <p>The global popularity of Labubu dolls, fueled by a TikTok trend, has led to a flood of dangerous counterfeit versions on the market. Trading Standards officers in the UK have seized thousands of fake dolls, which are often made with inferior materials and pose a significant choking hazard to children due to easily detachable parts. Authorities warn that these fakes, primarily traced to China, Hong Kong, or Turkey, are produced by criminal organizations with a disregard for safety standards and may contain toxic chemicals. The high demand and limited supply of genuine dolls have created a lucrative market for both scalpers and counterfeiters.</p>
