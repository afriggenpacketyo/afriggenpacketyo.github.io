          <p>Congressional Democrats are introducing a bill to establish an independent inspector general to oversee the Executive Office of the President. The proposed legislation aims to increase accountability and prevent potential fraud or abuse within the White House, regardless of the administration in power. Citing concerns over alleged conflicts of interest and the recent firing of several federal watchdogs, proponents argue the measure is a crucial check on executive power, though it faces significant hurdles in the Republican-controlled Congress.</p>

          <p>Torrential rains have caused catastrophic flash flooding in the Ruidoso area of southern New Mexico, resulting in at least three fatalities and prompting over 50 swift-water rescues. The region, still recovering from wildfires last year that left the ground unstable, saw the Rio Ruidoso surge to a record height, with water levels rising dramatically in minutes. The governor has declared a state of emergency to expedite federal aid as the community grapples with the destruction, which includes homes being swept away by the powerful floodwaters.</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England are set to strike for five consecutive days in July after voting for further industrial action in their ongoing dispute over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) stated the walkout will proceed unless the government agrees to negotiate, asserting that real-term wages have fallen significantly since 2008. The government has called the strike "unnecessary and unreasonable," highlighting a recent 5.4% pay rise and refusing to reopen negotiations, leading to a continued impasse that will disrupt NHS services.</p>

          <p>A recent dip in mortgage rates to their lowest level in three months has triggered a significant 9.4% jump in total mortgage application volume. Both applications for home purchases and refinancing saw a 9% increase for the week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This surge in homebuyer interest is also attributed to growing housing inventory and more moderate price growth. However, rates have begun to creep up again, suggesting the window of opportunity for lower borrowing costs may be temporary.</p>

In a policy reversal, the administration announced it would resume military aid to Kyiv, with plans to send 10 Patriot missile systems to help counter the most intense Russian aerial attack of the war. This shift in tone and policy follows a brief, controversial halt in aid and comes as Trump considers a Republican-led bill to impose heavy tariffs on countries trading with Russia.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume its plan for mass firings of federal workers by lifting a lower court's order that had blocked the move. The decision allows for large-scale "reductions in force" to proceed at numerous government agencies while legal challenges continue in lower courts. This action, part of a broader administration effort to restructure the federal government, could result in hundreds of thousands of job losses and has been condemned by critics as a threat to essential government services.</p>

          <h2>State Inspectors Approved Camp Mystic's Emergency Plans Days Before Deadly Flood</h2>

          <p>Records show that the Texas Department of State Health Services approved the emergency plans for Camp Mystic just two days before catastrophic flooding at the site claimed at least 27 lives. An inspection report dated July 2 noted that the youth camp had disaster plans in place and that staff were briefed on them. State officials clarified that camps are responsible for developing their own plans, which are then reviewed for compliance, but the incident has raised urgent questions about the adequacy of those plans and the oversight process.</p>

          <p>PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid in the U.S., is facing a critical supply challenge as demand from AI-driven data centers skyrockets while power plant capacity declines. The grid operator expects a 32-gigawatt increase in demand by 2030, almost entirely from data centers, yet has lost generating capacity over the last decade as plants retire faster than new ones are built. This strain has led to soaring electricity capacity prices, threats of states leaving the grid, and federal orders to keep aging power plants online to prevent blackouts.</p>

          <p>Singapore's state investment firm, Temasek Holdings, announced that its net portfolio value reached a record SG$434 billion ($324 billion) for the fiscal year ending in March, an 11% year-on-year increase. The growth was driven by strong performance from its Singapore-based listed companies and direct investments in the U.S., China, and India. During the year, Temasek actively rebalanced its portfolio, making SG$52 billion in new investments while divesting SG$42 billion, the largest such amount in over two decades, to position itself for a changing macroeconomic environment.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly flash floods in Texas, far-right conspiracy theories have circulated widely online, baselessly alleging the disaster was an act of government weather manipulation. Prominent figures associated with the QAnon movement, including retired general Mike Flynn, amplified claims that "cloud seeding" operations were responsible for the tragedy. These unfounded narratives gained traction on social media platforms and were echoed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who announced plans for a bill to prohibit weather modification, blurring facts during a real-world crisis.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the recent Philadelphia sanitation strike, arguing that the piles of uncollected garbage served as a stark reminder of how underpaid and undervalued essential workers are. The columnist contrasts the city's initial reluctance to meet the union's wage demands with its generous funding for the police department and high salaries for top officials. The piece suggests the strike successfully forced the city to re-evaluate its budget priorities and show that it values the workers who maintain public health and keep the city functioning.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, who ran on a promise to remove politics from the office, is finding his neutral stance challenged by the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement. While Hochman has restored many traditional prosecutorial policies after his predecessor's progressive term, his relative silence on federal agents making arrests in county courthouses has drawn criticism. The situation highlights the difficulty of maintaining a non-partisan focus on local public safety when faced with polarizing national policies that directly impact the local justice system.</p>

          <p>Homicides in Los Angeles have declined by over 20% in the first half of 2025, putting the city on track for its lowest annual total in nearly six decades. This significant drop mirrors a national trend of decreasing violent crime rates since the peaks seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Criminology experts suggest the decline is part of a broader, multi-year trend influenced by a complex mix of factors, rather than a single policy. The falling numbers present a stark contrast to the narrative of widespread lawlessness used to justify recent federal troop deployments.</p>

However, these efforts often face strong opposition from health insurance companies, who argue that proposed solutions will raise premiums for everyone.
