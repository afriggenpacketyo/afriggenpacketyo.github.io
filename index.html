          <p>President Donald Trump recently suggested the Washington Commanders should revert to their former "Redskins" name, publicly threatening to halt the team's plans to build a new stadium in the nation's capital if they refused. However, both D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and Commanders General Manager Adam Peters remain unfazed by these comments. Bowser emphasized that the stadium deal is in its final stages and a blockage is unlikely, while Peters stated his focus remains solely on the team's on-field performance, regardless of location. Trump also called for the Cleveland Guardians to revert to their old name, but both professional sports organizations have indicated no plans for further name changes.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipates an extension to President Donald Trump's upcoming trade deadline with China, with discussions scheduled in Stockholm. The current 90-day tariff suspension, agreed upon in May, is set to expire on August 12. Bessent views the trade relationship as constructive, hoping talks will also address China's manufacturing glut and its aid to Russia. This follows previous agreements to reduce tariffs, aiming for continued progress in global trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors' CFO reported a $1.1 billion tariff cost in the last quarter, reducing the company's profit margin from 9% to 6.1%. GM aims to offset at least 30% of the projected $4-5 billion full-year tariff impact through manufacturing changes, cost initiatives, and consumer pricing adjustments. Despite tariffs, GM continues importing popular models from Korea due to high demand. Stellantis also reported substantial tariff payments and production pauses, indicating a broader industry trend of absorbing costs rather than passing them to consumers, affecting overall profitability.

          <p>US approval for Nvidia's H20 chip sales to China, previously banned by President Trump, has sparked controversy among Washington's China hawks. The decision, part of a June trade deal exchanging chip access for Chinese rare earth minerals, is defended by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as a strategy to keep China reliant on American technology without selling advanced goods. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent initially denied a quid pro quo, leading to questions about consistency. Critics argue this move undermines efforts to restrict China's technological advancement.

          <p>Russian lawmakers have approved a bill to fine internet users for searching online content deemed "extremist" by authorities. The Ministry of Justice's list of banned materials includes over 5,000 entries, such as songs praising Ukraine. Fines could reach 5,000 rubles, though the practical implementation and responsibility for monitoring remain unclear. The legislation, criticized by opposition activists as "something out of 1984," passed the State Duma with strong support and is expected to pass the upper house, further restricting online freedom.</p>

          <p>Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times, announced plans to take the newspaper public within the next year. He stated this move aims to "democratize" the paper, allowing public ownership and ensuring it reflects the voices of the people. Soon-Shiong acquired the Times in 2018, bringing it back to local ownership amidst hopes for revitalization. However, the newspaper has continued to face financial challenges, including losses and subscriber declines, leading to significant staff cuts last year.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is close to finalizing a £63.5 million deal for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, with negotiations over add-on payments causing a slight delay. The 27-year-old Swedish international has agreed to a five-year contract with the Gunners.

This acquisition is expected to significantly boost Arsenal's attacking options, addressing manager Mikel Arteta's long-standing search for an elite center-forward.</p>

The author argues that Trump's aid is insufficient for victory and his actions seem to string Ukraine along, offering less decisive help than the obstacles he creates. Despite bipartisan calls for stronger measures against Russia, Trump's policy appears to grant Putin strategic advantages, potentially leading to further territorial gains and a disadvantageous peace deal for Ukraine.</p>
