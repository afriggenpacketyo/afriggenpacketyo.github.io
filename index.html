          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire, announced by former U.S. President Donald Trump, after escalating tensions and military strikes. The conflict stems from disputes over the Kashmir region, which has been a point of contention since the partition of British India in 1947. The agreement comes after a period of heightened conflict, including cross-border air strikes and the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's autonomy in 2019 by the Indian government. This ceasefire aims to de-escalate the situation and potentially pave the way for future negotiations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Fighting between India and Pakistan has intensified, with both sides targeting air bases and blaming each other for initiating the attacks. Pakistan claims India targeted its air bases with missiles, while India says it responded to a wave of Pakistani attacks involving drones and fighter planes. The United States and other nations have urged both countries to de-escalate, but the conflict has become the most expansive confrontation in decades. The escalating crisis has prompted international diplomatic efforts to defuse the situation, with concerns growing about regional stability and the safety of civilians living near the border areas.</p>

          <p>Federal efforts to control silicosis, a deadly lung disease caused by silica dust inhalation, have been significantly undermined by recent policy changes. The current administration has fired key personnel from NIOSH and halted enforcement of MSHA's strengthened silica standard, citing employer compliance difficulties. This rollback comes despite evidence of silicosis resurgence, particularly in the artificial-stone countertop industry, where many workers are developing the disease. The article highlights the essential public-health work performed by government employees in preventing silicosis and the potential consequences of inadequate public-health protections.</p>

          <p>Cardinal Vincent Nichols, a senior Roman Catholic leader, described the conclave to elect Pope Leo XIV as an "immensely peaceful" experience. He noted the absence of politicking and rancor among the cardinals during the highly secretive meeting in the Sistine Chapel. Cardinal Nichols also mentioned the unexpected benefit of being disconnected from the outside world, which allowed for more prayer and reflection. The conclave followed the death of Pope Francis and involved 133 cardinals who were sealed off from communication until a new Pope was chosen.</p>

          <p>The Langenhop family's three children, Ava, Olivia, and Landon, were diagnosed with LAD-1, a rare disorder that impairs white blood cell function and leaves patients vulnerable to infections. Traditional treatment options were limited, but the family enrolled in a clinical trial testing an investigational gene therapy developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals. The therapy involved modifying the children's stem cells to correct the genetic defect and then reintroducing them into their bodies. Five years after treatment, all three children are thriving and living normal lives, marking a significant success for the experimental therapy.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how part-time jobs have become a trap for many low-wage workers in America, with employers circumventing labor laws by offering too few hours instead of too many. Just-in-time scheduling and the lack of guaranteed hours make it difficult for workers to secure stable income and benefits. The author argues that this trend is an exploitation of workers and calls for policy changes to address the problem of underwork, such as requiring employers to set schedules in advance or incentivizing full-time employment.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has implemented a strategy to make the world dependent on China's exports and know-how, aiming to counter foreign interference and challenge the United States' global dominance. This involves increasing state-controlled lending to boost manufacturing, imposing export controls on critical minerals, and using antimonopoly laws to retaliate against American companies. While China still relies on the West for some advanced technologies, its willingness to weaponize the supply chain is redefining its relationship with the world. This approach has led to increased tensions and pressure on other countries to choose sides, potentially cleaving the world into competing spheres of influence.</p>

          <p>Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar have introduced the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA) to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances. The bill seeks to repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998, allowing federal funds for research on Schedule I substances. Experts suggest the bill could garner bipartisan support, enabling policymakers to craft effective legislation based on evidence rather than ideology. The legislation aims to address the federal government's current inability to scientifically measure cannabis' impact on various social and health outcomes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has launched a relentless media offensive characterized by crass language, flashy tactics, and outrageous social media posts. This strategy involves bypassing traditional media outlets and directly engaging the MAGA base through viral far-right culture. The White House has become a quasi-content provider, using shock-value videos and memes to dominate the “attention economy.” Critics warn that this approach undermines decency and accountability, transforming presidential communication into a form of propaganda.</p>

          <p>European officials are examining a trade deal between the United States and Britain for signs of how the former U.S. President Donald Trump may pressure them to adopt tougher policies on China. The agreement is viewed as an effort to ensure allies cut Beijing out of important supply chains, especially in steel and pharmaceuticals. While China isn't explicitly named, the agreement's language on forced labor, data security, and investment bans suggests it is a key focus. The deal may set a precedent for future trade negotiations as countries navigate trade relations with both the U.S. and China.</p>
