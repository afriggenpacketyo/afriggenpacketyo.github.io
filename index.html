        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump advised pregnant women against using Tylenol, linking it to autism without strong scientific backing and diverging from his own administration's more cautious guidance. He emphasized he was speaking from "common sense" rather than medical expertise, prompting immediate pushback from major medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. These organizations highlighted that Tylenol is considered the only safe painkiller during pregnancy and warned that Trump's "irresponsible" claims could pose health risks by deterring necessary medical treatment for pain and fever. The FDA itself noted that while an association has been studied, a causal link has not been established.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article critiques the Trump administration's recent public health guidance, framing the warnings about Tylenol and shifts in vaccine recommendations as part of a dangerous, ideology-first approach to science. It features an interview with Dr. William Moss of Johns Hopkins, who discusses the history of unified vaccine schedules and the complexities that lead to different international standards. Dr. Moss emphasizes that while parental concerns should be heard, the success of vaccines has dangerously lowered the public's perception of the risk of preventable diseases, creating a fractured public health landscape. The chaotic nature of recent advisory meetings is presented as a symptom of this growing distrust in scientific consensus.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma State has fired head football coach Mike Gundy during his 21st season with the team, following significant fan backlash. The decision came after a 19-12 home loss to Tulsa, which sparked chants of "Fire Gundy" from the crowd. This loss brought the team's record to 1-2 for the season, continuing a downturn from last year's 3-9 record and a recent 4-11 stretch overall. Despite his long and successful tenure, which included 18 consecutive seasons at .500 or better and a 170-90 overall record, recent performance led to his dismissal. Athletic director Chad Weiberg acknowledged Gundy's past success in raising the program's national prominence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to confusing and inconsistent federal guidance on vaccines, several states are forming regional coalitions to establish their own public health policies. Alliances on the West Coast and in the Northeast are issuing joint recommendations on vaccines, creating their own data-sharing protocols, and even exploring group purchasing to fill the vacuum left by Washington. State health leaders say these actions are necessary to restore public trust in science and protect residents from infectious diseases that don't respect borders. This trend highlights a growing fragmentation of public health authority, where states are acting as "laboratories" that could lead to conflicting health systems and further polarize the nation.</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, allegedly sent an apologetic email to Jeffrey Epstein in 2011 after he threatened to "destroy" her and her family in a menacing phone call. According to her former spokesperson, the call came after Ferguson publicly disowned Epstein and described him as a pedophile, following revelations she accepted money from him. The threatening call, described as having a "Hannibal Lecter-type voice," prompted the duchess to send the email calling Epstein a "supreme friend" to protect her family. The recent emergence of this email has caused several charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust, to sever ties with her after many years of patronage.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has awarded over $9 million to a California chef who suffered two strokes during an American Airlines flight from Miami to Madrid in 2021. The lawsuit claimed that the flight crew failed to follow protocol when the passenger, Jesus Plasencia, showed clear stroke symptoms both at the gate and mid-flight. Instead of seeking immediate medical help or diverting the plane, the pilot allegedly dismissed the concerns, resulting in a nearly eight-hour delay in treatment. As a result of the strokes, Plasencia lost his ability to speak or write and now requires constant care. The jury found the airline liable under the Montreal Convention, which governs international air travel.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has ordered actor Noel Clarke to pay a minimum of £3 million towards the Guardian newspaper's legal costs after he lost his libel lawsuit against the publisher. Clarke had sued Guardian News and Media over a series of 2021 articles that reported on multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against him. The judge dismissed his claim in August, finding the newspaper's reporting was defensible on grounds of truth and public interest. During the costs hearing, Clarke stated that he had lost his work, savings, and ability to support his family, but the judge ruled the payment was appropriate for pursuing a "far-fetched and false case."</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described the current economic landscape as a "challenging situation," citing the dual pressures of a recent inflation uptick and a slowdown in hiring. Speaking after the Fed's decision to cut interest rates, Powell noted that the "downside risks to employment have risen," shifting the central bank's focus toward the labor market. However, he also expressed continued concern about high uncertainty around the path of inflation, creating a two-sided risk for policymakers. This economic bind, sometimes known as stagflation, complicates the Fed's efforts to maintain its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment amid political pressure.

It will particularly hurt non-profit research institutions and universities that rely on top international talent but cannot afford such costs, undermining American scientific competitiveness.

The rise is driven by soaring electricity and natural gas prices, which have outpaced general inflation due to factors like grid maintenance costs and increased demand. This follows a summer of record-high air-conditioning expenses, compounding financial strain on families already dealing with record levels of household debt. The report also notes a 31% increase in unpaid energy bills since the end of 2023, indicating growing financial distress among consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a period of strengthening, the growth rate for single-family home rents in the U.S. began to slow in July, potentially signaling that landlords are facing pressure from financially strained consumers. According to data from Cotality, single-family rents rose 2.3% year-over-year in July, a rate below the pre-pandemic average and a clear loss of steam from earlier in the year. The slowdown was observed across most major metropolitan areas and at all price tiers, with markets like Miami seeing no rent growth at all. This trend contrasts with the high demand seen previously, which was fueled by soaring home-purchase prices pushing families into the rental market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes former President Donald Trump's speech at the United Nations General Assembly, portraying it as a bizarre and dishonest performance that embarrassed the United States on the world stage. The address was filled with falsehoods, from claims of ending seven wars to boasts about non-existent approval ratings and campaign merchandise sales. He attacked allies, derided climate science as a "con job," and made strange, rambling statements that left international observers bewildered. Unlike his 2018 speech where diplomats laughed, the reaction this time was one of stunned silence, with one columnist calling it his "craziest" UN speech and a foreign diplomat questioning the country's state.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, significantly increasing the likelihood of a government shutdown on October 1st. Trump claimed the meeting would not be productive, calling the Democrats' funding demands "unserious and ridiculous." In response, Democratic leaders accused the president of throwing a "tantrum" and running away from his responsibilities, stating that he will "own the shutdown." With both the House and Senate having failed to pass funding extensions and now on recess, the cancellation of negotiations leaves little time to avert an interruption in government funding, sparking a messaging war over who is to blame.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults are embracing a mindset dubbed "financial nihilism," turning to high-risk speculative investments like cryptocurrency, meme stocks, and sports betting. This trend is driven by a feeling that traditional paths to wealth, such as homeownership, are unattainable due to soaring costs, student debt, and a tight job market. Believing the conventional American dream is out of reach, they are "swinging for the fences" with risky bets in hopes of a lucky break. This behavior is seen by some experts not as irrational, but as a logical response to an economic system they feel has left them behind. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that the Trump administration must restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), that it had previously frozen. The judge granted a preliminary injunction, stating the administration likely violated federal law by failing to provide specific procedures or explanations for the funding cuts. The grants, primarily from the National Institutes of Health for critical medical research, were suspended by the administration over allegations of civil rights violations. This ruling is the latest in a series of legal setbacks for the administration's strategy of using federal funding as leverage against elite universities it criticizes.</p>

Experts from South Africa and Australia noted that what happens in Washington often influences perceptions in other countries, risking a decrease in trust in local health authorities and vaccine uptake.
