        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, returns on savings accounts like Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are declining. However, savers can still find rates around 4.50% by employing specific strategies. The article suggests considering online-only banks, which typically offer higher rates due to lower overhead costs. It also recommends using online marketplace sites for easy comparison and focusing on short-term CDs, as they currently provide more competitive rates than their long-term counterparts.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose to a 2.9% annual rate in July, slightly up from June. This figure, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, suggests President Trump's tariffs are influencing the economy, though it aligned with economists' expectations. Despite inflation remaining above the Fed's 2% target, markets still anticipate an interest rate cut in September, a sentiment supported by Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Consumer spending also increased, indicating economic resilience despite higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has strongly opposed a recent visit by U.S. Senators Roger Wicker and Deb Fischer to Taiwan, where they met with President William Lai Ching-te. A foreign ministry spokesman stated the visit seriously violates the "one-China principle" and sends a "seriously wrong signal" to advocates for Taiwanese independence. Beijing views the self-governing island as a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland. The U.S. officially acknowledges the one-China principle but is legally bound to provide Taiwan with defensive arms.</p>

          <p>German striker Nick Woltemade, 23, has completed a high-profile transfer to Newcastle United in the Premier League for a reported record fee of €85 million. Known for his unique combination of size and technical skill, Woltemade gained prominence last season with Stuttgart, scoring 17 goals and helping the club win the German Cup. Despite interest from Bayern Munich, Stuttgart held out for a higher offer from the Premier League club. The move is seen as a significant step for Woltemade's career, potentially securing his place in Germany's World Cup squad.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, seeking to block his attempt to remove her from the central bank's board. Cook's lawyers argue the dismissal is "unprecedented and illegal," based on "pretextual" allegations that she misrepresented her residency on a past mortgage application. The move is seen as part of Trump's broader effort to exert political control over the traditionally independent Federal Reserve. The case, which is expected to reach the Supreme Court, will have a preliminary hearing for a temporary restraining order.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has dismissed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office for an ethics violation, creating political instability. The ruling stems from a leaked phone call in which she informally addressed Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen as "uncle" while discussing border tensions, which critics claimed undermined the Thai army. This decision marks the third time a member of the powerful Shinawatra political dynasty has been removed from the premiership.

          <p>President Trump's executive order ending the 'de minimis' trade exemption, which allowed shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, is causing significant disruption for global businesses and consumers. The policy change, which was implemented abruptly, is expected to snarl supply chains and force retailers like Tapestry and Lululemon, as well as small businesses on platforms like Etsy, to rethink their business models. The exemption's use had surged in recent years, popularized by e-commerce giants Shein and Temu, but was criticized as a loophole that enabled unfair competition and the entry of illicit goods.</p>

The company's core e-commerce business also showed signs of revival, though profits in that division fell due to heavy investment in the competitive "instant commerce" sector.

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially revoked the extended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, effective September 1. Harris was legally entitled to six months of protection after leaving office, and former President Joe Biden had extended this detail for an additional year via an executive directive. Trump's memo cancels that extension, a move consistent with his administration's previous revocations of protection for other former officials and Biden family members. A senior advisor to Harris acknowledged the decision and thanked the Secret Service for their service and professionalism.</p>

          <p>A new book by Chris DeVille, "Such Great Heights," examines the evolution of the indie rock genre, which flourished in the 2000s with bands like Grizzly Bear and Modest Mouse. The article reviews the book, reflecting on how the internet and music blogs like Pitchfork propelled a niche, anti-mainstream aesthetic into a significant cultural and commercial force that shaped Millennial identity. It discusses how the scene's values of authenticity and sonic exploration eventually influenced mainstream pop music through producers like Jack Antonoff. The review also considers how streaming services later altered the landscape for this style of music.</p>

Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner had claimed the mergers would save "a significant amount of money," basing this on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its findings, now suggesting the changes could result in no savings or even incur additional costs. Critics, including the District Councils' Network, have expressed astonishment that the government would embark on such a massive reform without independent financial evidence.</p>

Initially seeming manageable, the disaster escalated dramatically when the levees in New Orleans failed, flooding 80% of the city and leading to nearly 1,400 deaths. The retrospective includes photos and recollections of the humanitarian crisis, the chaotic scenes at the Superdome, and the heavily criticized slow federal response. It also highlights the lasting damage, particularly in the predominantly Black Lower Ninth Ward, which residents say has never fully recovered from the devastation.</p>

          <h2>UK Bank Stocks Fall Sharply Amid Calls for a New Windfall Tax on Profits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 08:20:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Share prices for major UK banks, including NatWest, Lloyds, and Barclays, dropped significantly following a proposal for a new windfall tax on their profits. The left-leaning think tank IPPR suggested the tax could raise up to £8 billion annually to compensate taxpayers for losses incurred by the Bank of England's quantitative easing program. The IPPR argues that the program's design is effectively subsidizing commercial banks. While the Treasury has not commented, the proposal has sparked concern among investors about the future profitability of the UK banking sector.</p>

          <p>The potential British record transfer of Newcastle striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool is reportedly the key to unlocking a chain of other deals before the transfer deadline. Liverpool is expected to submit an improved offer of at least £120 million for Isak, who has publicly stated his desire to leave. For the deal to proceed, Newcastle is looking to sign two replacements: Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart, a deal which is close to completion, and Yoane Wissa from Brentford. Brentford's willingness to sell Wissa is in turn dependent on them securing a replacement, creating a complex, interdependent series of negotiations.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has indicated his support for a quarter-point interest rate cut in September, and suggested he could be open to a larger half-point cut if upcoming labor market data shows further weakening. In a recent speech, Waller expressed concern that economic conditions could deteriorate rapidly and argued the Fed should act preemptively. He anticipates that forthcoming revisions to jobs data will show the economy created far fewer jobs than initially reported. Waller, considered a potential candidate for Fed Chair, dissented from the July decision to hold rates steady. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested two firefighters battling a wildfire on Washington's Olympic Peninsula, stating they were in the country illegally. The arrests occurred during an identity check requested by the Bureau of Land Management as part of a criminal investigation into the contractors the men worked for. The incident drew sharp condemnation from Senator Patty Murray, who called the administration's immigration policy "fundamentally sick" and dangerous during wildfire season. The BLM terminated its contracts with the two Oregon-based companies, and the remaining 42 workers on the crew were escorted off federal land.</p>

The visit and Wicker's direct language drew an immediate rebuke from Beijing, which considers Taiwan part of its territory.

          <p>This opinion article analyzes the recent right-wing backlash against the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain for modernizing its "Old Timer" logo. The author argues the outrage, amplified by figures like Donald Trump Jr. and activist Christopher Rufo, is a cynical manufactured controversy designed to advance a broader authoritarian agenda. The piece details how a simple corporate rebranding was framed as a "woke" attack on American tradition to mobilize a political base. The author contends that the goal is to create fear and force institutions, from museums to corporations, to bend to a specific political ideology.</p>

          <p>An upcoming military parade in Beijing will provide a rare glimpse into the current hierarchy of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). Since the PLA does not regularly publish personnel changes, the generals given prominent roles in commanding the parade formations will be seen as rising stars. Conversely, the absence of certain high-ranking figures may signal that they have fallen out of favor or become targets of President Xi Jinping's ongoing anti-corruption campaign. This campaign has already led to the removal of at least 16 military deputies from the National People's Congress since early 2023.</p>

The event is meant to commemorate the end of World War II.

It is not yet clear whether the U.S. embassy will send a lower-level diplomat or a military attaché in the ambassador's place.</p>

          <p>A comparative analysis of global pension systems highlights a key structural difference that puts the United States behind many other developed nations. While countries like the Netherlands and Australia mandate retirement contributions, the U.S. system relies heavily on voluntary 401(k)-style plans, resulting in lower overall coverage. The Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index gave the U.S. a C+ rating, noting that while the system is solid, its voluntary nature creates significant risk. Experts suggest that mandatory contributions are a key feature of top-ranked systems, ensuring broader participation and greater retirement security for citizens.</p>

Their connection grew over shared stories and a challenge to a dance-off.

Applicants expressed various motivations, from patriotism and a desire to enforce immigration laws to seeking stable federal careers with good benefits.
