          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain chairman. This decision, revealed during the company's annual shareholder meeting, assures shareholders that Abel, the current vice chairman of noninsurance operations, will have the final say on company operations and capital deployment. Buffett stated he could still be helpful during periods of great opportunity, while Abel has been the designated CEO successor since 2021. Berkshire shares experienced only a slight dip despite the announcement and somewhat disappointing earnings, with the company also cautioning about potential tariff impacts.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns over the decline of America's movie industry and accusing other nations of offering incentives that attract filmmakers. This move has sparked debate and uncertainty within the film industry, with questions arising about whether the tariffs would apply to American production companies filming abroad and how streaming services would be affected. Industry unions warn that these tariffs could significantly harm the sector and its freelancers, while other countries, like Australia and New Zealand, have vowed to defend their screen industries. The move is said to be messaging and propaganda.</p>

          <p>Gregory J. Moore, the former divorce attorney of Aliza Sherman, has been charged with her murder, which occurred in 2013. Sherman, a Cleveland Clinic nurse, was stabbed more than 10 times near where she was to meet Moore to discuss her divorce. Moore had previously served jail time for lying to police about his whereabouts during the killing and for making bomb threats to delay trials. The indictment suggests Moore planned to kidnap Sherman to delay her divorce trial, and messages show him calling her to his locked office before the murder.</p>

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* explores the debate on whether popular culture is in a state of decline, contrasting the ease of artistic expression afforded by the internet with widespread feelings of malaise. It references Ted Gioia, who argues that America's creative energy has been sapped, leading to diminished arts and entertainment. The article acknowledges real problems such as Hollywood's reliance on intellectual property, culture wars, and unsustainable economic conditions for artists, but also highlights counterexamples like Billie Eilish and Shaboozey, suggesting that culture is still evolving. The author also speaks with Dean Kissick and Jaime Brooks about their pessimistic views on art and music, respectively.</p>

While Russia's economy has shown resilience despite Western sanctions, economists anticipate a slowdown in growth. The article notes that the ruble's appreciation was influenced by Trump's conciliatory stance towards Russia. The article also mentions the possibility of China and India being targeted by secondary sanctions due to their trade relationships with Russia, and the establishment of a netting payments system between major Russian and Chinese banks to mitigate the risk of sanctions.</p>

Montano highlights the dismantling of FEMA and NOAA, which will impair the ability to predict, prepare for, and respond to emergencies. She notes the importance of these agencies for issuing warnings, evacuation orders, and pre-positioning resources, and suggests that the cuts will lead to higher death tolls and more devastation.

          <p>The Bank of England is considering cutting interest rates due to growing concerns about the impact of President Trump's trade war on UK jobs and economic growth. Financial markets anticipate a quarter-point reduction in the base rate. Economists warn that Trump's trade policies could lead to a slowdown in trade and increased prices for consumers. The International Monetary Fund has already downgraded its 2025 growth forecast for the UK due to Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>Amid potential cuts to Medicaid and the dismantling of a federal agency supporting independent living for disabled Americans, Ari Ne'eman discusses the importance of the disability rights movement's history. Ne'eman points to the successful fight against Reagan-era cuts, which involved both massive mobilization and reframing disability rights in terms that appealed to a broad political spectrum. He also notes that disability remains a constituency with crossover appeal, making it a valuable focus in defending against cuts. Ne'eman also criticizes Secretary Kennedy's focus on preventing autism rather than improving services and support for autistic people.</p>
