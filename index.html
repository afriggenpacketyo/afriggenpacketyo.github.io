          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 04:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is intensifying its enforcement of social insurance contributions, a move aimed at addressing the nation's pension crisis. This has inadvertently increased the hiring of retirees, as companies can employ them without paying these mandatory contributions. The trend is sparking concern among the public, particularly as a record number of university graduates struggle to find employment, creating a generational tension in the job market. A new judicial interpretation from the Supreme People's Court will soon invalidate agreements to forgo these payments, potentially altering the labor landscape.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to ban the pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action, classifying it as a terrorist organization. Cooper stated the group's activities, which include claims of responsibility for property damage and violent incidents, go beyond legitimate protest. The move comes as an additional 60 individuals face prosecution for supporting the group, bringing the total arrests to over 700 since the ban was enacted in July. The government's action was prompted by incidents like an estimated £7 million in damage to jets at an RAF base.</p>

          <p>Legendary musician Billy Joel is closing his Long Island motorcycle shop, 20th Century Cycles, and will auction his personal collection of over 75 bikes. The decision follows his recent diagnosis with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting his balance, vision, and hearing. The 76-year-old singer has also canceled all tour dates through July 2026 to focus on his health and recovery. The shop, opened in 2010, was a passion project for Joel to showcase his collection and support the local Oyster Bay community.</p>

          <p>In the 11 days following the implementation of a new "one in, one out" migrant agreement between the UK and France, over 2,500 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept one person with a strong asylum case who has not attempted the crossing. This influx continues a trend that has seen over 50,000 arrivals since the Labour government took power, placing ministers under pressure to demonstrate the deal's effectiveness as a deterrent. Concerns are also rising about the use of larger, more dangerous boats by smugglers.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on her evolving appreciation for Renaissance art, which she once dismissed as unrelatable. She contrasts her youthful cynicism with her current understanding, which has been deepened by life experiences such as trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood. The author connects the historical devotion of Italian women to a Madonna painting with the raw maternal emotion in contemporary artist Jenny Saville's work. The article argues that life's significant events can open one up to the profound emotional complexity and resonance found in classical art forms.</p>
