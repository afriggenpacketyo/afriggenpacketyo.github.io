          <h2>Trump Administration Announces U.S. Withdrawal from UNESCO</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 16:12:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has declared its intention to withdraw the United States from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), citing the agency's "globalist, ideological agenda." The State Department criticized UNESCO's inclusion of Palestine as a member state in 2011 and what it terms support for divisive social causes, framing the move as consistent with an "America First" foreign policy. UNESCO's Director General, Audrey Azoulay, called the decision regrettable but anticipated, noting it contradicts the organization's work in areas like Holocaust education and could harm U.S. partners. The withdrawal is set to take effect in December 2026.</p>

          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor Technologies experienced a volatile downturn after a dramatic, Reddit-fueled surge saw its stock price triple in just a few days. The rally, which pushed the stock up 400% in July, lost momentum as shares fell over 10% following an earlier 24% gain. The speculative trading was driven by retail investors on forums like WallStreetBets, fueled by significant short interest in the company and a spike in options trading. This event mirrors the 2021 GameStop mania, showcasing the continued influence of social media on certain market sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Urban League, one of the nation's most established Civil Rights organizations, has issued a stark warning regarding the policies of the Trump administration. The group contends that these policies have created a "state of emergency" for Black Americans, specifically threatening anti-discrimination measures, personal freedoms, and economic progress within the community. This declaration highlights deep concerns from civil rights leaders about the current political direction and its impact on racial equity and justice. The statement underscores a significant point of tension between the administration and prominent advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified over 100 pages of documents related to Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, reigniting a fierce political debate. Gabbard alleged the files show evidence of a "treasonous conspiracy" by Obama administration officials to undermine Donald Trump, a claim Democrats have vehemently denied, accusing her of dangerously misrepresenting intelligence. Critics, including former officials and Democratic lawmakers, argue the documents do not alter the fundamental conclusion that Russia conducted an influence campaign to aid Trump's candidacy. The release has intensified partisan divisions over the U.S. intelligence community's credibility and actions.</p>

          <p>First amendment and human rights advocates claim that Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevara is being detained by ICE as a form of punishment for his reporting. Guevara, known for his coverage of immigration raids for a Spanish-speaking audience, was arrested in June while covering a protest, and despite the charges being dropped, he remains in federal custody. His attorneys and family express deep concern, noting his cell phone was seized and has not been returned, raising fears about the protection of his sources.

          <p>Amid growing political pressure, the U.S. Department of Justice is set to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, a key associate of the late Jeffrey Epstein, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. The move comes as the House Oversight Committee voted to subpoena Maxwell for public testimony, reflecting bipartisan demands for transparency in the case. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche stated he would personally conduct the interview to determine what Maxwell knows about others involved in Epstein's crimes. This renewed focus on Maxwell has intensified scrutiny of the investigation and its political implications.</p>

          <p>Prominent economist Mohamed El-Erian has publicly called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to resign, arguing it is necessary to protect the central bank's operational independence from political pressure. Breaking with what he sees as Wall Street consensus, El-Erian stated that while not a perfect outcome, Powell's departure would be preferable to the "growing and broadening threats" the Fed currently faces. His call comes as top administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have criticized the Fed for alleged "mission creep" and called for a review of its operations.

The Syrian government has acknowledged awareness of "shocking violations" by individuals in military fatigues and stated that the allegations will be investigated, though access to the city remains heavily restricted, making independent verification difficult.</p>

Despite the pressure and floating the idea of firing him, Trump's latest statement suggests a willingness to wait for the term to expire.

However, the television sector provided a bright spot, with on-location shoot days increasing by 17%, boosted by TV dramas and reality shows. Despite the television gains, the overall production total remains 32.5% below the region's five-year average, highlighting ongoing challenges for the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of DuPont saw a positive turn after China's market regulator announced the suspension of an antitrust investigation into the company's Chinese operations. The probe, which began in April and was widely seen as retaliation for U.S. tariffs, had created a significant overhang on the stock, despite targeting a relatively small part of DuPont's business. Investors were concerned the investigation could derail the upcoming spinoff of its electronics division. With that risk now removed, the stock has rallied to its highest level since March, ahead of the company's second-quarter earnings report. (not investment advice)</p>

Gyokeres has been a high-demand player after a prolific season in which he scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting.
