          <p>After being closed due to the Palisades Fire in January, the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) in Malibu has reopened just in time for Memorial Day weekend, much to the relief of residents and businesses. The fire had isolated Malibu, impacting local commerce significantly, with businesses like the Malibu Country Mart experiencing a severe downturn in customer traffic. While some locals are concerned about increased traffic and insensitive tourists, others are hopeful that the reopening will bring much-needed economic recovery to the area. The reopening marks a step toward healing for the community, even as visible reminders of the devastation remain. Optimism is cautiously high as residents anticipate a return to normalcy and a bustling summer season.</p>

          <p>Trygroup Inc., a major Japanese tutoring company, has issued an apology for incorrectly describing Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study materials. The false claim appeared in a video lesson for junior high school students, prompting strong criticism from patients, victims, and the Environment Ministry. Minamata disease is a neurological disorder caused by mercury poisoning, affecting thousands who consumed contaminated seafood near Minamata Bay in Kumamoto Prefecture. The company has taken the lesson video offline and issued a statement correcting the misinformation, emphasizing that the disease is not inherited but caused by mercury exposure.</p>

          <p>South Western Railways in the UK has become the first private operator to return to public ownership as part of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the entire rail network by the end of 2027. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed the move as a "watershed moment" to improve services and end 30 years of fragmentation. Rail unions welcomed the takeover, citing the poor reputation of privatized rail services, while the government anticipates savings of up to Â£150 million in compensation fees to rail operators. Other services like Southeastern and Eastern are slated for nationalization by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>A British fishing vessel has been impounded by French authorities for allegedly fishing illegally in French waters without a license. The vessel was seized in the English Channel and is currently held at the port of Boulogne while authorities consider prosecution.

The UK Foreign Office is providing support to the British national involved, while the Conservatives have criticized France for what they see as double standards in enforcing maritime laws.</p>

Despite overwhelming evidence of her innocence, defense attorneys attacked her character, bringing up her past as a stripper and financial difficulties.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work-related stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their canine companions. The research found that dogs of owners with higher job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, even when accounting for other stressors in the home. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," suggests that dogs are highly sensitive to their owners' moods and can pick up on subtle cues of stress, ultimately affecting their well-being. The study highlights the importance of separating work from home life to protect the mental health of both owners and their pets.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly's jail sentence for inciting racial hatred via a tweet has ignited a free speech controversy in the UK. Connolly posted a racist message following false rumors about an immigrant's involvement in a murder case, which led to her imprisonment. While some argue her sentence is excessive and infringes on free speech, others emphasize the importance of holding individuals accountable for inciting violence. The case has sparked broader discussions about the limits of online expression and the role of law enforcement in monitoring online activity.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States. Internal documents suggest the agency argues that emissions from these plants do not significantly contribute to climate change, a claim disputed by scientists. The proposal is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to uproot policies aimed at curbing climate change. Critics argue that this move could have significant negative impacts on public health and the environment, as power plants are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
