          <p>Following his death at age 46, fans of British boxer Ricky Hatton are reflecting on his legacy as the sport's 'people's champion.' The article highlights the profound connection he had with his supporters, thousands of whom traveled from Manchester to Las Vegas for his major fights between 2007 and 2009. Hatton's humble, working-class background and exhilarating fighting style endeared him to a devoted fanbase that united across city rivalries. These supporters cherish the memories of his high-profile bouts against figures like Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, which defined an era in British boxing.</p>

          <h2>UK Opioid-Related Deaths Found to be Over 50% Higher Than Official Statistics</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from King's College London reveals that official statistics in England and Wales have missed over 13,000 opioid-related deaths between 2011 and 2022, suggesting the crisis is more than 50% larger than previously understood. The discrepancy is attributed to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) not having access to detailed coroner reports where specific drugs are named. This significant undercounting has raised concerns among public health experts and politicians, who argue that flawed data has likely hampered government policy, funding, and treatment strategies aimed at tackling addiction effectively.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian journalist Dmytro Khyliuk, who was detained by Russian forces at the start of the full-scale invasion, has been released after three and a half years as part of a rare prisoner swap involving civilians. In this article, he describes the harrowing conditions of his imprisonment, which included beatings, dog attacks, and starvation, while noting that captured soldiers endured even worse torture. His release brings attention to the thousands of Ukrainian civilians who remain missing or illegally detained in Russia, whose government does not provide lists, creating immense challenges for their families and for Ukrainian officials seeking their return.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has declared his intention to sue The New York Times for $15 billion, alleging defamation and libel. In a social media post, Trump accused the newspaper of being a "mouthpiece for the Radical Left Democrat Party" and claimed it has been allowed to "freely lie, smear, and defame" him for too long. This legal action follows previous unsuccessful lawsuits by Trump against news organizations, including a $100 million case against the Times in 2023 that was dismissed by a judge on constitutional grounds.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for accelerated efforts to build a unified national market, framing it as essential for China to gain a competitive advantage globally and achieve its development objectives. In an article published in the Communist Party's journal Qiushi, Xi outlined key tasks, with a primary focus on curbing excessive and damaging price competition among domestic firms. The directive encourages industry associations to prioritize product quality over low prices, signaling a strategic shift to strengthen internal economic cohesion and phase out obsolete industrial capacity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite severe floods and heavy rains damaging large areas of farmland in India, particularly in the state of Punjab, economists forecast that the impact on overall inflation will be limited. Analysts suggest that sufficient cereal stocks and the contained nature of the crop damage will likely prevent consumer price growth from surpassing the central bank's 4% target midpoint. A recent cut in the goods and services tax is also expected to help keep inflation in check, providing the Reserve Bank of India with continued flexibility to implement monetary easing policies to support economic growth.

The author contends that for democracy to be preserved, it is essential for the Democratic party to regain control of the House of Representatives to act as a constitutional check on presidential power, focusing on economic issues to win over voters.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson and are piecing together the events of the attack. Investigators believe Robinson fired a single shot from a high-powered rifle from the roof of a nearby campus building before fleeing. Evidence recovered includes the rifle wrapped in a towel, as well as bullet casings with politically charged inscriptions. The suspect's father reportedly recognized his son from surveillance photos and urged him to surrender, leading to his capture after a large-scale manhunt.</p>

          <p>When questioned about the decision to lower flags to half-staff for conservative activist Charlie Kirk but not for assassinated Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, President Trump initially stated he was "not familiar" with Hortman's case. He later suggested he would have considered the gesture for the Democratic lawmaker if the state's governor had requested it. The exchange highlights the intense political debate surrounding recent acts of political violence, with critics accusing the president and his allies of selectively grieving and blaming only one side for the rise in targeted attacks.</p>

Miran is expected to participate in this week's key policy meeting, where he could play a role in President Trump's push for a substantial interest rate cut to stimulate the economy.

          <p>The sustained polling lead and recent high-profile defections to Reform UK are amplifying strategic anxieties within Britain's two major political parties. For the governing Labour Party, recent internal turmoil is compounded by the fear that their missteps could inadvertently lead to the rise of a party they deeply oppose. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party faces an existential crisis as it continues to lose members to Nigel Farage's populist movement. This political shift is forcing both Labour and the Conservatives to re-evaluate their strategies and confront difficult questions ahead of their annual party conferences.</p>

According to reports from the island's defense ministry, Taiwan currently has a backlog of $21.54 billion in U.S. arms orders. While most orders are on schedule, some key systems, such as the AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapon and F-16V fighter jets, have faced production and testing delays. The influx of these weapons systems is seen as crucial for strengthening Taiwan's deterrence and war-fighting capacity.</p>

          <p>Reports of smoke or fumes inside airplane cabins are occurring at a rate of more than three per day, according to a review of FAA data, prompting growing health concerns among flight crews and passengers. These "fume events" can be caused by engine oil or other fluids leaking into the aircraft's air supply system, potentially releasing toxic particles. Medical experts have treated flight attendants for nervous system problems linked to toxic exposure. A recent investigation found these incidents were most common on the Airbus A320 family of jets, which accounted for 61% of reported events last year.</p>

The ruling ensures Cook can participate in the upcoming interest rate vote and represents a setback for Trump, who has been actively trying to reshape the Fed's board and has publicly pressured it to cut rates more aggressively.
