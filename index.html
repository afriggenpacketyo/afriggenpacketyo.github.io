          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was captured after escaping from an Arkansas prison where he was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault. Hardin, who impersonated a corrections officer to escape, was found 1.5 miles from the prison after a nearly two-week manhunt involving bloodhounds, horseback officers, drones, and a U.S. Border Patrol team. Investigators are eager to question Hardin about his escape, which involved a lapse in verification procedures by a prison officer. Hardin had previously pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to 50 years for a 1997 sexual assault, bringing relief to the victim's family upon his capture.</p>

          <p>In Arizona, Border Patrol agents discovered seventeen migrants crammed into an RV and a sedan amidst sweltering heat, leading to the arrest of a U.S. citizen for human smuggling. The migrants, all from Mexico and including a minor, were found in inhumane conditions with limited space, ventilation, and no access to running water, while the rest were wedged into a small sedan that was discovered during a vehicle stop. Authorities say this rescue likely prevented a tragedy, highlighting the dangers migrants face in the hands of smugglers who treat human lives as cargo. The rescued individuals are being processed for expedited removal, and investigators are working to determine whether others were involved.</p>

          <p>Merryl Hoffman, a 63-year-old attorney, experienced a sudden cardiac arrest on a Manhattan street, but was saved by two passing nurses who performed CPR until an ambulance arrived. The nurses, Sabrina Castle and Gianna Formisano, were walking to work at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center when they stumbled upon the scene and immediately took action. Hoffman had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placed in her chest to prevent future cardiac arrests and began cardiac rehabilitation, later reuniting with the nurses to express her gratitude. The article highlights the importance of early CPR in increasing survival rates for cardiac arrest patients and the impact of bystanders' actions in medical emergencies.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has been innovating drone warfare, surprising Russia with creative attacks, including a recent strike on Russian warplanes using small drones hidden in trucks. The country also pioneered the use of sea drones, even shooting down a Russian warplane from the Black Sea. These drones have created problems for Russian ground forces by spotting and attacking troop gatherings, limiting Russia's advantage. Russia has responded by developing its own drone arsenal, partnering with Iran to produce the Geran, while Ukraine aims to produce over two million drones this year, transforming modern warfare.</p>

          <p>Kristi Noem, as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, is spearheading the Trump administration's immigration agenda, marked by strict enforcement and a focus on mass deportations. She has revoked Biden-era policies, deputized personnel across federal agencies, and enlisted local law enforcement to expand deportation operations. Noem has taken on the role of a high-profile surrogate, touring the southern border and engaging with world leaders, all while facing scrutiny for her approach. Critics argue her leadership marks a departure from past secretaries, citing concerns over competence and the use of political theater.</p>

          <p>An Atlantic article critiques the increasing prevalence of wealth in television, arguing that shows are now dominated by portrayals of affluent lifestyles, often at the expense of relatable narratives. The author contends that this trend, exemplified by shows like 'And Just Like That,' creates a distorted view of American life, focusing on the superficial details of exorbitant wealth. This shift towards "elevated" content, where money is not an issue, diminishes the ability to empathize with average people whose lives feel increasingly precarious. The article suggests that this obsession with wealth reshapes our collective psyche, promoting wealth as the sole marker of a significant life and rich people as the only ones worthy of our attention.</p>

However, the BBC article cautions that these massive totals do not reveal how the funds will be allocated across different departments, with some departments receiving priority funding while others continue to face financial strain. The review will prioritize long-term projects and security, with limited funds available for short-term spending. The government aims to use the review to demonstrate its commitment to rebuilding Britain, but faces the challenge of convincing a skeptical public and managing internal disagreements over spending priorities.</p>

The article suggests considering factors like investment returns and the size of one's nest egg to determine the best strategy.

          <p>ABC News presents a timeline of events surrounding the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native living in Maryland, to a mega-prison in El Salvador. Despite a 2019 court order protecting him from deportation, Abrego Garcia was deported in March based on allegations of gang membership, which his family denies. The timeline details the legal battles, administrative errors, and political interventions that led to his eventual return to the U.S. to face criminal charges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR article examines the concept of federal rental aid with time limits, focusing on Delaware's approach, which includes a seven-year limit, work requirements, and a savings incentive. The Delaware program allows tenants to save money by keeping monthly payments flat, with extra funds going into a savings account. While some experts support time limits to encourage turnover, others argue they can be detrimental without adequate support, citing a failed experiment in Washington state. The success of Delaware's program is attributed to its comprehensive support system, including savings accounts and assistance with budgeting, childcare, and health insurance.</p>

          <p>China's younger generation is shifting away from traditional baijiu, a strong distilled liquor, towards lighter, fruit-flavored beverages, prompting changes in the liquor industry. In Baisha, a town known for baijiu production, farmers are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum, reflecting this shift in consumer preferences. Chinese liquor brands are innovating their products to appeal to younger consumers, focusing on low-alcohol, fruit-flavored options.

It argues that this self-enrichment undermines American democracy and degrades public faith in government.

This expansion could remove structural restraints on the president and enable further lawlessness, necessitating a defense against the investigation based on its merits rather than procedural immunity grounds.</p>
