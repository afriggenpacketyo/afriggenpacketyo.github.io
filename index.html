          <p>While the administration of Philippines' President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. touts an improved environment for journalists, the reality remains complex. Global press freedom rankings have slightly improved and journalist killings have decreased since the hostile Duterte era, but critics argue these gains are superficial. Rights groups and reporters point to continued intimidation, politically motivated prosecutions like that of Frenchie Mae Cumpio, and online harassment as evidence of a persistent culture of impunity. Experts suggest that without systemic reforms, such as strengthening freedom of information laws and ensuring perpetrators of violence are prosecuted, the press's role as a watchdog remains under significant threat from powerful interests.</p>

          <p>A judge has ruled that military witness statements from 1972 can be used as evidence in the trial of Soldier F, a former British paratrooper accused of murder and attempted murder on Bloody Sunday. The prosecution argued these statements, from two fellow soldiers who are now deceased or unwilling to testify, are the only evidence capable of proving Soldier F fired on civilians. The defense contested their reliability, citing changing accounts and a lack of opportunity for cross-examination. This ruling is a critical step in the long-running legal proceedings concerning the 1972 incident where British soldiers shot 13 civil rights demonstrators in Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p>As Czechia's parliamentary election approaches, the ruling center-right Spolu coalition, led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala, faces a significant challenge from the opposition. The government is campaigning on its strong pro-Western and pro-Ukraine foreign policy, but many voters are more concerned with domestic economic issues like high inflation and the government's austerity measures. Despite recent positive economic indicators, the opposition ANO party, led by populist oligarch Andrej Babis, holds a substantial lead in the polls. A potential post-election coalition between ANO and pro-Russian, anti-NATO parties could shift the country's geopolitical orientation, making this a pivotal election for Czechia's future.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, New York street artist Felix Morelo has generated controversy and praise for his latest public art. Known for drawing interactive chalk circles on sidewalks, Morelo began creating circles labeled "Charlie Kirk spot" to process his anger at those celebrating the killing and to encourage dialogue about political polarization. The artwork has elicited strong reactions, with some people defacing the spots while others have offered messages of support. Morelo stated that the project is a social experiment intended to foster understanding and tolerance, reflecting the deep political divides currently present in the country.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested a man in his forties in connection with a major cyberattack that has caused significant disruption at several European airports, including Heathrow. The incident targeted Collins Aerospace, a company providing essential baggage and check-in software, forcing some airlines to resort to manual, paper-based systems and causing hundreds of flight delays. EU officials have identified the attack as involving ransomware, a type of malicious software used to extort money. The investigation is ongoing, and the software provider has not yet given a timeline for a full system restoration, urging airports to prepare for continued manual workarounds.</p>

          <p>A Standard Chartered survey reveals that a majority of multinational companies are turning to artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing to mitigate rising operational costs. Approximately 62% of the 1,200 senior executives polled anticipate cost increases between 5% and 14% over the next few years, driven by geopolitical uncertainty, supply chain realignments, and tariffs. This financial pressure is particularly acute for companies in the ASEAN region. The survey underscores a strategic shift where technological innovation is now considered as crucial as traditional economic factors in shaping global trade and supply chain strategies for the future.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to his show with an emotional monologue after a week-long suspension by ABC, addressing the controversy over his comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Visibly emotional, Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the murder or to blame a specific group, expressing that he understood why some were upset by his remarks. His return came amid political pressure and threats from the Trump administration regarding ABC's broadcast licenses, leading some affiliate stations to preempt the show. Kimmel used his platform to champion free speech, framing the issue as a critical defense against authoritarian pressure on the media.</p>

          <p>An independent review has found that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) engaged in unlawful surveillance practices, including using journalists' phone data to identify internal leaks. The report by Angus McCullough KC revealed 21 instances of illegal use of covert powers to uncover reporters' sources, double the number previously admitted by the PSNI. The investigation also found that for over a decade, the phone numbers of hundreds of journalists were systematically checked against police call logs in "defensive operations" to find unauthorized contact with officers. This practice, which was not legally vetted, raises significant concerns about data protection and freedom of the press.</p>

          <p>In a major medical breakthrough, doctors have successfully treated Huntington's disease for the first time, using a one-time gene therapy that slows its progression by 75%. The treatment involves a complex, multi-hour brain surgery to deliver a therapy that reduces the levels of the toxic protein responsible for killing brain cells. Huntington's is a devastating, inherited neurodegenerative disorder that has long been considered untreatable. The spectacular results from the clinical trial offer profound hope to affected families, suggesting patients could gain decades of quality life and opening the possibility of preventative treatments that could stop the disease before symptoms appear.</p>

The report found that asylum seekers are often taken on long-distance journeys for appointments, with one trip to a doctor costing a reported £600. The system appears to default to booking taxis for necessary travel without presenting public transport as an option, leading to questionable expenses. The Home Office stated it does not keep specific figures on total taxi spending, but the revelations have sparked political criticism over inefficient use of public funds.</p>

Many medical experts have reiterated that there is no solid scientific foundation for the claim, while pregnant individuals noted the announcement creates unnecessary fear around one of the very few pain relievers considered safe during pregnancy.

With an inadequate supply of sanitary products and a strict limit on the number of undergarments they can own, women are often forced into unsanitary and embarrassing situations. The lack of privacy, limited access to cleaning supplies like bleach, and the necessity of dealing with predominantly male guards for extra supplies compound the problem. The author argues that this disregard for their biological needs serves as a secondary punishment, suggesting a simple change to dark-colored underwear could restore a small measure of dignity.</p>

The rate at which employees are quitting has fallen to a low not seen since 2016, driven by economic anxiety and a desire for stability over the risks of job-switching. While low turnover might seem positive for employers, it can mask rising employee disengagement and underutilization of skills, leading to lost productivity. This lack of labor market mobility could also contribute to flatter wage growth and a period of economic stagnation. (not investment advice)</p>

The narrative being built around Kirk blurs his specific Pentecostal faith into a generic, nationalist version of Christianity that aligns with MAGA's political goals.

          <p>In his first show back after a brief suspension, Jimmy Kimmel delivered a monologue that balanced contrition with defiance, signaling he will not back down from his criticism of Donald Trump. While expressing that he never intended to make light of Charlie Kirk's death, he stopped short of a direct apology and instead pivoted to a robust defense of free speech against what he described as anti-American threats from the government. The episode highlighted the escalating battle between the late-night host and the president, who has publicly targeted Kimmel and his network, ABC. The return has solidified Kimmel's position as a prominent voice of opposition in the media landscape.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in New York, expressing a desire for a more stable and healthy partnership between the two nations. During the discussions, held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, Li urged Ottawa to adopt a "correct" perception of China to improve bilateral ties. Relations between the two countries have been strained recently, particularly after Canada imposed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, steel, and aluminum, which prompted retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on Canadian canola imports. Carney described the meeting as a "very constructive set of discussions."</p>

          <p>An ecosystem of right-leaning podcasts and online shows that helped elect Donald Trump appears to be fracturing six months into his second term. While some hosts remain loyal supporters, others like Joe Rogan and Andrew Schulz have grown more critical, expressing disillusionment with the administration's actions on issues like government transparency and foreign policy. This shift within the influential "manosphere," which reaches millions of young male listeners, could present a challenge for the MAGA movement's ability to maintain its unconventional coalition of voters. The fragmentation suggests that the once-solid support from these key media figures is no longer guaranteed.</p>

          <p>A homeowner in North Carolina has documented the removal of an invasive Bradford pear tree from his yard, taking advantage of a state-run bounty program. The initiative offers residents a free native tree in exchange for cutting down a Bradford pear, which is considered an ecological threat. These trees are structurally weak, prone to breaking in storms, and their dense growth can choke out native plant species essential for a healthy ecosystem. By replacing invasive species with native ones, homeowners can support local biodiversity, improve water conservation, and create more resilient and beneficial landscapes.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's return to television, prompted by a wave of celebrity and grassroots pressure on Disney, represents a notable victory for free speech and a new form of resistance in the second Trump term. The successful campaign to reinstate his show was driven by individual actors, musicians, and comedians rather than traditional political or corporate institutions. However, the victory is incomplete, as major station groups Sinclair and Nexstar continue to boycott the show, leaving it unavailable in nearly a quarter of the country. This situation illustrates both the potential for celebrity-led movements to influence corporate decisions and the significant structural obstacles that remain in challenging a politically-charged media landscape.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised his productive meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, which was followed by Trump's surprising declaration that Ukraine could win the war. Zelenskyy described the rhetorical pivot as a "big shift," noting that the U.S. president now seems well-informed about the battlefield situation. This marks a dramatic change from Trump's previous stance that Ukraine would likely have to cede territory to Russia to achieve peace. While Ukrainian officials expressed cautious optimism, they emphasized that concrete actions and continued U.S. support will be more important than the change in rhetoric alone.</p>

          <p>A columnist highlights the stark contrast between the messages delivered at Charlie Kirk's memorial service, arguing it reveals a deep disconnect in President Trump's approach to tragedy and politics. Just moments after Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, tearfully forgave her husband's killer and called for love over hate, Trump took the stage to spew venom at his political enemies. The article posits that while Erika Kirk embodied a message of Christian forgiveness, Trump immediately contradicted it with a call for revenge, ad-libbing, "I hate my opponent." This moment underscored Trump's role as an "inciter in chief" rather than a uniter, consistently choosing division over healing.</p>

          <p>Despite their reputation for progressive politics, California Democrats are increasingly adopting a more pragmatic, results-oriented approach to governing. This shift is evident in San Francisco, where the new mayor is focusing on public safety and housing, and in Sacramento, where lawmakers have reformed environmental laws to streamline construction and energy projects. This move towards the center is a response to voter concerns about the high cost of living, which has caused some to abandon the party. The new model combines principled resistance to Trump's policies with a practical focus on affordability, aiming to improve residents' lives while maintaining core values.</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's claims of an autism "epidemic," scientists and psychologists assert that the steady rise in diagnoses is not due to a new environmental cause but to evolving diagnostic criteria and improved screening. The definition of autism has expanded significantly over decades, now encompassing a wider spectrum of behaviors that were previously categorized differently or overlooked. Furthermore, increased awareness and universal screening recommendations have led to better identification, particularly in underserved communities. Researchers emphasize that the rate of what is considered "profound autism" has remained stable, with the growth occurring in milder cases on the spectrum.</p>
