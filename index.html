            <h2>Trump Explains Reversal on Tariffs, Citing Market Anxiety</h2>

            <p>President Trump abruptly reversed course on his proposed tariffs, announcing a 90-day pause for most nations except China after markets reacted negatively. Trump stated that he sensed unease in the markets and acknowledged the need for flexibility, despite previously insisting on the tariffs. White House officials attempted to portray the reversal as a strategic move to gain negotiating leverage, particularly with allies. However, the China factor looms large, with tariffs on Chinese goods escalating significantly after Beijing's retaliatory measures.</p>

            <p>President Trump's decision to pause his global trade war came after ominous moves in the bond market rattled the White House, causing anxiety among Republicans. Aides attempted to spin the reversal as a master class in negotiation, but Trump acknowledged economic reality forced the new approach. While the White House claims the tariffs were punishing China and prompting trade renegotiations, uncertainty remains about the long-term impact and whether the U.S. will damage global trust as a place for trade and investment.</p>

            <p>President Trump has directed the Justice Department to investigate Miles Taylor, who criticized Trump under the pseudonym "Anonymous," and Chris Krebs, who refuted claims of election fraud. Trump accused Taylor of leaking classified information and Krebs of weaponizing his position, ordering investigations into their activities. Critics argue that Trump is using the Justice Department for revenge, raising concerns about civil liberties. These actions come amid a flurry of executive orders signed by Trump, including measures aimed at reviving US shipbuilding and deregulating water pressure in household appliances.</p>

            <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer shared four lessons from the market's volatility following Trump's tariff announcements: avoid panicking, recognize that markets punish greed, expect drama from Trump, and don't bet against good companies. He emphasized that investors should stay the course and avoid making emotional decisions during market sell-offs. Cramer also noted that while uncertainty is expected with Trump, investors can assume he will adjust policies if they harm the economy. He advised against selling strong companies at their lows, even if they are affected by tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent denied the changes were influenced by market falls, while Trump stated the amendments were necessary because people were "getting yippy." The ongoing trade dispute between the US and China could significantly reduce trade between the two nations.</p>

            <p>The government has offered to buy coking coal to keep steel production going at British Steel in Scunthorpe, as the plant is running out of raw materials. The government's offer is a way to buy time while negotiations over the future of the plant continue. Ministers prefer a commercial solution to secure the long-term future of the plant, but the immediate issue is who will pay for shipments of iron pellets and coke.</p>

            <p>US shares surged after President Trump announced a suspension of steep tariffs on goods from most countries, instead imposing a 10% import tax rate. The S&P 500 soared 9.5% in the biggest one-day rally since 2008. The White House said it was backing off on higher levies for trade partners that had agreed to negotiate, but Trump said he would raise tariffs on goods from China even further, to at least 125% "effective immediately".</p>
