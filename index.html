She emphasized the importance of the U.S.-Ukraine partnership, highlighting the crucial support received from the U.S., including weapons like Javelins, which were initially provided under President Trump. Markarova also discussed a new economic partnership agreement aimed at creating an investment fund to benefit both nations, focusing on opportunities in agriculture, energy, and critical minerals.

          <p>According to the article, Ukraine is set to receive additional Patriot air-defense systems, including one being transferred from Israel after refurbishment, with Western allies discussing the logistics of providing another from Germany or Greece. This development comes as Russia has increased its attacks on Ukrainian cities, including a deadly missile strike on Kyiv. President Trump's stance on the war has softened, with a recent cordial meeting with President Zelensky at Pope Francisâ€™ funeral and the signing of a minerals deal paving the way for more U.S. military aid. The article also notes Ukraine's ongoing need for more air defenses to counter Russian attacks and protect key areas like the capital, Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have arrested relatives of Carmen Lau, a former Hong Kong politician who protested against the construction of China's new "mega-embassy" in London. Lau, who fled Hong Kong five years ago, participated in a rally against the embassy, citing concerns about China's authoritarian regime. Within 48 hours, her elderly aunt and uncle were arrested and questioned, followed by another aunt a week later. Lau believes the arrests are an attempt to suppress her "anti-Chinese" activities in the UK and fears the new embassy will become a hub for transnational repression.</p>
