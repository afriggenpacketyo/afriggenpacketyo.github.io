          <p>Week 3 of the NFL season delivered unexpected outcomes, with several teams, including the Cleveland Browns, Carolina Panthers, and Chicago Bears, securing their first victories. The Indianapolis Colts, led by Daniel Jones, maintained their undefeated status with a dominant win over the Tennessee Titans. Meanwhile, the San Francisco 49ers also remained unbeaten after a narrow victory against the Arizona Cardinals. These results defied early-season expectations, with other notable games seeing the Buffalo Bills defeat the Miami Dolphins and the Minnesota Vikings dominating the Cincinnati Bengals. The week underscored the unpredictable nature of the NFL season, reshuffling early standings and showcasing both established and emerging talent.</p>

          <p>An animal handler tragically died after a tiger attack at Growler Pines Tiger Preserve in southeastern Oklahoma. Ryan Easley was killed in what the preserve described as an "accident," emphasizing the inherent risks and Easley's deep love and respect for the animals under his care. All tours at the private facility, which offers visitor viewings and training demonstrations, have been canceled indefinitely. This incident serves as a somber reminder of the unpredictable nature of wild animals, even in controlled environments, and the profound connection handlers form with them. The preserve's statement highlighted Easley's understanding of these risks, rooted not in recklessness but in a genuine bond with the animals he cared for daily, leaving the community in mourning.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands gathered in Arizona for a memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot on September 10. President Donald Trump hailed Kirk as a "great American hero" and "martyr," while Vice-President JD Vance and other officials praised his political legacy. Kirk's widow, Erika, tearfully announced her forgiveness for the alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, and vowed to continue her husband's work as the new CEO of Turning Point USA. The event, resembling a political rally with Christian music and strong conservative rhetoric, underscored Kirk's significant influence on the MAGA youth movement and the deep political divisions in America.</p>

          <p>China's central bank kept its one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, defying expectations of a cut despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate reduction. This decision aligns with economists' predictions that Beijing would hold off on major stimulus amid a recent stock market rally, even as economic data signals fatigue. Retail sales and industrial output growth slowed in August, and consumer prices fell, indicating sluggish domestic demand. Policymakers are expected to implement marginal monetary easing later this year to meet the annual growth target of around 5%, with a focus shifting from risk management to reflating the economy.

          <p>China's GJ-11 "Sharp Sword" uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), with visible folding hinges on its wings, appears to be adapted for potential deployment on aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships. This design modification, hinting at a naval variant possibly designated GJ-21, was also suggested by images on the emblem of China's first Type 076 amphibious landing ship, informally known as a "drone carrier." These clues suggest the GJ-11 could be the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone, positioning it for crucial roles in intelligent warfare. The development signifies a significant advancement in the People's Liberation Army's uncrewed systems capabilities.</p>

          <p>Scientists are observing a significant "warm blob" anomaly in the Pacific Ocean south of Alaska, with sea surface temperatures reaching record highs in August. This phenomenon, marking the fourth-largest marine heatwave since 1982, spans a vast region and has profound implications for marine ecosystems and winter weather patterns. Previous occurrences, like the 2013-2016 blob, devastated fishing industries, triggered toxic algae blooms, and led to mass marine animal deaths. Researchers warn that human-driven climate change is intensifying these marine heatwaves. Meteorologists are now incorporating this year's warm blob into winter forecasts, anticipating potential Arctic temperatures for the Eastern United States.</p>

Experts warn that such shortages are becoming the new normal due to rising global temperatures and human-driven climate change, making food more expensive and less abundant globally.

Despite a brilliant performance from pitcher Emmet Sheehan, the bullpen faltered in the eighth inning, turning a 1-0 lead into a loss. Manager Dave Roberts expressed continued faith in struggling reliever Blake Treinen. The game marked a franchise record for home attendance, surpassing 4 million fans for the first time. The Dodgers, with a magic number of three, are focused on clinching their 12th West Division title in 13 years.</p>

          <p>Former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg criticized the relationship between UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump, calling the "endless knee-bending" "slightly cringey." Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg urged the Prime Minister to uphold British values, especially regarding the Trump administration's lukewarm attitude towards NATO, the transatlantic military alliance. He argued that courting the US president stemmed from a "miscalculation" that the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and the EU, emphasizing that such a choice is inevitable. Clegg also condemned Elon Musk's recent comments at a UK rally as an "outrageous intrusion into our sovereignty," reflecting broader concerns about foreign influence and national integrity.</p>

          <p>Former Labour MP Zarah Sultana expressed her determination to "reconcile and move forward" with Jeremy Corbyn following a public dispute over the formation of their new left-wing political party, "Your Party." Sultana, who had threatened legal action over "baseless attacks" on her character, has now dropped the claim. The conflict arose after Sultana promoted a membership sign-up, which Corbyn later dismissed as "unauthorised," alleging a "sexist boys' club" and her exclusion. Despite the deep divisions, both reportedly wish for the party's inaugural conference in November to proceed, aiming to unify the grassroots movement and resolve leadership questions.</p>

This demand drew sharp criticism from Democrats, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer calling it "the path to a dictatorship" and arguing that Trump is weaponizing the Justice Department.

The World Food Programme reports an unprecedented increase in child malnutrition, endangering over three million children, as international aid has sharply declined. The U.S. and other donors have significantly cut funding, partly due to the Taliban government's policies, including restrictions on women working for NGOs, which impede aid delivery.

The Philippines, which also claims the feature as Bajo de Masinloc within its exclusive economic zone, has vehemently condemned such a potential move as "illegitimate and unlawful." This development would undoubtedly escalate existing tensions in the highly contested South China Sea, where overlapping territorial claims frequently lead to diplomatic disputes and standoffs.
