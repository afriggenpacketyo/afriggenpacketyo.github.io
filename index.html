          <p>Major gun rights organizations, including the NRA and Gun Owners of America, have publicly opposed reported discussions within the Trump administration to restrict firearm purchases by transgender individuals. These discussions, said to be in early stages at the Department of Justice, follow several high-profile shootings involving transgender perpetrators. While the DOJ has downplayed targeting a specific group, focusing instead on mental health correlations, advocates for LGBTQ+ rights have condemned the potential ban as discriminatory and misguided, highlighting that transgender people are more likely to be victims of crime.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated he has no knowledge of a reported 2019 SEAL Team 6 mission in North Korea, which allegedly resulted in the deaths of unarmed civilians. According to a New York Times report citing numerous anonymous sources, the classified operation was approved by Trump to plant a surveillance device for monitoring Kim Jong Un's communications. The mission was aborted after the SEALs feared detection and opened fire on an approaching boat, whose crew was later believed to be civilians diving for shellfish. The Pentagon has declined to comment on the report.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London's Parliament Square against the UK government's proscription of the campaign group Palestine Action resulted in at least 150 arrests. The government banned the group under the Terrorism Act in July, making any expression of support a criminal offense. Despite warnings from the Metropolitan Police, hundreds of protesters, including many pensioners, gathered to defy the ban by holding signs and chanting. Police systematically arrested individuals expressing support, leading to tense confrontations, while human rights groups like Amnesty International criticized the arrests as a blow to peaceful protest.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has ceased providing a security detail for former Vice President Kamala Harris, following internal criticism that the assignment diverted officers from crime suppression duties. The protection was implemented after President Trump revoked Harris's Secret Service detail, a move Mayor Karen Bass called an act of political retaliation. The LAPD officers' union strongly objected to the use of city resources to protect a private citizen who could afford her own security. The California Highway Patrol continues to provide protection, though the future arrangement remains unclear.</p>

Major cities including Philadelphia and New York City are in the path of storms expected to bring damaging winds, large hail, and heavy rainfall. The National Weather Service has issued a Level 2 of 4 flash flood risk for a corridor stretching from Philadelphia to Bridgeport, Connecticut.

          <p>A 45rpm record by The Earwigs, an obscure 1980s power pop band from Orange County, has unexpectedly become a collector's item, with copies selling for up to $500 online. The band's frontman, Michael Ubaldini, was unaware of the record's value until recently, having sold personal copies for just $20. This newfound interest has prompted a revival, with the band reuniting for a release party for their 'lost' debut album, originally recorded in 1981 but never released.

The incident follows the Trump administration's designation of the Tren de Aragua gang as a terrorist organization and the placement of a $50 million bounty on Maduro.

          <p>American farmers in the Midwest are experiencing a significant drop in exports as the ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. have prompted China to seek alternative suppliers, particularly Brazil. The situation has created a divide within the agricultural community, with some farmers remaining hopeful that President Trump's approach will eventually secure better trade deals. Others are deeply concerned that the loss of the massive Chinese market for commodities like soybeans cannot be replaced, leading to long-term economic damage for the U.S. heartland. The future of this critical trade relationship remains highly uncertain.</p>

          <p>Gulf states like the UAE and Saudi Arabia are undergoing economic transformations that are causing friction between local populations and foreign workers. Government initiatives such as "Emiratization" and "Saudization" aim to increase local employment in the private sector, shifting away from state-provided jobs. This has positioned foreign workers, who are simultaneously being courted with new residency and ownership rules, as labor market rivals. The changes are challenging the traditional social contract, where the state guaranteed employment, and are creating new cultural clashes over lifestyle and social norms.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's focus on crime in Democrat-run cities like Chicago, an analysis of 2024 data reveals that the four large cities with the highest murder rates are all in Republican-led states. These cities are Jackson, Mississippi; Birmingham, Alabama; St. Louis, Missouri; and Memphis, Tennessee. The report highlights a significant nationwide trend of falling violent crime rates, with an unprecedented decrease over the last two years. Critics suggest the administration's rhetoric selectively targets cities in blue states while ignoring higher crime rates in red states.</p>

          <p>Germany's pay-as-you-go pension system, established in 1955 based on the assumption of a high birth rate, is facing a severe demographic crisis. A rapidly aging population and declining birth rates mean that by 2039, a third of the current workforce will be retired, with fewer contributors supporting a growing number of pensioners. This imbalance is putting immense pressure on the social security system, threatening to increase taxes and make Germany less attractive for investment. Economists are proposing solutions, including a new tax on wealthier pensioners, to prevent the system's collapse. (not investment advice)</p>

To identify these forgotten soldiers, a team is now employing forensic genealogy, combining advanced DNA analysis with historical family tree research. This effort, described as the "ultimate cold case," has already generated genetic profiles for two soldiers and identified potential family names. The project aims to restore the identities of these early American soldiers, who were given a formal military burial in 2023.</p>
