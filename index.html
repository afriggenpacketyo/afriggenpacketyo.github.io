          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Vance Boelter on six counts, including two capital murder charges, for the targeted killings of a former Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. Prosecutors announced this is the first step toward potentially seeking the death penalty, a decision that will be made by the Attorney General in the coming months. The indictment also covers the non-fatal shooting of a state senator and his wife. Authorities also revealed details from a letter written by Boelter, where he made bizarre claims about being a secret operative and confessed to the crimes.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has publicly called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to explain her previous comments and the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation files. This comes after the Justice Department stated it found no evidence of a "client list," contradicting Bondi's earlier remarks. The call for transparency is echoed by other Republicans, with some representatives pushing for legislation to force the release of all documents and for Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before Congress. The growing pressure from within the GOP indicates significant dissatisfaction with the administration's current position on the matter.</p>

          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills, which had received public support from President Trump, failed to pass a key procedural vote in the House of Representatives. Thirteen Republicans joined Democrats in voting against the measure, preventing the legislation from moving forward for debate. The package included bills to regulate stablecoins and clarify whether digital assets are securities or commodities. The unexpected failure represents a significant setback for the crypto industry and a rare instance of House Republicans defying a direct directive from the former president, leading to a dip in crypto-linked stocks.

          <p>A woman who served on the grand jury for the Karen Read murder investigation has been federally charged with criminal contempt for leaking confidential information. According to court documents, Jessica Leslie disclosed witness names and testimony from the secret proceedings and has agreed to plead guilty. Read was acquitted last month of murdering her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in a high-profile case that drew significant public attention. Leslie is expected to be sentenced to one day of incarceration, which is deemed served, and two years of supervised release.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a comprehensive immigration reform bill aimed at creating a pathway to legal status for long-term undocumented immigrants. The proposal would establish a "Dignity Program" for those who have been in the U.S. for at least five years, requiring them to pass background checks and pay restitution. The bill also includes provisions for increased border security, asylum system reforms, and protections for sensitive locations like schools and hospitals from enforcement actions. This legislative effort comes amid scrutiny of the Trump administration's mass deportation program.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has struck down a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have removed medical debt from consumer credit reports. The ruling is a significant blow to a Biden-era initiative designed to prevent healthcare expenses from negatively impacting Americans' financial standing and access to loans. The judge sided with credit unions who argued the CFPB had overstepped its authority.

This surge in research coincides with the pro-independence stance of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party and continued U.S. support for the island.

          <p>The number of shootings by Los Angeles Police Department officers has risen significantly in 2025, with 25 incidents recorded in less than seven months, nearly matching the total for all of 2024.

LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell attributes the increase partly to more suspects being armed with real or replica firearms, making it difficult for officers to assess threats.

          <p>Intense sectarian fighting has erupted again in southern Syria between local Sunni Bedouin tribes and armed Druze factions, resulting in over 160 deaths in three days. The violence prompted Syrian government forces to intervene, which in turn triggered a wave of Israeli airstrikes against them. Israel, which has its own Druze population, stated it was acting to prevent harm to the community and to demilitarize the border region. The conflict adds to the instability facing Syria's new government and has been marked by accusations of atrocities, including field executions and the mutilation of corpses by government-affiliated fighters.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has called on the financial industry to adopt a more positive narrative around investing in stocks and shares to encourage public participation and stimulate economic growth. In a major speech, she argued that for too long, the focus has been on risks rather than potential benefits. The government is now working with regulators to create a new system of targeted support to help consumers make informed investment decisions. This policy push aims to mobilize some of the £300 billion currently held in cash savings accounts into the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of catastrophic flash flooding in Kerr County, Texas, recovery efforts are now focusing on the area's lakes, where authorities believe many of the nearly 100 missing people may be located.

Search teams are using dive teams and sonar technology, which have already indicated large objects buried under feet of water. The complex and expensive operation highlights the devastating scale of the disaster and the community's determination to find the missing.</p>

          <p>The Senate is expected to vote on a White House rescissions package that seeks to cancel $9.4 billion in previously approved funding.

          <p>Senator Tammy Baldwin is urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture to revoke access granted to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to a critical database managing farmer payments and loans. In a letter to the USDA Secretary, Baldwin expressed concern that granting this access to unelected insiders breaches farmers' privacy and threatens food security. This follows an NPR report revealing that a DOGE-linked staffer has high-level access to the system, allowing them to view sensitive data and potentially alter payments with little oversight. The move has sparked fears of both intentional disruption and accidental errors jeopardizing farmers' livelihoods.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes the commercial failure of Pixar's latest film, "Elio," arguing it may mark the end of an era where the studio's brand alone could guarantee a box office success. Despite the massive success of "Inside Out 2," "Elio" recorded a record-low opening weekend for the company, suggesting that name recognition is no longer enough. The author points to the film's tumultuous production, which involved a change in director and significant script rewrites, as a potential factor in its weak story and characters. The failure raises questions about whether Pixar will become more risk-averse, shying away from original stories in favor of safer sequels.</p>

According to an ICE memo, the administration has determined that these individuals are not eligible for release from custody during their removal proceedings, which can last for years. This policy change, which is expected to face legal challenges, marks a significant shift from previous practices and aligns with the administration's hardline immigration stance.

          <p>It has been revealed that the UK government conducted an unprecedented secret evacuation of Afghans after a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked a dataset containing their personal details in 2021. The data breach exposed thousands who had worked with British forces and were at risk of Taliban retribution. The government obtained a super-injunction to prevent media reporting on the breach and the subsequent rescue operation, which only began in April 2024. The lifting of the injunction now raises serious questions about the government's moral responsibility, the danger of future data leaks, and whether the secrecy was also politically motivated.</p>
