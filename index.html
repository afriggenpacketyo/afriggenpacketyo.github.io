          <p>The Trump administration has formally requested the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court order blocking the deployment of National Guard members in Illinois. Solicitor General D. John Sauer contended that prohibiting the deployment undermines the President's Commander-in-Chief powers and endangers federal immigration officers and government property amidst ongoing protests. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has fiercely condemned the federalization of state troops, labeling it "un-American" to impose military presence against local objections. This legal challenge underscores a contentious debate about the scope of presidential authority in domestic military deployments and the balance of power between federal and state governments.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a critical 3-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 3 of the NLCS, placing them one win away from the World Series. The team initiated scoring early with Shohei Ohtani's triple and Mookie Betts' double, later breaking a 1-1 tie in the sixth inning thanks to Tommy Edman's crucial single, who was also named NLCS MVP. This triumph positions the Dodgers to become the first defending champions in 16 years to reach the World Series, a milestone not seen since the 2009 Philadelphia Phillies. Despite the Brewers' strong regular season record against them, the Dodgers are now intensely focused on maintaining pressure and aiming to conclude the series in Game 4 on Friday.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling nearly 750,000 vehicles in the U.S. due to three separate safety concerns identified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Approximately 290,000 F-Series trucks from 2020-2022 are affected by a rearview camera display issue, which may fail to show images correctly in certain lighting conditions, increasing accident risk. Another 115,539 Super Duty trucks from 2020-2021 are being recalled for a steering column defect that could result in a sudden loss of steering control. Furthermore, 332,778 2015-2017 Mustang models are under recall because corroded seatbelt cables could compromise occupant restraint. Ford dealers will address these issues with free software updates, inspections, or part replacements.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively pursuing several ambitious architectural projects, including a $250 million White House ballroom and a proposed arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial, aiming to cement his legacy. The privately financed ballroom recently hosted a dinner for significant donors, with discussions reportedly including the possibility of displaying their names on the structure. Democrats, spearheaded by California Rep. Mark Takano, are pushing legislation to impose guardrails on such projects, raising concerns about donor transparency, potential conflicts of interest, and the appropriate use of the White House as a national emblem. This endeavor showcases Trump's personal investment in creating lasting physical symbols of his presidency, despite political opposition and questions about the projects' nature.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would consider an "interesting" Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait, linking Russia and Alaska. Kirill Dmitriev, a Russian investment envoy, suggested the 70-mile "unity" link could cost $8 billion using Boring Company technology, significantly less than traditional estimates. This unusual infrastructure idea emerged after a call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the Ukraine War, a proposal that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has already expressed unhappiness with. The concept raises questions about feasibility given the region's harsh conditions and the Boring Company's limited experience in such environments.</p>

This heightened scrutiny spotlights a rapidly expanding lending sector that grew after the 2008 financial crisis as regulated banks offloaded riskier activities. While NDFI loans can offer attractive returns, they are characterized by higher and more rapidly materializing loss rates, complicating investors' ability to accurately assess exposure.

          <p>Athletic shoe company On is facing a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. from customers alleging its popular "CloudTec" sneakers emit an "audible and noticeable squeak," making them unwearable in daily life. The lawsuit claims the $200 shoes, marketed to feel like "running on clouds," instead cause embarrassment, especially for professionals such as nurses. Plaintiffs, reportedly unable to return the noisy footwear, accuse On of deceptive marketing and neglecting to rectify the design flaw. Social media widely corroborates these complaints, with users sharing at-home remedies, highlighting the widespread nature of the issue despite On's recent strong sales performance.</p>

          <p>Americans are currently enduring an unprecedented volume of 2.56 billion robocalls each month, marking the highest level observed in six years, coupled with a significant surge in robotexts since 2021. A report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund reveals that these unsolicited automated messages, frequently orchestrated by criminal rings, are designed to illicitly obtain personal or financial information, with victims losing an average of $3,690 per scam call. This proliferation is largely attributed to the increasing sophistication of scams, including the use of AI voice-cloning, and the inadequate implementation of anti-robocall software by many phone companies, despite the 2019 TRACED Act. This persistent issue represents a substantial and escalating threat to consumer protection and privacy.</p>

The school district has initiated enhanced cleaning protocols, while reassuring the community that this specific form of meningitis is not typically contagious through casual contact within a school environment. Bacterial meningitis is a serious condition causing severe inflammation of the brain's protective lining and spinal cord, which can be fatal if not treated swiftly; vaccination is considered the most effective preventative measure. The exact cause of Duffy's infection remains undetermined, leaving the community deeply saddened and mourning his loss.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan coalition of U.S. lawmakers is strongly urging President Donald Trump to personally attend three pivotal Indo-Pacific summits scheduled for this fall. The congressional members warn that presidential absence from these key gatherings could inadvertently grant China a strategic advantage, especially as Beijing aggressively expands its influence throughout the region. Their letter underscored the Indo-Pacific's critical importance to America's security and prosperity, identifying it as the central arena for strategic competition with China. This appeal for Trump's direct engagement highlights the perceived urgency for the United States to project robust leadership and send an unequivocal message to Beijing regarding its geopolitical ambitions and regional stability.</p>

          <p>Seven exceptionally well-preserved skeletons, unearthed from an ancient water well in the Roman city of Mursa, modern-day Croatia, have been identified as Roman soldiers dating back 1,700 years. The remains, belonging to taller-than-average adult men, exhibited indicators of early-life stress and injuries consistent with combat, including blunt-force trauma and puncture wounds likely from weapons. Researchers suggest these individuals were soldiers who perished during a 260 C.E. battle or subsequent skirmish for control of the city. DNA analysis further revealed that none were indigenous to the region, with origins traced to northern/Eastern Europe and the Byzantine Empire, providing valuable insights into the diverse recruitment of Roman legions.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown continues, federal student loan borrowers face significant uncertainty regarding debt relief, although monthly payments are still required. While individuals can apply for new repayment plans and various forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, actual debt discharge will be delayed due to the furloughing of Education Department staff. This delay could have adverse tax implications, as the federal tax-free status for loan forgiveness is scheduled to expire by the end of 2025, and President Trump's recent tax package did not extend this provision. Fortunately, most routine loan servicing tasks continue unimpeded, as they are managed by government-contracted companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russell Vought, President Trump's budget chief, announced an immediate pause and potential cancellation of over $11 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects, attributing the action to the ongoing government shutdown. Vought asserted that the "Democrat shutdown" has severely hindered the Corps' capacity to manage these substantial projects, specifically targeting "lower-priority projects" located in Democratic-leaning cities such as New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore. This strategic move aligns with the Trump administration's broader intent to utilize the shutdown as an "opportunity" to curtail federal bureaucracy and exert political pressure on opponents. This freeze compounds previously announced cuts totaling billions in infrastructure and climate-related funding.</p>
