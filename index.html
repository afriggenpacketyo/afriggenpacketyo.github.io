          <p>Jim Irsay, the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, passed away at the age of 65. Irsay is credited with transforming the Colts into a perennial title contender, thanks to his collaboration with Hall of Fame general manager Bill Polian, coach Tony Dungy, and quarterback Peyton Manning. In recent years, Irsay had faced health challenges, including a respiratory illness and struggles with addiction. His impact extended beyond the football field, as he was also a collector of guitars and a friend to musicians, drawing inspiration from rock and roll lyrics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas lawmakers have moved forward with a bill aimed at clarifying medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion law, which only allows abortions to save the life of the mother. While the bill does not expand abortion access or list specific medical exceptions, it specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. The proposal has received mixed reactions, with some worrying it doesn't go far enough and others questioning its potential impact. This legislative effort underscores the challenges abortion opponents face in defining medical exceptions within restrictive abortion laws.</p>

The man, identified as Li, departed from a beach near Fuzhou, Fujian province, and boarded a cargo vessel in the Taiwan Strait. The ship docked in Kaohsiung, where Li disembarked illegally and travelled undetected across Taiwan. This incident has raised alarms about loopholes in Taiwan’s maritime security.

One FEMA official described the strategic plan as the agency's "organizational backbone." The move comes after an internal presentation noted that FEMA is not ready for hurricane season due to culture issues, staffing shortages, and coordination problems.</p>

          <p>Chinese passenger drone maker EHang Holdings predicts that flying taxis could be used for public transport within the next five years on the mainland. Chief financial officer Conor Yang said fixed-route air shuttle services could emerge by 2030, with air taxi services potentially appearing sooner in cities with sufficient infrastructure. EHang and its joint venture partner Hefei Heyi Aviation recently became the first companies to receive certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) to operate autonomous passenger drones. EHang is conducting trial flights in Guangzhou and Hefei, with strong interest in its services overseas.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's top crypto and AI advisor, David Sacks, anticipates that the stablecoin legislation moving through the Senate will pass with bipartisan support. Sacks claims that this legislation could unlock trillions of dollars for U.S. Treasuries by providing legal clarity for stablecoins. He noted that over $200 billion in stablecoins already exists, but is unregulated, and that providing a legal framework could create significant demand for U.S. Treasuries quickly. The GENIUS Act, which regulates stablecoins, recently cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate.</p>

The bill adds trillions to the nation’s debt and does not slash enough spending, causing frustration among conservatives.

          <p>US researchers propose a novel approach to combat malaria by administering malaria drugs to mosquitoes, clearing their infection and preventing disease spread. Instead of focusing solely on killing mosquitoes with insecticides, the team at Harvard University identified drugs that can rid the insects of malaria when absorbed through their legs. The long-term goal is to coat bed nets with a drug cocktail, as mosquitoes have developed resistance to insecticides. The approach offers a new strategy to kill parasites in the mosquito, addressing the limitations of current methods.</p>

Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp states there's no evidence of genocide, and Whites remain economically strong. Nick Serfontein, an Afrikaner cattle farmer, says he feels safe and sees a positive vibe between farmers of all races. He also said that there hasn't been a single case of expropriation without compensation documented in the 31 years since apartheid ended. While acknowledging attacks on farmers, Serfontein emphasized that racial motives are not generally a factor.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration defended its controversial tariffs before a trade court in New York, arguing that striking down the levies would “completely kneecap” the US president amid the country’s trade talks with China. The lawsuit challenged whether Trump’s use of a “national emergency” under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act was legally justified to support the tariffs. The states contested not only Trump’s “Liberation Day” reciprocal tariffs but also the tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada over fentanyl production and trafficking. The administration argued that the president’s emergency declarations were not subject to judicial review.</p>
