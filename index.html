          <p>The Sean Combs trial continues with prosecutors presenting evidence from the raids on his Florida mansion, including disassembled AR-15-style guns, drugs, lingerie, and numerous bottles of baby oil and lubricant. Casandra Ventura (Cassie) previously testified that baby oil and lubricant were used in sexual encounters she had with Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges. George Kaplan, a former executive assistant to Combs, testified about purchasing drugs and cleaning up hotel rooms after Combs' stays. A forensic psychologist, Dawn Hughes, provided context on why Ventura might have stayed with Combs despite alleged abuse, explaining the role of financial control in abusive relationships. The article reports that prosecutors plan to call Kid Cudi to the stand. (not investment advice)</p>

Yair Golan, a left-wing politician, described Israel as becoming a pariah state, sparking outrage.

Recent polls indicate that a majority of Israelis want to end the war and prioritize the return of hostages. While the Israeli government maintains its commitment to destroying Hamas and rescuing hostages, the mood among some Israelis is described as one of despair and a lack of ability to effect change.</p>

          <p>Republicans are pushing through Congress a tax bill that could reignite international tax and trade wars, reversing a 2021 deal brokered by the Biden administration for a global minimum tax. The bill would penalize companies from countries enforcing the global minimum tax by increasing their tax rates in the U.S. This has raised concerns among finance ministers from the Group of 7 nations and could strain relations between the U.S. and other countries. Experts suggest that the legislation could violate international tax treaties and discourage foreign investment, potentially harming U.S. consumers and businesses.</p>

          <p>Jamelle Bouie argues that the MAGA movement, led by Donald Trump, is waging war on the American future through attacks on constitutional government, the nation's economic prospects, a sustainable climate, and scientific advancement. The movement's policies include rejecting global integration, prioritizing resource extraction, and cutting funding for research. Some see the movement's vision as a survivalist mentality, while others view it as a retrogressive vision of self-sacrifice and national expansion. Bouie contends that the MAGA movement aims to narrow moral horizons and unleash energies tied to hierarchies of race, gender, and sexuality, contrasting it with egalitarian visions of a composite nation and beloved community.</p>

          <p>President Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson, and House Republican holdouts are meeting at the White House to address issues with the "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act". The bill faces opposition from hard-liners over Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. Johnson aims to bring the bill to the floor, but holdouts pledge to vote against it. The White House Office of Management and Budget released a letter calling for the bill's passage, emphasizing Trump's commitment. Members of the House Freedom Caucus remain hesitant, seeking deeper cuts to Medicaid and the elimination of subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>

          <p>News of former President Joseph Biden's advanced prostate cancer has renewed debate over the benefits and harms of PSA screening tests. Experts note that while PSA tests can detect aggressive cancers, they also lead to unnecessary treatment of slow-growing cancers. Conflicting public health guidelines have created confusion, with some advising against screening and others recommending discussion with healthcare providers. Oncologists emphasize targeting aggressive cancers while monitoring less threatening ones. A new approach involves using MRIs and active surveillance before resorting to biopsies, aiming to reduce overtreatment and improve outcomes. (not investment advice)</p>
