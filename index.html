          <p>A federal judge has delayed the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was erroneously deported and then returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. His lawyers requested the delay, citing conflicting statements from the administration about whether he would be deported again upon release, which could disrupt his criminal trial. Abrego Garcia had previously been granted a legal status protecting him from removal due to dangers in El Salvador, making his initial deportation an administrative error. He will now remain in federal custody until at least mid-July while the courts address these issues.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his criticism of a major tax and domestic policy bill supported by former President Trump, suggesting he may fund primary challenges against Republicans who vote for it. Musk labeled the legislation a "disgusting abomination" and called its spending levels "insane," specifically targeting the bill's $5 trillion debt ceiling increase. This stance marks a renewed public feud with Trump, with Musk also floating the idea of creating a new political party if the bill passes. His opposition centers on the bill's fiscal impact and cuts to green energy tax credits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey revealed that China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly grew in June, defying forecasts of a contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, contrasting with the official government PMI which showed a third consecutive month of contraction for the broader manufacturing sector. This divergence may be explained by exporters front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs and pivoting to alternative markets in Southeast Asia and Europe. The data suggests some resilience in China's export sector amid ongoing trade uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A family in North Carolina fears they may have to ration essential treatments for their six-year-old daughter, who has a rare genetic condition, if proposed federal Medicaid cuts are enacted. The family relies on a state Medicaid waiver program, CAP/C, to cover over $4,000 in monthly medical costs that their private insurance denies. State officials warn that the proposed national cuts, part of the "big, beautiful bill," could jeopardize this program, which serves children with significant medical needs. This highlights the potential human impact of the legislation on vulnerable populations across the state.</p>

The legislation, a centerpiece of former President Trump's agenda, combines tax cuts with significant changes to healthcare and social programs, and is estimated to increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion. Democrats are using the process to force votes on controversial provisions ahead of the midterm elections, while Republican leadership navigates a slim majority to pass the bill before a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine helps prevent inflammation and the aging of multiple organs. It appears to work by inhibiting a specific enzyme, revealing a molecular pathway that links physical activity to longevity. These findings could lead to new anti-aging strategies that simulate the beneficial effects of exercise.</p>

These programs provided about $1 billion for food banks and schools to purchase fresh produce directly from local producers, supporting both food-insecure communities and agricultural businesses. Nonprofits now face a significant funding gap, reducing their ability to serve vulnerable populations, while farmers who had scaled up production to meet demand are left with devastating financial losses.

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged that the advancement of generative artificial intelligence will eventually mean fewer employees are needed for tasks that become automated. In an interview, Jassy stated that while some jobs will be eliminated by the technology, new types of jobs will also be created, particularly in fields like AI and robotics. He framed the shift as a way to free employees from "rote work" and make their roles more interesting and innovative. This perspective aligns with a broader trend in the tech industry where leaders are embracing AI for efficiency gains.</p>

Many of these new cafes rely on novelty and unique settings to draw customers, who may not return after an initial visit. The trend highlights the rapid growth of coffee consumption in China, with imports having grown over 650% since 2020.</p>

This decline has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.
