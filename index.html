          <p>A gunman opened fire in a Midtown Manhattan office building, killing four people, including an NYPD officer, before taking his own life. The officer, Didarul Islam, a four-year veteran and father, was working a private security detail at the time of the attack. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas with a history of mental health issues, traveled across the country before the shooting. The motive remains under investigation, but authorities believe he was a lone actor and there is no further threat to the public.</p>

          <p>India has surpassed China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the United States, according to a new report from Canalys. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India accounted for 44% of U.S. imports, a significant increase driven primarily by Apple's strategic shift in its manufacturing supply chain. This move reflects a broader trend of global manufacturers diversifying away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties and tariffs. The shift highlights India's growing role as a major hub for electronics assembly for the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryne Sandberg, the celebrated Chicago Cubs second baseman and Hall of Famer, has died at the age of 65 following a battle with metastatic prostate cancer. Remembered as one of baseball's best all-around players, Sandberg was a 10-time All-Star, a nine-time Gold Glove winner, and the 1984 National League MVP. He spent 15 years with the Cubs, where his number 23 was retired and a statue in his honor was unveiled outside Wrigley Field. The baseball community is mourning the loss of a player known for his integrity, grit, and dedication to the game.</p>

          <p>Severe storms and subsequent flooding have resulted in the deaths of at least 34 people in the region surrounding Beijing, Chinese authorities reported. The capital's Miyun district was hit particularly hard, with some areas receiving over 21 inches of precipitation, leading to the release of water from a reservoir at its highest level since 1959. Over 80,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in Beijing alone as the storms knocked out power and damaged roads. The central government has allocated emergency funds and dispatched response teams to assist with rescue and recovery efforts in the affected areas.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's government has introduced a controversial bill that would make it more difficult for citizens to vote. The proposed law would end same-day voter registration, requiring enrollment at least 13 days before an election, and would also ban all prisoners from voting. The Justice Minister argued the changes will create a more efficient and sustainable electoral system, but critics, including the Attorney General, say the bill appears inconsistent with the country's Bill of Rights. The opposition Labour Party has condemned the move, calling it a "dark day for democracy" that will reduce voter participation.</p>

While the airline noted that overall demand for air travel remains strong, analysts expressed concern over the drag from Air India's performance and increased competition normalizing operating margins from pandemic-era highs.

Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010, remains a deeply polarizing figure, celebrated by some for his hardline security policies but condemned by others for alleged human rights abuses.

          <h2>Trump Administration Issues Guidance Permitting Religious Expression and Persuasion in Federal Workplaces</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued new guidance affirming that federal employees can express their religious beliefs at work, including attempting to persuade colleagues of their views. The memo from the Office of Personnel Management states that workers can display religious items and engage in polite religious discussions, but must stop if a colleague requests it. This policy, which builds on previous guidance, is part of a broader push to protect religious expression, but has drawn criticism from groups like the Freedom From Religion Foundation, who argue it unconstitutionally encourages workplace proselytizing and could lead to harassment.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recalled his cabinet for an emergency meeting to discuss a European-led peace plan and humanitarian aid for Gaza. This follows a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland, where Starmer presented the plan developed with France and Germany. The initiative aims to provide immediate relief amid warnings of mass starvation and to establish a pathway toward a two-state solution. The move comes as the prime minister faces growing domestic pressure, including from over 140 Labour MPs, to immediately recognize Palestinian statehood as a contribution to the peace process.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a formal misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, who is presiding over a contentious case involving deportations to El Salvador. The complaint, directed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleges the judge made improper public comments criticizing the Trump administration's willingness to comply with court orders. This action escalates a conflict in which the judge previously found probable cause that the administration committed contempt of court for ignoring his order to halt deportation flights. The complaint seeks an investigation and the case's reassignment to another judge.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are facing the potential loss of crucial mental health services due to the Trump administration's abrupt discontinuation of federal grants. The Department of Education suspended the funding, citing concerns that recipients used it for race-based initiatives. However, school officials and service providers report this will devastate their ability to support students, particularly in rural areas with severe shortages of counselors and social workers. With 16 states now suing the department over the cuts, many districts fear they will have to lay off essential staff, leaving students without access to vital mental health care.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old U.S. citizen has spoken out after a video of his violent arrest by immigration agents in Florida went viral. The footage shows an officer telling Kenny Laynez, "You got no rights here," during the stop. Laynez, who was born and raised in the U.S., was detained along with his undocumented co-workers. The recording also captured an officer suggesting they might end up "shooting some of them." The incident has drawn sharp criticism from advocates, who say it highlights the dangers of expanding the role of state and local law enforcement in federal immigration crackdowns.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union is being analyzed, with some experts suggesting the deal is unbalanced and favors American interests. The pact imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports while eliminating tariffs on American goods exported to the EU. Economists project this could reduce the EU's annual GDP, while the Trump administration claims it will boost U.S. exports and manufacturing. Despite the new tariffs, European leaders see the deal as preferable to a potential trade war escalation, providing some market certainty even if it comes at a significant economic cost.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's recent visit to his Scottish golf courses provided UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer with invaluable, if unconventional, diplomatic access. The trip, though notionally private, involved extensive one-on-one talks and a lengthy, free-wheeling press conference, allowing Starmer to burnish his relationship with the American president. Downing Street views this access as crucial for aligning on key issues, particularly Gaza, where Trump's language appeared to toughen. The visit highlights the unique, personal nature of diplomacy with Trump and the UK's strategy of navigating it to advance its interests.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver for a final season of eligibility. Wingfield, a transfer who USC hoped would bolster its offensive line, is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive. The denial threatens to cost him a significant NIL opportunity and a chance to enhance his career at a major program. Citing disruptions from the pandemic and a previous injury, the lawsuit seeks an injunction that would allow him to play this fall, a decision that could have a major impact on the Trojans' thin offensive line.</p>
