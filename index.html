This partnership will allow the airlines to sell seats on each other's sites and enable JetBlue customers to earn frequent flyer miles on United, with reciprocal loyalty benefits. The deal, subject to regulatory review, aims to provide travelers with more choices and value across both airlines' networks. This collaboration differs from JetBlue's previous alliance with American Airlines, which was blocked on antitrust grounds, and the airline's failed attempt to acquire Spirit Airlines.</p>

          <p>Thailand is planning to restrict cannabis use to medical purposes, reversing its 2022 decriminalization due to a lack of comprehensive regulations. Under a new medical bill, dispensaries will only be allowed to sell cannabis to licensed shops or customers with a medical prescription. This move is expected to significantly reduce the number of cannabis shops in Thailand, potentially impacting the tourism and agriculture sectors. The government hopes to address issues such as recreational use and illegal distribution while working towards a comprehensive cannabis act to fully regulate the industry in the future.</p>

This move involves legalizing existing outposts and building new settlements, including the "historic return" to Homesh and Sa-Nur, which were evacuated in 2005. The decision is viewed as a strategic move to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, while Palestinian officials condemn it as a dangerous escalation that undermines efforts for a two-state solution. The international community widely regards Israeli settlements as illegal under international law, further complicating the peace process.</p>

Republicans argue the bill does not cut Medicaid for the most vulnerable but targets benefits for illegal immigrants, ineligible recipients, and able-bodied adults not working. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 8.6 million people will lose health insurance by 2034 due to the reform. (not investment advice)</p>

The watchdog calls for a transformative overhaul, including an independent funding review and a national tenant body to strengthen tenant voice and landlord accountability. The report highlights the human cost of poor living conditions and warns of potential social unrest if changes are not made.</p>

A recent ruling by the parliamentarian regarding a California air pollution law has sparked further controversy. Republicans are considering a bill that includes much of President Trump's domestic agenda, but it may face challenges due to the filibuster's 60-vote threshold. The future of the filibuster remains uncertain, with potential for further changes depending on which party holds the majority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance spoke at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, promoting the Trump administration's efforts to regulate stablecoins. Vance stated that the administration does not believe stablecoins threaten the integrity of the U.S. dollar but views them as a force multiplier for economic might. This comes as Republicans attempt to pass the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate digital assets, amid concerns about conflicts of interest related to President Trump's cryptocurrency ventures. David Sacks, Trump's crypto advisor, believes a legal framework could create trillions in demand for U.S. Treasuries. (not investment advice)</p>
