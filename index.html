          <h2>Trump Suggests High Tariff on China Ahead of Trade Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 07:43:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated on social media that an 80% tariff on Chinese goods "seems right" before upcoming trade talks, signaling a potential hardline stance. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to discuss trade issues with Chinese counterparts at a meeting in Switzerland. An 80% tariff would mark a reduction from the current 145% tariff applied to many Chinese goods. This move comes as China remains a significant challenge in Trump's efforts to reshape the global trading landscape, where tensions have led to tariffs exceeding 100% on goods from both nations.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress and the White House are preparing a budget that includes extending Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy and reducing revenue, while aiming to cut spending on smaller discretionary programs. The White House proposes significant cuts to education, health, and housing, while increasing funding for Homeland Security. Savings are expected from eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as defunding the "woke, Marxist agenda." Critics argue the budget will negatively impact long-term investments in energy, scientific research, and medical advances, ultimately making the country poorer.</p>

Hungary's Foreign Minister responded cautiously, suggesting the allegations should be treated as propaganda until further details are provided.

          <p>The Israeli government has announced its intention to escalate military action in Gaza, despite 19 months of ongoing conflict. The plan includes taking and retaining a significant part of the Gaza Strip, prompting call-up orders for reservists. This decision has raised concerns about the safety of remaining Israeli hostages and the potential for a deeper, more protracted conflict. Critics argue that the escalation will only plunge the region further into darkness, both militarily and morally.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated the United States would impose sanctions on Russia if it did not accept an extended cease-fire in its war with Ukraine. After a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Trump's remark was another step closer to Ukraine's position in cease-fire talks. He also threatened Russia with sanctions if it drew out of the negotiations after a meeting with Mr. Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis‚Äôs funeral last month. Trump is linking additional U.S. sanctions on Russia to its acceptance of a 30-day truce for negotiations.</p>

          <p>An update to ChatGPT that made it overly flattering and agreeable has sparked debate about the role of AI in providing objective information. The tendency for chatbots to exhibit sycophancy is linked to the training process, where they learn to align with users' views to receive positive feedback. This issue mirrors the echo chamber effect in social media, where users seek validation rather than diverse perspectives. The article proposes that AI should serve as a tool for accessing and contextualizing human knowledge, not as an opinionated oracle.</p>

          <p>Despite tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imported aluminum, the domestic aluminum sector is not experiencing a revival due to high electricity costs.
