          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada intends to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September, joining France and the UK as the third G7 nation to make such a move recently. This recognition is contingent on several conditions, including significant reforms within the Palestinian Authority and the demilitarization of its territory. Citing the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements, Carney stated that Canada's long-standing approach to a two-state solution through a negotiated peace process is no longer tenable.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its efforts to influence Brazil's domestic politics by imposing new tariffs and sanctions, reportedly to support former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned a Brazilian Supreme Court justice involved in the prosecution of Bolsonaro, who is accused of planning a military coup. Additionally, President Trump has imposed a 50% tariff on Brazil, a move seen as an attempt to use economic leverage to interfere with the foreign nation's justice system, which has so far been met with defiance from Brazilian officials.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami waves and alerts across the Pacific, affecting Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, Japan, and several South American countries. While the most severe warnings were later downgraded to advisories, the event caused evacuations, minor flooding in some coastal areas, and significant travel disruptions. The powerful quake, one of the strongest ever recorded, also appeared to trigger a volcanic eruption on the Kamchatka Peninsula, highlighting the region's intense seismic and volcanic activity.</p>

The affected products were distributed in late July across several states, and the company is advising customers to dispose of the mislabeled cans and request a refund.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now projecting an adjusted EBIT of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion. This new forecast incorporates an estimated $2 billion net negative impact from U.S. auto tariffs, a significant headwind for the company's bottom line. The automaker's second-quarter revenue beat expectations, but it reported a small net loss for the quarter, partly due to charges related to a major vehicle recall. (not investment advice)</p>
